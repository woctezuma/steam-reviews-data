My biggest irritation here is that you have absolutely no data literals: if you need a zero, you have to grab a zero from somewhere in the puzzle's memory.  \n\nYou start with a very basic set of instructions that does grow over time, but the list never grows to more than what fits comfortably on the screen.

It offers some really tough challenges for even those who code for a living, using only the simplest( aaand a bit outdated) programming concepts.\n\nYou have a bus, and an array with a specific size in each level. You can use basic commands to read an index from that array into your bus, or write that bus into an index within your array. You can read, write, add, subtract, increment and decrement. You can read your input into your bus, and write your bus onto the output. Every operation is done with your bus. Your task is to take input from the inbox conveyor, process it according to the protocol provided with each level, and output the result onto the outbox conveyor. As simple as that. But it is always worth it and results in extreme satisfaction when I nail the solution. (Joy of Thinking)\n\nIn the game, you climb this enormous office building, slowly progressing through more and more complicated tasks, and small cutscenes that tell a fun story about three of your colleges, mostly during \"coffee break\". All three of which ignore the news on the TV where you will see the city slowly turning into a world where machines do all the work.\n\nThe third \"era\" in this game is the most exciting. After a dramatic cutscene, your bosses tell you that big changes are coming. It is a plot twist. The story takes a very sharp turn. At the same time, you unlock the last, and most powerfull upgrade in your arsenal of commands. One that really changes everything.\n\nIn the case you were wondering, amongst the toughest challenges offered are sorting, prime factoring, and duplicate filtering. They are hard because of the lack of memory space, and the lack of control over the flow of your code. You don't just have to know programming, you need to master it. You can only branch your code by testing if your bus is zero or negative, so subtract to compare numbers. If you fail, the game laughs at you, your boss at his desk get mad( as errors), and you can feel very clueless about some of the mistakes you made. I am talking about my Father who teaches C++ in university. Unlike me, it took him one hour to give up on writing a code for the prime factoring level. He was overwhelmed by a simple math puzzle for which I wrote a (not OCD) code in ten minutes, fixing it up to be fully optimal in about 20 extra minutes.\n\nI let more than one person other than myself try the game, and surprisingly enough, they mostly failed near halfway through. They got stuck in different levels, but to the point that they are \"guessing\" when they modify their code. They recognise, say that they put a specific command in the wrong place, but they \"guess\" when they try to move it elsewhere. Some told me that they don't even know what their code is doing anymore. It's like not being able to read your own writing.\n\nA lot of negative reviews complain about the fact that the tools are not powerfull. They are half wrong. It makes for a great challenge, but yes, it can be frustrating if you can't part with your precious \"for\" loops, and advanced mathematical operations for the sake of the game. After all, in a game of optimisation puzzles, multiplication and division are way overpowered the same way something else can be owerpowered and decrease the fun the player has in a lot of games. Developers tend to make the most optimal way to play the most fun.\n\nAnd then there are the Optimal Completion Distinction (AkA: OCD) challenges. There are two for each level if you are really into programming. There is the size challenge, which you complete by staying under a given number of lines. And the speed challenge, which is the \"average number of steps\" your worker has to take, tested against a number of deterministically generated inputs.\n\nAnd here is what I dislike about this game:\n-Incorrect and sometimes misleading translation( at least, to my native language).

I found most of the puzzles really easy, although some of the later ones did make my brain churn for a bit to solve them. Things will get messy, assembly programming is messy in all but the simplest of programs, so don't feel bad that it looks horrible. If it works, it works.\n\nI do have a few complaints. The commenting system is horrible. You have to draw on a small piece of 'paper', on which you have nearly no space to write anything but a short word or two. Being able to type would go a long way. I ended up not using comments because of this, since I wasn't sharing my 'code' with anybody and as long as it worked and solved the puzzle in the end, it's fine, but it would have definitely have helped in some of the later puzzles to help me keep my bearings.\n\nThere is also very little in the way of a tutorial. New concepts are more or less thrown in your face and explained in a sentence or two. In the beginning, with relatively simple instructions like 'add', 'sub' and 'jmp', this works, but when you have 15 instructions to keep track of, and you get another one, which isn't explained very well, and you're required to use it in a relatively complicated way, I could easily imagine people getting stuck if they weren't all ready familiar with how they work. Don't feel bad for looking up an instruction on Google, or look for an example program, or just try to mess around with new instructions so you can familiarise yourself with them on your own terms.\n\nAlso, some of the longer programmes you're required to write in the later puzzles take a really long time to run. You can speed up how fast programmes are run, but they don't run quickly enough, even at the highest speed, during the late game, since the programmes take so long to run.\n\nOtherwise, it's a fun little exercise, and even if you don't complete it, you'll have familiarised yourself with one of the most fundamental parts of programming (doesn't get much closer to the metal than asm!).", "timestamp_created": 1517114560, "timestamp_updated": 1517144255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39626941": {"recommendationid": "39626941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047811996", "num_games_owned": 897, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517383254}, "language": "english", "review": "Assembly 101 - Introduction to Assembly Language\nCourse Description: Prepares you for TIS-100, Advanced Assembly Language", "timestamp_created": 1516968453, "timestamp_updated": 1516968795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39595405": {"recommendationid": "39595405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329176143", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516944770}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u754c\u9762\u7b80\u6d01\u6f02\u4eae\u3001\u5173\u5361\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de7\u5999\uff0c\u633a\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1516848425, "timestamp_updated": 1516848425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39588466": {"recommendationid": "39588466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125694577", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521057657}, "language": "english", "review": "With the recent anouncement of \"7 Billion Humans\", the sequel to this game, I want back and played it for a bit and remembered how much I loved it.

gameplay\n\nI'm honestly not sure if this game is made to just to fuck with programmers or not. becuase if it is it does it with absolute aplomb. registers are annotated by literally scribbling on a post-it note **with your mouse**. the debugger gets annoyed with you if you don't solve the problem in one go, and takes literally minutes to go through a single run of the problem before you can step backward through every step of the program (no breakpoints!!) to where the error occured -- and then if you modify your program the debugger suddenly loses all runtime state and you need to re-run it from the beginning\n\nthe game culminates with a huge 'fuck you' boss problem that is at least twice as hard as every level before it combined. it literally took me 4 hours to complete every level other than the last, and 2 hours to give up on the last problem for 6 hours total gameplay\n\nugh, it's so frustrating because it felt like the game had so much potential -- if they just added basic quality-of life features like having separate files, or subroutines, or reusable code, much of the frustrations of the harder problems would be removed.

in fact, it somewhat reminds of the witness, as both have this artificial difficulty - the developers THINK that you can just figure out on your own what you need to do, but in fact do nothing whatsoever to ensure that that is the case. there are these super arrogant programmers here who are like \"this was so easy!\", which makes more people who do not have programming experience more inclined to buy the game - so i just wanted to get that out of the way and warn those people.\n\nthe worst part about human resource machine is its story. it tries and completely fails at implementing the previous success of little inferno's storytelling - a cycle of gameplay, some tidbits of story, and then more gameplay, etc., to entice the player to keep playing. except these tidbits of story here are so sparse and hard to achieve in the later portions of the game that it made the story completely worthless, and it would honestly i feel be the e x a c t same game if the story was taken out altogether. especially when i thought that i would enjoy this game because of its story. this is also so very different from little inferno as the concluding story is short and ultimately very inconclusive, in comparison to little inferno's wonderful and decidedly conclusive ending. this really aggravates me. a  l o t.\n\ni want to say that i didn't hate human resource machine. i just didn't end up enjoying it either. the first 20 puzzles were interesting and complex, but that sudden difficulty spike around the halfway mark left me genuinely angry. the story was interesting but ultimately not worthwhile. if you're into programming, you'll probably like this, but if you're not, i warn you to stay away.", "timestamp_created": 1510280921, "timestamp_updated": 1510281207, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36386829": {"recommendationid": "36386829", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993433516", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477450915}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most enjoyable programming games, mostly because of its graphics and soothing synth soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1510190691, "timestamp_updated": 1510190691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36325329": {"recommendationid": "36325329", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986609886", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510502717}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is kind of brilliant.

In this game, we play as an employee of Tomorrow Corporation, the strange company that also showed up in their previous two games. Our role is quite simple: we'll receive a series of inputs, and we must write a program to obtain the desired outposts. It sounds (and is) simple at first, but as you progress through the game, you'll get more and more challenging puzzles to solve, including some optional ones that are really difficult.\n\nI must admit, I had great difficulty with some of the latter puzzles. After all, programming has never been something I'm good at, but even then, this game is good to learn some basic skills. It's also interesting to see the logic behind some of the \"programs\" you build, how a series of simple commands can perform complex operations, like building a Fibonacci sequence up to the number you receive, or being able to take a number and output the digits that form it.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's quite minimalistic in this game, even more so than in their previous games. There's a few cutscenes, plus dialogue from your \"bosses\" on each level that give you some insight into their lives, but nothing really elaborate. Not that it's a bad thing; even though the story in Tomorrow Corporation's games is fun and thought-provoking at times, it's always played a secondary role to the gameplay. The artstyle is the same we've seen in their previous games, and the soundtracks feels similar as well; again, that's not a bad thing, as their style always feels unique and quirky.\n\nTo conclude, I'd say that this is a fairly enjoyable game, one that I recommend to everyone who wishes to learn some basic programming, or who enjoys Tomorrow Corporation's quirky games.", "timestamp_created": 1504292655, "timestamp_updated": 1504292655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34635058": {"recommendationid": "34635058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071874819", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504188983}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and challenging game.

[/h1]\nIn a nutshell, Human Resource Machine is an introduction to programming logic. You are tasked with creating autonomous instructions for your corporate slave/minion to follow such that he/she can complete various mundane tasks. These instructions come in the form of copy and paste commands, loops (called jumps), addition and subtraction operations, and more. There is no prior programmer experience required, as the game does a great job of slowing introducing its various concepts and gives the player tons of feedback along the way.\n\nFor those who are a little more familiar with programming, each stage has optimization challenges that ask you to find solutions with either the fewest commands or the shortest number of steps. On top of that, there are optional challenge stages that are much more advanced than their main-game counterparts.\n\n[h1] You Should [b]Buy[/b] This Game If: [/h1]\n[list][*]You're interested in learning basic programming logic\n[*]You like logic puzzles and are a very meticulous thinker\n[*]You like that feeling of doing something productive[/list]\n\n[h1] You Should [b]Skip[/b] This Game If: [/h1]\n[list][*]You don't like programming or have no interest in it\n[*]You want a fast-paced, action-oriented game\n[*]You'd rather not do something that feels like homework[/list]\n\n[h1] My Personal Opinion (Recommendation Reflects This) [/h1]\nI had a very mild exposure to programming prior to this game, so I fall more into the \"new person interested in programming\" category. For someone like that, I believe that Human Resource Machine is a great, fun and intuitive introduction. While starting out very basic, HRM's puzzles become extremely challenging and encourage you to think creatively to solve a variety of problems. This game actually gave me a new appreciation for programming, as even the simplest of tasks can require a ton of steps.

"playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498770560}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego consta de 41 niveles de los cuales 6 Son Escenas cinematicas, Dando lugar a 35 niveles Jugables, Con una duracion aproximada de 7-8 Horas Para quien recien lo empieza a jugar de principio a fin e incluyendo Logros de Steam, Aunque podria subir a 10 o 12 horas, dependiendo de la mente que este jugandolo.\n\nMi experiencia con el Juego:\n\nYo Debo confesar que deje de jugarlo aproximadamente en el nivel 12 o 13 Por la gran dificultad que me conllevaba resolver los puzzles o programas, Solo pude cumpletarlo mirando tutoriales para cada uno de los subsiguientes niveles, Intente resolverlos hasta aproximadamente el 23 o 24 y luego directamente copie los programas y saltie todo hasta el final debido al crecimiento exponencial de dificultad que terminaron teniendo.\n\nLo mejor del Juego:\n\nLos dialogos estan geniales, Muy bien hechos, tipico de un juego de Kyle Gabler, como World of goo y little inferno, ese tono sarcastico, esa forma de presentar a los personajes con su toque especial, esta muy logrado y con poco material.\n\nLos graficos son espectaculares, con esa tradicional aura caricaturesca medio noir y new school mezclados que es tipica de los juegos de Kyle Gabler, El inicio con el cartel de empleado y el progresivo envejecimiento del personaje (cambia a Adulto de mediana edad y luego ya mayor edad solo el pelo) son algunos detalles, junto con los cambios en la habitacion y los 6 cortos cinematicos hacen que saques sonrisas y le pone diversion a un juego donde mas alla de ese tipo de interacciones, solo se utiliza la logica pura y nada mas.\n\nLos menues son simples y faciles de usar, las ayudas que dan los personajes tambien, la descripcion del desafio\nme parece copado e ingenioso que den 3 tabletas para  crear diferentes formas de llegar a la misma solucion \nEl ejecutador de comandos tambien, y sobre todo que tenga funciones de copiar, cortar y pegar son muy buenas para intercambiarlas con otras personas\n\nla musica es estupenda, envuelve en todo momento, Aunque siento que falta algo de variedad habiendo solo 17 canciones que rotan en diferentes momentos del juego y son bastante cortas.\n\nLo peor del juego:\n\nLos comandos son dificiles y hechos especialmente para gente que sepa bastante de logica, programacion y matematica, igual lo son los desafios y por ende, Algunos logros.\n\nNo posee Steam cloud: Creo que no hace falta mas explicacion, pero hoy en pleno 2017 es una verg\u00fcenza que un juego no posea dicha caracteristica, he visto varios juegos de estudios indies y demas implementar esta funcionalidad (tengo entendido que deben pagarle a steam para tenerla) y realmente dudo que pesen demasiado los archivos, como para no implementarla, sobre todo limitandose a 3 perfiles maximo.\n\nQue se puede mejorar: \n\nFaltan niveles, el juego es demasiado corto, ya que esta hecha toda la base de programacion, podian haber agregado varios niveles mas, como los de secuencia de fibonacci y otros\n\nModding: Permitir que gente agregue niveles y comandos y cualquier cosa que se les ocurra, tambien podria haber un competitivo contrareloj o algun otro modo entre jugadores para competir o cooperar, etc.\n\nMas idiomas: Idiomas como el Urdu, Japones o Suajili No figuran en la lista de idiomas, Hay poco texto para traducir y no vendria mal agregar mas idiomas para que haya mas publico\n\nEl precio: Quizas de 10 a 8 dolares, por el tema de duracion.\n\nConsideraciones finales:\n\nEl juego pide poquisimos requisitos, pesa solo 200 megas, asi que anda en cualquier computadora sin mayores complicaciones.\n\nNo lo compre, salvo que sea un Experto en matematica, Logica y programacion (idealmente, en estos 3 campos) ya que afrontara dificultades Muy altas hacia el primer tercio del juego o hacia la mitad, en caso de tener algunos conocimientos mas que yo, pero el juego Dista mucho de ser lo que parecen las fotos, Es pura resolucion de problemas y son bastante dificiles, Aunque lo vea en oferta, no se deje llevar por sentimentalismos, Sea racional (yo lo compre por que como me gustaron todos los otros juegos de Kyle Gabler, pense que este no me decepcionaria bajo ningun punto de vista, lo compre ciegamente y algo de decepcion me trajo).\n\nNo lo disfrute mucho, Pero no quiere decir que sea un mal juego, todo lo contrario, Aunque deberia venir con una etiqueta que diga ADVERTENCIA!!

Solve the programs\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nThe entire point of the game is to code basically. You have a limited instruction set where you can add, subtract, jump, jump conditionally, and combinations of those. You use these primitive instructions to solve problems ranging from dividing to sorting. Overall, the game is a lot easier to get into compared to something like TIS-100. A drag and drop system with an easy system to get help really goes to making this really friendly for people not familiar with programming. For people that are, it\u2019s similar to a programming in a SUPER basic assembly and the challenge comes from making the programs run as efficiently as possible with the fewest instructions. If you\u2019ve done any programming in the past, you\u2019ll probably be able to solve the problems without many issues and the efficiency is the difficulty. If you\u2019re into low level stuff, great but I was kind of hoping for functions or the ability to put a number in a register but sadly those aren\u2019t there.

This game starts off great and is a good time puzzles require some thought and you can get through it. However you're going to dedicate like an hour with a pencil and paper doing the math at level 20 if you have no experience in Coding, just trying to do basic math. My biggest gripe with this game is that you have to do adding but there's no tag for adding like there's a \"Jump if 0\" \"Jump if negative\" however at the multiplication level there's you having to do things like 9 times 7 with only the ability to copy and paste numbers to 1 of 10 slots.  If you can handle a lot of dedication go for it this game will take up days of your life figuring things out on your own. For me however it was incredibly frustrating because I really needed hints on how to go about things but all i got was an answer sheet, like if you're doing level 20's multiplicaiton you'll get your answer is 63 since it's 9 x 7 but how do you go about getting to that step is what I was desperately looking for. \n\nTL:DR this game is just requiring more dedication than I could give it because it is just asking for way too much with little help at a difficulty scaling that jumps too high after a point", "timestamp_created": 1497408754, "timestamp_updated": 1497408754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32371396": {"recommendationid": "32371396", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982875866", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496952187}, "language": "english", "review": "What a fun educational game!", "timestamp_created": 1497294311, "timestamp_updated": 1497294311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32351805": {"recommendationid": "32351805", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979415594", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501021506}, "language": "english", "review": "I studied computer science, so.... many of the puzzles are second nature to me.

Getting something from input, interacting with it as the challenge requires, and then sending it to the output. \nFrom what I do know about programming, for the most part, it's very logical. It might take some figuring out how to get around a problem, but it's almost always doable (not always elegantly mind), and that is something I love about this game. It's possible to take awhile, think things through, and have a realisation as to what you need to do. \n\nThe problem I have with the game is when it deviates from this (and I would say it only does in the later levels). I don't know if it deviates from this because I don't know enough about programming to understand why it doesn't work the way I want, or if it's the game just being a douche (I expect a mixture of the two). For example, you're able to subtract letters from numbers, but not add them together, nor letters to letters. This makes it possible, but the game never really explains /why/ I could do one, but not the other (beyond giving a 'bad output, you can't do this'). \n\nQuite a lot of the problems I have with the game seems to stem from the game not giving you a 'check if' tag, to check if a space is occupied, or has a specific number on it, or something, anything. Of course, this might make the levels a lot easier, but it's this that I feel is where it deviates away from the programming aspect just to be a douche. \n\nAnother issue I have - not with the game so much I guess - is that while I want to complete the game on my own steam, if I don't know what to do, or don't understand what it wants (nor the help it gives you in game), I'm pretty much SOL. The only help online offers a 'this is how to beat it', rather than a 'this is the way you need to think' or 'this is what it's asking'. I asked a few programming-minded friends of mine to help, and even they weren't able to give me hints about what I was meant to do (not that I'm blaming the game for THAT, they just might not understand because of something previously explained in the game that they don't understand themselves). \n\nI've done most of the game as is (two levels short of the main 'campaign', and four or five levels short of the extra challenges), but your play time will vary depending on your programming experience, and how fast you can understand and twist these concepts to your own whims. \n\nDo I recommend this game? That's hard. Yes, and no. If you enjoy programming games? Hell yes. Do you enjoy logical games? Yes. Do you enjoy difficult games? Eh, I guess it can be. If you like all of them?

But I guarantee you that any positive review was either written by a programmer, or written by someone who is still at the very beginning of the game.\n\nAt no point does the game ever explain anything to you, or even give you a hint. That could be okay, except for the insane jumps in difficulty. All of a sudden at level 20 you have to multiply two numbers, but there's no multiplying. All you can do is add and subtract. And you can't even tell it to do that any specific number of times.

The first half dozen levels are extremely simple and are best thought of as a tutorial to teach you the rules of the later levels.  You are inputted a string of letter or numbers and need to do certain things to them.  Such as sort in order from lowest to highest etc.  You have a limited number of commands to use and each level has a challenge of size and speed.  Which is how few commands you need and how few steps you need to finish your program.  Overall, I enjoyed the game and had fun tweaking my programs to meet the size challenges.  I did get discussion board hints on a handful of speed challenges to get the final achievement. \n\nOh yes, the game has some humour in it too and a quaint \"story\" behind it all.

As\u00ed que verme fuera de horas de trabajo\nusando papel y l\u00e1piz para optimizar una tarea, como si estuviese otra vez aprendiendo a programar, ha sido un placer inesperado. Porque de eso va este juego, de programar en un pseudo lenguaje similar al ensamblador, b\u00e1sico pero capaz de hacer cosas muy potentes.\n\nPara los no programadores, aconsejo que no tengan miedo, porque empieza muy poco a poco, los tutoriales son geniales, y tiene un sentido del humor muy particular y efectivo. Critica las grandes organizaciones con maestr\u00eda, de una forma suave pero sin cortarse. El estilo gr\u00e1fico es desenfadado, funcional y cuidado.

I've even stayed up late trying to get all the optimisation challenges!\n\nIt's a fairly comprehensive game - you get 42 challenges.  There's a little bit of story as you climb the corporate ladder, which breaks up the game nicely.\n\nThe language you program in is quite simple, but I was impressed that it covered indirection.  You can read from offsets on the carpet.  Also, because you're dragging instructions around, there's no way to write an invalid program.  All programs run, they just might not do anything useful.  You can label variables and instructions, too.\n\nIn terms of being an introduction to thinking like a programmer (in the small), it feels about right.  Unlike some of the other games, there are no bizzare restrictions that exist to give you 70's nostalgia, your programs can be as long as you like and you usually have some scratch space.

Durch die Visualisierung des Programmablaufs kann man ganz einfach nachvollziehen, was das eigene Programm gerade tut.\n\nWie funktioniert's?\n\nDer Spieler bekommt eine Aufgabe pr\u00e4sentiert. Dabei gibt es ein F\u00f6rderband, auf dem Pakete herein und ein F\u00f6rderband, auf dem Pakete heraus transportiert werden. Eine Aufgabe kann beispielsweise sein, nur das gr\u00f6\u00dfere von zwei aufeinander folgenden Paketen auf das Ausgangsf\u00f6rderband zu stellen.\n\nAuf der rechten Seite kann der Spieler mit verschiedenen Befehlen wie Lesen, Schreiben, Addition, Subtraktion oder Sprungbefehlen ein Programm grafisch erstellen. Das \"Programmieren\" erfolgt dabei per Drag'n'Drop.\n\nSobald das Programm erstellt ist, kann man es ablaufen lassen. Dabei wird einfach und verst\u00e4ndlich auf visuelle Weise dargestellt was genau passiert. Die Geschwindigkeit des Programmablaufs kann variiert werden und auch ein schrittweises Durchgehen ist m\u00f6glich um Fehler zu finden.\n\nF\u00fcr wen ist das Spiel geeignet?\n\nWer noch nie Assembler programmiert hat, und es gerne lernen will, sollte sich an das Spiel wagen. Die, die Assembler schon mal gesehen haben, k\u00f6nnen hier einige neue Aufgaben l\u00f6sen und vor allem Optimierung lernen. F\u00fcr echte Assembler-Profis der alten Schule wird das Spiel wohl zu einfach sein. Aber auch f\u00fcr Programmierer, die bisher nur Hochsprachen wie Java gesehen haben, kann es durchaus zur Herausforderung werden, wenn man noch einen Befehl einsparen soll. M\u00f6glicherweise k\u00f6nnen Eltern auf diese Weise auch ihre Kinder an das Programmieren heranf\u00fchren.

It is a fun game, and I will probably come back to it, but I feel that because I had an understanding of coding prior to playing this game, it was as fun and easy as it started. \n\nGood game to learn rudementary coding, but as a game kinda falls flat. 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1488007150, "timestamp_updated": 1488007150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30158917": {"recommendationid": "30158917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107561406", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520464361}, "language": "english", "review": "It gets quite difficult as you progress.", "timestamp_created": 1488002752, "timestamp_updated": 1488002752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30147379": {"recommendationid": "30147379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203624681", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497029744}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool game, the fact that the programing language is really minimalist makes the programing even more difficult, and the challenges about prog size and complexity are relevant.", "timestamp_created": 1487961177, "timestamp_updated": 1487961177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30128370": {"recommendationid": "30128370", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993424254", "num_games_owned": 673, "num_reviews": 217, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487955358}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0451\u043b [b]Human Resource Machine[/b] \u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430. \u0421\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0438\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0437\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u041d\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u043d\u0430\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043b\u043b\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435\u043c. \u041a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438: \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 flow, \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0445\u0430 \u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430.

At least, the annoyance doesn\u2019t come from the puzzles themselves\u2014that\u2019s what the user interface is for. Far too much brain power must be spent on dealing with it, as you feel like you are working against it rather than using it to your advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s a\u00a0programming game, so you\u2019d expect a\u00a0keyboard-driven interface, but no. It is mouse only, you compose your programs by dragging commands with your mouse. It is colour-coded, but it doesn\u2019t do different colours for different loops\u2014forcing you to trace the arrows to know what\u2019s going on. Commands take only a\u00a0little part of the screen, most being taken by ultimately useless graphics, leaving you with a\u00a0small window for at most 15\u00a0lines of code; when later challenges require up to twenty-five, requiring you to scroll and making arrow following so much more aggravating\u2026\nYou can\u2019t copy-paste parts of the code, you can only copy all of it and pasting will replace everything. You can\u2019t create breakpoints, so debugging require either good reflex to pause at the right moment, or clicking through literally hundreds of steps, until you get to the part you wanted.\nAll in all, you get the feeling that you fight the game more than you fight its challenges.\n\nIt is also a\u00a0very short, one-shot game. There are two optional objectives for each mission plus some extra puzzles, but nothing else. There is no global ranking for players (TIS-100 style) and the puzzles themselves don\u2019t really have nearly as many possible solutions for it to be meaningful.\n\nProgramming games are few, but they are not that uncommon.

Games about assembly language program are a bit of an extreme niche genre. This one tries to smooth that out with goofy graphics. It sort of works.\n\nTo clarify: the game works, the softening of the extremeness is the part that sort of works. By the end of the game you might (as I did) wish you could turn that part off and focus on the puzzle at hand. This is ironic because the graphics did play a small role in attracting me to the game in the first place. It's an easier sell than say, TIS-100, because of them, but after 20 puzzles or so, they feel in the way.\n\nFortunately, to some extent, you can turn them off, or at least avoid or mitigate them. The easiest method is by adjusting a slider that changes the speed at which code is executed. Ok, it just makes the little dude move faster--at the fastest, his existence is obviated, but you might want to turn off the sound effects.\n\nUnfortunately, that settting doesn't persist from puzzle to puzzle, so once you start doing that, you'll never stop doing it. It's a small niggle, but imagine if every time you loaded up a game you had to adjust the sound settings. Sometimes the smallest conveniences turn out to surprisingly large inconveniences in absentia.\n\nThe other place where the friendly interface ultimately gets in the way, is the coding itself. This is a great game for getting budding programmers to realize how tedious and limiting a drag and drop interface is for programming. It's very usable, and has some features that seem nice in the beginning, but much like learning to use keyboard shortcuts in an application makes you resent the inneficiency of using a mouse to do the same actions, you will ultimately find the nature of the interface slows you down, and the way the code is presented starts to feel increasingly...murky. And that's not just because assembly language is inherrently spaghetti code.\n\nFor simple programs, like those for about half to three fourths of the puzzles, it's no big deal. The fact that jump commands have arcs and landing pads to help you keep track of where they lead is useful. But if you get into something more complicated, those arcs can be distracting.\n\nThe worst feature though, is the commenting. Firstly, because of how delayed it is in being added to your repertoire, but mostly because it's so badly implemented in a misguided attempt to keep everything looking just a little kooky. Comments are done by simulated masking tape, but to write on it, you draw with your mouse. Basically, all your comments will look like crude MSPaint drawings. On the one hand, the ability to go symbolic and use non-standard images to organize things is neat, but the inability to just type a comment, and the added time burden involved because you have to draw your comments, limits their desirability and frankly, discourages using them even when they would be really really useful.\n\nI wanted to use comments, but I refused to use the commenting system provided because I didn't see value in investing the time necessary to learn to write using a mouse. If you have a digitizing tablet, you'll find commenting much less of a nuisance. That said, I know this because I have a digitizing tablet, but it was still too much of a nuisance, too much of a break from the programming, to do. I guess, in a way, it should help me be more empathetic to other programmers that don't bother commenting their code... but only slightly. (Seriously, comment your code IRL if not in this game. Everyone who reads it later will be glad you did.)\n\nFortunately, it's possible to code in an external text editor and import the code to the game... but there's something a little off about that to me. I'd have preferred the option to switch between text input and mouse input within the game itself. While I dig programming games, especially assembly programming games, I'm not too keen on the idea of games that are best played by using a completely different (and not included) program to do most of the uh... gameplay.\n\nI admit, \"gameplay\" is a word whose meaning is strained by this genre, but I'm holding to it.\n\nThe other criticism I have is that the progression is surprisingly uneven. I realize that with this sort of thing, it's quite difficult to predict what order will be best to present the puzzles in, because people have different backgrounds and different ways of looking at things--what is immediately obvious to one person might be opaque for quite some time to another, and they might well switch places with only a minor tweak to what the puzzle is asking for. But, I found the leaps in difficulty to be dizzying at times--especially at the end where I blew through five or six puzzles in a row (mostly fully optimized on the first try) only to smash into how to implement a bubble sort (or selection sort) using the limited instruction set. The difficulty is in the sudden increase in the minimum amount of bookkeeping required. \n\nRecommended for casual programmers, programmers curious about assembly languages (this is simpler than diving into MIPS) and programmers that would love to take a break from fuzzy ambiguous demands and just sit down and code for a well and clearly stated problem.

And in the genre, this one brings a unique perspective that might seem positive at first glance. The simple graphics and the approach to animating the algorithm in progress certainly would seem to allow for the game to be a good introduction to programming for younger players. The programming puzzles themselves start fairly basic, which again seems like a good teaching mechanic.\n\nBut that perspective is completely undermined by the story, which revolves around a bored, and boring, lifetime employee of an unforgiving corporation. The work undertaken by this employee is meaningless, futile, and despite the efforts of the game designers to add Office Space-style dark humor, horribly depressing. The clear message to younger players is that this is the corporate life facing them if they take up programming. There is a hint of a side plot in cut scenes, but it never adds up to anything.\n\nFor players who already know programming, the puzzles become hard enough at some point to become interesting, but they don't have any cognitive connection to the earlier puzzles - the solutions don't build on each other. So it feels like a hard cliff dividing those that know programming from those that don't. In addition, the harder puzzles become very annoying to solve because of the interface, which doesn't allow for typed input even for things like labels. Copying and pasting into an actual text editor, then copying and pasting back, is possible, but extremely annoying.\n\nIn summary, the game falls short due to some fundamental design decisions.

I encourage you to look at some gameplay videos first. And I recommend buying it only in deep sale. The reason I am torn is because it's a nice concept and video games are a great way to introduce people to programming. But the implementation isn't up to par.  As a software engineer who loves coding, I find this game utterly annoying. Programming in the real world is much easier for the same level of complexity.  \n\nBasically, this game gives you items in your inbox (the input set) and each level gives you instruction on what to do with those items. And once you're done what you're asked to do, you have to put the results (output) in the outbox. Sounds like a fun idea and the game is fun, at least initially. But as you progress to higher levels, the flaws in the game starts to overshadow the fun part of the game and a fun programming puzzle game turns into a frustrating and tedious chore. \n\nOne of the most glaring problems of this game is not letting us set breakpoints, which would have made life so much easier! When you're writing a lengthy program in the real world, and you think there is a problem (bug) in your program at a certain point, you can set a breakpoint there and the program will stop when it reaches that particular point. So now you can continue investigating where the problem is. But in this game you can't do that. So if you're trying to find out any problems in your program, you have to click on the \"next step\" button till you get to the step where the problem happens. This was a minor annoyance in the beginning but as the program becomes longer it becomes a big headache. \n\nThe second most annoying flaw of the game is when you stop your program, it scrambles the input set. So now if you made any progress in figuring out where the problem lies, you have to throw it out the door and start anew because in this new set you will face problems at a different point. When you program, you can debug using the same inputs till you figure out the problem but here you can't. Again, initially not a problem but as the level of complexity of the programs increase, it becomes unbearable. \n\nThese are just two of the many problems. The game doesn't even let you use conditional statements, another thing that makes life of a programmer a lot easier. \n\nIf you don't have experience programming, then rest assured real life programming is much easier than playing this game. The tools available to you as a programmer makes your life much easier and those aren't available in this game.

There is no form of copy and paste, the insertable comments are obnoxiously large and you can only see a small portion of the more complicated programs meaning doing the optimization challenged can be very frustrating. A minor note is the game forgets whether you muted it or not so you have to remute it every time you start it up. You can also only mute it from within one of the levels.\n\nThe game is also very bare. 41 levels, each with two optimisation challenges but if you have some experience with these kinds of games you'll complete both challenges with your first solution on 80% of the levels. That's it. There's no sandbox, no bonus missions, no other stages, no Steam Workshop. That's your lot. I thought the game might expand, perhaps adding additional workers or additional rooms but it doesn't.\n\nSpacechem has 53 story missions, many of which consist of multiple \"rooms\", 3 bonus missions and an additional 255 Research Net missions.\n\nI can't recommend HRM for either experienced programmers or newcomers to this excellent genre.

Plenty of amusing, desaturated graphics and cutscenes, and an upbeat soundtrack keep things light and funny while you decide how to get your employee to achieve the tasks set before him.\n\nThis game starts out super easy and then builds to being a challenge even for the seasoned, persistent, puzzle solver. It also has several fun achievements to go back for after you complete the basic levels (or if you need a break from the straight forward puzzle solving).\n\nOf course, the flip side to that is *this game is a long series of puzzles.* If you don't like solving puzzle after puzzle, this game is not for you. There are breaks to keep things interesting and avoid monotony, but it still boils down to just a lot of puzzle solving.\n\nHowever, if you're on the fence, give it a shot. There's no long intro or steep learning curve so worst case scenario is you play it for an hour and you find out you don't like it and return it. Best case scenario is you have a BLAST and maybe develop skills you didn't even know you could develop.\n\n\nP.S.

I actually don't want to leave a negative review, but I can't ignore its glaring problems. Since the positive reviews outnumber the negative ones, I'm leaving this review to add some constructive criticism.\n\nProgrammers will breeze through the puzzles in no time, about a single-digit number of hours to complete. The game only gets interesting when you try the optional optimization challenges (get your program under a certain size or speed). Programmers need to do these optional challenges otherwise there is no point in even playing this game. They are interesting challenges, but they're also where things go bad: the bad UI makes things unplayable. Here's why:\n\n1) You can add comments to you code, as well as labelling memory locations...but it's done in the most annoying way possible. You don't type in your comments with the keyboard, instead you \"write\" with the mouse. Oh, and the field you get to draw/write into is very small, and the pen you draw/write with is very thick, so you can barely write anything. A comment such as \"P is prime\" hardly fits. Really infuriating. I've seen some awful programming environments, but this is the first one I've seen that actively discourages you from commenting your code.\n\n2) The maximum program run speed is far too slow for some of the more advanced optimization challenges. One of the puzzles will take 3:30 to run at max speed (although you can get it down to about 2:20 when you optimize it). That's too long, and will become an unnecessary test of your patience.\n\nThis isn't a petty complaint. Let's put that 3:30 into perspective. 3:30 means you can only run your solution 17 times an hour. That's 3:30 of waiting, maybe about 20 seconds to apply a fix, then another 3:30 to see if it worked. Rinse, repeat, get frustrated. That means you can only try about 15 things (trivial stuff like small fixes) an hour, so that particular puzzle becomes dragged out to a ludicrously painful extent. You spend a lot of time just waiting for the puzzle to run, and hardly any time working on your solution. Imagine if your favourite IDE did that. You get the picture.\n\nAs an aside, that particular puzzle also trolls you by supplying the single-item list as the final input (after the 10 item list that accounts for most of the 3:30 runtime), so if you have a bug that happens with the list-of-only-one-item (an edge case, that's why they test for it) then you're going to have to wait 3:30 for that bug to appear, then additional multiples of 3:30 to test each of your fixes.\n\n3) Dragging and dropping program instructions is needlessly laborious. The maximum HRM program length is 255 lines (although I think the longest HRM program I wrote is about 70 lines). Let's just say, without spoiling anything, you **might** get near the 255 line limit while trying to solve some of the optimization challenges. That's a lot of dragging and dropping! If you double click an instruction the game appends it at the bottom, which isn't helpful as most of the time you are likely to be working on an inner loop. Instead of adding it to the bottom, double clicking should have inserted the instruction after the last one you added. That would have been a big improvement.\n\nThese complaints may sounds trivial, but they aren't. The big optimized programs have lots of jumps, etc and it quickly turns into a mess of spaghetti code (that's ok, it's just what happens with asm code). You can only see about 16 lines of code at a time, so it becomes very easy to lose track of things. You could add some labels, but the labels are painful to add! You're bound to make mistakes as a result of the UI, and then the UI punishes you for those mistakes by making you to wait 3:30. Now you see how the game itself becomes the biggest problem. These problems only start to make themselves apparent when doing the optimization challenges. At that point you have to wonder why you're even bothering with HRM. You can find loads of programming challenges/golf/puzzles out there, just do one of those instead in your favourite development environment where you can add comments with your keyboard, don't have to wait 3:30 for a trivial program to run, and you can see more than 16 lines of code at a time.

Initially you only have \"input\" and \"output\" operations, but you'll get a new operation whenever it's needed for solving the task at hand. After you reach the first \"milestone\", you'll be introduced to the optimization challenges \u2013 \"preferred\" length and average run time values for your programs (personally, I found that moving the last part of a loop body before its beginning is a surprisingly effective technique). You'll also get \"optional\" branches with more interesting (but also trickier) problems to solve; though the main branch also gets quite tricky later on (I found it quite funny, that on the last problem, whenever I tried optimising for time, I somehow ended up also reducing program size, on every step).\n\nIn short, it's a neat game with several hours worth of fun brain exercise, that also makes you struggle with doing simple things enough to appreciate the fact that no one actually [i]has to[/i] (and definitely shouldn't) program this way for at least half a century.", "timestamp_created": 1481307964, "timestamp_updated": 1481308043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28251708": {"recommendationid": "28251708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084528010", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520349119}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e07\u6076\u7684GOTO\uff08JUMP)\n\nps\uff1a\u6ca1\u6709while\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709if...else\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u8212\u670d...", "timestamp_created": 1481199437, "timestamp_updated": 1481199437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612950", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28208127": {"recommendationid": "28208127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029715988", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481211866}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "80\u591a\u500b\u5c0f\u6642\uff0c\u73a9\u5230\u5269\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u500b\u6311\u6230\u4e86\u3002\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u505a\u5404\u7a2e\u6311\u6230\u5f88\u548c\u6211\u7684\u80c3\u53e3\uff0c\u6211\u62ff\u4f86\u505a\u70ba\u5de5\u4f5c\u5beb\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e4b\u9918\u7684\u4f11\u9592(\u54a6?)", "timestamp_created": 1480965611, "timestamp_updated": 1480965611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28191693": {"recommendationid": "28191693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094037372", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505413858}, "language": "english", "review": "Programmed a bubble sort and beat the efficiency target.

The language presented is quite brutal and the goals are very challenging.  This is a good exercise and puzzle program for dealing with low level assembly style language.  As a benefit, several of the techniques can be applied to higher level languages IRL.\n\nI agree with other reviewers that the game does not offer much hand holding, leaving you to leverage external learning resources or previous experience.  No sample code is provided in the game, however you do start with a very limited instruction set which is added to as you move along, so in that regard it does provide a learning path.  While it does introduce you to the verbs, it does little to suggest grammar or logic structure, but maybe that is part of the exploration aspect of the game.  \n\nAt the time of this review, 2 hours into playing, I am starting on level 20 and I have completed the all the side challenges available to me. There is much more to the game and mechanics than I have been exposed to. every level up to this point has introduced new challenges and concepts on structure and most every other level introduces a new verb.\n\nThe polish on this game is great, the mechanics work excellent.  The interface is quick and easy to work with.\n\nThe developers should be proud of this software.\n\nOne thought for those playing this game is to consider what the game's coding would look like now that you have been introduced to assembly; how the game draws itself on the screen, registers input, etc... it's a good mind fuck,\nThank goodness for C.", "timestamp_created": 1477021313, "timestamp_updated": 1477021313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26115679": {"recommendationid": "26115679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036876943", "num_games_owned": 692, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467758657}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice way to introduce people in programming task.", "timestamp_created": 1476887123, "timestamp_updated": 1476887123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26099786": {"recommendationid": "26099786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200201969", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476790666}, "language": "italian", "review": "Pi\u00f9 che un vero e proprio gioco lo definirei un esercizio di logica, richiede ragionamento e sforzo mentale.

You need no prior programming knowledge to understand and play this game, nor do you need any of it to have fun with it.\nHowever, there are two \"courses\" in the game, plus a bonus challenge:\n-The regular, linear puzzle path that starts at a difficulty of \"add these numbers together and send the result. You did it!\"\n-The more advanced puzzle path that actually needs a lot of thinking and planning to grasp and finish. There are some really hard puzzles here, even if you did some programming in your free time.\n-There are also some optimization challenges, However, be aware: those are *REALLY DIFFICULT*. I was only able to optimize the first third of the game, and after that, i found myself blankly staring at my screen for 10 minutes, wondering how i ended up with 20 commands instead of 5.\n\nSo basically there are three types of people that would enjoy this game, based on the two paths and the bonus:\n1. People that enjoy logic puzzles and doing cool things with numbers. AKA people that would enjoy any other puzzle game just as much.\n2. People that not only like solving logic puzzles but also are interested in programming in general; The way of thinking that would usually help you solve a coding problem will also help you here. Also do try this path if youre type 1; The game might convince you to go on.\n3. Mad insane people that want to get the best results humanly possible and strive for maximum efficiency. This game will consume your life and stay in your head until you beat the requirement for optimization. This is a last warning. It is not too late to turn back.\n\nThat being said, the logic curve is really gentle; the first third of the game operates on knowledge that a preschooler would have. So yeah, dont worry. Even the final puzzle of the main path was not that hard to conquer. With enough time and the will to not give up, you will be able to solve the whole thing easily. This is not a crazy Zachtronics game where halfway through the game your brain explodes in a billion shreds and you regret everything. It's actually quite a relaxing experience. And for 10\u20ac, it would be silly not to try and give it a go.\n\nPositive things:\nThe graphics and soundtrack are lovingly crafted, the game eases you into the more difficult puzzles, and unless youre going for 100% efficiency, just solving the whole thing wont be too much of a hassle. Although this might not be a casual game, it does not involve any crazy mental hoola-hoops just to have fun with it, unlike something akin to TIS-100. TIS-100 is the kind of game that will inevitable make you feel like youre the most stupid human on planet earth. (However, if you are smart enough, which im not, TIS-100 will give you just what you need)\nThis game will make you feel smart while also being an actual fun game you will want to sink your free time into.\n\nNegative things:\nThe programming language youre given is the most low-level thing ever. You are given very basic mathematical operations throughout the whole game. This might work for what the game asks of you, but i feel like if the thing progressed more and gave you more high-level programming stuff to work with, you would be able to ask much more cool and interesting things; as a result of the kind of programming you use, even the hardest challenges seem bland. Even the hardest thing in the enire game - finding prime factors - still is a basic task. The only hard part is that youre only given subtraction, addition, and memory management, so in the end it feels like carving a statue out of stone with your bare hands. Which just isnt fun. Other games like spacechem make difficult tasks feel exciting and cool, this one not so much.\nAlso the UI is a bit slow sometimes.\n\nIn the end, even if it doesnt look like it, the games really cool! I definetly recommend it if you have any interest in puzzle games whatsoever. Go play it! The positives outweigh the nitpicks i have by a lot, and the 12 hours i spent with it were a lot of fun. Im also definetly going back to optimize my messy code.

In the begining, you work with solely numerical inputs but later on you have to deal with character manipulation as well.\n\nMy opinion of this game is a little biased as I program professionally.  I feel like some of the harder puzzles probably take a pretty big leap in difficulty that may prove frustrating for player who are not familiar with certain assembly-level ways of thinking.\n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed the puzzles, and even though the game isn't terribly long, its a really interesting and unique experience, and I found it worth what I payed just for that.  The challenge objectives can also add some length on to the game with some of the challenges being trickier than even the hardest puzzles normally.\n\nSmall gripes I had with the game is that the difficulty curve feels all over the place. Sometimes programs are feel really tricky or really trivial compared to those around it and even some of the alternate track levels seemed much easier than those around them.  Also, there is kind of a back story with cutscenes that happen occasionally, but they feel really pointless and kind of take you out of the experience of the game.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this game to people with programming experience looking for some fun little puzzles that require you to take a step back and work within limitations or people who have an interest in programming or learning programming and want some practice in solving those types of problems.", "timestamp_created": 1475467171, "timestamp_updated": 1475467171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25823079": {"recommendationid": "25823079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009417952", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475423312}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una aut\u00e9ntica maravilla.\n\nTe introduce de forma muy sutil y superficial en el profundo mundo del c\u00f3mpu_to.\n\nLos problemas que te plantean tus jefes son graduales y cada vez m\u00e1s espec\u00edficos.

This game attempts to target two very different audiences by having the main simple track for puzzle enthusiast and the complex track for experienced programmers. As such I will be splitting my review in two so you can better decide if this game is for you.\n\n[b]To the puzzle enthusiast:[/b]\nThis is a logic and mathematic puzzle game that you not only have to solve yourself but you have to write a program to solve for you. If you\u2019ve never programmed before the game walks you through everything you need to know in order to play. It gives good instructions and hints to help you get along. I think it strikes a good balance between teaching the player different concepts without handing the answer to the player. The puzzles can compound on each other as the knowledge of the answer from the previous puzzle might be vital to discovering the answer to subsequent ones. If you get to the end of this game then you will have learned some basics of simple programming. \nIf you enjoy cross words, logic, and/or mathematical puzzle games you might find this game enjoyable.\n\n[b]To the programmers:[/b]\nThis game adds an artistic overlay of a man executing a series of simple, low level, or assembly like commands. (i.e. add, jump on zero, etc). Every level you are presented with the challenged to create a specified output with a given input and your job is to create a function to achieve those requirements. I played this game on a PC but I think it would be easier on an iPad or tablet. Everything is controlled by the mouse and you even have to drawl your notes to keep track of things. (no option to type your notes in.) I\u2019ve solved most of these puzzles in school assignments when working with assembly.\nThe only challenge they have for programmers is that they have two challenges for the advanced levels. Create the function using the fewest number of commands and create the function using the fewest number of steps. You can\u2019t always do it both was at once. I never have trouble creating the functions to complete the given task.\nIf you have always wanted to see a compiler where a little man runs around executing your commands than this is literally the game you\u2019ve been waiting for. If that doesn\u2019t appeal to you there is really no reason to get this game.\n\n[b]5/10[/b] Would I recommend this game? That\u2019s not a straight forward answer. I would recommend this game to someone who likes puzzles and is interested in learning what low level programming might be like. I would not recommend this to anyone else. Because the people I would recommend this game to is such a small niche I\u2019m giving the review a thumbs down.", "timestamp_created": 1475370267, "timestamp_updated": 1475370357, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481796", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25770071": {"recommendationid": "25770071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109644042", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473976996}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun, but rather short puzzle game that requires basic logic circuit skills. \nObviously, this isn't a game for everyone, but anyone who wants to study computer science will likely both have fun with this game and learn something in the process.

The presentation of Human Resource Machine is amazing. The workings of the CPU are visualized by means of a tiny office worker, your avatar, who executes your commands and walks around, picks up boxes and changes numbers.

It even gets the point across that optimising for speed can sometimes make programs bigger, and vice-versa (although it does so in a slightly annoying way, by limiting which instructions you have access to, when it could have made the same point in more realistic ways, like optional loop unrolling).\n\nThe UI could use a couple of improvements (like dragging instructions directly to memory \"tiles\" instead of having to do it in two steps, or having a way to adjust the sound and music volume, etc.), but overall it's decent. Definitely worth the 1\u20ac I paid for it, and easily worth up to 5\u20ac or so. For 10\u20ac (the current list price), I really would expect that extra UI polish.\n\nMakes a great gift for kids who are just starting to learn how to code and for people who [i]think[/i] they'll never learn how to code.

It was quite refreshing to play a less-than-hardcore programming puzzler for once.\n\nYou new job is at an old-timey skyscraper. Since computers haven\u2019t been invented yet, the engineers solve problems by running letters and numbers around on tiled floors. Given an inbox full of stuff, your task is to write a small set of instructions that give the bosses exactly what they want, in the precise order they want it.\n\nWhat the game doesn\u2019t explicitly tell you is that you\u2019re writing some of the simplest useful algorithms in assembly code, such as multiplication, sorting, and alphabetizing, using logic that\u2019s very similar to what you\u2019d use if you were doing it for real. And it\u2019s all presented in a clean, responsive interface and Tomorrow Corporation\u2019s signature creepy cartoon artstyle. It does a wonderful job of presenting the art of writing algorithms as a series of simple, elegant puzzles.\n\nAnd just like Little Inferno and World of Goo, it has an unexpectedly beautiful, haunting soundtrack.\n\nI give the game an 8.5 / 10. Why the points off? Mainly, it\u2019s due to the limitations of the interface, some of which are seriously disappointing. It\u2019s clear to see that Human Resource Machine was meant to be played on a touchscreen, and it sticks to it to a fault. The only way to comment your code is to write awkward, messy, hand-drawn notes with a paintbrush \u2013 you can\u2019t type comments at all.  And the code editor itself, while perfect for 90% of the game and its simplistic puzzles, starts to show some frustrating weaknesses as the game pushes the envelope on complexity near the end: there\u2019s no zooming, no indenting. You can\u2019t bulk select any code, so if you want to duplicate a block, you have to re-create it line by line. If you want to delete a code block, you have to drag every single line away.  Copy/paste is limited to the [i]entire program[/i] at once, which is nearly useless.\n\nSome of the problems with the editor can be alleviated because you can copy and paste code into external text editors, but then there\u2019s another serious problem: you can\u2019t read any of the comments, since they\u2019re encoded as 2-color images. The entire comment system is shamefully awful and deserves an entire point off of a nearly perfect game. Why not allow text input? I mean, most devices with touchscreens also have on-screen keyboards, so what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nA few other nitpicks:\n\n- Steam leaderboards would have been nice.\n- A few extra puzzles, perhaps about 10, would have been nice. The game only has about 36 of them.\n- A sandbox mode would have also been nice.\n\t\nProgramming games tend to have some hardcore difficulty, requiring nearly just as much planning and effort as a legitimate programming project. Finally, with Human Resource Machine, we have one that\u2019s suitable for newcomers. If you\u2019re interested in programming puzzles but thought SpaceChem or TIS-100 got too hard, this may just be the game for you.

This works mostly, in the first two thirds of the game. Nearing the end, when length of the codes goes up to 50 lines, a single misclick results in erasing everything since complexity does not allow for good bug finding.\n\nYou cant use keyboard for writing codes, or editing them. This really slows things down and makes it prone to misclicks. There is a copy&paste function, but it only copies ALL of the lines and copies into by erasing what was there before, rendering it useless. Especially in some parts which required division, I had to rewrite some of the code I had written 3-4 stages before, and it felt like a chore.\n\nStage monologues and backstory was well designed, with a hint of critique of automation observed in all industries. Missions were also well designed, although I found optimization targets a bit too tight, especially for the beginners. I completed the game in 6 hours without caring about the optimizations first. My wife is more of a beginner in programming and she is in her 13th playtime hour, still playing the game, getting frustrated sometimes since it is either you found the algorithm, or not. The game does not give you 5 quests and let you solve them with the order you want, it is all linear.\n\nTo sum up: Even though I mostly talked about its negatives, I throughly enjoyed it.

The game has a charming premise, which is underdeveloped. Although your character is moving upward through a dystopian corporation, this is less fleshed-out than the world map in early Mario games. The sound design is suitable and unintrusive, but nothing to write home about. More importantly, the game design suffers from expert myopia. It's essentially a teaching game (or to use the 90s buzzword, an edutainment game). While it could be a fun way to learn visual programing, in reality the teaching game genre is merely used as a framework, and is entirely neglected. There are no actual hints for a stumped player. The coding language the player uses is artifically hobbled by a lack of the most basic functions fundamental to languages handling maths. The player must execute relatively simple programming tasks with elaborate contortions of unsuitable functions, like determining if numbers are equal without an actual comparison function of any sort. The newbie codemonkey will feel it is cheating to look up answers or even hints, likely unaware that porgrammers pull code from documentation and github all the time.\n\nFor experienced coders, this will be a fun puzzling romp with a robot apocalypse skin. For aspiring programmers and those with less than perfect math scores, it will quickly devolve into an exercise in frustration. \n\n*I have not reviewed it for accessibility.

You aren't required to use them, but if you do hopefully you have good handwriting using a mouse.\n\n-No ability to set constants; you have to use whatever the game provides you.

But not too much.  Using a limited choice of steps, you try to write efficient fast programs for various tasks.  It's starts simply, but ramps up to fiendishly difficult - I had to get help on the final level, and I still don't understand how their script worked to solve it.  And there's an even harder bonus level that I thought I had then discovered I my solution only encompassed half of the requirements. Of the 40 puzzles included, I solved less than half in a suitably efficient script length or performance steps, and it took me 7 hours to do that much.\nThat being said, when you do figure out how to best run the scripts, it's quite a buzz.  The difficulty is artificially spiked some by removing some very basic abilities that any programmer should have, making the knowledge less transferable than it could have been, And the story surrounding the game is weird at best and fairly minimal (it's by the same guys behind World of Goo and Little Inferno).\nBottom line; if you're not into programming, you'll hate this.  If you are, you'll get frustrated by it, but it should still trigger those same feelings you get when you write particularly good code.

The gameplay is good, but I'm not quite sure what niche it's meant to fill... Let me explain.\n\nFor people with some experience in programming, assembly, or maths, the end game is a bit too easy. Difficult concepts are never fully explored, and the hardest thing you do is basically prime factorisation and bubble-sort; I felt like the pace and difficulty curve up to the end was great, I just wished it was longer, and kept getting harder. For those people, I'd recommend TIS-100 or Spacechem, as both are much harder than this, even by the halfway point. For people without the programming experience, my guess would be that the difficulty curve is a bit too steep. It doesn't actually explain any of the logic concepts involved, and I think it'd be tough without at least a bit of prior programming experience. Moreover, while the coding system is fun, it does end up looking very convoluted, and the bulky comments system doesn't fix this. This works to make it harder for beginners, who don't have the experience at debugging and thinking in the abstract. So for those reasons, I think there are better introductions for beginners online.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed it, and was able to optimize at least one side of each program while I was working up the ladder, but I'm not going to be going back and optimizing everything.", "timestamp_created": 1466871129, "timestamp_updated": 1466871129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23790802": {"recommendationid": "23790802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059246000", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466860422}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u6e38\u620f \u63a8\u8350", "timestamp_created": 1466860441, "timestamp_updated": 1466860441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23787326": {"recommendationid": "23787326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283353842", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470574745}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5c0f\u4eba\u597d\u53ef\u7231\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u5f88\u5f3a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1466852265, "timestamp_updated": 1466852265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23787007": {"recommendationid": "23787007", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993027823", "num_games_owned": 668, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447522209}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

With this type of game it would be very easy to make more levels.\n\nSomething I dont like is you cant combine the simple functions to make a more complex function.

willing to learn computer programming, the Human Resource Machine is a pretty and fun game that will teach you the wonders of, uhm, assembly language, and (starting at level 20 or so) force you to optimize the hell out of your code for size or speed. I only miss IP manipulation. And a stack. [strike]Indirect addressing and[/strike] bitwise operators wouldn't be bad either! [UPDATE: Indirect addressing appeared in level 29! Yay!]\n\nI kid you not. I've read in a review that the game would be impossibly hard for nonprogrammers, and boring and trivial for those who already code. It's a lie! In the past 25 years I used many assemblers, wrote a lot of C code and learnt the ways of IDA Pro \u2014 I think I'm not a too lousy coder myself, yet I'm enjoying HRM. The optimization goals can actually be challenging, and you can always raise your personal bar if it's too easy. Oh, you can also go beyond the game itself, and write your own machine that understands HRM code. Or a compiler that generates HRM code. But I digress, these are not game features, but something you can do on your own if you're really interested.\n\nHow I would change it? I wish it could accept user-generated levels. Subroutines or library functions, as I mentioned earlier, would be interesting, as well as a stack for recursive code, but then we would soon have a real CPU simulator there, which is probably beyond the scope of a simple game. So let's say it's cool as it is, and user content would be a worthwhile addition. But the real importance of HRM, and the reason I liked it so much, is that It brings back to the world of the living a brief glimpse of the lost art of assembly programming \u2014 and I'm quite happy

Idea, badly executed. I hoped for much more.\n\n70s programming/10\n\nEdit: \n\nAs requested in the comments the answer to: \"What would you have added to the game to improve the \"execution\". If you had the opportunity.\" Here is my answer:\n\nThere are just so many things one could imrove, just for the start you could fix the touch-device centric ui design which results in odd things like being unable to write a comment using your keyboard (instead of using the mouse to draw your text) or the fact you can only see very few lines of your \"code\" at once, most of the screen is just filled with the background picture which doesn't do nothing at all.\n\nA further point I do not understand is why the game is sticking with just the most primitive of commands and limitations of assembly throughout the gameplay. Take the task of implementing an algorithm to add two numbers without actually using the \"add\" function, it is fun at first but it would be perfectly ok, to say something like: 'You have unlocked the 'add' command!\" so one could just use it from now on.\nOr why the hell should I use gotos (aka 'jump to') instead of 'if'-clauses.\nOr why is it impossible to define functions so i do not have to duplicate my commands all the time.\nThese are the most basic concepts in programming which would allow to introduce much more complex (and fun) tasks to solve instead of just playing assembly code golf.\n\nThe potential this game could have is nearly endless based on the premise that you are actually just programming using a very low-level language. Gamers with no affinity to programming whatsoever could be introduced to concepts like loops, conditions, functions or even patterns (producer/consumer pattern would fit perfectly) which could be a good basis to introducing a storyline.\n\nInstead this game just feels like a rip-off, I assume it wouldn't take more than few weeks to put this thing together for a skilled game developer.",

Despite warnings from CEOs, internet celebrities, and science fiction movies the world over, we the sheeple refuse to accept that our ravenous technological cravings have sealed our fate. The question is not if but when our new robot overlords will rise to power, eventually overtaking humanity and ushering in a new era of life on earth. As robotic life ascends we will watch, helpless, as they move in on our land, our loved ones, and especially, our jobs. Here, amidst the pandemonium, we will be reminded of Tomorrow Corporation, a tiny indie developer known for their aggressive cynicism and delightfully unsettling artwork. They tried to warn us, but alas their message came too late.\n\n\u201cHow did they warn us,\u201d you may ask yourself, as the metallic arms of a superior species crushes your spine like so many forests destroyed in the name of progress. Why, with entry level coding puzzles of course! Tomorrow Corporations\u2019 2015 follow up to 2012\u2019s Little Inferno (also known as Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cutest and most flammable cat), Human Resource Machine is a programming focused puzzle game featuring everything you would expect from a studio that has seemingly fallen into an existential ditch and decided they liked it down there.\n\nHuman Resource Machine is two parts inscrutable \u201cif-X-then-Y\u201d coding conundrums, one part robotic doomsday sendoff to the white-collar worker, both delivered with as much self-aggrandizing snark as can be squeezed into the four or five hours the game takes to complete.\n\nIf you are expecting Human Resource Machine to offer you an introduction to real-world coding, you should probably look elsewhere. Rather than give you a crash course in any modern coding language, Human Resource Machine is a logic driven puzzler utilizing a simple drag-and-drop interface to order instructions for your worker to undertake (because aren\u2019t we all just cogs in the capitalistic machine?). This approach does a lot to minimize the learning curve insofar as actually entering commands, and for the first few levels Human Resource Machine does a fantastic job of introducing basic order-of-operation sequences as it cycles in new commands and tasks you with completing tedious but oddly satisfying objectives.\n\nRather quickly though the steady difficulty curve Human Resource Machine begins to lead you down turns into a sharp incline. As one might expect from a game whose attempts at satire and metanarrative are as subtle as throwing someone out a window, Human Resource Machine is not the least bit interested in offering you a handhold when you come up against a puzzle that is utterly incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with coding logic. On the contrary, much of the game is predicated upon corporate enforced ignorance, with your boss overseeing you not for the sake of offering assistance but to mock your own inefficiency and inability to grasp what he assures you is basic at most.\n\nWhich, from what I have gleamed from actual coders who have played the game, is actually the truth. Though I wouldn\u2019t have known from simply playing the game, Human Resource Machine is ostensibly among the least mentally taxing programming puzzlers currently out there (a genre made up of other obscure indie darlings, such as SpaceChem and TIS-100). This then makes it hard for me to understand who Human Resource Machine is for. As a non-coder I repeatedly found myself coming up against puzzles I hadn\u2019t the slightest idea how to solve, forcing me to look outside the game for assistance, and even then often failing to understand how a solution worked therefore giving me little to go on for future puzzles. If Human Resource Machine was designed for accessibility, that goal was buried somewhere along the way and replaced with an inscrutable, unintuitive experience that is all the more aggravating because it apparently shouldn\u2019t be as difficult as it is.\n\nEven when I was able to solve a puzzle on my own, I was met with a halfhearted sense of accomplishment, as even having made progress there was no guarantee the next level wouldn\u2019t be entirely impenetrable. The difficulty curve in Human Resource Machine is among the most erratic of any game I have ever played, alternating between patronizingly simplistic and excessively challenging with the regularity of an elderly man\u2019s digestive track.\n\nUpon progressing Human Resource Machine will occasionally interject with coffee break vignettes which flesh out what could loosely be called a narrative, but, more directly, serve to reiterate the game\u2019s overarching message of impending robotic doom. Or maybe the take away is that all corporations are evil and are only keeping us around as long as we are still useful to them. Or maybe it\u2019s that we will do anything, no matter how tedious and inane, if it\u2019s framed as a game. I\u2019m not sure I could say with certainty what Human Resource Machine is really trying to. From where I\u2019m standing it seems generous to say it has much of a say on anything, and isn\u2019t merely rattling off along the same \u201ceverything is meaningless\u201d train of thought that began with (and was better executed in) Little Inferno.\n\nWhether a warning, a joke, or an attempt to reignite the market for edutainment, Human Resource Machine accomplishes little beyond damaging itself for the sake of establishing a tone that doesn\u2019t actually say anything strongly enough to be worth hearing. At times, Human Resource Machine is a dry but reluctantly satisfying puzzle game, and at others it exhausted me with its antagonistic approach to instruction and tedious structure. At this point I would almost welcome the robotic uprising, as at the very least they will surely have a better time at this than I did.

The player selects a list of actions that achieve a desired result.  For example, moving odd numbers from one side of a room to another or adding two numbers together and putting the result in the mail room's \"outbox\".  The concepts start fairly straightforward, but there are some particularly onerous (optional) challenges that make things interesting for the more experienced developers.  Most puzzles include at least 2 optimization challenges: use the least number of commands, and perform the task most efficiently.  I'm a programmer and I find some of these challenges difficult.  \n\nThe ambiance captures a satirical heartless corporation filled with clueless managers and soul-crushing orders from the executives.  The mood is kept light with colorful and cute characters, despite the dreary brown office interior.   Several \"interludes\" provide some brief comic relief.\n\nIn short, Human Resource Machine is a very enjoyable, casual game.

I am not a programmer. Here is my review.\n\nYou play an office drone in the mailroom of a large corporation, tasked with menial jobs like sending boxes from the inbox to the outbox, adding numbers to them, subtracting numbers, reordering them, sending only primes, alphabetizing, etc. along the way. As you progress, there are little bits of \"story\" that just seem cute at first but then become hilarious as you realize the world outside is changing in strange ways as you while away the years in an office. I was pleasantly surprised that this game even had a story at all.\n\nAs for the coding itself. You have a limited amount of commands, so your code is never going to be super efficient. (Ex. You have to divide quite often, but a divide command is unavailable, so you have to do an excessive amount of subtraction to get the same effect). A lot of the fun comes from trying to figure out non-obvious ways of achieving tasks that are simple in the real world with what you have. There are also challenges for optimizing your code, either with the minimum amount of steps or the minimum amount of commands. The coding style is with little boxes that you arrange in a list (no typing code), some with arrows to redirect your sequence. It's most similar to the coding system Scratch, for reference.\n\nPros:\n+Great art style\n+Good music (although repetitive, but I never got sick of it)\n+Speed/efficiency challenges for each level add replayability\n+Harder bonus levels that you can skip if you don't want the challenge\n+Cute little story\n+Slick UI, with only minor issues (see Cons)\n\nNeutral:\n~Minimal story, so don't expect one and you won't be disappointed. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at what there was.\n~Mouse only. This isn't really too big of an issue, but there are ways to add notes to your code to help you keep track of what you're doing, but you have to write them by had with your mouse, which is kind of annoying. Definitely not game breaking, and it also allows you to draw pictures if you want, which did come in handy at times.\n\nCons:\n(None of these are game-breaking. Just little annoyances)\n-Code is very inefficient, so you end up with really long bits and it's easy to forget what parts of the code are doing what. You either need to use the note function to remind yourself what you're doing or debugging your code will be a nightmare. When changing one thing led to tons of errors, I often just deleted everything and started from the beginning just because it was easier than figuring out what I had done.\n-No way to select chunks of code for easy delete.

I like programming games. Human Resource Machine was... okay. I like the graphics, I like that one can add comments and labels, and I like the music. But let's talk about the core gameplay: the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty simple for the most part, with the exception of the side-branches (which are nicely hard, and optional), and the final puzzle, which is literally a second-year computer science exercise in writing a sort algorithm in assembler. It's rather a big leap from all the other puzzles you've been working on. It would make a great side-branch challenge, but it's a rather brutal challenge for a typical player.\n\nIf you've got a programming background, you can knock the main branch (and \"win the game\") in about 3-4 hours, which means the content feels a bit lacking. If you don't have a programming background, the last puzzle will be crushingly hard, which means endless frustration when you can't win the game. This leaves Human Resource Machine not well-placed for *either* audience. I'd love to say the storyline makes up for this, but unfortunately it doesn't.\n\nInstead of playing Human Resource Machine, I would recommend:\n\n- TIS-100, if you've got a programming background. It's *very* well done.\n- SpaceChem, regardless of your background. It has lots of challenges and will really make you think.\n- Little Inferno, if you don't want a programming game at all, but do want an awesome story from Tomorrow Corporation.\n\nMaybe grab this if it's on sale, but try one of the games above first instead of paying full-price.", "timestamp_created": 1462890195, "timestamp_updated": 1465207868, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 162, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787111", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22894721": {"recommendationid": "22894721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097499566", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463076226}, "language": "english", "review": "This game really let my head expolde with this endless strings, loops and solution of any kind of problems! \nSitting on PC and thinking hours of hours how to find a solution! ;) Very very nice!", "timestamp_created": 1462884264, "timestamp_updated": 1462884264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22891983": {"recommendationid": "22891983", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964345647", "num_games_owned": 873, "num_reviews": 214, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462869367}, "language": "english", "review": "It is hard for me to recommend this game, we really need something in between thumbs up/down, because though I personally did not enjoy this game, someone less skilled in programming might find it more of a challenge.\n\nThis is a great little concept and a good game for a beginner programmer to practice fundamental programming mechanics.

You are given a very limited set of coding instructions which expand over the course of the game, and your goal is to solve all of the puzzles within a certain number of instructions or a certain number of lines executed. You have some basic looping commands (basically, GOTO and GOTO IF 0 and GOTO IF < 0), addition and subtraction, variables, pointers, and comments.\n\nThe goal is basically to take inputs and output according to the instructions. There are 41 levels in all.\n\nThere\u2026 honestly is little to be said about this game. It is pretty much a pure programming game, and while it might be an interesting puzzle for a lot of folks to solve, on the other hand, I feel like if you didn\u2019t understand programming, a lot of this game would be very inaccessible, despite its supposedly easy interface. Writing programs in it is a process of click and drag, there\u2019s no real ability to create subroutines, and sometimes it can feel a bit tedious when you realize you\u2019ve barely exceeded the necessary parameters and are going to have to take an entirely new approach.\n\nHonestly, if you\u2019re going to spend six hours messing around with programming, you might as well spend that time messing around with a real programming language. The story here is at best vague and at worst obtuse and self-contradictory; are you working for robots? Are you a robot yourself? Who knows, and who cares?

In some aspects, HR Machine doesn't disappoint: the audiovisuals are at their quirky best, and the user interface is slick as hell - as usual. All is not well in the gameplay, unfortunately.\nHR Machine is a design puzzle game, where you actually have to write simple programs. The early levels teach the basic programming concepts, and then it's on to more complicated tasks. In theory, the early levels should be great for eduction, and the later ones should keep seekers of challenge happy. In reality, the early levels do almost but not quite a great job, while the later ones are mostly disappointing.\n\nThe game does a good job of introducing load / store, loops and simple arithmetics, but I sorely miss comparison and proper branching - doing branching based on subtraction and jump-if-zero is not how I'd like to explain programming to my kids. I'll see if it will work eventually, but I sense a missed opportunity here.\n\nThe later levels are... well, not challenging. The tasks are rather straightforward, and the optimization challenges don't work well - the toolset is insufficient to do creative size optimizations, and speed optimizations too often turn into exploding loops to save on the jump instruction. For which the game is not very well equipped, so it's also time consuming without merit.\nIf someone grinds through the game, then he will eventually be rewarded by two excellent puzzles (Digit Exploder and Prime Factory) - if there'd be 10 more of these, I'd be quite happy.\n\nAll in all, HR Machine is an interesting game, and I can recommend it - but probably only under 3-4 EUR.\n", "timestamp_created": 1462712293, "timestamp_updated": 1462712293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22862262": {"recommendationid": "22862262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079134873", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462710471}, "language": "czech", "review": "Dobr\u00e1 hra na procvi\u010den\u00ed algoritmizace... :)", "timestamp_created": 1462710770, "timestamp_updated": 1462710770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22859068": {"recommendationid": "22859068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146914169", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462640092}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u82b1\u4e86\u5927\u69825\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u6210\u6240\u6709\u9898\u76ee\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u652f\u5173\u5361\u4e5f\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u8fd8\u6ca1\u505a\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u548cTIS100\u6bd4\u8f83\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u4ee5\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684Puzzle\u7c7b\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\uff08Human Resource Machine\u8bed\u6cd5\u6bd4TIS\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c11\u91cf\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u7ed9\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f5c\u51fa\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\nPro\uff1a\n+\u4f7f\u7528\u62d6\u62fd\u4ee3\u7801\u5757\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0a\u624b\u96be\u5ea6\u5f88\u4f4e\uff08\u6bd4TIS\u66f4\u6709\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\uff09\n+\u7f8e\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5f88\u8ba8\u559c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5c0f\u4eba\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f4\u89c2\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u8fd0\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u7f16\u7a0b\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u719f\u6089\u4ee3\u7801\n+\u9ed1\u8272\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u597d\u8bc4\nCon\uff1a\n-\u5173\u5361\u6709\u70b9\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0d\u8ffd\u6c42\u5168\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bdd\u96be\u5ea6\u504f\u4f4e\n-\u4e0d\u652f\u6301mod\u6216\u8005\u9898\u76ee\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8010\u73a9\u5ea6\u7565\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\n\n\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u6bd4TIS100\u66f4\u6613\u4e0a\u624b\u66f4\u8ba8\u559c\u4f46\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u578bPuzzle\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u6240\u6709\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\u7231\u597d\u8005\u5c1d\u8bd5\n\nNov 24th,2016 \u63d0\u540dsteam\u201c\u5bb6\u755c\u6700\u4f73\u4f7f\u7528\u201d\u5956", "timestamp_created": 1462696325, "timestamp_updated": 1479994395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655619", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22858930": {"recommendationid": "22858930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047713531", "num_games_owned": 1241, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487062721}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u522b\u7279\u4e48\u8ddf\u6211\u63d0GOTO\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1462695684, "timestamp_updated": 1462695684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "4.993345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22858832": {"recommendationid": "22858832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188515021", "num_games_owned": 1346, "num_reviews": 292, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472186657}, "language": "english", "review": "Learn to code\n&\nbecome\na\nbetter\nbigger\nbusiness monkey.", "timestamp_created": 1462695174, "timestamp_updated": 1462695174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22858052": {"recommendationid": "22858052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021143121", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462655147}, "language": "english", "review": "This is yet another rendition to the growing list of \"programming\" games that have not much to do with programming.

I would do few things differently, allow to change font sizes, allow type things on keyboard (you have to drag n drop everything, even comments you need to draw, can't type), or some shortcuts space for playing the simulation and [ ] to adjust speed would help. The visual jumps are nice when there is 3 of them, but when you have more of them they just annoy you. There is copy and paste and probably I enjoyed typing it manualy in other application and paste it back. I would allow CALL, RET instructions which would create routines / libaries, maybe allowing people carry over some libraries they made before. Now you have to start from scartch every time, one level checks for duplicates in memory, where the mem is already populated, next level is basicaly the same but you need to populate the memory yourself now. having nice common routines you could focus on problem solving and not the tedious work. What i enjoyed are the optimalisation parts a lot where you need to push limits of the architecture to the max. Definitely they should fix few things and create second game.

Upon starting the game, I was glad to see that it retained the unique aesthetic sense from the previous titles, but that feeling was quickly overtaken by a sense of frustration and apathy. After the first few stages the puzzles increased in difficulty in such a sharp and dramatic manner that I felt blindsided.\n\nEach stage of the game represents a year of employment and entails solving a programming problem involving some form of alphanumeric input and using your set of basic instructions to manipulate the data to conform to a desired form of output that your in-game boss communicates to you. You must construct a basic program using such tools as commands to pick items up from the input conveyor, copying to and from designated spaces, adding, subtracting, setting jump points useful for repeating sections of code and making conditional operations based on the data you happen to be working with at the moment. The puzzles start out easy enough, and it's simply a matter of arranging the commands at your disposal. After a short while though, the puzzles become exponentially more complicated and the game expects the player to take the few simple tools it gives, and use them to perform operations that the game makes little to no effort to explain. It felt as though since the game has established that you are capable of performing subtraction, you must therefore also be capable of not only division, but taking the products of multiple division operations, sorting them, and outputting them in a particular order \u2013 all using only the most basic of mathematical tools. Is it possible to accomplish these tasks? Yes. But the game doesn't establish the link between the simple and the complex, and doesn't prepare the player for the challenges it puts to them.\n\nI spent a period of time that I felt was sufficient with each puzzle and while the first quarter of the game was doable, after a while it became apparent that I wasn't going to be able to solve the rest of these puzzles on my own. Since I wasn't particularly enjoying the experience I decided I would follow a guide and at lease see if the story held any value. Unfortunately, what story is there is merely window dressing. Whereas the previous titles World of Goo and Little Inferno had stories that shed some light on their dystopian surrealist worlds, the world of Human Resource Machine is never particularly enriched. Apparently a machine army is taking over and nobody in the game seems to notice or care. Nor is it relevant to the challenges you are facing. The Kafkaesque setting and characters led me to believe that there was probably a message in here, but by the end I found I didn't know what, if any, message was meant to be conveyed and I no longer particularly cared.\n\nIn the end, I can only recommend this game to people that enjoy this very narrow type of programming-based logic puzzle. Anyone else will likely be frustrated and bored, and unfortunately the charming graphics and music won't be enough to keep the player's interest.", "timestamp_created": 1462579636, "timestamp_updated": 1462579636, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22834818": {"recommendationid": "22834818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084512310", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466433440}, "language": "english", "review": "when the people behind the world of goo get involved, its guaranteed fun! get it now and ask about it later.

It didn't seem to have a problem with letting me subtract the letter 'B' from the letter 'A', giving me the result -1.\n\nIf you want a programming game, buy SpaceChem instead, or play The Codex of Alchemical Engineering free on various flash gaming sites...", "timestamp_created": 1462459995, "timestamp_updated": 1462459995, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452276", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22810691": {"recommendationid": "22810691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066474981", "num_games_owned": 1420, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462596454}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u4e86\u5341\u51e0\u5173\u5427\uff0c\u5199\u4e2a\u611f\u60f3\uff0c\u4eff\u4f5b\u53c8\u56de\u5230\u4e86\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u5199ACM\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u60f3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57f9\u517b\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684 \u3002", "timestamp_created": 1462455993, "timestamp_updated": 1462455993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22809142": {"recommendationid": "22809142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044619336", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462449129}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon jeu, en tant que d\u00e9velopeur, je me suis bien amus\u00e9, c'est un jeu d'algorithmie : Optimiser est le seul objectif de ce jeu, optimiser le nombre d'appel de fonction ou le nombre d'execution de fonction, \u00e0 vous de voir.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1462449307, "timestamp_updated": 1462449307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22807194": {"recommendationid": "22807194", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990066758", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465329825}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this I realized how much I need things like methods, functions (basic code structuring techniques), libraries full of ready-made methods / objects and inheritence.\n\nAs such, going back to basics is a good learning experience even for existing programmers such as myself.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a .NET programmer.

You program a little worker by clicking together a program for him to execute. The game is a fantastic visualization of programming's simple concept - input/computation/output by mapping it onto a little office worker that fetches boxes from an input conveyor belt, varying storage capabilities and comparison operations and a final output coneveyor belt.\n\nEach level gives you a different task starting from very simple operations to increasingly more complex mechanics mirroring real-world techniques (pointers, zero-terminated strings anyone?). The tasks itself never feel repetitive, each one is a different challenge in itself. The learning curve is extremely well done and every level is a unique challenge. It just feels perfect in a way that you're never overwhelmed nor bored because of the available mechanics, all the while keeping the problems them simple and short enough to be done in a handful of steps.\n\nFor people that look for bigger challenges, there are optional side tasks (and they really become challenging), as well as special achievments for solving the regular and optional levels in as few as possible instructions (small program), or in as few as possible steps per input (small runtime).\n\nI really find it hard to put into words how excellent this game is.

Les programmes sont tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9s: ils vont de la copie simple de l'entr\u00e9e vers la sortie, d'une copie avec filtres (ne pas sortir les nombres n\u00e9gatifs, par exemple), \u00e0 des programmes plus complexes comme  les suites Fibonacci ou le tri de cha\u00eenes de caract\u00e8res.\n\nLe meilleur qualificatif que je pourrais donner au jeu est \"silly\"! Je suis un d\u00e9veloppeur professionel, et je m'amuse bien dans ce jeu. Le nombre d'instructions disponible \u00e9tant limit\u00e9, il faut user d'imagination et de combinaisons surprenantes afin de cr\u00e9er un programme correct.\n\nL'interface est tr\u00e8s simple d'utilisation: un simple cliquer / glisser pour placer nos instructions. Les graphiques sont comiques et admirables. J'aime beaucoup les niveaux interstitiels un peu f\u00eal\u00e9s. Ce sont de petits \"cut scenes\" sans but r\u00e9el, mais qui font rire.\n\nJ'ai deux filles, l'une de 11 ans et l'autre de 8 ans. Ma fille de 11 ans n'a pas du tout aim\u00e9 le jeu. Elle n'a tout simplement pas embarqu\u00e9 dans le jeu. Elle a tout de m\u00eame r\u00e9solu les 4 premiers niveaux. La plus jeune par contre a bien aim\u00e9e. Elle a r\u00e9solu les 5 premiers niveaux. Elle a eu besoin d'un peu d'aide, surtout au niveau de la langue: sont vocabulaire anglais ne lui permet pas de comprendre les mn\u00e9moniques des instructions de l'unit\u00e9 centrale de traitement. Mais une fois qu'elle conna\u00eet le sens de l'instruction, elle l'utilise bien.\n\nJe recommande chaudement ce jeu \u00e0 tout personnes qui veulent introduire des enfants \u00e0 la programmation, d'une fa\u00e7on simple et comique.

It is a puzzle game with the occasional short cut-scene teasing that something is happening in this world but you won't care. Characters are cute though.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nAnyone can start playing this game and enjoy it. It does require you to follow along as it ramps up the difficulty. It doesn't progress too quickly and offers optional challenging puzzles to accommodate all.\n\nCompletion time is somewhere at 8h. I spent 10h on optimizing all puzzles, having spent a number of hours out of the game to rethink my approach.\n\n[h1]Other[/h1]\n[url=https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine]Website[/url]\n[quote=official Website]Ordering here directly from the developer gives the highest percentage of proceeds to the creators, and also gets you a Steam key as well as cross platform DRM-free versions.

Sometimes I would go to sleep and think about how to clear a level and then wake up like \"I GOT IT!\". \n\nI'm a very laidback gamer, so I don't play a lot of games. At all. So I find it impressive that this game managed to keep me entertained for 10+ hours and even made me think of it outside of those hours. Usually I just stick to sudokus, nonograms, etc. But this felt a lot more fun than those mundane puzzles.\n\nI don't have anything bad to say. The game explains the mechanics well at the beginning and it's clear what your goals are. Obviously, the first levels are very easy. It just keeps stepping it up a nodge. I do remember clearing the first 19 levels very quickly, then being stuck at level 20 for an hour. It was funny how big the leap was for me, but I could overlook it. I was very glad to have these kind of tough challenges thrown at me after I got into it.\n\nThe game was worth every cent to me.

Especially regarding the ending which for me is the thing I am working towards in games from this company. \nI thought the last segment in Little Inferno did a good job at giving you just a little bit extra for your time and I could see a scenario where you get a bit more of a glimpse of what you, the employee, have brought upon this world with your optimizations.\n\nI initially wondered if this was a good tool to get friends into programming and it is for some aspects, but it is not comprehensive and I think by the time they reach the end they will be too frustrated and not finish it. I think the critical path ramps up a bit too much and some of the later puzzles should have been on the side branches to avoid frustration. Maybe a hint system that gave you a bit more info would have helped.

The levels are presented in a way that encourages players to think about the level and figure out the puzzle for themselves, instead of just looking for a walkthrough, which I\u2019ll admit to being guilty of in the past.\n\n I loved the quirky art style and the amusing, if simple, plot, but that really takes a backseat to the gameplay. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, not for me, but if you're someone who plays games just for the plotlines you might be dissapointed. \n\nDefinitely check it out if you\u2019re a fan of coding or puzzles, and are looking for a challenge that makes you want to keep trying, instead of just quitting or getting someone else to solve it for you. \n", "timestamp_created": 1453854958, "timestamp_updated": 1453854958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20769865": {"recommendationid": "20769865", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981420934", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515092816}, "language": "english", "review": "I knew I'd love this game from the moment my wife pointed it out to me on Steam, and I was right. The art style and mood of the game is equal parts Nightmare Before Christmas and Paper Mario. It's amusing and friendly, and makes assembly language programming really accessible. And that last point is really what makes this game great. As a professional programmer, I'm always happy to see new pathways for entering the field.\n\nOne of my most memorable childhood experiences that led to my love of programming was an exerise we did in school where the students gave the teacher step-by-step instructions to make a peanut butter & jelly sandwich. For example, a student might say, put the knife in the peanut butter jar, but if the lid was closed, the teacher would just bang the knife against the lid a bit to the sounds of raucus laughter.\n\nHuman Resource Machine is probably the best embodiment of those ideas I've ever seen, and you'd be forgiven if you thought it was just another puzzle game at first. However, the puzzles can get pretty challenging, especially if you are going towards the optimization goals.\n\nAny programmers who don't have much exposure to low level coding should get this game. It will give you a much better intuition of what's going on under the hood in your programs. This is especially true with the way the animations play out. Watching your toon wander around the play space, picking up data from boxes, moving them to other boxes, etc. helps you identify unnecessary/duplicate work, and other possibilities for optimization.\n\nAs a final point to drive this home, I spent last April and May doing a job search. At least 50% of my interviews/code tests involved problems with the exact same structure as many of these puzzles. If you can do well at this game and haven't done any programming before, you might want to consider a career change. ;)\n\nTHAT SAID\n\nWhile this was released as a desktop-only game, the UI was clearly designed for mobile (or at least by mobile designers), and it's rather painful:\n[list]\n   [*]ALL input is done with the left mouse button, including writing comments and labels. You have to draw them with your mouse which is annoying to begin with, but the only editing tool is \"undo\" which removes the last stroke you made. This makes it really tedious to make minor changes to an exsting program, and also means that when you copy/paste the code to share, it adds a bunch of base64 encoded binary data rather than a nice, textual comment in context with the code.\n   [*] There are absolutely no options besides \"toggle fullscreen\" and \"toggle music\".

You write in assembly-like language (very simple instructions) programs that manipulate data in input, and generate some data in output. Task vary from doubling the input values, to sorting the input values.\n\nPros:\n - easy to learn, good for young learners\n - good learning curve: instructions are introduced when needed\n - simple UI: instructions dragged and dropped as blocks\n\nCons:\n - if you don't like coding/puzzles stay away from this\n - Not many instructions are visible at a time\n - Too easy if you mastered TIS-100.\n\nThe pros are pretty much self-explanatory. The instructions as blocks are especially good for novices.\n\nAbout the cons, I found the puzzles too easy compared to the ones from TIS-100. Each puzzle has challenges on writing short or fast enough programs. Those are not always that easy, but personally they extended my play time from 5 to 7-8 hours. Not much.\n\nAbout TIS-100, I believe a comparison is needed. In TIS-100 you need to code a grid of processors that 1) can only run short programs and 2) have no memory. This made TIS-100 puzzles extremely hard. This game, instead, is about more traditional (simpler) coding because 1) there is only one processor, 2) programs can be indefinitely long, and 3) there is random-access memory (except for the first, very easy puzzles). The most obvious limitation of the processor is that you can't load an arbitrary value (say 4) in its register/tile, unless it is in a memory cell you can copy the value from.\n\nOverall, a nice puzzle game for people who like the genre or they want to learn what coding means. A little too easy for people who mastered TIS-100.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452923748, "timestamp_updated": 1452923748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20552193": {"recommendationid": "20552193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070271464", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467568041}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

Usually it's best to find a solution first and worry about optimizing it later so you can move on.\n\nThere is a story in this game, but haven't gone far enough to fully know it thus I can't say much on it.

I'm at a point now where it's clear where the game is headed which is why I want to advise against purchasing this unless you truly are willing to become a programmer, it's not really a fun game unless you enjoy programming.\n\nIf you love programming however this is your thing, great game uses some psuedo based Assembly language...except it's nowhere near as powerful and is much more limited so even if you are extremely familiar or an expert in Assembly like me you'll still have to figure out new things to do with very basic commands.\n\nIn the end this makes things like comparing numbers a much more complex thing so instead of a few lines you'll have many...many lines storing values to add or subtract the value finding the result etc. That's not so much the problem but because the only real branching available in this game is Jump if zero or Jump if negative you'll find that most programs are oversaturated with Jump commands. While it's pretty funny and thought provoking to run through 10 - 20 Jumps in for conditional programs, if you're learning programming this is not exactly efficient or even how programming is done. Rest assured it is much more simpler than this game to figure out if two numbers have the same sign or not in actual programming.

You instruct your character to perform simple tasks by writing instructions in a language that's like assembly (machine) code. The tasks begin extremely easy, so you can get the hang of writing this code, and get much more complex as about halfway through the game. As a bonus, you can attempt to meet length and efficiency of execution goals for each task, and there are bonus tasks which are very hard. There is a plot here but it's treat like an afterthought, or a bit of downtime between packs of levels.\n\nI think the game is extremely fun, especially if you're a programmer or interesting in exploring programming. I had a great time with it up until the last maybe 5 levels, out of 42 main levels. I also played a few of the bonus levels, and I had a good time optimizing the majority of the levels that I played. My problems are:\n* You can't type code labels, you have to draw them with your mouse.\n* These label system sucks, and there's no white space or code hiding. This all makes longer programs MUCH harder to read.\n* All code must be written by dragging copies of commands into place. No typing.\n* A few levels have no good explanation of the concept being used. It's almost as if this game, or these specific levels, was written ONLY for programmers/math nerds.\n\nThose are minor issues until the levels get really complex.

I'm also pretty sure this game was directly inspired by the Little Man Computer! I will list the pros and cons, and then conclude my review, with a rating out of 10.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\n+ Do not need to know how to program, just how to solve puzzles.\n\n+ Great art design.\n\n+ Lots of levels to play through, including some branched off more difficult levels that deviate from the main story.\n\n+ Great price for what you get.\n\n+ Very good tutorial.\n\n+ Some levels will ultimately leave you stumped for quite a while!\n\n+ Inside each level, you can ask the person at the desk for examples, or further explanations of the level.\n\n+ \"Optimisation Challenges\" - basically, \"can you complete the level using x or less commands?\" These add a decent replay value, and challenge you more.\n\n+ Can go forward or backwards one command a time, for program debugging, instead of only being able to play and reset.\n\n+ Comments! You can label certain parts your \"program\", so you know what part is doing what. (Or other people know, if you struggle and need some external help! These come in a couple of levels after the tutorial.)\n\n+ Humorous dialogue!\n\n+ Runs very well on a whole range of hardware. 60FPS @ 60Hz on Intel HD with a Pentium B950.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n- No options. The resolution will play native, and you can only toggle windowed or fullscreen.\n\n- No sound options. Volume is at 100%, though you can turn off music in-game.\n\n- Can't scroll up or down your command list once you run the simulation, which can be a minor annoyance if you want to follow it as it plays.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nA great game with a large target audience (if you can logically think and solve puzzles, this game is for you), created by Tomorrow Corporation - the creators of Little Inferno and World of Goo. The game has a linear set of levels, but has branches of levels that are of harder difficulty than the linear storyline, thus keeping the game fresh. The optimisation challenges further this, and add a replay value if you want to perfect levels. Ultimately, I would recommend this game strongly for those who like puzzle games, and the fact that it runs very well on even lower end hardware.\n\n[b]Rating: 9/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1447525442, "timestamp_updated": 1447525442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19073285": {"recommendationid": "19073285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107803169", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451577752}, "language": "english", "review": "how do i get a refund i didnt really enjoy the game", "timestamp_created": 1447514565, "timestamp_updated": 1447514565, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.375692", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19072964": {"recommendationid": "19072964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047029419", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447536998}, "language": "english", "review": "great, great game!!", "timestamp_created": 1447513417, "timestamp_updated": 1447513417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19064536": {"recommendationid": "19064536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991891480", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447520209}, "language": "english", "review": "It's ok.

Other than that, the gameplay is really simple and the problems not that hard. Beating the efficiency challenges can however be excruciating. \n\nTechnically speaking, however, the game is an obscenely bad PC port and for a game with programming as a concept, it's pathetic that Tomorrow Corporation has released the game as is. We can only hope they get their s.h.i.t. together and release a patch that turns this into a proper PC game. \n\nSure the game runs fine and stable, but these are extremely basic things that are required for releasing anything on PC:\n\n- The game lacks every form of settings menu. There are no volume sliders, no resolution/graphics settings, no way to adjust the audio levels or mute the menu music whatsoever. This is basic stuff that needs to be in every game and releasing a game without is sheer incompetence.  This needs to be fixed.\n- On Windows the game defaults to borderless window, which is fine for most people, but then it positions itself on top of everything else, which is bad and makes it pointless to run in a window in the first place.  This needs to be fixed.\n- The game refuses to be minimized. You can force it minimized by dropped to the Desktop, but as soon as you then go into another program it maximizes itself again. Again, this needs to be fixed.\n- Hitting Alt+Enter will force the game into regular windowed mode, which is the only way to keep the game from burying everything else you have running. It's also the only way to get into the audio mixer to turn down the game's volume (which you wouldn't have to if it was made properly).\n- Completely lacks keyboard support. Yet it has the ability to make labels and comments, without accepting keyboard input (yes, you can draw crap, but even on touch devices that's obnoxious). This is inexcusable and needs to be fixed. Pretty sure the tablet version doesn't support keyboard either, which just doubles up how bad that design decision is.\n\nOther than that, the game runs at a solid 60 fps, the audio is way too loud (even at 15% it's really loud), it has the same cutesy style as Tomorrow Corporation's previous games, and it is fun for the few hours it lasts (frustration included).", "timestamp_created": 1446936693, "timestamp_updated": 1446936693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18939435": {"recommendationid": "18939435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037445537", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446929685}, "language": "french", "review": "Bien fait, assez plaisant, les puzzles ne sont pas trop difficiles, sauf parfois lorsqu'on cherche \u00e0 faire les d\u00e9fis (code avec le moins d'instructions, ou tournant le plus rapidement possibles).

First off, people with basic programming skills will probably whiz though this game fairly quickly, I managed to finish 90% of the puzzles in one 5 hour sitting. Any real issues you'll end up facing is using your programming knowledge and implementing it into this games ui, which can be a little cumbersome at times.\n\nHowever, this game seems to be quite welcome to people who have never coded in their life. It teaches the basics steadily and in an easily understandable way, but I found the puzzle difficulty to ramp up maybe a little too fast. I watched a LPer have a crack at this game and started to really struggle at year 5, and just ended up quiting :C\n\nEach year has extra challenges too, and these are aimed at the highly skilled (at least the later years). It presents some extra diffculty to a puzzle if you're up for it. But as I said and the game itself states, this challenges are very hard, maybe a little too hard; as they require a very specific solution in a very flexible enviroment. It's quite difficult to \"trim the fat\" from coding normally, this game makes it an even more tedious task.\n\nOne other downside is the story. Normally I wouldn't complain about this as I prefer games with interesting mechanics over games with a detailed story (not that I don't enjoy them). But Human Resource Machine hasn't really tried all that hard. All you really get for story are brief cutscenes which most point to the \"robots will replace humans\" trope. While a fitting story for this game, it's not explored.... at all...\n\nOther than that, I nothing but good things to say about this game, awesome music, the \"tomorrow corporation\" artstyle and I've not encoutered any performance issues or crashes playing.\n\ntl;dr\n+ Interesting puzzle mechanic implemented well\n+ Awesome music (where's my downloadable soundtrack?)\n+ Great introduction to programming, or just to test your current skills in a neato enviroement\n- Lackluster story\n- UI can be cumbersome at times\n- Challenge requirements are too specific\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1446490008, "timestamp_updated": 1446490008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18835251": {"recommendationid": "18835251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106078583", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445176954}, "language": "english", "review": "Cheeky little game got me doing Maths and programming!!

The game does a decent job of introducing instructions (the gameplay mechanics), but does get quite challenging later on.  I like that they include some background information about the programming principles that the challenges are built on (enough to turn around and then Google the concept; indeed, some in-game dialogue even encourages you to do so, but not necessary).  Optional levels and optimization challenges provide something for those who want more (and I do recommend taking them on).  The tone and style of the presentation and narrative will be familiar to fans of the team's previous games ;).  The option to edit your code in an external editor is nice as well, and proves useful for the motivated.\n\n\nNITPICKS:\nI would call these more nitpicks, as opposed to true \"cons\", as they seem to be mostly design choices.  For example, the UI is a bit blown-up -- likely to make it easier for touch screens, and perhaps to give it a wider appeal (which I think is great, so ultimately a worthy concession).  Working with many lines of code can get a but cumbersome when not working externally (perhaps there could be options for collapsing/moving the instructions for each level).\n\nTL;DR:\nDefinitely recommended for fans of the genre, but do be aware it's core gameplay is very different from Little Inferno or World of Goo, despite the somewhat cutesy signature art style.

And it kept me hooked for several hours.\n\n[h1]What it is[/h1]\nA set of cumputing tasks you have to solve with a very basic set of micro-instructions, and a very limited amount of memory.\n\n[h1]What's the plot?[/h1]\nEach task stands on its own and there is very little in terms of overarching story or plot. The game sets a thematic mood, and runs with it.\n\n[h1]How long is it?[/h1]\nThere are 41 challanges, some 10 of which are meant to be tutorials introducing the way the machine operates or getting to use new instructions.\n\nLeaves ~ 30 challanges to solve in \"mini-assembler\". \n\nIf you're familiar with this kind of programming, you're going to find working solutions to the puzzles pretty quickly. There might be a few challanges late-game that require a not-entirely-trivial algorithm to work: sorting and integer factorization. The easier ones will be done in anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 mins, the hard ones maybe in 20 (you still have to try your algorithm and fix all these off-by-one bugs, right?). \n\nIf you're not familiar with programming at all, the learning curve will take its toll in terms of time spent, but you'll learn how computers work at the fundamental level. Modern ones, and not so modern ones. I promise you, after you're halfway through the game, you'd be able to look at an article like [url=http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/gcr-decoding/index.php]this[/url] and have a basic understanding of what the author is talking about. The learning curve is quite enjoyable, and the pacing is pretty good. New instructions are made available every couple of levels, the challanges gradually increase in complexity.\n\n[h1]Is it Hard?[/h1]\nThere are two optional challanges attached to every level. \n[list]\n    [*] Size: making the program as short as possible\n    [*] Speed: making the program execute fewer instructions when it runs\n[/list]\nLike in many real life scenarios where micro-instructions are involved you're to preserve memory and optimize runtime speed. And you're going to realize that you usually can't have both at the same time.\n\nThese challanges can be hard if you've not programmed before. They will be easier if you have programming experience at any level.  They will be much easier if you've programmed with micro-instructions before and are familiar with low-level optimization concepts like loop-unrolling. Often you'll be able to solve the speed challenge by just taking your unoptimized solution and \"being the compiler\". You'll start unrolling loops, reordering instructions to save memory accesses etc. \n\nSometimes you'll have to change the idea behind your solution to pass a challenge. Usually that would happen with the size challenge, and usually late game, where there are real choices for algorithms. There's several ways to deal with sorting for example, and once you googled the simple approaches, you pick one and implement it. Might want to [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics]watch[/url] how they work first. And for the size challenge you'll always want to go with the simplest idea. Simple ideas usually need fewer instructions.\n\nNeedless to say, to pass all the challenges you may need to think and do some research as well. To some that's fun, to some that's tiring. But if you want to 100% this game on your own, you're going to have to put [i]some[/i] effort in.\n\n[h1]Will I like it?[/h1]\nMaybe. It's a puzzle game. You can't solve it with try-and-error if you're stuck. You may get stuck on the late game challenges especially. But it's rewarding to solve them after you give it some thought and have an epiphany :)\n\nAll in all, if you like technical puzzles, then this is going to be somewhat interesting. \n\nOne thing that I found could be improved upon is that, especially end-game, there's not enough high level instructions and/or space on screen to lay out your program. Either give us a div/mult instruction or make the screen-space for the program bigger. Writing division loops in assembler takes space you know, and seeing more of the program at a time would help staying organized. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1446194092, "timestamp_updated": 1446194092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18744339": {"recommendationid": "18744339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005672602", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506598766}, "language": "german", "review": "Eines der besten Spiele, das ich je gesehen habe!

It makes some things more annoying than they should be.\nAlso, there's no code block copying and you can only save 3 solutions to any puzzle - both problems can be overcome by copying your solutions into text files, but you shouldn't have to do that.\nFinally, I found it boring that many programs could be speed-optimized by merely unrolling loops. I know that's a real technique, but it just isn't that interesting. Maybe you could make unconditional jumps free?

I haven't played WoG, but the art style is a carbon copy of Little Inferno. I personally don't mind, it's serviceable and cute, but don't expect much. The music is not really important, but didn't annoy me, although I turned it off later to listen to my own music. Sound effects can get a bit annoying in the longer puzzles but that's only natural.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not very difficult or very easy. They are somewhat challenging, especially if you try to get the optional challenges, which the game warns you are hard. They are. If you are familiar with programming puzzles, this is that. The programming language is not real, but resembles assembly or other (educational) high level languages. It is, however, not a real language. You'll enjoy the game if you enjoy programming puzzles and won't enjoy it if you don't enjoy them.\n\nThe game's major disadvantage is the complete lack of being able to write. Comments are hand-drawn, which is fun but I can never get in much information. You won't need much of them because the programs will generally be short, but it's an annoyance. The max speed at which the programs run is also just too slow; I got bored waiting for the final few programs. The game seems made for touch control. Like with real languages, this fake one has some limitations. I didn't mind the language that much, but it's a shame you won't actually learn a new language from doing this (although it can help improve your skills). They also explain some concepts very minimal and then tell you to look it up on the web if you still don't know.\n\nThe story is very thin; don't expect anything of the level of Little Inferno. Overall, it is a fun programming puzzle game in a good package. There are free alternatives, but the overall package is done very well. Difficulty scales well, the look is cute and there's a tiny bit of story sprinkled on top. It's a shame the game has some annoyances but you probably already know if this is the game for you. The game is also very short.\n\nRecommend if you like programming puzzles or if it's on sale and you like raw puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1445870428, "timestamp_updated": 1445870428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18691687": {"recommendationid": "18691687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023302797", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451045804}, "language": "english", "review": "Great!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1445843463, "timestamp_updated": 1445843463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18684720": {"recommendationid": "18684720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016431410", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474218818}, "language": "english", "review": "Mind bending.

Most problems are known problems that are easy google-able (which the game even reminds you of). Google fibonacci and you will see what I mean.\n\nNow the biggest question though: is it fun for anyone that isn't a complete geek? Well I can't speak for all but simply the prestation and artstyle is already quite entertaining. \nSo I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games in general and those who have an interest in computers in particullar.\n\n\nReview for information scientist & programmers:\n\nI'd still recommend. \n\nThe programming is so basic (it's basically assambler but with less functionallity) the challenge here is to remember how to make an >= comparison with jump if negative commands only. \n\nIn the age of Java it is quite nice to be reminded of the roots again and the hardware restriction one had. \n\nThe real challenge for us is the optimization challenges it has where you need to reduce runtime and/or code length. \n\nOne minor gripe with the game mechanics:\n\nSome of the commands are inconsistend. The sub-command for example substracts the value in the box you chose from the value you are currently holding, But it doesn't change the value of the box it self, so you have to save it manually afterwards.\nIf you take the bump -1 command instead the box value is reduced by -1 and you pick said value up at the same time. \n\nYou get used to it, but it is annoying the first time you try to make a programm and the thing doesn't work because the commands act differently from what you expect.", "timestamp_created": 1445673197, "timestamp_updated": 1445673197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18650198": {"recommendationid": "18650198", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993794444", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474340962}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who does not do any programming, I'm finding this game quite fun - coming into it without solid knowledge can be a blessing (if you're me) or a curse.

It's definitely forcing me to think differently, and I think in a more logical fashion. The puzzles progress well, so you don't feel totally unprepared for each level. \n\nIf you can, avoid looking up exact answers to each level - you'll only feel more and more lost as puzzles progress. Sometimes it helps to ask for a bit of help - I couldn't figure out on my own how to do multiplication with just addition available to me. A hint from someone who knows more than me helped, and I was able to construct something on my own from there.\n\nDo I feel like I'm learning about programming? Not really.

I'm going to guess it's on par with Little Inferno (which was somewhat weak to begin with).\n\nControls are kind of awkward. You  have to write on your labels via mouse and not keyboard. Some folks in the forums can point you to places where you can implement text into the labels, but I'm not quite inconvenienced enough to take extra steps. Sometimes I find myself meaning to pause and instead selecting 'stop' (there is no 'pause'), which resets the input so you have to run through all over again and make double sure you hit the 'back' or 'forward' buttons if you want to go line-by-line before hitting an error, at which point you are given the option to debug line-by-line. Any alterations to the code also reset the inbox, so you can't see exactly what your modification would have done with the original variables you had been working with.\n\nFor ten bucks, if you're either into logic puzzles with no programming experience, or experienced but cool with liberties being taken and what probably seem like arbitrary restraints, it's a good buy.", "timestamp_created": 1445655800, "timestamp_updated": 1446428258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18647179": {"recommendationid": "18647179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027390777", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511812118}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutly an amazing puzzle game made by a genius.

Seeing images of Human Resources Machine, I had assumed that it would do something similar in terms of exploiting space to create programming puzzles; in fact, the real game is played in a sidebar full of simple commands. Where the little man is on the screen is completely irrelevant---there are no collisions, nor even a command to move to the space right or left. Instead, you deal with space purely as a list of numbered addresses. TIS-100 and SpaceChem both force your programs to move through space, creating a novel riff on programming with problems of adjacency and making efficient use of limited space to accomplish complex tasks. HRM, by contrast, is much closer to working through an introductory CompSci problem set. The game is also marred by a poor interface; commands can only be entered by drag-and-drop, where the keyboard would be much simpler to use.\n\nThis isn't a bad game---three to five hours of decent puzzles without finishing some of the harder challenges---but it really has nothing to recommend it over a Zachtronics puzzler.

That's the sad thing about loving your work. The idea of pretending to do my day job inside a video game and in my spare time excites me...\n\nOf course, I was wrong. Human Resource Machine is a low-level programming puzzle game with a few HR and performance management jokes thrown in along the way. You pick an employee and \"code\" their workflow to automate a particular job, and with each level it becomes messier and more complex. Most frustrating of all are the optimisation challenges, which force you to rethink and rewrite solutions which may work perfectly on their own, but falter when it comes to \"efficiency\".\n\nIt gets tough quite quickly, and as someone who dropped Maths at school as soon as I was allowed to, I was often left stumped. Luckily, my intermediate knowledge of PHP/Javascript helped a little, and the game does a good job of introducing new commands one by one, so there is a great feeling of progression as you pick up new concepts and techniques. Despite the difficulty, it's ridiculously fun and somewhat educational.\n\nMy only negative comment would be that the UI is a little clunky, forcing you to scroll up and down if you have over 15 lines of code (zoom functions would be a great addition) and hand-draw notes rather than type. However, the developers have cleverly added in the ability to copy and paste code within the game as well as in into external programs like Notepad, for those who like to get down to the nitty-gritty.\n\nAs expected from the creators of World of Goo and Little Inferno, the music and graphics are delightful, and whilst there isn't so much of a storyline going on behind the scenes, the gameplay is captivating and very rewarding.\n\nHRM combines three of my passions - HR, code and video games, and it does so fantastically.

The main problem is that this game is outdated. I try to play the programming puzzle games I can find. However, I can usually find a sizable audience that would enjoy a game I *personally* dislike if they ignored or didn't mind a couple features.\n\nThis game, the \"audiences\" I can think of couldn't be more than a couple hundred. Basically, it is already outdone by other games in many, many different categories: length, accessibility, difficulty curve, concept conveying, design, debugging, feedback, efficiency, convenience, the list would probably break Steam's word count limit. And on its own rights, it still manages to be either mediocre or below on what it does.\n\nIf you're a newbie at programming, I recommend Jahooma's LogicBox for making many programming aspects convenient and less tedious. (These include better debugging control and instant feedback.) And if you're a newbie at programming like me, this is something you would really care about; assistance in some of the annoying aspects of programming. Which this game doesn't have.\n\nIf you want to learn programming concepts, it has more to show you. Here's what I can think of that would make you pick HRM over JLB: music, your personal preference of graphical style, minimal story, general knowledge, and comments/labels. Ask me anything!\n\nThe game itself is also as well designed as a free Flash game. If you're a newbie, the game has a really warped difficulty curve, and it constantly fails to get into detail to a lot of subjects the game attempts to cover. It is very frustrating to scroll through your \"code\" in this game, because the interface is so limited and your tools don't catch up, making your code look more and more like spaghetti. They really tried to push the \"simplicity\" so far the puzzles themselves got too complex and tedious to play.\n\nThe game's foundation itself is also weak. The different tests are non-rigorous, making the game seem very unpolished and easy to break. There was an opportunity to make a good story out of the game and really integrate it with the gameplay which would give it something unique, and it alluded to it, but never delivers. In addition, some design choices make the game _way_ too limited in terms of design space. Other optimization puzzlers are very free, but this one loves to deny a lot of creative solutions that were not considered during building the puzzle, so there are a lot less creative opportunities to solve in the game.\n\nSo basically, this game's main goal was a disaster.\n\nAs a second comparison, TIS-100 is a game I'm not too fond of, but I find enough a certain audience would like that makes me say that if you're someone who's played many programming puzzlers and wants more, that TIS-100 is a clear pick - its difficulty curve outdoes LB and the gameplay does not significantly differ from HRM besides the concurrency part. And you get like 10 times more playtime.\n\nI don't see where this game fits at all, and I'm torn on which it would have fit for. It's not unique. It's uninspired. It's not original.

Helping the creators of World of Goo was another incentive to give this game a shot.\n\nMy verdict is if you can solve all of the problems in the game efficiently and quickly then you pretty much have a good grasp of very low level programming. Real world programming is not nearly as tedious or disorganized (well, not all the time) but I found the game quite enjoyable and worth my money.\n\nIf you know how to code then the game is super easy but for everyone else, this game is a great glimpse into an entire industry. This game should DEFINITELY be put into grade schools everywhere. DO IT NOW for the greater good of humanity. If I played this rather than Oregan Trail as a kid, I'd probably be a god at programming now instead of an amateur historian.\n\nI want to see all high schools deploy this game as a part of their curriculum.\n\nMany of us have seen those \"coding games\" where you type code into a web interface and it basically checks if you did the code right. To put it bluntly, this medium is not very engaging. I don't see too many people having the motivation to slug through soul crushingly irritating syntax errors or logic errors. There is simply no way to actually visualize what is going on. I mean come on! It's like teaching someone English by forcing them to memorize words. The letters of the alphabet and other fundamentals go right over their head.\n\nThen comes Human Resource Machine. It is quite minimalistic and is basically rudimentary assembly programming with only registers and pre generated values (I believe it's still Turing complete). The value of this game is that you can actually see what is going on \"inside the computer\". There is no computer in the game. All operations are done by you, a lowly mailroom working sorting through some paper, and that is the genius of the game - it goes straight to the core of programming and right away users can get a feel for what the field is about, they are learning the alphabet.\n\nThe game is an exercise in logic and process reasoning.

It is a visual programming environment. The goal of the game seems to teach people how to think like a programmer, and I think it does an admirable job at that. It manages to make players visualize what a variable is, how to create ordering in your commands, why runtime errors occur, and how to test and debug. \n\nI have some misgivings, though.\n\nFirst, there is little fun in the game, except the fun of solving a programming puzzle. The people for whom this program is most useful, will hardly find any fun in that.\n\nSecond, the language the game uses is GOTO-based, and it isn't for nothing that GOTOs have been more or less banned from programming languages in the past 40 years. They make a program completely unreadable and unmaintainable, and that is exactly what happens with this game.\n\nThird, it is ridiculous that only about 15 lines of code will fit on the screen. A zoom function that would allow you to see more of your program if you want is sorely missed.\n\nFourth -- and this is the most important complaint that I have --, the OCD challenges are unfitting for this game. You can try to create a program in the least amount of memory space, but memory space is no concern of modern computers. You can try to create a program that uses the least number of cycles, but speed is no issue for modern computers and compilers optimize well anyway. By adding these OCD challenges, the designers make the player focus on those things which are least important in programming. When I teach people programming (and that is part of my job) I want them to write readable, maintainable code, and not create an unreadable mess because it is 10% faster.\n\nI'd like to use this game as a teaching tool for beginners, to get them to think like programmers before delving into the arcane mysteries of a modern computer language. I wish I could get a version without the OCD challenges.

As a long-time programmer (about 9 years), I found these to be a great mental exercise, and would heartily recommend to any programmer who is interested in optimizing code. 30 hours in and I've completed all but two of the OCDs, so I'd say there's a lot of replayability here, as playing through the game itself only took about 10 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1445217381, "timestamp_updated": 1445217381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18560085": {"recommendationid": "18560085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082215375", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446244729}, "language": "english", "review": "Small game.... good for getting the old nogger ticking again.

condizionati e operatori logici (per fortuna nel gioco non sono stati tradotti in italiano come in un vero linguaggio di programmazione).\n\nLa parte piu' divertente (ed impegnativa) sta' nel superare le sfide di ottimizzazione del codice.\nCome nella vita reale, qualsiasi programmatore e' in grado di scrivere codice, ma in pochi sanno scrivere codice ottimizzato. \n\nIn Human Resource Machine troverete due sfide di ottimizzazione per ogni livello: quella di sintesi e quella di velocita', ovvero scrivere il programma non superando il numero di linee di codice indicato nell'obbiettivo ed il numero di operazioni eseguite dal programma per portare a compimento l'intera operazione.\nPotrete comunque risolvere i livelli scrivendo un codice lungo e non ottimizzato, ma cosi' facendo vi

Perhaps the only fault is the brievity of the game particularly if you have played these other games before.\n\nThe idea is straight forward, create programs for your little person to process things from the inbox to the outbox, all set against the theme of an emotionless corporate environment. The programs are simple, based on commands that readily map to assembly language, along with data registers and the like; the only trick added late in the game is the concept of memory pointers which do help to make more complex programs.  The means of creating the programs are very intuitive, with big markers for loops, and the ability to add your own labels so you can figure out how to debug it. The game gives you plenty of help to figure out what should happen and tools to debug your program if you run into problems.\n\nIf you have played these types of games before, you quickly catch on to ways to optimize programs, and this is one of those side tasks the game offers: trying to beat an average number of code lines and processing steps, but wisely you're not penalized for failing to meet these. So there's ways to come back to optimize more. A number of optional puzzles can prove to be more difficult tasks once you get done with the main set.\n\nAnd this is where the game get a bit short. There's about 40-odd challenges, with about the first half-dozen or so being very simple tasks if you know anything about programming to start. It took me only a few hours to complete the main line of puzzles (though without trying for optimization). I feel there's more that the game could offer from the core. (For example, having to manipulate multiple workers to complete more complex tasks, akin to having multiple processors). But still, the aestetics and the approach the game gives makes the price well-justified for the game.

Automation of each job is achieved through the use of simple one line commands which combine to to create a sequential programming language. This game is both a challenging puzzle game and a great way to help new programmers into the world of programming.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n   [*] Challenging gameplay\n   [*] Cute story\n   [*] Replayability in the form of optimizing your code.\n   [*] Great music and sound, appropriate for the environment.\n   [*] Super cute graphics.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n   [*] Only uses sequential programming, where modern programming uses much more object oriented.\n   [*] Very logic based, definitely not everyones cup of tea for a puzzle game.\n   [*] While the music is great, there is very little variation in songs, so it can get a little repetitive.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nWhether you're new to the world of programming or a veteran coder this game is fun and offers varying levels of challenge for everyone. The  cute graphics, very \"corporate\" soundtrack and  [spoiler] relatively dark\t[/spoiler] storyline all combine to create an amazing little game with a good amount of content for its price.

If you know a little or a lot about coding, I can't recommend this. Too often you feel like you're trying to walk with your legs cut off at the knees - you see a problem & know immediately how to solve it, but the tools required are not available. \n\nExample: Multiplying two numbers without knowing what they are beforehand. Easy - just multiply a by b.\nNo - no multiply function. Okay, So I store a, then store b, then add a to a b times.\nNo - you can't use variables like that. You have to store a, then b, then add a to a, store it as c, then take one from b, check if b = 0, then add a to c, then take one from b, check if b = 0, then add a to c, then take one from b, check if b = 0, then add a to c, then take one from b, check if b = 0...\n\nYou will have to do each of these steps manually, with a mouse, just to do basic multiplication. Bubble sort? Two's Complement? There are infinitely saner ways to learn about this, and there is almost no handholding. Quite literally the only advice you will get sometimes is like this: \"This procedure is called XOR. You make look it up online if you wish to do further study.\" Well, if you enjoy learning about Exclusive Or et al., skip the game & watch Computerphile on YouTube.\n\nEven with labels, complex functions are too unwieldy to see as there are only 16 or so lines of commands are visible at once, and loops/jumps take up two lines so if you need recursion (and look at what you have to do just to multiply, so you will need it), finding where changes happen is nightmareish. This is why we indent our code!\n\nThe story is there, but not even as close to engaging as Little Inferno, let alone World of Goo. The graphics style is just like 2D Boy/Tomorrow Corporation's other work, familiar & quite enjoyable. The soundtrack is pleasant at first but will rapidly grate. \n\nThis game will teach you about logical operations in a curiously if not particularly intuitive fashion - it will NOT teach you how to program!", "timestamp_created": 1445079253, "timestamp_updated": 1445079801, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481139", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18519378": {"recommendationid": "18519378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039224695", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503698281}, "language": "french", "review": "Human Resource Machine est un jeu vraiment g\u00e9nial.\n\nIl permet de d\u00e9couvrir (ou re-d\u00e9couvrir) les bases du fonctionnement d'un programme, avec une approche fun et intuitive.\nLa difficult\u00e9 est progressive et l'approche est vraiment originale.", "timestamp_created": 1445064354, "timestamp_updated": 1445064354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18518553": {"recommendationid": "18518553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132476688", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475601051}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun little game about logic and puzzle solving.

On the other hand, you can finish a job in the only way you can think of, and have your mind blown when you see the optimization goals, and wonder how you can possibly re-arrange your steps.",

Ils me font rire, mais je peux me voir en eux, assailli par le consum\u00e9risme ou la bureaucratie.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535687098 Human Resource Machine vous exp\u00e9die dans la peau d'un de ses 'automates de bureaux' vous ne travaillez pas \u00e0 la chaine sur des pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9tach\u00e9es, mais c'est tout comme. \nLe but est simple, transformez selon un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 tr\u00e8s concis l'information entr\u00e9e pour la renvoyer \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9diteur.\nJe ne vais pas jouer les myst\u00e9rieux plus longtemps : une INPUT, un OUTPUT et un traitement \u00e0 appliquer entre les 2, c'est trait pour trait une analogie du langage de programmation connu sous le nom 'ASM' ou Assembleur. C'est un langage extr\u00eamement simple, extr\u00eamement \"bas niveau\" pour vous donnez l'adjectif pr\u00e9cis en usage en programmation. \n\nCe langage se pr\u00eate tr\u00e8s bien aux jeux vid\u00e9o pour 2 raisons, a) Le rapport entre sa simplicit\u00e9 et sa puissance est gigantesque. C'est un concept qu'un enfant, capable d'addition/soustractions (et un peu d'abstraction), peut s'approprier. b) La courbe d'apprentissage qu'il implique est tr\u00e8s stimulante. Comprenez que vous allez utiliser un ensemble d'instructions limit\u00e9 et simple mais qui se combine pour former de fabuleux leviers. \n\nPar ailleurs, l'ASM c'est toujours d'actualit\u00e9 non pas qu'il soit encore utilis\u00e9 aujourd'hui, mais plut\u00f4t qu'il est \u00e0 l'oeuvre partout et tout le temps pour les machines informatique). Tout programme fini t\u00f4t ou tard d\u00e9compos\u00e9 en ASM, qui lui est utilis\u00e9 quasi directement par votre machine, son processeur, sa m\u00e9moire vive. (je sch\u00e9matise, l'assembleur a des variantes, des \u00e9quivalents et m\u00eame si son 'jeu d'instructions' est simple il s'est enrichit au fil du temps d'op\u00e9rations subtiles et profond\u00e9ment abstraites).\n\nLes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en questions sont toujours tr\u00e8s clair et tr\u00e8s simple. Une fen\u00eatre offre les op\u00e9rations disponibles, glissez et d\u00e9posez ses op\u00e9rations dans le fil d'ex\u00e9cution, ordonnez les, lancez la simulation en appuyant sur 'Play' et vous verrez votre avatar d\u00e9bonnaire se promener et effectuer visuellement les op\u00e9rations que vous venez de planifier.\n\n[quote][u]exemple d'\u00e9nonc\u00e9[/u] : Pour chaque couple de valeurs dans l'Inbox, faites-en la somme et d\u00e9posez le r\u00e9sultat dans l'Outbox. (Il a l'air triviale mais vous aurez des surprises lorsque vous mettre en place l'ex\u00e9cution). Plus on avance, plus vous devrez r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir pour d\u00e9finir un cycle qui une fois r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 en boucle effectuera l'op\u00e9ration sans faillir. \nConcr\u00e8tement, un tapis roulant \u00e0 votre gauche vous am\u00e8ne des 'dossiers' marqu\u00e9s d'une lettre ou d'un chiffre. A droite un second tapis attends le r\u00e9sultat 'de sortie' et entre ces tapis, c'est \u00e0 vous d'op\u00e9rer. De traiter l'entr\u00e9e en respectant les r\u00e8gles et faites suivre le r\u00e9sultat de la transformation. [/quote]\n\nSi le concept vous rappelle quelque chose, c'est normal. Le d\u00e9veloppeur Zachtronics (Infinifactory) a d\u00e9j\u00e0 cr\u00e9\u00e9 2 titres selon le m\u00eame concept (TIS-100 et Spacechem \u2014 Le premier est tout r\u00e9cent et hardcore, le second est assez vieux, plus simple d'approche mais toujours tr\u00e8s exigeants. Ce dernier se focalise d'abord sur l'efficacit\u00e9 et la complexit\u00e9 algorithmique). HRM lui fait pareil mais avec une exp\u00e9rience vraiment 'user friendly', ce qui signifie que c'est plus abordable et plus ludique (et plus simple aussi). Mais son animation permet de rep\u00e9rer plus vite ses erreurs et facilit\u00e9 l'apprentissage.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535720485 Si l'ASM vous parle d\u00e9j\u00e0 un peu, vous retrouverez classique 'Input', 'output', 'add', 'sub', 'jump', 'jumpif*, copy*' avec m\u00eame des commentaires et un mini mode \"debug\". Pour les autres vous les comprendrez en moins de 10min chrono garanti :) \nHuman Resource Machine est totalement traduit en fran\u00e7ais (menu/sous-titres, il reste quelques courts dialogues vocaux) mais les traducteurs et les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont eu le bon sens de ne pas traduire les instructions (puisque c'est sous ce nom que vous les retrouverez dans le langage lui-m\u00eame.\n\nHuman Resource Machine est g\u00e9nial, agr\u00e9able et bien poli. Ses vertus p\u00e9dagogiques sont \u00e9videntes et m\u00eame si l'informatique/programmation vous laisse froid, le jeu se refuse \u00e0 basculer dans le jargon ou dans l'abstraction compl\u00e8te. Il constitue aussi un excellent pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 Spacechem et TIS. Par ailleurs tout comme dans ces derniers, HRM inclus votre efficacit\u00e9. Un niveau implique plusieurs mani\u00e8re de faire mais dans le jeu (tout comme dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9) votre efficience compte beaucoup, donc HRM comptera en combien d'op\u00e9rations vous \u00eates parvenu \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me, ou le nombre total d'instructions dont vous avez eu besoin.

This is done by dragging and dropping commands that direct the worker to perform certain \"programming functions\". While the game doesn't really teach you any actual programming, it does a good job teaching programming concepts and makes it easy enough for people without programming experience to understand.\n\nWhile the early levels are pretty easy, the later levels can get quite challenging especially for people without experience programming. The puzzles are pretty interesting but you need to think like a programmer to solve a lot of them. This might be challenging for people who haven't programmed before. For people who have programmed before I would say that the game is moderately difficult. \n\nHaving some programming experience I actually had a lot of fun with the game. It is probably one of the best puzzle games that I have played recently. It has taken me around eight hours to complete all but one of the puzzles so the game is probably nine to ten hours long. With more programming experience you could take less time and with less experience it will likely take you longer. \n\nThe game won't be for everyone. If you have no interest in programming or puzzle games, you probably won't like Human Resource Machine. Otherwise I think you could really enjoy the game. \n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\n[url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/human-resource-machine-indie-game-review/] Read My Full Review [/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1444942337, "timestamp_updated": 1444942337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539732", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18490054": {"recommendationid": "18490054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028091020", "num_games_owned": 3051, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444862314}, "language": "english", "review": "Human Resource Machine is a game that teaches you how to program in a fun and satisfying way\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Dn78q_IPk\nThe game helps you wrap your head around the way programming logic works.

There's nothing more satisfying than scratching your head at a puzzle, shouting at the screen that it's impossible, only to solve it in the next 5 minutes and feeling like a God. That is also a taste of what programming feels like.\n\nThere are a few optional challenges in levels which encourage you to optimize your programs so that you use less commands, or complete the task in fewer steps. Even that, is a useful skill the game helps you learn for real programming.\n\nAs you progress, you unlock new commands that you can incorporate into your program, as well as labels to remember what some sections you've created are. Within each level, you even have a few pages to work through, in case you want to try out a new program to solve the task, but don't want to scrap your current one in case you want to go back to it. The UI is also very easy to use. Everything is streamlined and reacts the way you'd expect it to.\n\nI love the world the game is set in as well. The art style is reminiscent of World of Goo and Little Inferno. It's go that adorable yet creepy and sad undertone. I feel like everyone thinks they're happy, but are actually miserable. The music is beautiful as well.\n\nOverall, I really love this game. I think it's fantastic, and I can't wait to 100% all the levels.

Better known as the developers of Little Inferno and World Of Goo. Is Human Resource Machine (HRM) just as brilliant as those games or is it maybe even better? Or, God forbid\u2026*gulp* worse?\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nLet me reassure you: HRM is absolutely great. It might not necessarily be better than their previous games, but I enjoyed this just as much (and at times even a bit more), but it\u2019s still a unique game that tries to teach you the basics of programming. It can be fun for actual programmers and people who have never even attempted it before, although it speaks for itself that it will be more challenging for this group.\n\nYou start at the bottom of the company, where the level number is relative to your years in service of the company. It starts off rather linear with only one way to go up, but after level six you can choose to play more advanced puzzles, and these branch off the otherwise linear path. These are usually more difficult versions of the levels you\u2019ve already played and they are entirely optional.\nThere seem to be 33 levels, by the way, and this is excluding the optional puzzles. In total there are around 44 levels.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531839482\nThe first few puzzles can be solved with relative ease, but the game always wants you to use your brain. You might make some progress by just trying things. You might even be able to finish a few levels this way, but ultimately things just become too complex. If you haven\u2019t paid attention to the game\u2019s mechanics then you\u2019re going to have a hard time finishing it.\nThe learning curve is good; you\u2019ll start off with the absolute basics and then just work your way through the levels, gaining more and more functions as you go. There are 11 functions in total and these functions will apparently simulate most of a computer\u2019s algorithm, which I was actually unaware of. You learn something new every day!\n\nYou can start and stop a puzzle, fast-forward as well take steps backward and forward. The sound can be muted in the level itself and there are also buttons to delete, copy and undo functions and use three sheets. You also have a clear button that removes all of your used functions so that you can quickly start over again. This is sometimes more useful than just rearranging everything and also gives a better overview if things are not going your way.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more advanced programming puzzles then I\u2019m sorry to have to disappoint you. Even casual gamers can eventually finish this game with a little patience. And to be honest, I don\u2019t think the game would\u2019ve been as fun if the puzzles would\u2019ve been even more difficult. If you want advanced programming lessons then I suggest you go read a book or follow a training course. \nIn fact, I think that there will be plenty of players who might want to give programming a try after having played this, either as a hobby or a study/job.\n\nWhere I normally don\u2019t get a sense of accomplishment whenever I manage to solve a tough puzzle, in HRM this is a completely different story. Solving the puzzles felt rewarding and great. I felt\u2026 smart. That\u2019s not normally a feeling I get when I play games. It\u2019s maybe because these are logical (to-the-point) puzzles whereas other puzzles usually require a bit trial-and-error gameplay because things aren\u2019t always clear(ly explained) and are shown in an entirely different context, relative to the game\u2019s story and atmosphere. And no, this doesn\u2019t apply to *all* puzzle games, of course.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531839455\nAfter finishing a puzzle you will be shown a results screen (called Optimization Challenges) that shows you have many steps (speed) and functions (size) you should have used and how many you used to actually finish the level. Since sometimes you can do (much) better this is a good incentive to go and replay a level. Plus, you will ultimately learn to program more efficiently this way. And the levels are also usually just a few minutes long (and previous attempts are saved you when exit the level), which is another kind of bonus I guess.\n\n[h1]Audio & Visuals[/h1]\nWith such a relaxing game you will need relaxing audio as well, right? You are absolutely correct and thankfully the music that has been implemented suits the game well. It remains in the background and doesn\u2019t become the focus of attention. Other than that there are some relatively basic sound effects: similar to the sound effects used in their previous games.\n\nThe visuals of HRM are instantly recognizable as Tomorrow Corporation\u2019s work. There\u2019s no doubt about it: the weird looking big lipped and/or big eyed characters and the brownish color palette. It\u2019s all part of the developer\u2019s famous art style. Everything looks stylish and sharp, the animations are done well, although the animations in general are quite limited. But then again, this isn\u2019t a game about the visuals, but about the gameplay. The graphics are there so you know you\u2019re dealing with a game here, but underneath it all is actually a basic programming tool. One that has just been dressed up.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531839406\n[h1]Length/Replay Value[/h1]\nFortunately there are more than enough puzzles to be solved. There are 44 levels in total and while they start off by showing you the absolute basics the difficulty will increase not long after you have started. Add to this the optional, more advanced puzzles and you should be able to finish it in 10-30 hours. All of this naturally depends on your current programming knowledge and intelligence, though (hence the big gap).\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThey have done it again: the people of Tomorrow Corporation have managed to surprise me once more. HRM has become a beautiful, little educative game that shows everyone can have fun programming\u2026 as long as it\u2019s a little dressed up. \nI\u2019ve had tons of fun playing it, even if it\u2019s at times frustratingly hard/difficult/complex. But try to keep going, though, it\u2019s worth it for the feeling of accomplishment alone. \nIn any case, I suggest you add this to your cart right now and press that big \u2018Buy\u2019 button immediately.

[/b] [/h1] [/u]\n\n[b]Developer: [/b] Tomorrow Corporation.\n[b]Genre: [/b] Puzzle Sloving, Indie, Programming.\n[b]Price: [/b] 9.99$\n[b]Played on:[/b] GTX 650 2GB OC Edition, Core i3 4130 3.4 Ghz at 1920x1080 Res.\n\n [i] [h1] \"Welcome new employee to Human Resource Machine!\" [/h1] [/i]\n\n[u] [b] Gameplay: [/b] [/u]\nWell ain't this game lovely? You get to program your little guy to do all kinds of things using the commands the game game gives you. You can do anything from basic inbox to outbox all the way to crazy infinite mathmatical loops. Gameplay is as promised, basiclly programming, you need to build a program that works for each floor to continue to the next and get promoted so you can do more puzzles with ocassional coffee breaks. The game is actually really challenging, I haven't gotten extremely far as of writing this review, but maybe that's just because I've never done programming. \n\nEach level or \"floor\" has it's own unique problem to solve, the game gets harder and harder and there are even extra side puzzles for the employees doing the best job! The game really combines programming and puzzle solving almost perfectly, very enjoyable. I currentlly only made it to level 14 just because the game seriously melts my brain on each time I open it, is that a bad thing? No, not really, because I enjoy getting my brain destroyed while trying to solve the puzzles that this game throws at me. Although you do not [i] need [/i] to know how to program, it does help. \n\nThe only thing I'd really like to say is if you are used to getting angry over frustrating games, then there is no point to picking this game up. This game [i] will not [/i] be for everyone! It starts off easy and gets harder, and harder, and harder.\n\nTomrrow Corp. as usual still leave that charming sense of... creepiness. There is always someone watching, something happening in the background that they don't tell you about but you [i] know [/i] is happening. Always a pair of eyes staring or a gear cracking or a.... is that a robot arm on the floor?\n\n[u] [b] Story: [/b] [/u]\nStorywise, the game dosen't offer a whole lot but it's a puzzle solving game, what did you expect? All the story really is, is you going floor to floor progressing up the HRM corporate food chain as whatever character you've picked out of the 4 avaliable options. The game dosen't need it's own storyline, the story is built into the gameplay, which works very, very well for a game that's all programming.\n\nIf you are really looking for a story I'd recommend Tomorrow Corp.'s [i] \"Little Inferno\" [/i] which does have a sweet little story attached to it. \n\n[u] [b] Artstyle: [/b] [/u]\nKeeping it classing Tomorrow Corp. stuck to their usual rough drawn-like artstyle. Like in their other 2 games, it looks as lovely as ever. The game looks really nice, taking the wacky fun Tomorrow Corp. models we love and mixing it with a clean, colourful UI. Vibrant colours and shapes everywhere all the way from the programming buttons to the floor tiles.\n\n[u] [b] Soundtrack: [/b] [/u]\nDespite the slight creepiness of the game (See: \"Gameplay\") the game has a upbeat, happy soundtrack like all other Tomorrow Corp. games. In my opinion not being [i] as [/i] good as Little Inferno's soundtrack, the game's OST is still really sweet and quiet adorable.\n\n[u] [b] Performance: [/b] [/u]\nObviously the game runs at a smooth 60 FPS no matter what's going on since the requirements are basiclly any computer past the year 2005 even if it isn't built for gaming. I still note performance because it's really important to know no matter what game it is. \n\n[u] [b] Additonal Notes: [/b] [/u]\n- The game dosen't have a crazy large amout of levels but they take ages to beat so it shouldn't matter that much.\n- Extremely frustrating, not saying it's a good or a bad thing, just leaving a note of it.\n- Your boss for each floor tells you what the output is suppose to look like, so you know how [i] beat [/i] the level, just not how to solve it.\n\n[u] [b] Summary: [/b] [/u]\nIt's fun, it's frusting, it makes me feel stupid, but it's loveable and most importantly it's really, really great. Highly recommended.\n\n[b] Rating: 8.5/10.

[/b]\n\nHuman Resource Machine is a challenging puzzle-based programing game from the devs who brought us Little Inferno and World of Goo. In HR Machine you\u2019re presented with tasks to complete and in order to complete said tasks you need to program your little office worker to complete whatever steps need to be taken in order to complete it. As you\u2019d expect the puzzles get harder as you progress through the game but they\u2019re not exactly easy to begin with, making this one of the most challenging games I\u2019ve come across.\n\nI\u2019ve never done any kind of programing before and while the game is very good at explaining how to do it within the game it is still pretty tough to wrap your head around. If you do have programing experience you may find it slightly easier but there are bonus levels along the way to test the best!\n\n[h1]Presentation [/h1]\n\nHR Machine brings back the style that Little Inferno and World of Goo had and as expected it looks great and fits perfectly with the game. There\u2019s not much else to say about this other than the fact that it\u2019s a great looking game. All the models are good, the UI is clean, simple and easy to use as is the menu.\n\n[h1]Gameplay [/h1]\n\n[b]Management is watching. [/b]\n\nStarting the game with two different commands you\u2019ll gradually work your way up to eleven different commands, making up a simple language. Using this language you\u2019ll program your little office worker to complete tasks set by the management. Each task has its own floor, completing the task will earn you a promotion to the next floor and a harder task to complete. While the main objective is of course to complete each task, the management are also looking to see how many commands you use and how many steps it takes for you to complete the task. While these aren\u2019t tied to progression they add an extra challenge if you wish to push yourself though it\u2019s not always possible to complete them both in one program.\n\nThe tasks set are of a wide variety but they always involve taking items (numbers at the beginning but letters are introduced later on) from the inbox and then manipulating them somehow before moving them to the outbox. Some tasks involve taking items from the inbox before subtracting them from the next item in the inbox, some involve multiplying a number by itself x number of times etc. \n\nAll of the levels with tasks have spaces on the floor where you can copy inbox items to/from. These are used in pretty much all of the tasks in order to manipulate the items or swap their order etc.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier there are bonus tasks which provide a challenge for even the best programmers! The different tasks are displayed as what looks like an elevator floor control. Every so often you\u2019ll come across a branch that breaks away from the rest of the levels, generally about four or five levels. The tasks given to you on these levels are incredibly challenging, I found the regular tasks mind numbing but these take it to a whole new level of mind numbingness! So whether you\u2019re a programming wizard or a complete newcomer there\u2019s something here to get your grey matter going.\n\n[h1]Audio [/h1]\n\nAudio is great across the board for HR Machine. The music fits nicely with the game and it\u2019s reasonably subtle so it doesn\u2019t steal the show from the game itself. Sound effects are also fitting and sound pretty good.\n\n[h1]Miscellaneous [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]While it\u2019s definitely not the main point of the game, HR Machine does have a storyline running through it which is rather amusing and provides a nice occasional break from the game itself.\n[*]HR Machine features forty-two levels, enough to keep you going for quite some time though not all of the levels have tasks to complete, six of the levels are coffee breaks, i.e. the levels where you\u2019re presented with the story.\n[*]Really the only thing I didn\u2019t like about HR Machine is that it\u2019s pretty difficult to write out the comments. Comments are unlocked a few levels in and allow you to split up your code (you can also label spots on the floor later on) but they have to be \u2018hand-written\u2019 with the mouse, personally I would have preferred to just type them.      \n[*]You\u2019re able to run your program step-by-step which is incredibly helpful for fine tuning it as well as weeding out any issues with it to correct them.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\n\n[b]Essential Purchase.[/b]\n\nHuman Resource Machine is a truly fantastic puzzle-based programing game with a charming aesthetic and challenging puzzles. If you\u2019re a fan of puzzle games or just like a good challenge, do yourself a favour and buy this game.\n\n[b]Review Copy Provided.

[/i]\n\n[u] Summary: [/u]\nEver wanted a glimpse into the world of logic and assembly programming? That's what Human Resource Machine does: translates the world of some assembly based programming into a corporate like infrastructure in a puzzle like format. And they've done it rather well, allowing for teaching the concepts and ideas behind logical programming in a way that people can understand, at least coming from a software engineers perspective. It still captures the Tomorrow Corporation's aesthetic and goofy nature rather well, and while it's a game that will frustrate others with no hint system, it's countered by the use of the \u201cdebugger\u201d to see what's going on. A good teaching tool and glimpse into the world, while still challenging those who want a puzzle challenge.\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h_yAHu3eqg [/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fantastic translation of the material to a core concept that people can understand. While I had a headstart with my background, I felt it taught the material well enough to get a basic understanding, but held back enough so that people would still be challenged.\n[*] Good extra objectives to teach concepts of optimization. Feel like this would do well in a classroom to teach basic ideas. Shows some of the struggles behind code length and efficiency.\n[*] Captures the Tomorrow Corporation's aesthetic rather well. Goofy, with a hint of seriousness, and a good element of little charms.\n[*] Good introduction of new mechanics just as you finishing getting a handle of the other one.\n[*] Allowed for multiply solution areas so that you can attempt certain different ways without messing up your current one.\n[*] Giving examples for those who get confused was a good move.\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] No hint system will frustrate people on some solutions that they may not just get.\n[*] Some information should have been displayed on the screen as opposed to submenus for clarity sake. There was enough room and ways to fit it in thematically.\n[*] May be short for some, but honestly, I feel it's the right amount for a game like this.\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1444939251, "timestamp_updated": 1444939251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603980", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1792, "total_negative": 126, "total_reviews": 1918}}

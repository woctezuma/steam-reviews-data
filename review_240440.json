Minor spoilers ahead. \n\nFirst of all this is not actually a \u201chacking\u201d game, it\u2019s more of the actual stealth planning game that uses basic computer commands to solve puzzles. Also the game never actually has you do the heists so if that bothers you go elsewhere; all the missions are actually prepping for the mission. I like the odd art style and odd humor when it does actually show up, it needed more but the game is overall maybe 7-10 hours so it\u2019s not like the gameplay got stale. It\u2019s not a game to play in one sitting, you do need to in many puzzles take some time sit down and think about how to string commands together to solve the puzzle.  The only kind of hard to understand and tricky command is blink, which is easy to mess up and it\u2019s not explained that you need to exit a program then reenter it. The mix of computer commands and special puzzle solving without having to switch in and out of menus reminds me a lot of the immersion created in farcry 2. When using the \u201cdeck\u201d or even monitor you never actually taken to a separate menu it all exist in game.  My only major criticism of the game was the jump pad fans, tended to make for some of the worst section of the game, they had a bad habit of overshooting or being frustrating to use.  Everything else though felt kind of natural like in some 1980\u2019s future.  It\u2019s worth a play if you\u2019re looking for an odd mix of computer programs and puzzle platforming. \n", "timestamp_created": 1519619018, "timestamp_updated": 1519619018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40209238": {"recommendationid": "40209238", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969383645", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518997781}, "language": "english", "review": "My first encounter with this game was while it was in development. It was being shown in a trailer at a PAX show, and it seemed like it was going to be the first game to allow the player to use programming to solve interactive problems in a FPS. I was pretty excited for that, but after years in development and waiting for the macOS port, I see that it changed a lot from its early vision. What remains is an incredible aesthetic but an easy and short 5 hour game where your band of 3 lady hackers complete a series of virtual heists. There are puzzles, but they are light scripting if you can even call it that. Nothing that feels like programming ever comes into it. You'll \"jack in\" to wall sockets and trigger this and that with keyboard commands, but mostly it follows the tradition of \"find the door trigger that opens the door\". With the twist being that sometimes you have to place a remotely triggered device and work on your timing. There is no multiplayer, despite the introduction of a gameplay style halfway through the game where you have to switch between two characters to cooperatively solve tasks in tandem.\n\nThe gameplay changes every stage or two, and it doesn't build upon itself necessarily. It's just continually experimenting with ideas and then throwing them away. You're on a train, you're robbing a house, you're in space now. Robots attack your hideout. You're on an airship. A badminton mini-game. All right...I get it, this game wants you to know it's quirky.\n\nAnyway, beyond some light brainteasers, this is a game about the visual art. Quadrilateral Cowboy has no dialogue or plot, moving between discrete and disconnected missions with only wah-wah-wah Charlie Brown style dialogue, if any at all. It's strictly visual storytelling. It fitting with the hipster aesthic, the game is set in a fictional 1979 or 1980, with plenty of retro computing artifacts and obvious influences from Wes Andersen's cinematic style.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of a handful of public domain tunes from the early 20th century (plus a recurring rendition of Claire de Lune) which the player can select from at any time, using a walkman-like portable record-player item. Visually, the game is a cross between dark cyberpunk and an absurdist comedy, similar to JazzPunk. Thanks to the idTech4 engine, it runs at a good frame rate on an old mid-2010 MacBook Pro.\n\nI would recommend the game if you are a fan of charming indie efforts, but do not look for a serious programmer-style challenge along the lines of a Zachtronics game. The controls are clumsy, especially when trying to place your deck or TV on the ground. Multiple bugs will affect your gameplay \u2013 mostly minor, but in my short playthrough it crashed to the main menu or crashed out of the game entirely more than once. Another bug can cause your character to \"choke from lack of oxygen\" in any outer-space level where you are safely indoors.", "timestamp_created": 1519000031, "timestamp_updated": 1519000031, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40038380": {"recommendationid": "40038380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052595334", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518499454}, "language": "english", "review": "My god.

I would recommend picking this one up on sale. \n", "timestamp_created": 1515267111, "timestamp_updated": 1515267111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39111272": {"recommendationid": "39111272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143177897", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515244135}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is somewhat reminiscent of Jazzpunk, another indie game. Both have cyberpunk environments, humor scattered everywhere (especially objects), and a charming cast of characters. However, this game is about Hollywood-esque hacking and heists in a cyberpunk's reimagining of the 1980s instead of Bond-ish espionage in a Cold War-stylized future. There's a plot, but it is optional since knowing about it inside the game requires careful observation of the levels.\n\nThere is a terminal on your portable deck, wherein you will have to type commands to interact with hackable objects. Newbies and people who aren't good at computers shouldn't worry too much since the game provides instructions all the way through the end; there are even signs in the early levels inscribed with examples of said commands and the optional advanced features.\n\nIf you are tech savvy, a prosumer, programmer, and/or interested in computers, then you'll enjoy the game even more; there are references to old and new technology aplenty, even in the items that are provided. It is possible to finish some levels with only one command and a bit of going around them. This is due to the in-game terminal (not the debug console) allowing basic pipes for commands; for those who don't know, this allows for combining multiple commands into one. There are a few other advanced CLI features in there, but I'd suggest playing the game to find out more about them.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a phenomenal indie game with a good albeit optional plot, peculiar and interesting gameplay, great retro cyberpunk-ish atmosphere, and chock full of pop culture-laden subtle and blatant humor.

Another reason is that I've been pulled away from longer games simply because of circumstance. So you could say that what Quadrilateral Cowboy actually offered was exactly what I needed at the time of playing it. And what it offers is some of the most subtle, intimate storytelling in gaming intertwined with what I would also call subtle, intimate puzzles. Puzzles with clever solutions but in which the solution is not the most important element.\n\nThe highlight of this game is the physicality of the objects you interact with. It is the internal consistency of the tools at your disposal. If it's true that the game never combines all it's elements to present you with truly complicated puzzle challenges (a la Portal, The Witness or Stephen's Sausage Roll), it is also true that the game doesn't really aim for that kind of brainteaser. It has just as much puzzle as is necessary to make you feel in it's world, breaking into things, hacking weird stuff, downoading brain content, sticking it up the corporate overlord. Even though many of the puzzles are  simple, I will never forget how they made me feel. As the story of the three girls progressed, I became part of this rag-tag band of absurd hacker-heros in a way that will stay with me for a long time.\n\nSo that's why it has become a most memorable game for me. It is short and sweet. It is subtle and feels profound without posturing or ridiculous gestures of intellectual grandeur (looking at you, Bioshock Infinite). It has great gameplay that you can interact with at the pace of a narrative sensation that encompasses you (never do you need to stop and think for a duration of time in which you are no longer a character and become instead a solver, a detached entity with a notepad and a brain).\n\nIt is little escapade into a world I wish existed.

The big difference between Quadrilateral Cowboy and its predecessors, however, is that it\u2019s a fully functional game, with clearly defined objectives and gameplay mechanics, instead of the \u201cwalking simulator\u201d approach employed by the developer with his earlier work.\n\nBrendon Chung\u2019s latest title is an adventure game disguised as a puzzle-solving experience. We play as a recently graduated engineer dabbling in computer hacking and engaging in a series of high stakes heists. From the beginning of the game, we can see that Quadrilateral Cowboy\u2019s world diverged from ours at some point, as it\u2019s set in the 1980s, but there are flying motorbikes and VR seems to be a fully functional thing. Computers must still be controlled through DOS-like interfaces though, something that fits the cyberpunk theme perfectly, and adds a tactile dimension to our interactions with the game world.\n\nThe beginning of the adventure will teach players how to hack doors and other objects in the game world, using a portable hacking deck that must be deployed and then interacted with. The act of hacking feels real thanks to the use of believable commands typed on the portable computer\u2019s miniature keyboard and displayed on its screen, and after a few small \u201ctest\u201d levels, most gamers will be typing commands as if they were real life hackers.\n\nQuadrilateral Cowboy is quite similar to Portal, introducing a new gadget, building a level around the use of that tool and then seamlessly adding it to the player\u2019s arsenal as a thing that may or may not be used to complete later puzzles. This is usually something good, but at some points it feels like the first half of the game is a tutorial for the latter part of the adventure. Luckily, the story is intriguing enough to carry the \u201ctutorial\u201d parts, and the strangeness of the environments ensures that the player never feels bored, even with the most basic tasks.\nBetween each mission, we\u2019ll be taken to playable intermissions which usually take only a few seconds (though the player can always explore the environment at their leisure) and through those scenes we can learn more about the world, our character and her friends/associates. For instance, we can discern that even though our character is a recently graduated engineer, the city of Nuevos Aires has no need for her skills (or her friends\u2019 skills) and that\u2019s the reason for her criminal activities.\n\nAs the game progresses, the plot\u2019s pace quickens, the stakes are higher and we get to play through complex levels that make use of all the gadgets acquired along the way. Sadly, not everything is perfect, as Quadrilateral Cowboy seems to be a quite buggy piece of software (picking up gear in order to stash it may trigger crashes for no apparent reason) and some players may feel that the duration of the game is a problem (I got through the game in four hours) Still, even with those caveats, I believe that Blendo Games\u2019 latest adventure is one of the most enjoyable titles of 2016, and I can\u2019t wait to see what Brendon Chung\u2019s got planned for the future.", "timestamp_created": 1488908756, "timestamp_updated": 1488908756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30347951": {"recommendationid": "30347951", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990748200", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488758683}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautifully subtle", "timestamp_created": 1488758802, "timestamp_updated": 1488758802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30345630": {"recommendationid": "30345630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041020479", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492949653}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me feel like a hightech rogue agent!

Multiple weevers, or using the weever and autocase simultaneously, are never explored even though the tools and commands hint at the possibility. Workshop support really SHOULD make up for some of these flaws, but six months later only a handful of levels even exist. \n\nThe plot and backstory stuff feels like it's building up to something big, but it never gets there which is unusual given the developer's past works. The game does a good job of establishing the basics of who these people you're playing as are in between levels, but there's never a moment where these relationships are tested or a true antagonist emerges. Some really cool things happen, and then they just stop happening.

I didn't rush the game and even idled some, and I still came out at 4.9 hours.\n[*]The story is just awful.  You get the general picture but there's no detail to really drag you in, or feel involved. It doesn't tie the levels together whatsoever. It just feels like you're doing the next level because.. it's next. The story [spoiler]goes from hacking to getting attacked to flying. There's nothing that ties it together.. except maybe sisterhood? I didn't feel it. They're friends. Who fucking cares?[/spoiler]\n[*]Buggy. Even months after release, issues the dev thinks they've fixed keep happening. Visual bugs, bugs while restarting a level, bugs with the deck so you can't issue commands properly, which persists through saves and reloads. Bugs everywhere.\n[*]Sound felt very cheap at times.\n[*]Mods? This game has been out for 5 months and has 4 mods on the Steam Workshop. This isn't the dev's fault, but if they wasted time integrating the workshop for this, someone is at fault.\n[*]Puzzles go from easy to hard to easy. There's no consistency whatsoever, and the game does a horrible job of explaining some mechanics. Most are easy to understand, but if you miss a detail, it gets confusing quickly.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, it's a neat idea but it doesn't execute its goal very well. I'd give it a 6/10.

After running it for a couple of hours, the game will spontaneously lock up. Sometimes when I load the game it will load into a 640x480 window and freeze. And sometimes when I play, I am not able to cycle back through the keyboard commands without it also adding a carriage return. (IE, if my last command was \"test\" I should be able to hit the up arrow to get the \"test\" command line to appear in my current field--however, while it does bring up the \"test\" command it effectively hits <ENTER> executing the command by itself). Most of the time I can just cycle through all of my previous commands with no issues, but once this started happening, I have not been able to stop it from happening.

Again, if you played the previous games, you might end up a little dissapointed.[/spoiler]\nOverall, i would give the game a 7/10, just for trying something new with the hacking mechanic.\nStory of Gravity Bone + Gameplay of Quadrilateral Cowboy = Dream Combo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-L-jCr18g", "timestamp_created": 1473549871, "timestamp_updated": 1473549871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25387478": {"recommendationid": "25387478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134263790", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473194731}, "language": "italian", "review": "Semplicemente Delirante!!!!\n\nUn puzzlegame che mette dalla sua ironia e ambientazione cyberpunk.\nPuzzle intellenti e la figata di tornare ai tempi del DOS (x chi \u00e8 vecchietto \u00e8 un tuffo nel passato).\n\nSimpatico, divertente e per nulla banale.\ninsomma a chi piace usare il cervello potrebbe essere un acquisto azzeccato.", "timestamp_created": 1473199050, "timestamp_updated": 1473199050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25373800": {"recommendationid": "25373800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037044572", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473121642}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is my 2016 indie gem so far.

You get in, find an obstacle, plan how to use your tools and commands and when you set everything in motion and pull it off you just feel badass.\n-The hacking is very accessible, no previous programming knowledge required\n-The variety is amazing, you'll start by simply using your field computer and as the game progresses, you'll get more tools that you'll have to know how to use so you can do things that you simply can't do by yourself.\n-The game has a really nice level of detail that is essential for the game to tell it's story.\n-The workshop support can give you a couple more hours out of this.\n\nWhat you may or may not like:\n-The game was relatively easy and short (about 4.5 hours) if you don't want to pay 20\u20ac for that, then it is perfectly understandable that you should wait for a sale.\n-The story is mostly told through the enviroment and the moments in-between missions. No voice acting, no written logs with lore, just visual storytelling (which I believe this game nails)\n\nWhat you most certainly won't like:\n-There is a number of bugs I came across while playing, picking up a turret in a mission made the game crash, the deck(the field computer you use for the hacking) had its screen stuck and another time, it inputed automatically the previous commands when selecting them, but nothing a level restart or small workaround wouldn't solve.", "timestamp_created": 1473123640, "timestamp_updated": 1473123640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25370012": {"recommendationid": "25370012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067499546", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470186957}, "language": "english", "review": "I can praise this game all I want, but ultimately your enjoyment of QC will depend on how much you like coding.

My biggest complaint with the game is that there wasn't a single puzzle that used everything you have learned and you entire arsenal in one giant climactic puzzle, instead you are left wondering what could have been which may be intentional seeing as the story is deliberately left that way too.\n\nOld fans of Blendo will not be surprised by the subdued storytelling, but for some it might be a turnoff. A lot is left to the player to piece together through intuition and studying the environment, which in my opinion is needed me in storytelling in gaming.\n\nAnother complaint is the length but that is mostly because I wanted more of the game as I loved it so much.

Please keep doing the work you have been doing, and especially if you continue to add to Quadrilateral Cowboy, an already excellent and complete game.\n\nReview: This game is full of cyberpunk \"jobs\" that you do with two other characters, in a fully stylized world. With the use of multiple gadgets and hacking, you can use an easy to learn programming language to utilize them to break into highly secured places. Its a bit of a challenge to program multiple tasks, but it is very open ended in how you can do your programming. About 2 missions were a bit of a pain, due to me trying to figure out how not to get stuck in laser grids, but they were doable, and most of the many missions are not so very hard to figure out.\n I recommend this game to anyone who wants to challenge themselves with a game that uses objects and coding together to complete objectives, and anyone that has enjoyed Blendo Games work before.\nTHE LARGEST PRO: The game itself is strangely emotional, and beautiful. The gameplay is solid but the unfolding of the group, without dialogue, and how they live and work together is just first rate. Not many games replicate the narrative as well, with so much minimalism, as this game amazingly does.

Everything goes perfectly well for these characters.\n\nIt's such a shame, too, because as you look through the developer's commentary you see Brendon Chung's enthusiasm for his project. He spent much of his attention in the finer details of this world he created.", "timestamp_created": 1470149502, "timestamp_updated": 1470149502, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24668427": {"recommendationid": "24668427", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976263858", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470100515}, "language": "french", "review": "Tant qu'\u00e0 \u00e9crire une review constructive, autant commencer par ce qui f\u00e2che le plus : ce jeu est COURT.\nMais je reviendrais l\u00e0-dessus plus tard. Car au-del\u00e0 de ce d\u00e9faut pas si singulier en 2016, ce jeu est EXCELLENT.\n\nDans la pure lign\u00e9e des jeux Blendo, dont il partage l'univers, la narration se fait sans aucun dialogue. Vous d\u00e9couvrirez les personnages (ou ne les d\u00e9couvrirez pas, si cet aspect ne vous int\u00e9resse pas) et le monde dans lequel ils \u00e9voluent en vous baladant dans les petites intermissions entrecoupant le gameplay, exactement comme le faisait Hotline Miami.\n\nL'histoire repose sur un groupe de 3 mercenaires/hackeuses encha\u00eenant les contrats, dans lesquels elles sont amen\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u00e9rober discr\u00e8tement coffres, donn\u00e9es. Pour cela, elles disposent d'un ordinateur, le Bienjensu KDR-7, qui leur permettra de planifier leur coup avant de passer \u00e0 l'action, en effectuant une premi\u00e8re fois la mission dans une reproduction virtuelle du lieu de crime.\nEt \u00e0 vrai dire, mis \u00e0 part les interludes pass\u00e9es dans le monde r\u00e9el, tout se passera dans ces simulations, une ellipse temporelle sautant syst\u00e9matiquement le reste des \u00e9tapes \"concr\u00e8tes\" du plan, laissant cette partie du d\u00e9roulement de l'histoire, sens\u00e9 \u00eatre identique \u00e0 la planification, \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par votre imagination.\n\nLors de ces simulations, Poncho - tel est le nom de l'h\u00e9ro\u00efne - devra utiliser divers gadgets pour interagir avec son environnement, le principal \u00e9tant le Deck, un ordinateur portatif qui lui permettra d'agir sur certains objets tels que les portes ou les lasers afin de se frayer un chemin au sein des structures \u00e0 infiltrer, et contr\u00f4ler \u00e0 distance le reste de l'\u00e9quipement dont elle disposera. Parmis ces inventions qu'emploiera notre protagoniste, on trouvera, entre autres, un robot quadrup\u00e8de miniature capable de se connecter sur les \"Datajack\", \u00e0 savoir des prises de donn\u00e9es dispos\u00e9es dans les niveaux donnant la possibilit\u00e9 d'agir sur certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments du d\u00e9cor, ainsi qu'une valise se d\u00e9ployant cachant une mitraillette dont les balles d\u00e9clencheront les boutons \u00e0 distance.\n\nLes missions nous sont propos\u00e9es par groupes de 3, chaque grappe introduisant de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de gameplay qui seront expos\u00e9es au joueur avec une difficult\u00e9 croissante.\nLes m\u00e9caniques ne sont pas tr\u00e8s difficiles \u00e0 apprendre, encore moins \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser. \u00c0 la mani\u00e8re des autres productions du studio, les niveaux sont construits de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que le joueur prenne en main le jeu simplement en \u00e9voluant dedans, disposant dans les d\u00e9cors de nombreux petits \u00e9criteaux afin d'apprendre de mani\u00e8re contextuelle \u00e0 manipuler son \u00e9quipement et son environnement. Il est ainsi tr\u00e8s naturel de parcourir les niveaux, et les r\u00e9actions que l'on adopte face aux obstacles devient rapidement tr\u00e8s spontan\u00e9es.\nNul besoin d'\u00eatre effray\u00e9 par l'aspect \"programmation\" de ce jeu : il ne se r\u00e9duit qu'\u00e0 taper des commandes, \u00e0 l'instar d'un prompt MS-DOS des ann\u00e9es 80 (\u00e9poque dont le jeu fait sans cesse hommage). Celui-ci est par ailleurs tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 utiliser, et pointer une tourelle automatique degr\u00e9 par degr\u00e9 se r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9tonnamment grisant.\n\nEt c'est de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 que vient un des reproches que je pourrais faire \u00e0 ce jeu : certaines m\u00e9caniques de base sont certes reprises de s\u00e9quence en s\u00e9quence, mais d'autres parties du gameplay, pourtant tr\u00e8s stimulantes, dispara\u00eetront purement et simplement d\u00e8s lors que le chapitre qui les aura pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aura touch\u00e9 sa fin. De plus, les missions cumulant la somme de ces m\u00e9caniques, que l'on peut attendre en seconde partie du jeu une fois que celui-ci aura cess\u00e9 de nous enseigner l'ensemble de ses ficelles, se comptent sur les phalanges d'une main dont il manquerait des doigts. Comme si le jeu entier n'\u00e9tait qu'un tutoriel pour quelque chose de plus important, le g\u00e9n\u00e9rique apparaissant par surprise d\u00e8s lors que le jeu aura \u00e9puis\u00e9 tout ce qu'il avait \u00e0 nous apprendre.\n\nAlors oui, c'est un jeu Blendo, et cela correspond donc plus ou moins au style du d\u00e9veloppeur, \u00e0 savoir proposer une exp\u00e9rience courte mais intense, racontant une histoire de mani\u00e8re condens\u00e9e mais ma\u00eetris\u00e9e, ressemblant presque \u00e0 un essai au format vid\u00e9oludique. La diff\u00e9rence avec les autres jeux narratifs du d\u00e9veloppeur tels que Gravity Bone ou Thirty Flights of Loving, se situe au fait que cette exp\u00e9rience ne repose pas enti\u00e8rement sur une narration, car il y a un r\u00e9el gameplay prenant bien plus d'importance que cette histoire qu'il tente de nous raconter, que l'on peut totalement ignorer si on le souhaite, sans pour autant perdre notre plaisir de jeu. Cette fin pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e laisse un petit arri\u00e8re go\u00fbt de frustration, d'inachev\u00e9. On aimerait en avoir plus, mais il ne faut pas oublier qu'une seule personne (2 d'apr\u00e8s les cr\u00e9dits ??) se trouve derri\u00e8re ce titre, en d\u00e9veloppement depuis quelques ann\u00e9es.\n\nQuelque chose est cependant venu s\u00e9cher mes larmes : l'ouverture du jeu au modding.\nidTech 4 aidant, il est possible de charger des mods via le Steam Workshop, vide \u00e0 l'heure o\u00f9 ces mots sont \u00e9crits. Mais le d\u00e9veloppeur \u00e0 d'ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9crit un petit guide de d\u00e9marrage pour d\u00e9buter le level design sous DarkRadiant, utilis\u00e9 pour la conception des niveaux du jeu, et promets de l'\u00e9toffer une fois le jeu exempt de bugs. Les communaut\u00e9s de fans \u00e9tant ce qu'elles sont, il y a fort \u00e0 penser que de nombreux mods et maps de qualit\u00e9 verront le jour tr\u00e8s rapidement afin de nous permettre de continuer l'exp\u00e9rience !\n\nPas grand chose \u00e0 dire sur le graphisme : c'est le moteur de Doom 3, avec la direction artistique propre \u00e0 Brendon Chung, l'unique d\u00e9veloppeur derri\u00e8re Blendo Games. Il ne faut donc pas s'attendre \u00e0 plus que des graphismes tr\u00e8s simples \u00e0 base de persos \u00e0 la t\u00eate carr\u00e9e, objets low poly et textures MSPAINT. Mais cela reste coh\u00e9rent et tr\u00e8s mignon, du moment que l'on accroche \u00e0 ce style d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis en place lors de ses pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes cr\u00e9ations.\nApr\u00e8s quelques minutes dans ce jeu, on comprend tr\u00e8s bien pourquoi son sous-titre est \"un jeu cyberpunk du 20e si\u00e8cle\", et cela en devient d\u00e9lectable tant le d\u00e9lire est original assum\u00e9 jusqu'au bout, s'appropriant les codes du genre en y incorporant de nombreux clins d\u2019\u0153il et clich\u00e9s aux ann\u00e9es 80.\n\n\n[b]tl;dr[/b] : c'est court mais kiffant, on peut taper des commandes dans un prompt DOS pour ouvrir des portes, y a un petit robot mignon t\u00e9l\u00e9guid\u00e9 qui fait des bruits mignons, y a une malette mitrailette, des persos principaux f\u00e9minins et badass, plein d'ordinateurs qui font blipblip quand on y rentre des cassettes, cours l'acheter", "timestamp_created": 1470137650, "timestamp_updated": 1470137650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24665040": {"recommendationid": "24665040", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970443518", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478308628}, "language": "english", "review": "Wes Anderson meets Neuromancer in a story-puzzle game I wish never ended.

They both have a small band of misfits taking odd jobs and casually going to space. There is also the same mix of cultures in the enviroments that Bebop is full of; and they both have Cowboy in the title!\n\n\nSpoilers from here!\n\nThe ending felt like it touched on a lot of the key themes from that show. It ends with you reminissing on the life of crime that you lived when younger; it seems like a happy ending but if you look carefully just before the final photgraph that triggers the end credits there are books on hospice care, and because you're the only person in the ending sequence it heavily implies that your partners in crime are probably now very ill or already dead; suggesting that all that fun that was had was only part of the past; in fact it kind of recontextualizes the entire game to from the perspective of older you looking back. In fact the leaderboards urging for a faster time after each heist suggest that you are looking back at the heists you completed during you life and thinking about how much better they could have been run. \n\nThe reason I think this theme of recognizing that all of that was back in the past is also inspired by Bebop is because that is literally the key themes of Bebop; every character in that show has something from their past that they are either too focused on or trying to run away from.\n\nSo maybe I'm just crazy and maybe obsessed with an anime, but considering Chung has mentioned that show as an inspiration to earlier works I think it is interesting to look into similarities.", "timestamp_created": 1470077321, "timestamp_updated": 1470078539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24655836": {"recommendationid": "24655836", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989236581", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470071661}, "language": "english", "review": "This one is a doozy. How do you talk about a game you had a ton of fun playing, but felt\ncompletely underwhelmed by it?\nI guess the best way to start is with the stuff that it does well, and it indeed does it incredibly well.\n\nSo whats the game about? You are part of a 3 man(woman)  crew who takes jobs and contracts of the illegal sort. You are a thief so to speak. A highly efficient thief. Not the kind that hides in the shadows and kills stealthly or parkours around the rooftops, but the kind that hacks security defenses, opens tightly locked doors, and deactivates lasers. Yes, you are a hacker.\n\nBut where the games excels in this department over other similar premises, like Watchdogs, is in the way that it makes you feel like a hacker.\nYour biggest asset in this game is the laptop you carry with you and the way the gameplay around it works.\nYou see, you have to manually place the laptop on surfaces and type in the command lines yourself, for example, opening a door will require you to type in door2.open(x), x being the number of seconds it will be open.\nThis might sound tedious and annoying, but I assure it goes a long way to make you feel like a pro doing heists in the fastest time possible. Typing a long line of commands, and seeing the world unfold the way you want it to and reaching your goal perfectly is a great feeling.\n\nYou then will get new gadgets with each subsequent new heist, stuff like a remote bot you have to connect to a small crtv  and type in the inputs you want it to do, or a turret that you have to pitch and move on your laptop.\nThese are all fun gadgets that give promises and foretellings of how complicated the heists will turn out in the future, with the simple idea of having to manage them all at once being a sign of things to come.\n\nAnd this is where my biggest problem lies with this game. It never comes. Those hard puzzles where you have to take everything you learned so far to task and being able to manage every single gadget so you can get the objective and flee undetected do not exist in this game.\n\nEvery heist gives you a new idea and mechanic, only for it to be abandoned in the next heist. There is even one point where the game gives you a heist where you need to control all 3 characters simultaniously to achieve the objective, which is great, only to abandon that idea the next heist, by giving every single ability to one character.\n\nThe only heist where I can say your skills and understanding of the game are truly tested is the phenomenal last level, where you will constantly realize your mistakes and have to restart the level once again to do it just right, and it feels amazing. And then the game ends.\nMy comprehension of how game development works isnt the best, and I understand that this is a one man project. But I expected more from this title, knowing how long it took to be made. \nThere is a Mod section in the menu of the game, and while it makes perfect sense for it to exist, since this seems the kind of puzzle game that put in the hands of talented players could create amazing and incredibly complex levels, looking back at it now that I have finished the game, it just screams \"Lazy\" to me. You need to earn those talented players first, before you ask them to make levels for you.\n\nIts odd, because I absolutely love Portal, a game whose puzzles are very easy and the whole game feels like a tutorial, same as this one. Maybe its because Portal carries itself with its pacing and sense of world, and the amazing character of Glados.\n\nWhich isnt to say that Quadrilateral Cowboy fails in this department. It has such style and aestethic, the kind I absolutely love, and it conveys so much about its characters with just a few short scenes and moments.\nBut unfortunately, it wasnt enough for me. The price it asks is too much, buy this on sale.\nIt feels like the game is struggling between being a narrative experience and a substancial videogame, and while the former is very good, the latter is definitely missing.\n\nIf you value style over substance, then you might enjoy this very short and sweet experience, because the time I spent with it was very enjoyable. But if like me, you expect a slow increase in difficulty and the game demanding more of a player's skills as it goes along, you will not find it here.\nIts almost as if the dev of the game is simply giving you the tools to create a better game, and giving you a tutorial for things to come. If those things do come, I will gladly come back and enter this world once again. But if not, what we have for now feels unfinished.\n\nIm having Superhot flashbacks all over again. That was a game that also had a great premise, ended very fast, and had an absurd price tag. But at least Superhot had an Endless Mode where you could spend hours in if it was your kind of stuff.\nSadly you wont find that kind of extra content here, unless you get into beating the levels again as fast as possible.

Would have loved to see more puzzles with more of that stuff the last half of the game has a smash and grab feel even without raising alrams.\n\nTLDR: PLAY THIS GAME ITS GREAT!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1470069461, "timestamp_updated": 1470069461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24652447": {"recommendationid": "24652447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047525633", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470058066}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u4e86\uff0c\u5f53\u5e74\u770b\u9884\u544a\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u611f\u89c9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u6709\u789f\u4e2d\u8c0d+\u9ed1\u5ba2\u5e1d\u56fd+\u94f6\u7ffc\u6740\u624b\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e5f\u786e\u5b9e\u6709\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u90a3\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6253\u4ee3\u7801\u9ed1\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u5f88\u5e26\u611f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u786e\u5b9e\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4eae\u70b9\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\uff0c\u5c31\u76ee\u524d\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u5efa\u8bae\u5168\u4ef7\u8d2d\u4e70\u3002\u6700\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u5173\u5361\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\uff0c\u5927\u69824~5\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u5c31\u80fd\u641e\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u9664\u4e86\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5173\u8fd8\u7b97\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u96be\u5ea6\u800c\u4e14\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u6240\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8c1c\u9898\u90fd\u4e0d\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6f5c\u529b\u662f\u6709\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5229\u7528\u5404\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u89e3\u8c1c\u7528\u7684\u9053\u5177\u5176\u5b9e\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u5173\u5361\u505a\u7684\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u4e00\u4e9b\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u52a0\u5165\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574a\u6216\u8005\u4f5c\u8005\u81ea\u5df1\u518d\u591a\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u5361\u4f1a\u66f4\u8010\u73a9\u4e00\u4e9b\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5c31\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u5c31\u5728\u4e8e\u5237\u6700\u5feb\u65f6\u95f4\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u7ba1\u600e\u4e48\u8bf4\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u521b\u610f\u548c\u6c1b\u56f4\u8fd8\u6709\u90a3\u4e2a\u8ff7\u4e4b\u6545\u4e8b\u4e3b\u7ebf\u90fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e58\u6c34\u51c6\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u4e5f\u7684\u7684\u786e\u786e\u662f\u786c\u4f24\uff0c\u6709\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u63a8\u8350\u6253\u6298\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e70\u4e00\u4e2a\u73a9\u73a9\u5427\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u73a9\u73a9\u5854\u7f57\u65af\u6cd5\u5219\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u2026\u2026\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1470058790, "timestamp_updated": 1470122009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24651140": {"recommendationid": "24651140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080620830", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470051008}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game.

Some may not find much in the vagueness and lack of explicit exposition, but I quite enjoyed exploring the world and trying to discover what it was about. The world is very clearly different from our own, but it shares enough similarities that it's not completely alien which makes it quite a bit eerie and mysterious.\n\nThe artstyle is very distinctive; lots of low-polygon shapes and flat colors makes it more of a symbolic rather than realistic style. I feel this symbolic artstyle combines very well with the strange world because the familiar symbols and the unfamiliar setting create an interesting and somewhat unsettling contrast. The textures are also very high quality, even insignificant pieces of paper are readable. Some text is so small that even walking right up to it you can't really read it, you have to zoom in even further for the text to become large enough. This high texture quality makes the world feel very crisp and made exploring it more enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay was also good, but it is somewhat lacking in depth. The puzzles were not so hard that they became frustrating, but not too easy either and it felt rewarding to solve the harder missions. I feel like the missions were all well designed in the way they introduced new mechanics and ramped up the difficulty. Some have said the puzzles have a programming element, but that's not really true. There's no conditional logic and very little abstraction, you type commands into a command line and that's it. The lack of depth doesn't show up in the missions themselves, it only become apparent in the game's length. The game can be pretty short if you're decent at puzzle solving and don't take the time to look around you but go straight for the objectives.\n\nIt took me about 4 hours to finish the game, and I spent a good portion of that time doing other stuff than just solving the puzzles. The length doesn't bother me, I had a great time playing the game and I will probably go back to it to try to improve my time on different missions or try different approaches.\n\nI should note that you have the ability to skip every mission if you want to, which I think is a nice feature in case you get stuck on something. There's little narrative exposition in the missions themselves, and you have the ability to explore every world in noclip mode so there's really no penalty to skipping other than missing out on the puzzle itself.\n\nAll in all I think this is a great game. If you like puzzle games this is good. If you like exploring weird settings with unique art this is good.

The theme and the asthetic is great (I'm a big fan of oldschool/retro cyberpunk and sci-fi) and there is a lot of detail to be found. The mechanics seem very interesting (I'm also a fan of games that use a command line interface as one of the primary input methods) and are quite diverse. You have a little hacking device you can plug into datajacks, a cyberdeck (or should I call it a suitecase deck?) which allows you to hack doors and stuff, a little robot you can give commands to and a bunch of other stuff.\nThe main problem I have with the game is: It is not a puzzle game. If I look at those mechanics I think \"puzzle game!\" immediately. But it's not. The challenge of the game is not coming from \"solving\" any logical puzzles. Those are all trivial and very straight forward. Instead you are supposed to complete the different levels as quickly as possible to compete on a leaderboard.\nSo is it a good time attack/speedrun game? I don't think so. Because while the mechanics are interesting and diverse, controling them feels very cluncy (it almost feels like that is on purpose) and are not very fun to use after you get past the \"oh! shiny command line interface!\" hype.\n\nI think this game would have benefitted greatly by being a puzzle game with interesting puzzle design.

Its magical and very customizable, which COULD lead to insanely creative ways to solve the games many levels. Which leads us to the problem: there aren't that many levels, and it feels like the levels were created with only one or two solutions in mind. The levels are so simple, and segmented, so it doesn't feel like there is much synergy. You can't really chain things together outside the moments, you can tell, that you were explicitly supposed to; except for a few occations (and in my opinion are the best moments of the game, really, pure joy) here and there.\n\nIt's like all the effort went into the story and the mechanic, and none into level design. Which is insanely dissapointing, because it would be the best game I've ever played if a little more polish was put into it. \n\nMy number one example for this, is the two person heist mechanic, where you have two characters who you can sync up with your watches, planning each move carefully, but then its over. Boom, 2 or 3 levels and we never see it again. [b]Essentially the tutorial to use this mechanic is the duration you get to enjoy the mechanic. [/b] Really though, thats how the whole game feels, by the time you have really gotten to use the equipment well, you are done and wont play the game again.\n\nYou can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and you can see from my playtime I have loved this game, but it leaves so much to be desired. Most of my time was spent seeing if I could unlock \"the rest of the game\", praying it was hidden.\nIf the dev ever announces that they are going to hire a level designer to make a second story, or just a puzzle mode where you play several levels during the at least 25 year gap between the beginning and end, I will recommend the game.

The story was presented more in a \"find the lore\" approach rather than being cutscene driven (anyone notice those books on hospice care?), each heist level alternates with a shopping or downtime level that you can either explore or just speed through depending on your interest in that.  There was also some care clearly put into making the world very interactive, though this typically amounts to just picking the item up and moving it around. The sticky-note system lets you leave tips & messages for your friends to see whenever they play through a level, akin to the Talos Principle's graffiti except you can actually type whatever you like on the note.  The notes are also small enough in size that someone worried about potential spoilers can avoid zooming in to look at them.\n\nThe gameplay itself has all the right tools for a stand-out puzzle game, though most of the levels are largely \"I know I'm supposed to use this device, lets watch for where I use it\".  By the time you're given all the tools at once and aren't being especially corraled, the game is over.  I ended up with 6.2 hours, and I spent some extra time on certain levels playing around with how smoothly & automated I could make things...building long batch files while in the \"Casing\" mode so I could sail through the non-casing mode with good timing and a few blink commands rather than frequently accessing the deck.

The concepts behind it are great and the execution is enjoyable, but the levels never allow the depth that one would expect from a puzzle game. Every level brings in a new ability and each of those levels is focused on that thing. In other words, every level asks you \"do you know how to use this ability?\" but no level ever delves into the interplay between the abilities. I was always expecting to find a big level with complex puzzles necessitating the use of all of the skills I'd learned so far, but that level never came. Plus, the puzzles aren't that difficult. Most of the time I could easily see what needed to done, and succeeding was just a matter of things out.\n\nBut it's not al bad, because I've enjoyed the experience.

During the breaks between jobs you have the opportunity to learn more about the personalities and histories of the other characters, adding an emotional dimension to the game without using dialogue.\n\nChung has also made an introductory guide for making mod levels for QC to accompany the game and it seems he is planning to update it further to answer questions people are having, which I really appreciate.\n\nMy main complaint is that it feels far too short. I really kept wanting to be able to see more of QC's world after it ended. But overall I truly enjoyed playing it. The high point of the game, for me, was being tasked with making digital copies of the brains of coma patients in a clinic floating in space.", "timestamp_created": 1469853023, "timestamp_updated": 1469853023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24608116": {"recommendationid": "24608116", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997915494", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470101545}, "language": "english", "review": "incredible", "timestamp_created": 1469852798, "timestamp_updated": 1469852798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24606715": {"recommendationid": "24606715", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980269963", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469937355}, "language": "english", "review": "after a long day at work nothing is more cathartic than throwing a computer around the room", "timestamp_created": 1469844202, "timestamp_updated": 1469844202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521856", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24605021": {"recommendationid": "24605021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059826239", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513403212}, "language": "english", "review": "I have since changed my review from negative to positive - despite a few crashes, it wasn't enough to warrant a negative review.

If you know Chung\u2019s work, you know what to expect as far as the \u2018experience\u2019 or flavor. Otherwise, here is a test to gauge if you will like this game. If two of the three apply to you, then I highly recommend you buy it:\n\n1.\tYou have enjoyed other Blendo games, specifically [i]Thirty Flights of Loving[/i].\n2.\tYou enjoy \u2018hacking\u2019 or logic puzzle games such as [i]Duskers[/i] or to a lesser extent [i]TIS-100[/i].\n3.\tYou are a fan of Wes Anderson films, or follow any director (for that matter) that has a very potent flavor or style.\n\nI didn\u2019t mention the price tag, because it still remains to be seen how the Workshop and future updates will change the play content. Two days after release Chung added update 001 which added some cool things. Also to note, the cryptic three digits there. Will there be hundreds of small updates over time? Not sure. [b]Mileage will vary, but if you enjoy the game, there is quite a bit to explore.[/b] It won\u2019t be difficult to get at least 10 hours out of what is here now. Right now, you can experience the storyline (~5 hours), replay with commentary (~2 hours), and then race the high scores or mess with mods (I\u2019m not sure what kind of hours this will add \u2013 likely depends on you).\n\n[i]Essentially, you have a variety of technologies to accomplish \u2018hacking\u2019 based tasks.[/i] The whole thing is played out in 1st person mode, where you solve puzzles by using computer code. The learning curve is nowhere near as steep as others in this genre. In fact, most found the puzzle difficulty underwhelming. I did too, but honestly, it was almost refreshing to be able to finish it without banging my head off the walls for days.\n\nWhile a common complaint is that [i]Quadrilateral Cowboy[/i] is too short, I actually may *slightly* have the opposite feeling. Debatably, what made [i]Thirty Flights of Loving[/i] so magical is how quick of an experience it was. It packed sooo much in, in so little time. Now, [i]Quadrilateral Cowboy[/i] doesn\u2019t wear out its welcome, but I totally understand why the base game length is what it is. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Beautiful Blendo style that throws you into magically wonderful storytelling like no other game can\n+Awesome mix of first person and \u2018hacking\u2019 or logic puzzles\n+The details are often in the simplicity of Chung\u2019s storytelling; the feelings can have so much impact with such minimal graphics/sound/tech\n+Unlike other games in this genre, this title can totally be finished by nearly anyone (instead of just those who have ample experience with logic code)\n+Updates are still being added\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-There are still a few bugs that are being ironed out\n-Some will see the price-to-hour ratio to be a negative; I still say \u2018lets wait and see\u2019, but overall I\u2019m more than happy (I would have spent more, but I\u2019m a huge Blendo fan)\n-The first half of the story and the end was definitely stronger than the later portion of the game; [spoiler]the portion where you enter \u2018team play\u2019 and the bits in outer space were odd and I\u2019m still not sure how it all gels together story-wise[/spoiler]\n-Some of the magic that made [i]Thirty Flights of Loving[/i] was in its brevity; [i]Quadrilateral Cowboy[/i] does not overstay its welcome, but makes me question how length of game plays a role with such potent storytelling\n\nThis was my most anticipated title of 2016. Do I think it is game of the year? Too soon to tell. It certainly lived up to my hype, which says something. [b]If you are an avid indie game fan, this is a must-play. Nobody makes games like Blendo.

Like the rest of the Blendo Games first person catalog, it never wastes your time -- every room of every level is about something, there's no \"filler\" here. Imagine the purity and confidence of Portal 1 (a puzzle game that gracefully knew when to stop) with the visual sensibilities of Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai, and you get QuadCow.\n\nMany of the negative reviews here are going to complain about how the game doesn't escalate into a hugely over-complicated multi-part multi-agent mission that requires you to engineer 100s of lines of code with 20 different remote devices... but I think it was a wise decision to avoid this same trap that nearly every coding puzzle game falls into.\n\nThis is not a programming game about complexity -- rather, it's about ingenuity. \n\nThis is not about designing a giant system with 100 moving parts, and Portal would not have been a better game with 8 portals. Instead, this game is about using the right command at the right time at the right place. (If you know what you're doing, you can complete many of the levels in 30-60 seconds. But the first time you try, it'll take you 15-30 minutes.)\n\nConceptually, QuadCow is about re-imagining the act of coding. Is coding a slow crawl of engineering, or can it be a light and delicate performance, like cold water or a kiss?\n\nIf you want TIS-100, go play TIS-100. But in this game, YOU ARE A COWBOY, NOT AN ASSEMBLY PROGRAMMER.

It's exactly what you would expect from playing Blendo's previous standalone 3D games Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving. It's longer and grander than both of those, but it shares many of their traits, such as Blendo's unique storytelling methods and his great worldbuilding, using techniques like magic realism and implied plot. The gameplay is more focused in this game than in his others (they didn't have much in terms of puzzles or things like that) and it adds to the game significantly. The hacking mechanics are very well done and it's very fun to use all the gadgets. \n\nThe only flaws with this game are that the missions are linear puzzles without much replayability (actually not any replayability at all unless you feel like getting more immersed in the gorgeous world or want to go for a better time on the arbitrary leaderboards) and the many crashes experienced during play. Blendo is, however, working progressively and diligently to eliminate bugs and crashes so by time anyone reads this, the crashes will probably be fixed. \n\nOverall I feel it was worth the $20, but if you want a longer game (it's about 4 hours long), or expect sandboxey levels ala deus ex and an in-your-face story, then you probably won't enjoy it. This game can be summed up as 30 flights of loving multiplied by 10 with keyboard hacking ala command prompt and a couple neat gadgets (remote controlled robot, autoturret, springboard-type launcher) so if that doesn't sound appealing, don't buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1469722244, "timestamp_updated": 1469726978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24576681": {"recommendationid": "24576681", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966468553", "num_games_owned": 880, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469650839}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic experience, albeit a short one.  While the other reviewers are correct in that the game ends before it truly begins, the core mechanics are solid.  It is clear that the fine folks at Blendo have assembled a fantastic set of building blocks, they simply need to do some more building with them.  \n\nAs I said, the mechanics are solid.  Using the deck to interact with both items in the level and subsequent tech feels fantastic.  The alarm timers are a nice solution to the problem of giving the user too much direct control - if a door or laser is opened for more than a (visibly posted) length of time, an alarm sounds.

Each map introduces a new puzzle type, usually along with a new item, which is then used as the main puzzle on that map. Then you'll move on to a new puzzle type - usually with enough hand-holding that you never really need to think about the solution. Solve a puzzle once and you've solved it forever: the puzzles don't evolve, they don't get any more difficult, they never get revisited with a different toolset. My greatest difficulty in the game was in fact figuring out where I was supposed to go next and not how to solve each puzzle.\n(That and the bugs, which forced me to quit and restart the game again and again as game objects glitched out and became impossible to interact with.)\nThe really frustrating thing about this is that, as I said at the beginning, it had the potential to be [i]great[/i]. Each individual puzzle element is clever, creative, and hints at the ingenious puzzles it could be used for - but never is.\n\nStylistically speaking, it is also one of the most confused games I have ever seen: \"Let's do an early '80s setting! No, let's do a William Gibson-style cyberpunk setting! No, let's do steampunk!\". It has the feel of someone in the 30th century being asked to portray hacker life in the late 20th century without any research - and not in a charming way. The same goes for the graphics, which mix extreme minimalism with fancier effects in a way that feels less like a deliberate design choice than a way to save money on artists.\n\nA 4-hour game for 20 bucks is always hard to recommend.

I felt myself grow attached to my group of friends,  though a single word was never spoken. \n\nThe \"Hacking\" mechanics were easy to use, and even easier to learn. Unlike a majority of well known hacking games, you actually type commands, rather than 'click' them. Don't expect these commands to come in handy in real life, but in the context of the game it felt empowering and, well, awesome.  The gadgets were simply F***ing awesome, and some of the 'abilities' you pick up later on are pretty cool too. My only complaint was that the game ended feeling too short, even though in truth I had played for 7 hours. I suppose that is the hall mark of fun, though. Time flies when you're having it. \n\nThe technology had a retro feel to it, which was, to put it simply, delicious. I've never had more fun typing on a clunky old keyboard, inserting cassette tapes, or hooking a telephone line to my laptop. \n\nIf you haven't played this yet, do.

The rest is either not used at all or simply taken away from the player, sometimes for 1 mission and other times forever.\nBecause of all this, the game became way too easy later on. Instead of having puzzles to solve, you just go through the motions. Click this, click that, go here, go there. Some timer here and there. No challenge whatsoever. Not to mention you can 'cheat' your way though a lot of the levels.\nThe final mission tries to bring some stuff toghether but it's just not enough.\nI played it again with the developer commentary on and he talks about world building a lot but the story didn't grab me at all so it's hard for me to care about the game world. In the end I felt like the story was very basic, obscure and just patched up with some 'gags' here and there.\nI thought this was going to be a great game, but it turned out rather bleak.\nI was going to say it was too short (4h is pretty much all you get), but that might have made it better here. At least I didn't get bored of it before the end.\nI liked previous games from Blendo but this one was a huge disappointment.\nAll in all I don't think it was worth the price of $20.\n\nEDIT: Since this review got so much votes I feel like I need to make some things clear.

If you want to compare it to something, think Thief and Uplink meshed together.\n\nAs with all Chung's games, it's got a quirky, simplistic aesthetic that lends more focus to the narrative than the environments. The game is set during a retro-futuristic 1980 with airships, space elevators and oversized ventilation shafts.\n\nThe basic gameplay consists of lugging around a chunky Osbornesque \"portable\" computer and using it to hack into security systems to open doors and windows, turn off laser grids and cameras, and so on. The computer lets you set up sequences of commands to create small scripts, optimally letting you simply walk through a building while doors and alarms toggle around you. I'd loved if this concept had been explored more, since only the last mission starts to approach the complexity I expected. [spoiler]The most complex thing you do consists of toggling four lasers after eachother with the little walking robot[/spoiler].\n\nI chalk this down to the game being too short. Chung's games tend to go in the \"short and sweet\" category, and narratively Quadrilateral Cowboy works perfectly in its three-to-four hour playtime. Mechanically, I was left wanting more.\n\nThe story is fun, the characters are quirky and characterful (despite not saying anything), the gadgets have great potential that isn't fully realized, and there's apparently mod support out of the gate (makes sense considering the engine is open-source).\n\nI tihnk the mods might make this game really great.

D\u00e9j\u00e0 gagnant de l\u2019IndieCade 2013, Quadrilateral Cowboy se faisait attendre depuis 2012 d\u00e9j\u00e0, cumulant les r\u00e9compenses et les bons retours suite \u00e0 une premi\u00e8re version du jeu. Il faut dire que le pitch donnait plus qu\u2019envie, le jeu \u00e9tant d\u00e9crit comme une aventure cyberpunk bas\u00e9 autour de braquages et d\u2019hacking, le tout dans la m\u00eame veine que Gravity Bone et Thirty Flights of Loving.\n[...]\nQuadrilateral Cowboy suit ainsi les aventures \u00e0 travers ce monde r\u00e9tro-futuriste (le tout se d\u00e9roulant \u00e0 la fin du vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle) de trois femmes qui, suite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec de leur entreprise, se tournent vers le hacking et le braquage pour gagner leur vie. Je m\u2019en tiendrais l\u00e0 en ce qui concerne l\u2019histoire m\u00eame et les d\u00e9tails, je pense que c\u2019est des choses qui m\u00e9ritent vraiment d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9couvertes \u00e0 travers la narration si particuli\u00e8re et passionnante propre aux jeux de Blendo Games. Et surtout, la narration visuelle \u00e9tant souvent plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de laisser la libert\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ce qui se d\u00e9roule, j\u2019aimerais \u00e9viter d\u2019influencer d\u2019\u00e9ventuels (futurs) joueurs. Les braquages se pr\u00e9sentent donc sous forme de puzzles avec des objectifs simples \u2013 non sans rappeler Gravity Bone \u2013 et devant se r\u00e9soudre gr\u00e2ce au hacking, tapant sur un vieux laptop des commandes pour contr\u00f4ler les divers gadgets que l\u2019on obtient au fur et \u00e0 mesure du jeu. Quadrilateral Cowboy se renouvelle sans arr\u00eat, les diff\u00e9rents niveaux s\u2019encha\u00eenant sans se ressembler. Le jeu arrive, de par l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de son gameplay et de sa narration, \u00e0 installer une certaine routine chez le joueur, soutenue par les \u201cinterludes\u201d entre chaque braquage, plus orient\u00e9s exploration et tranches de vie. On ne s\u2019ennuie alors jamais et, selon qu\u2019on pr\u00e9f\u00e8re l\u2019exploration et la d\u00e9couverte \u00e0 travers une narration fascinante ou bien le hacking et ses puzzles (ou les deux, \u00e9videmment !), le jeu contentera autant le joueur. D\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, on peut passer toutes les missions ou jouer en mode \u201ctouriste\u201d, permettant de d\u00e9bloquer toutes les portes. De l\u2019autre, la plupart des sc\u00e8nes d\u2019exploration peuvent se finir en quelques secondes si l\u2019on n\u2019est pas curieux ou int\u00e9ress\u00e9 au point de fouiller partout, et l\u2019on peut rapidement acc\u00e9der \u00e0 chaque niveau depuis le menu principal pour optimiser et am\u00e9liorer son score.\n[...]\nQuadrilateral Cowboy est une merveille que je ne saurais trop vous conseiller, culmination de toutes les bonnes choses que l\u2019on pouvait retrouver dans Gravity Bone et Thirty Flights of Loving coupl\u00e9es \u00e0 un gameplay particuli\u00e8rement efficace et passionnant. Je ne saurais lui trouver des d\u00e9fauts, si ce n\u2019est quelques crashs frustrants et un menu principal parfois confus. Quadrilateral Cowboy, c\u2019est une narration visuelle fascinante et captivante, au croisement entre le gameplay, le r\u00e9cit et l\u2019ambiance audio-visuelle. Une narration que l\u2019on ne peut retrouver que dans du jeu vid\u00e9o, puisque les choix narratifs sont induits autant par la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur que par les contraintes techniques, les choix de gameplay ou les observations de playtests, comme en t\u00e9moignent les commentaires du d\u00e9veloppeur incorpor\u00e9s au jeu. Quadrilateral Cowboy, c\u2019est encore un jeu vid\u00e9o prouvant que le m\u00e9dium peut \u00eatre source de v\u00e9ritables \u0153uvres d\u2019art (pour ceux qui n\u2019ont pas suivi ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es !), sans pour autant laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019aspect ludique.", "timestamp_created": 1469467632, "timestamp_updated": 1469488255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619580", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24521852": {"recommendationid": "24521852", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998465023", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474688534}, "language": "english", "review": "Brendon Chung is the Quentin Tarantino of videogames.\n\nBrendon has impeccable taste and you can tell he devours all kinds of cinema, literature, and games looking for that special \"something\" in all of them.

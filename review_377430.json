I played through every ending. Upon realizing this game was on Steam, I played long enough with a copy of the game on here that Steam would let me write a review.\nI'm not entirely sure if this is meant to be a horror game. If so, it fails. If it is meant to have a creepy atmosphere, it fails. Viva Pinata, an adorable game, has creepier moments than Who Is Mike. Cute dating sims have better ren.py menu customaziation. \nThe dialouge does not create a dark atomosphere. The mock-anime art style and expressions are laughable. \nTo potential players, if you are looking for a dark, creepy mystery, don't play this game. If you want to laugh at a game that fails at what it is trying to do, go ahead and play Who Is Mike.\nTo the devolopers, I understand that you did try. The art shows effort. However, I reccommend harder lines, and moving away from the anime-type expressions. The dialouge needs to be darker. The 4th ending made me check if this was a PARODY of horror games. I understand this is supposed to have comedy elements, but the dialouge is so torn between genres, every joke and every creepy moment falls flat. While I'm no expert at ren.py myself, I know how customizable the menus and dialogue boxes are. There's several potential ways to have a cool looking menu, such as making it look like broken or shattered glass. I also reccomend chosing a genre, creepy mystery or comedy mystery. [spoiler] There's a lot more potential with the player as the fake Mike. [/spoiler] I'm sure the devolopers can make a better game than this.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m just going to write a simple summary first, before I make my attempt:\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\nComplex and fulfilling story that draws out real emotions in the player\nRealistic character development\nMany, many plot-twists that tie in together perfectly\nBeautiful art and mood-appropriate surroundings\nMost likely the best soundtrack I have ever come across\nLeaves an impact and a lot of thought in the reader\nStruggles and dilemmas that are not presented cheaply, nor unrealistically\nAuto-saving during choices and a lot of save spaces that can be locked so that you cannot overwrite them by accident\nExtras\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\nNo \u201cskip only read\u201d option, although in this game that\u2019s not really a problem\n\n  Now, let\u2019s start at the beginning. When I first opened this game, the first thing I noticed was how the art and the original soundtrack worked perfectly to create an almost palpable atmosphere. That, together with the writing style, has set a mood so intense I could literally [i]feel[/i] all the emotions the characters were going through. \n  There was one thing I was disappointed with at first - the backgrounds. At the beginning of the game, it just didn\u2019t seem to fit to me - everything had so much effort put into it, and so the background art looked simple and out of place in contrast. It even birthed a faint feeling of doubt in me. But as I delved deeper into the mansion and its story, somehow all of that transformed - the backgrounds were still done the same way, but I didn\u2019t mind anymore, I actually loved it. That\u2019s when I realized the choice to use those backgrounds was definitely the right one. They were perfect - didn\u2019t show too much, just enough to hint on something deep within you and let your mind paint the picture.\n  Visual novel is a perfect fit for this story. I have read a lot of books that could be turned into visual novels, and a lot visual novels that could be turned into books. This one is unique - it works with everything it has, and uses every aspect of storytelling and each piece of what makes visual novels a genre, and ties them together. Words, pictures, sounds, emotions and assumptions all work in tandem to create an experience unlike any other, and really suck you into the lives and fates of the game\u2019s characters.\n  Speaking of characters, I was surprised at how well they have been handled. Each and every one of them feels like a real person - one that you cannot just love or hate, but one that you can have conflicting feelings about or even change your mind about completely without forgetting their previous transgressions.\n  Without spoiling anything, I also have to praise the developer on how they handled gender and identity issues. It can be very tricky to tackle these things, especially in certain time-periods and settings, but they didn\u2019t seem to struggle at all. I believe that players who have ever experienced gender dysphoria - or really any kind of dysphoria about their body - will really appreciate that.\n  I cannot but recommend this game to everyone. If you dislike reading, this game might be a bit too tedious for you, but if you enjoy books and/or visual novels, do not hesitate.

The music is superb and almost ethereal in nature. I'd describe it as the \"funeral music of the bastard sons of fallen angels.\" The art style also stands out among other visual novels.

Why does the maid insist on taking you through the house, opening doors that reveal tragic stories that seem ripped out of the pages of plays, fables, and cautionary tales? What connects the people in these stories that span hundreds of years? Most importantly, who are you, anyway? \n\nFata Morgana is a story about how grief, hatred, and vengeance create cages not just for your enemies, but also for you yourself. It's also a story about the ways in which ignorance and complacency can warp even the most well-meant and sefless acts into tragedy.  It's a story that gives you plenty of reasons to hate a large chunk of its cast, but then challenges you to think about their actions and motivations from other perspectives.  It's full of graphic depictions of violence, but it treats difficult subjects with a surprising degree of care and sensitivity. It's a bit of a hard sell for the first few hours if you're not interested in the first few doors' stories, but there's a reason why the maid is showing you them, and it's well worth sticking with the game and seeing in retrospect why it was important to watch them.  \n\nThere are no \"routes\" in this game, though there are a few bad ends, mostly clustered around the final 5-6 hours, all of which are short and result from obviously bad choices.  It's easy to load your most recent auto-save, select the right answer, and move on; you don't explore alternative possibilities so much as watch as one long story unfolds. The game also telegraphs most of its big revelations well in advance, but the real pleasure of Fata Morgana (aside from its excellent soundtrack) lies in watching as the frame of reference for the game's events and characters gets bigger and bigger, and in seeing how the significance (and even sometimes the reality!) of its revelations changes in the process.  \n\nI have only two major pieces of criticism about FM. The first is that the art ranges from \"gorgeous and perfectly fitting\" to \"so anatomically incorrect that it's distracting\": some of its character portraits are noticeably worse than others. Regardless, the art is unique and stylish, so I can't fault it too much. The second bit of criticism is that this VN doesn't always do a great job of establishing its settings and character voices. There's a happy medium between having characters speak in \"thee\"s and \"thou\"s and going off on long tangents about medieval religion and politics, and having them speak like modern teens in casual conversation while only vaguely sketching out the background circumstances of their lives and beliefs. Most of the time, FM gets the balance right, but the times when it doesn't are immersion-breaking and they detract from the storytelling; luckily, I was too invested in the characters and their stories to care very much.\n\ntl;dr: One of my favourite visual novels.

I underestimated visual novels my whole life. Never have I thought i would actually find a visual novel that has no romantic choices routes/school/everything is fine/harem/etc; rather i found a suspense, thriller, horror and the most amazing love story filled with tragedies that all come together as one.\n\nConsidering this is filled with tragedies, do you wonder if the whole game ends up in tragedy too? Well, the answer is [spoiler]No. It actually is HEA.[/spoiler].\n\nFantastic characterisation, atmosphere, ost and most beautiful and realistic CGs - and there are many.\n\nThe story and the plot is quite linear. The choices though provide other endings including bad ends and normal ends and there are in general 7 normal endings, 1 true end and and around ten or so bad ends (forgot how many were there). But all of them were were interesting to go through so I recommend that you get all endings!\n\nOfc the story begins with protagonist - the Master of the witch's house - trying to find out about themselves, because of the amnesia they suffered. They are greeted by the Maid, a mysterious woman who claims that showing them the past of the previous residents - and their tragedies - will be the key to the protagonist's memories. Because the Maid has seen and experienced all of their tragedies herself.\n\nBut are all stories true? Or is something amiss? If a tragedy is to beautiful to be true... is it true, or is it a fabrication?\n\nThis is a story of love that knows no time, no bounds, and that no matter how much you suffered, one day you are going to find someone or something that will make you wanna live with all of your heart.\n\nThis games also features one of the rarest things i have come across in media, and that is [spoiler] intersex [/spoiler] character, which is amazing, because the representation was handled so well (in my opionion at least).", "timestamp_created": 1511962405, "timestamp_updated": 1512564819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544807", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37914185": {"recommendationid": "37914185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026000752", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511933876}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love music, play this game.

To say the story 'has layers' is a vast understatement, and yet to get much more specific would risk spoiling the effect for first time players.

As I mentioned, the tale is not always an easy read and takes some extremely dark, intense and uncomfortable turns, but the characters are so well fleshed-out that you come to feel truly invested in their trials and triumphs. So yeah; perseverance required, and moments of levity are well-earned.\n\nI do have some minor reservations about the writing - the decision to represent laughter phonetically (such as 'Hehehe') detracts from the atmosphere on occasion by invoking more a feeling of online messenger chat than character dialogue, but I got used to it. Most of my other complaints turned out to be the game messing with me.\n\nFinally, the music and overall sound design is fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere.

story knows how to stir up emotions in you with characters who are more complex than they let out.\nThe dialogues in the game made me feel happy, sad and romance as the story is written convincingly and paced in a way that you don't get bored with it.\n\nThe voiced soundtrack in this game is also amazing and another strength besides the quality writing, it makes you feel the moment of care-free childhood joy, or what else the story brings to you.\n\nAs you can see, the story is feature-length and can take over 20 hours to complete unlike normal story-driven games nowadays which just feel too compact length-wise.

It just engulfes the reader into a world of twirling despair, suffering, pain and emotional distress.\nWhile the gist of the story revolves around the concept of \"love\", it is uncontrovertibly packaged with themes for every taste: physical abuse, schizophrenia, deconstruciton of character through psychological torture, carnage, suicide, homosexuality, revenge and forgiveness... the list could go on and on for quite a while.\nThe central subject in Fata Morgana, however you look at it, is Pain. Wether physical or mental, detailed in its own description or subtly hinted at, it's the motive that sets every action in motion.\nSo if you think you're getting into a regular novel, think twice, and be prepared to suffer. No character has a complete right to his\\her own action, and the whole ordeal is filled with grey morality and black-stained paths which you'll necessarily have to cross at some point.\nI have deeply enjoyed the narration, it managed to capture my interest until the last chapter, and successfully immersed me, also thanks to the amazing musical score. Graphics are really simple, with raw backgrounds taken from photos, the resulution is very low, but it didnt diminish the overall value of this product.\n\nAs it stands, I will give this novel a satisfactory 8.5 \\ 10, very solid constructoin, fantastic use of plot twists and turns, however, if I had to address one big complaint, during the last quarter of the novel the narration dragged way too much, and the ending was very anime-like, something many may have appreciated, but given the quality up until that point, I was personally a bit disappointed.

It allows you to empathize and fall in love with the people, understanding their motivations. \n\nThis is a story about what it means to be human, what our personal experiences and emotions can drive us to do.

I wish I paid full price for it. That's how much I came to enjoy it. Afterwards, I went ahead and I bought the game full-price for a friend of mine and I'm currently forcing her to play it. Yes, I said force. That's relevant and I have to be honest with anyone interested in getting this game: you're gonna have to push through the first couple of chapters, but it is absolutely worth it. \n\nThe first chapter is the weakest in the entire game by far. I found the story to be incredibly boring, predictable, and there was one soundtrack that played through most of it that made me want to claw my eyes out. I have no idea how I got through that first chapter and it's a miracle I did, but holy FUCK am I glad I stuck with it.\n\nLiterally everything is a big improvement from that chapter. By the fourth tragedy I was pretty sold like, \"Yeah, that was neat and I'm kind of sad but also intrigued.\" And then the game takes a MASSIVE turn for the better. And then I'm bawling (not clawing) my eyes out because that's what I do when I have feelings about sad and happy things alike.\n\nTL;DR: You'll suffer the tragedy of an awful start to a VN and then you'll suffer through the characters' tragedies because your heart is breaking again and again and just when you think it's done making you cry (in a good way) it'll break it again.

Oh boy was I wrong. This game deceives you at so many levels, that you begin to question wether anyhting you see is actually real in this game. even the characters sprites seem to be an unreliable source. Some concepts that we normally take for granted in vn's (like being able to read the last few lines again by scrolling up) are used here as  means of subtle foreshadowing. It's probably also worth it to read it a second time (haven't done that myself yet), because the foreshadowing is just that good.

From the stunning visuals to the extensive and beautiful soundtrack to the emotional twists and turns the story takes you on.\n\nIf you enjoy visual novels i implore you pick this up. I was dubious at first because it was a bit expensive and i expected the story to be quite trite, Im glad i was wrong. The writing isnt amazing, but nor is it horrible to the point of distraction, it servees its purpose to get the point across and thats really all you can ask for.  Obviously cant reveal too much about what makes the story amazing as it would ruin the experience. I had a few moments when i thought i was near the end and there couldnt possible be more reveals and every time i was shocked and delighted about what came next. \n\nThe music is easily the best ive heard for a VN, and some tracks will probably make it to the top of my all time gaming OST favourites. Each track fits the elements of the stories they are used for, blending prose and visuals together perfectly. My personal favourites are the tracks used in the later half of the game, which are just so haunting and emotional.\n\nOverall, please buy this game!

The stories themselves were akin to dark takes on fables or fairy tales and not particularly surprising to any genre reader, but would be passable if an editor had actually tightened up the prose.

Anyway.....\n\nWithout spoilers, the game in general has a very \"goth\" overlay. Arc one, in particular displays something you'd think to find in a work by one of the Bronte sisters. Arc two is somewhat Lovecraftian. Arc three is a general throwback, and Arc four quite literally centers around curses, crusaders, and, of course, a massive \"haunted\" mansion.\n\nI think I can say that the real \"story\" begins after the first four \"doors\"/arcs. It does feature some content that may offend or put off certain individuals, but hey, that's how many decent \"tragedy\" stories go. \n\nThe characters are all pretty well written. There were a few I couldn't stand, but that doesn't mean they weren't interesting in their own right. By the end of the VN, I felt I could truly emphasize with a majority of the characters, and actually found myself rooting for the individuals who had been portrayed as being awful humans. \n\nThe soundtrack, of course, is brilliant. You can purchase the OST for $11.99 on Steam at this time, and I do plan on doing just that. Anything to support the creators. \n\nThis is one of the best VNs I have ever read.

They had a sort of painting aesthetic, and for the most part, pleasant to look at.\n\nOverall:\nThe House in Fata Morgana is fairly long (it took me about 36 hours to complete), and has a fairly dark story with likable, relateable characters. The few choices you have to make throughout the game are simple, and make sense. I had no technical issues on my end, but I think the game started out in windowed mode (which was annoying)\n\ntldr;\nI'd rate the game an 8.5 out of 10, but I'm pretty bad at making reviews.

Repetition, the worst crime a writer can commit, repetition is not good and it should be minimized, if it's required (different perspective from different characters), it should be done in such a different way as not to look like repetition.\n2. Screaming, moaning, and other random sounds doesn't transition well to the written form, instead of doing AAAAAAAAAAAs, author is way better of telling what a certain character feels, that's what literature is for.\n3. Characters are so one dimensional and shallow that they look like dolls with horrible stories for the most part.

Interminable fussing over every little detail, on and on and on.\n5. There is not enough going on for it being as long as it is.\n6.

I can see some people liking this game a lot, but not me.\n\n1. The story is not that good\nThe mystery in the story is forced, there are too many pointless word-plays in the story, once, cool, twice nice, trice? It gets old. I do not want to go into more details because I will end up spoiling the story. But for multiple times in the story, it goes like this. \n\nA man is stabbed by a knife, you and your police buddies are going around crazy trying to find the murder weapon. Some random dude holding an apple came in and he was immediately arrested. Why? Because he was holding a knife and the knife's name is apple.\n\nWhat is the point of telling a story in this manner?\n\n2. The music is distracting\nBackground music for most parts of the story is good, but for some other parts, such as first half of chapter 1, it is insufferably noisy and distracting. I am looking for a relaxing time to read a book, but I cant read with the sound of a woman jibber jabbering in actual Japanese. Like do you listen to gangster rap when you read books?\n\n3. Art style\nArtwork in this game looks great in selected screenshots, but its overall quality is meh. For example, the sprite for one of the characters when she lowers her head and smile in chapter 1 is outright bad. \n\n4. The cult following\nThis game seems to be a perfect game to its fanbase that is immune to all criticism. In the comment section there are people describing how they want to have sex with a 50 year old woman (you know what i am talking about :D) just because I am openly saying I do not like this game.\n\nI stopped in the middle of chapter 2 and I really do not have the will to continue anymore. But because of all the forced mysteries in the novel, I went online and checked on the plot, just to realize how stupid the story telling is. Note here I am not saying the story is bad. Oh it is not bad, it is not good either. I would describe the story as a bunch of cliche classic tear dropping stories twisted together. It is the story telling that is really bad. \n\nBefore you purchase this game, go to youtube and at least check out the story of the first 2 chapters, which is like 1/3 of the actual game. You will know what I mean by \"forced mystery\".\n\nAnd btw, fanboys, it is not a valid argument telling people \"you have no right to review this game if you have not finished it.\" \n\nWell, this game is too bad for me to want to continue, and that is the whole point of my review.

great story.  This is a visual novel in it's most literal sense: It is essentially a novel with illustrations and music.  There are very few choices to make, and other than bad ends they don't have any real effect.  Instead, the game focuses on a well-developed single story path.\n\nAnd it succeeds with that story.  \"Tragic\" cannot be overstated, some of these characters go through some very nasty stuff.  The more light moments are well done too.  Giselle in particular has a lot of funny banter with another character during the happier moments.  It also does a great job with plot twists/revelations.  On more than a few occasions I thought I had things figured out and had the rug pulled out from under me.  And all of the twists don't turn the story into a mess.  Having played to the end, I look back at the game and it does make sense, I see how it's all put together, what the rules were, and what everyone was trying to do, and it works.\n\nRecommended.", "timestamp_created": 1497817681, "timestamp_updated": 1497817681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32527418": {"recommendationid": "32527418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035898856", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511666245}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most heart-wrenching VNs I've ever read, and I've wept big \"babby\" tears through CLANNAD, G-Senjou no Maou, Steins;Gate, and plenty of others.

The music, visual effects, artwork and writing all blend together into a truly emotional tale that I couldn't get out of my mind until the end. And a thanks to all staff who worked on bringing this game's truly excellent localization to steam!\n\nNow while I'll say I enjoyed it immensely, I do highly encourage inspecting the content warnings before purchasing this game, even if you don't usually do that sort of thing. Not because this game gets extremely graphic, but a lot of its topics can be very hard-hitting and tough to swallow, particularly if you relate to them in some form. I appreciate the seriousness of the subjects it discusses, and the respect with which it discussed them, but there were times I had to take a deep breath or a break. \n\nThe House in Fata Morgana is a tale I'm grateful I was able to experience, and one I'll likely revisit one day.

I won't actually spoil a thing, but please believe me when I say that the price of the game is well-worth the content.  Most everyone has said why better than I could, but my personal experience is that this is a game that has a way that forces you to get in touch with your heart in ways you weren't expecting. It takes certain tropes and spins them around. It makes you think in different ways. It is painful.  It tells you there isn't always one answer.Some things can't change, but also, some things CAN. \n\nIt's a game that genuinely understands the human emotions, and if you can think you can handle it, please try it out.\n\nWhich by the way, the content warnings exist because there are some really dark and traumatic scenes in the game! I actually commend the company for providing proper content warnings because this does have a lot of distressing content! Some of the content even contains spoilers (which they do warn for), but they're not afraid to lay it all out to make sure fans know what they're getting into. That care that they have for the audience without needing a push for it is great.  \n\nAnd also, from what I've seen, I think they handled this content with care while also not romanticizing any of it which I GREATLY appreciate. It's painful, but it drives the point of the game home. I can only comment on part of the game because I don't have personal experience with all of this content myself, perhaps those with similar experiences will disagree? But so far from what I have seen, everyone seems to agree that with such sensitive subject matter, it really was done tastefully.\n\nThe artwork by Moyataro is also beautiful and fitting for the story (I REALLY love the faces especially holy cow), and the music is simple but beautiful and if some of the songs don't get stuck in your head then you're stronger than I am, lol. I don't normally buy game soundtracks cuz I don't listen to instrumental but I plan to buy this one asap. Also this VN is LONG. ITS 30 HOURS LONG. It might not be a \"game\" but it's LITERALLY 30 HOURS OF TEXT and that's me being a really fast reader okay. I'm telling you, it's worth the money!\n\nThis game is just done with so much care and especially LOVE. The original company and the translation team both have put so much effort! You can feel it! I could write three essays on this game in like two days if I wanted to. I wish I could talk about my favorite parts of the game and truly explain the beauty of what this company created. But I want you all to enjoy the game for yourself, and have your own journey to form your own thoughts and opinions along the way.\n\nBUY THIS GAME.

Every once in a while, however, I play (or in this case really, read) something that just utterly exceeds all of my expectations. Not to sound too arrogant, but seeing as how I've played many hundreds upon hundreds of games, this is harder and harder for a game to do for me. [i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i] is a visual novel that, even now (almost a full year after completing it), I have a hard time letting go of.\n\n[i]Fata Morgana[/i] is essentially a tragic love story that spans several centuries, intertwining the fates of numerous characters. It is difficult to say more than that, because this story has a myriad of twists, turns, and story subverts that even jaded ole me didn't see. What starts as an innocent looking game with a very unique art style (at least for Japanese visual novels) quickly transforms into...well, something else. The game delves into a myriad of very deep, dark, and tragic subject matters. While knowing what's in store is not truly a spoiler, some may prefer to be surprised. Thus, I will list the subjects the game covers in spoilers, and discuss each of them briefly:\n\nYou are in for a story that covers:\n\n[spoiler]- Incest\n\nThis is not done in a way that most Japanese media might seem to portray it. It's not covered for very long, but what's there is very effective.\n\n- Sociopathy/psychosis\n\nA truly deep dive on what sociopaths experience can be found in this tale. It's probably the most objective look at what drives the darkness in the hearts of humanity.\n\n- Sexual Assault (I wanted to use the stronger term but it seems to be censored)\n\nThis particular subject will be very difficult for some to read. It is, however, executed with extreme realism and utmost respect. The build up and aftermath are truly haunting; it is not a plot device, used for vindicative reasons, or there to be tacky; rather, it is all in service to the overall theme of the story. Specifically, the focus is not on the vile act, but the mental scars thereafter. (As a side note, the author of this VN is a woman. Without that perspective, it would be impossible to write a story like this).\n\n- Body dysmorphia\n\nOnce again, this will be very difficult to read for some, but as someone who has never nor can never experience such a terrible thing, my heart literally ached. It's perhaps the most realistic and convincing depiction I've ever seen in media, along with every consequence of the subject.[/spoiler]\n\nIt covers these very heavy, very important topics and more, with exceeding respect and tonally correct realism. Honestly, this bittersweet tragedy devastated me, and I empathized greatly with the characters. For a company that usually localizes pornographic games, MangaGamer did an absolutely outstanding job translating this game into English. The text volume is daunting, yet the text remains superbly written on a high level - with basically no grammatical errors. This game puts most other Visual Novels (barring a few) - with their tropes and cookie-cutter scenarios - to great shame. The characters are all very human and not a single one of them lacks a flaw. It is an adult, mature story - I would certainly not recommend it for a younger audience.\n\nNot to be too cliche, but Fata Morgana shows us what Visual Novels could be, if they weren't wrapped up genre stereotypes and an otaku-pandering market. Though I found myself enjoying the illustrations, I feel that the story would have been done better justice as a traditional novel - though it would be quite a lengthy one. Player choices are very few, so not much would be lost in translation. It would be much easier to get my friends to read it, that's for sure.\n\nDespite the very heavy subject matter and depressing, gothic storyline, the game ends with a very realistic, satisfying conclusion. Without a doubt the best visual novel I've ever played and one of the best stories I've ever read, period. It took me a while to choose between the excellent [i]Steins;Gate[/i] and this as my favorite, but this one wins out as the overall better tale. \n\nI have few minor complaints. The pacing can drag on and on and on, similar to the latter books in the [i]A Song of Ice and Fire[/i] series (where every detail is exhausted), and the art can vary between being pretty good and pretty bad. Additionally - and also as a bit of a heads up - the first four chapters are written much...differently...then the rest of the game. Without giving too much away, you could consider those an extended prologue of sorts - the 'quality' of the writing quadruples in short order, despite it being...'lower'...on purpose. \n\nOther than all that, if you are a fan of intriguing stories draped in human realism, then I highly recommend you scroll back up and hit that 'Add to Cart' button.

If you are a fan of visual novels you owe it to yourself to buy this game. It is undoubtedly one of the best VNs on Steam. I had my doubts, as the First Door is not really the best of introductions (and Mell and Nellie are my least favorite characters by far), from the Second Door on (until the somewhat draggy third act) it is completely captivating. \n\nPROS \n-Powerful, unique, and emotional storyline with great writing. It's not the deepest or most philosophical thing you'll ever read, but it is rich, involving, and full of twists and turns. It really has a way of making you feel for the characters.\n-Gorgeous soundtrack. Other reviewers and the Steam tags attest to this, but really, it is (except for one or two annoying tracks that play whenever Nellie comes around) \n-Fantastic art and character design \n-Dark, rich atmosphere \n\nCONS \n-Draggy third act---at least for me. I plowed through the rest of the game, but when I hit the point [spoiler]when Michel travels the past to try and prevent Morgana's murder[/spoiler] I ground to the halt, and it took me a month to get through. Maybe it's just my dislike of Nellie and Mell manifesting. But don't let that deter you too much; if you can plow through the morass, the reward is more than worth it, and the climax is amazing. \n-Somewhat clumsy introduction. The extended \"prologue\" of the game begins with a series of 3 (technically 5) different vignettes. While I found the second and third extremely captivating (especially the third), the first didn't exactly keep me glued to my seat. Luckily I'm a fast reader and managed to make it through in around 45 minutes, but for a slower reader it might be a bit of a slog. Still, the rest of the game makes up for this hiccup. \n-Minor historical inaccuracies. This probably will not bother 99% of players, and didn't really bother me that much, but I did notice. For instance, stained glass was not yet invented in the 11th century, and it also would've been unlikely that [spoiler]Michel would've received a frame landscape painting from Georges[/spoiler] in the 11th century either. The presence of a Japanese guy in Europe in the 9th (?) century and even in the 18th stretches credibility a bit, but I mean they recently found a Chinese skeleton dating back to Roman Britain so who am I to gainsay it. One shouldn't really expect historical accuracy in a Japanese anime game but I still noticed it, call it autism if you want. \n-It ends, but luckily there's a sequel coming out!\n\nIn any case, the pros far outweigh the cons in The House In Fata Morgana. I'm so happy that I found this game and played (read?) through it. It is seriously in a league of its own and bears reading even if you're not a fan of anime or Japanese games. It doesn't really fall back on (that) many anime cliches and has a wonderfully unique story to tell. \n\ntl;dr It's a good game and I cried.", "timestamp_created": 1495676245, "timestamp_updated": 1511534250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31801252": {"recommendationid": "31801252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087854214", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495522752}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521a\u521a\u73a9\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u300aseventh coat\u300b\uff0c\u63a5\u7740\u4fbf\u7acb\u523b\u6765\u4e70\u4e86\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\n\u8981\u8bf4\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff0c\u611f\u8c22\u5427\u3002\n\n\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u4f60\u4eec\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u300aseventh coat\u300b\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u80fd\u73a9\u5230\u4f60\u4eec\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u7684\u5e78\u8fd0\u3002\n\n\u6b63\u662f\u90a3\u4efd\u611f\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u6211\u4ece\u5760\u843d\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u62c9\u4e86\u56de\u6765\u3002\n\n\u90a3\u4efd\u611f\u52a8\uff0c\u4f1a\u94ed\u523b\u5728\u6211\u7684\u7075\u9b42\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f34\u6211\u4e00\u751f\u3002\n\n\u975e\u5e38\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u7684\uff0c\u611f\u8c22\u4f60\u4eec\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1495011534, "timestamp_updated": 1495011534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31656470": {"recommendationid": "31656470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075683173", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503970475}, "language": "english", "review": "Played for few chapters, and then i stop, unable to finish it.\nWhy?

An amazing soundtrack, if you don't play this game at least get the soundtrack and some good audiophile headphones as a present to yourself too (ballers get speakers and a subwoofer). Fata Morgana features very human characters intwined within a heavy plot, forcing them to show off their vices, their virtues, all wrapped in tragedy. Regarding tragedy, we see Fata Morganna force players to stare at tragedy again and again, examine it from another viewpoint and dealing with the consequences. If you find tragedy uncomfortable, depressing, avoiding them at every turn because it turns the waterworks on or stabs the chest, this is that kind of VN and more. I won't say avoid it even if you hate it, yeah I think you should play it, I would rather carry the hate than not recommend this VN to everyone and anyone. it deserves it, I sincerely think so.\n\nPersonally, VNs have always caused the most catharsis out of any medium, if you have experienced that emotion many times from this medium then I don't need to say much more, you already know what's coming and what state you will be in by the end. If you are brand new to VNs perhaps you experienced catharsis from something particularly good already.

This is a story about people. Real people. There are no good guys or bad guys. They're humans. Flaws and all. It was very refreshing to read something like this which doesn't resort to cliche characters or the same stereotypes I've seen time and time again. Since this is a visual novel I like to keep these kind of reviews brief because I wouldn't want to spoil anything, but if you enjoy reading then there's no reason not to check this one out. \n\nThe artwork for me was fantastic. I think it may be real photos with filters on them, but regardless it really just serves to enhance the atmoshpere. Gives it this kind of otherworldy feel to it which is very fitting. The sprites are nicely done and very detailed. They're are a lot of sprites with such minute changes that you probably wouldn't even notice them since you're looking at the text, but the attention to detail is admirable and praiseworthy. \n\nThe music is also just amazing. I believe it's done in various different languages which lend itself well to the changing times and settings. It helps to set the mood and it's a soundtrack I find myself often listening to. There are very catchy songs as well as dramatic pieces. I'd even say that the game is worth getting just to listen to it. Very well done. \n\nAll in all, The House in Fata Morgana is beautiful.

That you can play for 10, 100 or even more than 1000 hours and still enjoy it. And their is absolutly nothing wrong with it. The most of my favorite games i would put honestly in this first category. \n\nThe second category of games wants to create an unique experience. An experience that you will not get (most likely) anywhere except this game.\n\nOf course the category are not strikt and their are many games that make a ton of fun, that also give you an experience that you will remember your whole life. And then their are games that wants to give you an experience, see the world from the eyes of a war orphan for example, while they are still fun to play. \n\nThis game however fits totally in the secound category, since it is \"just\" a Visual Novel without any \"fun\" gameplay mechanics. However, this game has clever mechanics to put you into the persons of the game with hard choices to make. And it has....the best plot i have ever seen in any book/game/anything at all. \n\nSince i dont want to spoiler anything for you (because the mistery of the game, with all it plottwists and unpredictable events are one of the many Charms of the game) i just wanted to say that this was a rollercoster of emotions and a one-time-per-life experience for me! i have felt hope, joy, misery, hate, sadness and every kind of emotion, the good and the bad, i can think of. And because of this, because the story is so complex, well written and diverse...i can not imagine that this VN will not touch you soul...and believe me i never expected that it will touch mine....how wrong i was.\n\nIt is funny that of all the hundreds of games i have played in my life, after all the great tripple A titel, and all the amazing other games, that give you a new experiece, ( and because i played already so many games in my life i thought that i have slowly seen every kind of game/ new experiece that games can give me) that this kinda unknown Visual Novel that i have found on a total random coincidence, from which i just hoped and expected that it will make my evenings after my studies for examens a bit interesting, did reveal itself as the best, and most emotional game i have ever played, and have given me one of the most intense experiences in my life! \n\nThis Visual Novel is in my opinion a masterpiece, and i can only recommend you to try it out, since you can refund it on steam if the story of the first 2 hours did not touch you so you have nothing to loose, expect a little bit of time. But if you are like me and you liked the story than congratulation: You will never forget the hours you will read the maybe most wounderful story that was written yet, and enjoy your trip to discover the tragic mistery...of the house in fata morgana. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1486261293, "timestamp_updated": 1486261293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29614740": {"recommendationid": "29614740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013432493", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494058067}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0445, \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0443 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u0433\u0440\u044b 100% \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433. \n\u0417\u0430\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f, 30 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u0441 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u043c\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0438, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0442\u0430\u043c. \n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0437\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0444\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440\u044b \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043e\u043a, \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043c, \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438. \u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0435 \u043a \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0443 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435, \u0438 \u0442\u044b \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f -

If you like visual novels, there is no need to read further ; this game is a no-brainer. However, if you are new to the genre, it might or might not be the best title to begin with, depending on what you seek in this kind of game.\n\nWhat this VN lacks in budget (no voice-acting, small resolution, few CG's, few characters, no animated intro, ...), it clearly makes up for in polish and heart. The story is absolutely brilliantly written (even from a literary point of view) and wonderfully paced. The non-moe art is incredibly refreshing, the characters are really expressive, the soundtrack is amazing, and the choices are made so that it actually is possible to reach the true ending on a first run without help.\n\nHowever, as hinted before, the somewhat austere realisation and the fact that this VN is rather text-focused prevent it from being suitable for everyone. If what you look for in a VN is an extended interactive anime (which some do very well), you are probably better off with another title. Plus, this is an horror game. There are no jumpscares, but the game will make you endure a variety of emotions that you may not be wanting to experience.\n\nBut if you are, brace yourself, enter The House, and enjoy one of the very best visual novels available on Steam.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1485742303, "timestamp_updated": 1485742389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29451952": {"recommendationid": "29451952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044184873", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485213922}, "language": "english", "review": "Story - 10\nArt- 9\nSound - 10\nCharacters - 10\nEnjoyment- 9.5\n\nOverall- 9.5 (rounded down from 9.7)\n\nOne of the greatest visual novels and a must read.", "timestamp_created": 1485214400, "timestamp_updated": 1485214400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29386035": {"recommendationid": "29386035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025079799", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493236563}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was a wild ride.

I think it's a a great game after finishing, there are so many good reviews on it all ready, so I'll add my own 2 cents. \n\nThe story really resonates, and the music makes it feel nostalgic. There was clearly a lot of thought put into the art, the writing, and the music, because they all fit to make this game whole. Honestly, when I first started playing, I would consider the art to be decent. Wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst. Some awkward perspective or proportions on body parts issues here and there, but for the most part, its good. The artist knew how to create mood-fitting pieces that fit with the story. I've grown to enjoy the artwork. \n\nThe music is perhaps the game company's selling point -- I'll be honest that the music isn't grade A, the vocalist sometimes sounded off-key or it just felt like her accent wasn't quite right. I thought the music was sung in latin this whole time, but it's apparently in Portuguese (most of it is)? Which is interesting because the backdrop is in a different European area... But aside from minor details like that, by the time I finished the game, I really started to love some of the tracks. And I would probably buy the OST even if the singing isn't perfect -- it now is associated with a great story.\n\nThe decisions you make are very easy to do -- most of the game, you are the observer until the half-point, in which you are given some more choices. There's a few endings to achieve for your steam achievements, but in all honesty, I think the game-makers only wanted the player to enjoy a good story and make it to the end of it. So if you do buy, make sure you save often near the end.\n\nI would buy this game if you enjoy suspense, mystery, gothic-esque themes, makes you cry..., because this isn't really about playing a game, more like experiencing a story. There were also some very adult themes about building character though, some very strong messages about \"being able to be who you are,\" which I thought was rather well put together.\n\nOverall, there's a lot of good things going on with this game, and I hope to buy more games from Novectacle if they continue to make VNs of the same or better quality.", "timestamp_created": 1482284155, "timestamp_updated": 1482284155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28402285": {"recommendationid": "28402285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118163664", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513307521}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]TL;DR[/b] This is not your typical Japanese visual novel, but more like a good paperback novel come to life.

There is a well-executed overarching story beyond that. Also, don't be mislead by the store page artwork. This isn't [i]that[/i] kind of novel. I know that's most people's knee-jerk reaction, but it takes on a whole new meaning once you finish the game. The devs have said that [i][b]the game is not targeted at any specific demographic[/b][/i].\n\n[u]Not recommended unless you are a sensitive gamer:[/u]\nThere is a [url=http://blog.mangagamer.org/2016/05/12/the-house-in-fata-morgana-content-advisory/]content advisory page by the localizers[/url] with out-of-context spoilers.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nNo dating sim elements, little to no otaku pandering with the usual anime stereotypes [i](there's one character who's basically a dark and disturbing satire of the \"good-looking affluent snobbish tsundere\" archetype)[/i], no H-scenes to lure in horny kids, no gratuitous gore, no endless slice-of-life chatter about irrelevant things, no digustingly large moe eyes. This is the kind of mature and thoughtful VN presentation I would like to see more of from titles developed in Japan.\n\nStory, characters, music, art style --- this is a well-rounded package; pretty much everything I want out of a visual novel. While the writing may not hold up to the best paperback novels out there, its [b]overall presentation[/b] (encompassing text, visuals, sound, and even [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew]interface screw[/url]) pushes this title into elite territory. All these facets of the game come together to create a highly immersive experience.\n\nThere is no voice acting, though the game's hauntingly beautiful vocal tracks (whose lyrics are basically the inner monologues of the characters sung in Portugese, Latin, and French) more than make up for it. The art is a perfect blend of eastern and western art styles, retaining the expressiveness of Japanese anime art while giving off a dark fantasy/gothic vibe befitting of the setting. \n\n[b]Special mention goes to the top-tier character sprites.[/b] Not only are they detailed and aesthetically pleasing, the artist Moyataro also breathed life into them by giving them many variations in their facial expressions; their sprites are very expressive even without the typical enormous, out-of-proportion sparkling anime eyes you find in so many other VNs. One of the characters alone must have at the very least 30 different variations for her sprite, and they all convey her emotions very well without looking unrealistic. I didn't even notice one of those variations was her puffing her cheeks until my 2nd playthrough due to how subtle it was. Consider me a new Moyataro fan.\n\nWord of warning though, the weakest portion of the story, art and music are all frontloaded in the first two hours or so of the game, which is unfortunate. Thankfully, it only gets better from there.\n\nSo what's the story about? Without spoiling anything:\n[b]It's about human nature, in all its beautiful and disgusting glory, laid bare.[/b]\n\nI appreciated how the heavier themes seldom explored in video games are handled with maturity and grace here. This is a tale that will stick with me for many years to come.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nP.S.

It's a testament to many things as a visual novel: It shows us how a VN does not need the slightest inkling of Japanese culture in it to be a masterpiece of the genre; how the art, music and prose can mesh together to form a magnificent crescendo of literary beauty, how one can craft a story so poignant that every single person -from the happiest to the most sorrowful- can relate to it in some manner; most importantly of all, how one can prevail over unrelenting abuse and torment.\n\n[h1]Premise[/h1]\n\nFata Morgana begins as you, ???, wake up inside a run-down, gloomy mansion that feels as desolate and dead as the Maid who greets you upon your awakening. She calls you \"Master\". In order to reawaken your memories, she decides to show you around various rooms in the mansion. Every room leads to a different era, a different cast, a different tale...\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nFata Morgana is a master stroke in terms of narrative design. Every single member of the cast has believable motivations and they are presented as complex characters; breathing, living people both in their cruelty and compassion. The pacing is virtually airtight save for a few possible stretches that last less than an hour, and I personally welcomed them for giving me a rest and time to wind down from the rest of the experience. It's a tragic tale, but a tale that harbors hope, and a tale that takes its (heavy, grotesque, tormentful) subject matter seriously. By the time the utterly cathartic ending rolls out, you have an experience on your hands that could very well keep you thinking on it for life. The prose is quite well-written (It's no Planescape: Torment, but it is easily an above average translation), and many variations of dialogue and scene depictions, internal monologues are all written in a manner that is not pretentious or overly complicated.\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\nFata Morgana's most distinctive feature at first glance is its art style. The sprite work is meticulously detailed and somewhat realistic while still retaining some artistic flair. All characters are drawn expressively while the backgrounds are filtered photos that appear as abstract CGs- which might ring alarm bells for those who loathed Higurashi and Umineko's original backgrounds, but the truth of the matter is that -at least for me- the backgrounds in this game resemble oil paintings, reflecting a distant but not yet fully forgotten past. The only significant flaw of the (2012) game- and perhaps the whole VN- is that it is in 4:3. The art is in beautiful tandem with the music as well, which brings me to my next point...\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nFata Morgana's soundtrack could have single-handedly let this VN be a GOTY contender. As it stands, it is still potentially the best aspect of Fata Morgana and that is not light praise. It has the best soundtrack I have heard in any videogame or VN, bar none (yes, that includes Umineko :P). Fata Morgana's tracks range from wistful to catchy to ominous and hectic to peaceful and they are quite varied for each era you visit. Especially songs with vocals are incredibly touching and quite a few of them have stayed with me since (to the point where their emotional baggage makes it difficult to listen to them). Giselle and Hex in particular are godlike, though I'd recommend you to not listen to those two before fully experiencing the VN. The OST is mostly comprised of sad tracks (melancholic, wistful and distressed) but that makes the stellar peaceful and happy tracks stand out all the more. The music's effect is amplified unimaginably when you hear them in the VN- as I said before, the art and music in Fata Morgana are in beautiful, priceless harmony with each other.\n\n[h1]Miscellaneous[/h1]\nMenus: The game's menus are decent, with a few options for text speed and separate settings for BGM and SFX. By saving at choices and particular spots in the story, I almost ran out of save slots. But the number there should be fine if you do not mind overwriting here and there.\n[b]Choices-[/b] There are a fair number of choices in the game, but they're all really straightforward so unless you want to go for 100% completion, you really don't need a walkthrough.\n[b]Extras-[/b] After the completion of the game, you unlock galleries for art and music as well as a lengthy, non-canon \"backstage\" scene that's pretty funny. The vocal tracks have illustrations you can view that display the original and English lyrics for each song, and they look great! The game's DRM-free OST is available through Steam as well, as DLC. Definitely worth it.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nFata Morgana is a classic. Its art, music and its masterful execution of its subject matter cannot be found anywhere else in the medium.

Suffice it to say that it is deeply moving, beautifully crafted, and easily the best visual novel I\u2019ve played. In fact, it\u2019s probably the best example of storytelling through the medium of a computer game that I\u2019ve experienced. It\u2019s not completely flawless (though in my opinion its flaws are minor, and mostly boil down to some scenes going on too long), but it's a brilliant and memorable work, and a deeply emotionally affecting one. As said, giving a summary of the story would give too much away, so a few general notes instead:\n\n- The whole game is intensely atmospheric- the surreal backgrounds (very heavily filtered photographs, apparently), combined with the soundtrack, create an unearthly atmosphere which perfectly fits the story being told. Best played at night.\n\n- Speaking of the soundtrack, all the high praise for it is well earned- it\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard in a video game, and could not be more fitting to the game as a whole. It\u2019s worth mentioning that it takes a while for this to become clear- the very best tracks (by Yusuke Tsutsumi) don\u2019t come until some way into the game, and the music in the first chapter is probably not really the best introduction to the game\u2019s music. (It's actually very fitting to the mood of that chapter, but I found it to be a bit on the annoying side, and I have a feeling a lot of other people would find it so as well.)\n\n- It is almost entirely devoid of the usual tropes and cliches one might associate with visual novels- if one generally avoids visual novels because of those cliches, one might want to make an exception for this, as it is very, very different from the average visual novel in that regard.\n\n- The game starts off rather slowly and takes quite a while to reach the central plotline. The slow pace and the gradual build-up is necessary for the story being told and ultimately more than pays off, in my opinion, but the game definitely requires a bit of patience. \n\n- One of the ways the game excels at storytelling is that it does things that could only be done within the medium of a computer game, and it does them very well. [spoiler](During chapter 4, keep an eye on the backlog.)[/spoiler]\n\n- This is a genuinely mature game, in the best sense of the word \u201cmature\u201d. All too often, if something is said to be \u201cadult\u201d or \u201cmature\u201d, it really means either \u201cporn\u201d or \u201cpointlessly grimdark\u201d- both of which are about as far from The House in Fata Morgana as it gets. Saying much more would give too much away, but suffice it to say that, though it is often very dark in content, it\u2019s not at all in way that\u2019s cheap, exploitative, or manipulative, and the themes it deals with are crucial to the story it tells. \n\nI could probably go on for a long time about this visual novel, but I\u2019ll leave it at that. To sum up- The House in Fata Morgana is a masterpiece, a rare example of a visual novel that truly fulfills the artistic potential of the medium.

The otherworldly-ness of certain characters is punctuated by the realism.

I think one character in particular benefits from this, where the flickering of eyes, parting of lips, or narrowing of brows can say a lot.\n\nVisual novels with anime-styled art sell the most, whether they are OELVNs or Japanese visual novels.

And yet, one of my favorite tracks is called \"Everybody's Crying.\" (but it's beautiful!)\n\nThe cast is decently big, and everybody has their rightful place in the story, though some definitely get more moments to \"shine\" than others.

A gothic story, it begins when an unnamed protagonist (called \"You\" in the ingame text) appears within a decaying manor house. \"You\" are greeted by a maid, the care taker of the estate who seems to exist outside of time and has born witness to the house's many tragedies. She has been waiting for \"you\" and wants to show you four stories of the estate's previous owners and the events that led to their downfalls. There are subtle clues within the four stories that hint that there is a deeper truth. Choices are generally sparse but some of them have to be made within a time limit. Failing to act quickly can lead to premature bad end, but running down the clock can also be the \"correct\" answer to unlocking the game's second half were the truth within the truth is. \nThe second act is were Fata Morgana really shines. While the first four chapters were not slouches in the story department, the final four chapters form the heart and soul of the impressive over-arcing tale. While there are sections that feel like they go on forever and seriously drag, this is more than made up for by the unpredictable plot twists and an incredibly well developed love story. There are no cliche characters included to hit all the wish fufillment buttons of nerds here, but a sympathetic cast of fully fleshed out heroes and villains. \nThe character art is amazing, but the static backgrounds leave a lot to be desired. Most of the time you have incredible detailed character images standing against what looks to be an overexposed photograph or a filter has been superimposed to make it look blurry and indistinct. \nThere is no voice acting, but that may be a plus in this case. Fata Morgana is a massive VN. I've always found that I can read the character dialogue much faster than the characters speak it so the play time would probably end up being twice as long if you waited for the voice clips to play. Second, Fata Morgana has incredible music and most tracks include some vocals. This was not composed to be background music but an emotional accompaniment to the story. As such, any spoken dialogue would have had to compete against the emotive score. \nIn short, I highly recommend House in Fata Morgana. If you buy only one VN this year, make it this one.  \n \n", "timestamp_created": 1480292905, "timestamp_updated": 1480292905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27833793": {"recommendationid": "27833793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262386106", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481541911}, "language": "english", "review": "Prerequisites:\n- Ability to read\n- Ability to empathise\n- Some patience\n- Time (you may not be able to stop reading)\n- A good headset (music and ambience plays a big part)\n- A box of tissues\n\nThis VN combines beautiful music and artwork with some of the best storytelling techniques I've seen.

A Maid calling you Master then guides you through the mansion's history in a bid to have you remember everything yourself. \nCan you face the truth, not matter how much misery and sadness it may bring? \n\nIt's been quite a while since a story was able to make me weep like this. While it can be indeed sad, almost unbearably so at times, there is meaning in all the sadness. And once all is said and done, the feeling of catharsis, of heartwarming happiness is absolutely worth it. The characters go through hell and back, and they come out stronger for it.\nNot to mention how one of the stronger themes in Fata Morgana is that things aren't as they appear at first. Characters are introduced in one particular light, only to become completely different people with many circumstances and reasons for being the way they are, to the point where we can trully sympathize with them despite whatever attrocities they might commit.\n\nThis attests to the quality not only of the writing, but of the localization team as well. The translation is top-notch and everything reads nicely and properly adapted to the eras this story portrays. The characters feel like real people with their own distinctive voices and personalities. \n\nThe production values are also nothing to scoff at, even more so considering this was actually done by a doujin (lit. indie) circle. I mean, damn. The art is incredibly awesome, extremelly pretty and beautiful to look at, be it endearing or violent moments. The music is orgasmically beautiful as well, with MANY tracks having vocals and sung in many different languages, even Portuguese (being a Brazillian, it is kinda hard to understand and, when you look at the lyrics, you see they didn't fully grasp the language though).\n\nMy only gripes with it would be that some scenes here and there (mostly in the final arc) do drag a little bit on points that were already estabilished, and the presence of timed choices. While it made absolute sense within the context to have them so, in the end it's just sort of annoying for you to get an ending simply because you didn't click on your answer quick enough. Also, the CG gallery and music player only unlock after you reach the true ending as far as I could tell, and this could take around 30 hoours.\n\nAlso, speaking of choices, this VN does things a bit differently: the begginning is actually linear and choices gradually appear towards the end, but for completely justified reasons.\n\nAt the end of the day, The House in Fata Morgana is a masterpiece in it's own right, and the fact that this game seems to be so obscure and with so few reviews is almost criminal if you ask me.

It can't be easily forgotten. It's been three months since I finished it and I already find myself wanting to read through it again because my feelings about this story have not changed and are still the same I was having after immediately finishing it.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to start saying that readers must be warned that [i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i]'s story is pretty heavy on the dark side.

Please do not step down from this one cause of the unusual and more western art style of what you're used to, because that's almost what I did, and at the end the art ended up being one of the things I appreciated a lot.\n\nIf you're not yet a fan of this media format called visual novel or could never get into one, you're probably here reading the reviews because you've been allured by the art style and heavy colours. Yes, throughout the game there always is some eerie atmosphere and tragedies are what these characters eat for breakfast. I recommend trying out the demo (not on Steam) which includes the first two full chapters that last several hours.\n\nI must dedicate a paragraph to the music, the star of this title. Know that this game is non-voiced and there's a good reason for this choice. The OST consists of 65 tracks, probably almost half of which are [b]vocal tracks[/b] and sung in Portuguese.

My initial impression was \"Shakespearean tragedy meets Edgar Allan Poe\" and that assessment has held up through the course of the story. The first half of the game covers a series of distinct but interconnected stories, each more tragic than the last, spanning several centuries but taking place in the same cursed mansion. The second half throws back the curtain and makes you rethink everything you\u2019ve thought up to that point, and makes all of the stories even more tragic than they seemed at first. The story is absolutely [i]harrowing[/i] and made me break down in tears many times.\n\nStructurally, the VN is mostly kinetic (read-only). There are a handful of choices, though most of them act as short branches off the main story that quickly end in an alternate ending or dead end (sometimes literally).

Well, I'll start by saying the first three chapters, which amounts to about the first 6-9 hours were terrible.  The main character, if you could call her that, was an unredeemable purity sue that could do nothing wrong and yet had the whole world against her.  Every single villain was just a stupid caricature of a person that only seemed to exist to inflict violence on the  purity sue.  It reads like a bad fanfiction written by a self-absorbed, emo, teenager.\n\nSo why the recommend?  Well the other 11-12 hours makes it work.  It addresses almost every single problem I had with the story besides the fact that the authors thought they should lead in with an \"extended prologue\" that long in the first place.  And not just with a brief exposition dump to cover the plotholes, no, pretty much every detail that gets brought up in those first three stories is built upon with exquisite care and given a greater purpose by wrapping it around the unfolding tale of who we discover to be the true main characters of the plot.  \n\nI'll leave it at that.  Much like Undertale, I feel like really explaining how it does things would kind of ruin it.  You *should* feel exasperated by the end of chapter 3.  You should be wanting answers.  You should have just about had it, because that's in large part what makes the other half or two-thirds of the game so strangely...\"cathartic,\" as one of the creators put it.\n\nThis was a really weird experience, and I started it off really hating it, but it leaves off with me being pretty impressed, actually.  Weird stories like this just wouldn't fly in the mainstream market, and I'm glad these guys are out there trying to be creative, clearly throwing a lot of stuff at the wall to see what sticks, but at the same time not losing track of what writing a good story is.  Things have to have a purpose.  Characters have to be more than just a couple tropes.  Happy endings aren't a writing sin, but not everyone should have one.\n\nOkay, some nitty gritty details:\n*The length of the game for a straight playthrough to the true ending is about 25 hours if you're a moderate/fast reader like me.  Don't look at my playtime, I fast forwarded through a good part of the \"prologue.\"  The pricing for this title is just *okay,* considering it's $25 for a 25 hour game and it expects you to be longsuffering through the first few chapters of reading.\n\n*On the technical side, the game is fairly simple, you get window sizing options and text speed settings, but nothing else.  This is pretty par for the course for a visual novel.  \n\n*This VN does offer choices to the player, some timed, surprisingly.  I don't think there were any indicators of the timed ones, the options would just go away.  The vast majority of the endings are just dead endings, and I haven't seen the other ones to tell how in depth they are, but I think they're mostly just less ideal cut-offs on the main thread, rather than true distinct routes.\n\n*This game advertises its copious amaounts of music, and its true.  It has a crap ton of tracks.  They have a tremendous amount of talent and effort behind that soundtrack.  A lot of it features vocals, too, in a variety of languages, including French.  It takes a lot of getting used to, though.  Again, that cursed prologue, some tracks, and the scene transition jingles they use in each of the first three chapters are genuinely appalling.  But like the whole rest of the experience, something really changes as you go.  The music ends up fitting the mood incredibly well, and some of the repeated themes just stuck with me.  Overall, music is a mixed bag, but pretty dang impressive for what it is, and I think when it counts later in the game it more than comes through.\n\n*The character art and the CGs are incredible, simple as that.  I didn't realize how long I'd been needing some quality non-moe art, and this is it.  It doesn't feel like its targeted towards boys, or girls, it's just good.  The background art however is pretty bland.  Painted with such a heavy brush in some areas that some locations felt muddled to the point of being unrecognizable if not for the narration describing it.\n\n= Overall it's a game with some heavily flawed pacing that still manages to redeem itself, not for an ending, but for what the whole journey ended up being.

A bit of advice: save the game whenever you reach a choice and keep all those saves (you have way more than enough slots for that), especially if you want to later try to get all the achievements, as that will require you to [spoiler]pretty much use all options in all choice screens[/spoiler].\n\nTrigger warning: while the visuals never get completely graphic, the text does describe many terrible acts and gory scenes in great details. Tread carefully.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Astounding story, full of tragedies, mysteries and surprises\n[*]Amazing soundtrack that really helps the script move the reader\n[*]Beautiful art for the sprites and CGs\n[*]A vast array of characters, each of which has many secrets to reveal\n[*]Great writing (the style is always modern, regardless of the era, that is a choice made by both the original author and the translation team for the reader not to struggle with Middle Age speech and lose the thread of the story, having tried reading old texts in their original versions, I think it was a good choice on their part)\n[*]Impressive length for a visual novel\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]High chances that you will get depressed or want to curse all of mankind (or at least many of the characters) during the game\n[*]Backgrounds are nothing more than photographs with a splurging of filters on them and it shows...

The tragedies that unfold in this game, as the Maid would say, you will only be able to bear them because they are not yours... and if you have any empathy, then you will probably feel like some of those trials ARE yours.

It also shows that a story can change, if told from multiple perspectives.\nWhile the art wasn't the usual anime-esque style you are used to from other visual novels, it was quite gorgeous and very expressive.\nI was not as fond of the soundtrack as I would have liked, but it still fit very well and enhanced individual scenes. \nUltimately, this is a must read for fans of visual novels and for people who like good stories in general.", "timestamp_created": 1470256915, "timestamp_updated": 1470256915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24691122": {"recommendationid": "24691122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157438913", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490412986}, "language": "english", "review": "Only one word could describe The House in Fata Morgana \u2013 MASTERPIECE.

It\u2019s very hard to talk about why I love Fata Morgana so much without delving into spoilers, but I\u2019ll try my best. And trust me, this is a game where you want to avoid spoilers at all costs. \n\nAccording to the writer, \u201cThey did not specifically target men or women with the game, and instead just intended to make a game for players who enjoy stories\u201d. And they accomplished just that. This was an incredibly well-crafted story. The tales were gripping & addictive. The romance was wonderfully moving. The tragedies were utterly heart-breaking. I cried my eyes out at some points. At other points, my jaw hit the ground in shock. Other times, I smiled hoping the very best for these characters that had grasped my heart. The characters in this game are so painfully human and real - they make human mistakes, have real weaknesses... but there's still hope. And Fata Morgana displays that wonderfully. \n\nBoth the art and music are hauntingly beautiful. A couple of the songs brought tears to my eyes, while others had my heart racing in anticipation in accordance with their scenes. Such an amazing job all around.\n\nOf course, it may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea (originally didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be mine, but well it ended up being my favourite tea flavor \u2013 bad pun, let\u2019s move on *ahem*). A lot of themes in Fata Morgana are not present in other VNs that I\u2019ve read, and by pushing boundaries, the writer presents a remarkably unique experience. \n\nI implore everyone to give this game its much needed second glance & give this underrated gem a chance.

Every character is loaded with depth and has multiple sides to them. The story is exceptionally well written, with many shocking plot twists that you likely won't see coming. \n\nThe soundtrack is hauntingly captivating, fitting the scenes depicted perfectly and increases the emotional impact of everything exponentially. It's not only one of my favorite soundtracks for a VN, but any genre period. Seriously, it's worth buying The House in Fata Morgana for the soundtrack alone, it's that good.

The artwork in combination with the soundtrack sets off a very unique incredibly dark atmosphere that you would be hard pressed to find in any other game, especially horror themed. \n\nIf I had to list any flaws, it'd be that there's no widescreen support or voice acting. I couldn't be anymore pleased, the experience was amazing and it's hard to put into words. It's more something that you need to experience for yourself than take reviews at face value. IMO this is the best visual novel you can buy at $25 full price on steam.

It really reminds me of Danielewski's House of Leaves in a way and left an even greater impact on me. People who are unfamiliar with the medium of visual novels might see a whole bunch of stereotypes, to those who are familiar with the medium and frankly you'd probably find a lot of the same themes in here explored in more depth in Umineko no naku koro ni, who's question arcs can be found on steam. However, Fata Morgana held my interest and it's very atmospheric to say the least some of the areas involving Morgana herself come across a bit corny and melodramatic but the relationship between the \"Master\", the maid and Morgana herself is really heartwrenching and heart warming. \n\nArt: The art is very unique when it comes to visual novels as the developers as stated because most visual novels use the standard cell shaded method. However, Morgana strikes a healthy balance between an anime aesthetic and realism delivered through a gothic lense and can be seen as a really well told gothic lolita story. The color scheme is very muted and the background itself seem unimpressive but the unique art style more than make up for it. \n\nStory: The episodically told story about the fate of star crossed lovers is definitely something that has been done before and sometimes especially in the third chapter behind the third door there is some tragedy for tragedy's sake, whereas the first two stories come off more as legitimately tragic, the fourth chapter itself is really well explored and you really get an in depth understanding of the main character and the main girl. A lot of LGBT people could probably relate to the events that are presented in the fourth story. \n\nCharacters: A lot of the characters don't seem one dimensional but I'd say maybe 2.5d, aside from the main characters they didn't really feel as well rounded as we would have liked but they have depth and are well explored but none of them really seem like \"real\" three dimensional characters other than the \"male\" and female leads. Morgana herself's story is sort of cheesy but it's a type of melodramatic fancy french cheese you can't help but love. Speaking of French I was very impressed by what I assume is the french language in this story because it makes the story so much more atmospheric. \n\nThe Music: There is a wide variety of music and it seems to follow every bit of the story and does a great job of setting the mood of the piece, however; the only thing that really sticks with you is the ending theme. I'd say it's a good attempt but there's nothing really on the same level as DEAR YOU, or Umineko's soundtrack and I believe it falls short of things like the Steampunk series when it comes to uniqueness still Morgana's soundtrack is very charming.", "timestamp_created": 1469942025, "timestamp_updated": 1469942025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455880", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24601734": {"recommendationid": "24601734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051833822", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470027337}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite a lengthy visual novel with an engrossing storyline.

I want to say this without spoiling it.

As the hours it takes to complete for an average read speed is around 25hrs. Not including all endings and Extras. Is worth a full price to me. \n\nAlso a side note on the OST:\nThe OST is truly emotional and fits the situations in the game very well, they fade out and match the feeling of every sentence the characters say through the game and also have beautiful vocals and instrumentals.

But I felt the need I should after having just finished playing the game inside and out within sixty-seven hours. A lot of the time I did play I stopped just to take in the beauty of the haunting art in both the characters and the environments and also to admire the amazing musical score, but overall I didn't let it completely distract me from the story itself.\n\nThe House of Fata Morgana is a Gothic Visual Novel, a game that is mostly narrative base with rare options for you to determine the stories already established cycle, like a story book. And a pretty engaging one at that. Though the first part was slow for me to get comfortable in, once I invested myself in Fata Morgana, I could not stop reading.\n\nStory wise, the VN tells a series of tales throughout periods of history that happened within the Mansion as told by the mysterious Maid who acts as both your guide and narrator of their stories centering on three unique individuals. Each Chapter takes on darker turn the deeper you delve, with themes of human sin. Telling anymore would spoil a lot of the story, but they all come together to answer lingering questions later on while also keeping you on your toes.\nAt times the pacing is slow, sometimes to the point that I grew anxious for the next scene, but hopefully it's not too unbearable for those who read at a slower pace. Sometimes I wonder when I would get to the next scene, feeling some scenes were longer than necessary.\n\nI have very few gripes about the game. But one thing that does bother me the most is how stiff some of the character sprites are. They may be facially expressive to fit the dialogue, but one can only handle a seeing a certain position for so long. It's especially apparent in the first chapter with [spoiler]Mell[/spoiler] always has a hand behind his neck with his back slouched, which bothered me more than the rest of the cast (he has another pose, but that is only used for more tense scenes). I'm sure it would have been a lot more work if they drew different arm/body gestures (since the character art is knee high), but I would have loved to seen a little more life than just their facial expressions. The scene art is fantastic though, making up for the lack of sprite dynamic.\n\nI sometimes thought it would end on a suspenseful cliffhanger to pan out a sequel to make more money, but instead I felt amply rewarded with more insight in the characters of Fata Morgana. Including a charming behind the scenes extras with a surprise at the end! There is so much more to this game than what you may see on the store page and I urge VN fans to buy this.\n\nOverall, this game was made with much love and care put into its quality.

And that's precisely what the majority of people do.[/quote]\n\nAt first glance, [i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i] tells tales of not romance, friendship and innocence: it mainly tells tragedies of breakdowns, betrayals and scheming. It ruthlessly delves into the bottom of despair, but it is only to better bring us back up to the realms of hope.  \n\nAs an anti-hero would take the place of a hero, [i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i] skillfully casts an anti-romantic story over a ramification of several stories, and it is absolutely worth it.  \n\n[quote]You can [i]try[/i] to remember the past, but it's an absolute, utter waste of time. Erase everything - all your sorrows. Wipe them away for a fistful of happiness. Allow me to show you... that you have no need of the past.[/quote]  \n\n[i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i] has several settings and tells stories of multiple settings. The adolescence of a young brother and her sister, and the blooms of love and their consequences. A journey through the highway to insanity and hopes of salvation. An ever daunting gap between husband and wife and their own attempts, struggles and misadventures. Unfortunate circumstances clash with a life of isolation.  \n\nAs vague as I'm trying to make them, these tales, in truly stylish gothic aesthetics, are spread across centuries of each other. It does a good job of keeping things moving and ensures variety of events.  \n\n[quote]That was your first time witnessing those tragedies. [...] You were able to bear 'em because they weren't [i]your[/i] tragedies.[/quote]\n\nThe tragedies bear great impact in their appeal to us to empathize and pity the protagonists. They make us despair for them because they make us hope that all will end well. In that, the writing is successfully fulfilling and greatly delivering the feelings behind the stories. The way it builds up to the second half of the VN is absolutely enthralling and really engaging.\n\n[i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i], as a visual novel, is quite unconventional. It really is, in the best ways. I must also commend all the work that went into the localization, because practically nothing read or felt as something that came specifically from Japan (well, except for that one guy, but even then he just felt exotic), or Japanese tropes. It's absolutely refreshing, in a medium where so many devices, settings and tropes get used and reused so ubiquitously.  \n\nAt times, I would find the art odd looking, but it's overshadowed by how beautiful, stylish and gorgeous some of the CGs look. Frankly enough, the main reason why some people (myself included) weren't immediately seduced by the art style is because they are not used at all to this style. Overall though, it's great for the eyes, especially to wash away the excess of moe blobs.  \n\nThe OST is unusual and unlike many things in this world. But again, this VN detaches itself well from many things in this world. It can be enchanting, sorrowful or downright bewitching. I'm personally way more used to instrumentals in VNs, so having most of them vocalized is a different experience. There is no voice acting though, but adding on the previous point, I think vocalized OST wouldn't clash well with voice acting.  \n\nThe characters are flawed, but that is the main drive of the novel. How they are flawed though feels deeply human, especially when there's always reasons or motives to how they are acting like they are. Well, [i]almost[/i] human anyway. At times, they might feel repetitive, but they are mostly coherent and worthy of the stories they took part in.  \n\nMy greatest complain about [i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i] will be in its technical implementation. While it is usable, and at times, really well exploited, it feels older than it is, and not in a gothic way. In contrast to everything else about it, the interface doesn't try to do much things differently than in other VNs; in fact, I'd say it does less than average when it comes to immersion (other than by the story itself). Perhaps it is a good thing, as the UI keeps out of the way of the story, leaving us devoted only to it, but I would have liked to have seen more effects for immersion. Perhaps a bit of screen shaking, more animations, subtle SFX... There's definitely room for improvement.  \n\nStill, all in all, [i]The House in Fata Morgana[/i] belongs to the realm of top-tier stories, and I would love to see more visual novels in this style.

The estimate I've seen is between 10 hours (if you get the shortest route) and 30 hours if you get the complete story (which I did), and that seems about right.\n\nI really enjoyed this, it's by far one of my favourites if not my favourite VN and would stack pretty highly even if it had been written as a book. I only got one alternative ending (4) and it was nice to see that it contributes a tiny bit of a different perspective, though the objective is to get at the bottom of the mystery.\n\nAs you can gather from the video and the screenshots, the atmosphere is rather Gothic, though I think that the screenshots aren't necessarily representative of the entirety of the art quality: if you think the art is really nice there, just wait until you get to chapter 5 and you'll see there's a jump in quality and a few new sprites look even nicer than the ones in the first few chapters.\n\nStory-wise, to avoid spoilers, I could say that this is mainly a story about relationships in the widest meaning of the word. It's about the bad things and the good things that people do, and sometimes the bad things are done for entirely understandable reasons, while the good things might be ultimately motivated by self interest. The narrator isn't really judgemental, and I thought it was an incredibly nice thing to see particularly in this day and age. \nIf you'd rather have a nuanced look at a group of characters, rather than people to either hate or love, you will probably like this one. I absolutely adored it. \n\nI found that every time I thought I understood what was going on, something changed my perspective and added more mystery and made me want even more to understand exactly what went on. Even once you actually understand what the main conflict is, you'll probably find that you'll go from almost hating some characters to understanding and empathising with them. I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster.\n\nThere are a few revelations throughout the narrative and I found myself jaw-dropping at the surprises. There is absolutely zero filler, too. It's all so engaging I found myself clicking to see the next line of text with great impatience.\nFrom what I could tell, there were no mistakes in the editing phase and the translation seemed good to me, though I'd point out that English isn't my first language, so I might not notice more subtle problems with the editing.\n\nThere are no voices, aside from the vocals in the many songs in the OST, but I didn't think the experience suffered from it. If anything, there's one particular aspect of the story that would have made it really hard to choose at least a couple of voice actors.\n\nThe options in the menu are rather nice. You can easily set the speed of the text in milliseconds and tailor the Auto Mode to your needs with great precision. I use that a lot as I find it less painful than clicking (due to RSI), but I ended up ditching it as I said earlier, as the story was just too engaging to wait. \nThe saving and loading screens are quite interesting, too: the most recent save is marked clearly and you can \"lock\" save files. This means that if you have save files that you absolutely want to go back to to hunt for endings, you can be sure you won't overwrite them by mistake.\n\nThe music is incredibly fitting. At first I found it peculiar to have so many vocal tracks, but I ended up feeling that the usual piano tracks that are often the meat of a lot of VNs' soundtracks just wouldn't have given the same atmosphere. Gao's voice is really something else and I didn't hesitate to buy the soundtrack along with the VN.\n\nReally, if you're looking for a dark story sprinkles with some more optimistic moments and for something that isn't about dating a selection of girls or boys, you should give this a try.

given on the Steam store page for this game as of 5/24/2016 and will be referring to things mentioned therein.  Honestly however I think that description tells a tiny bit more about the story then I would like, so if you are someone who hasn\u2019t already read it, then my recommendation is to not read that synopsis or any of this review (or just skip to the summary at the bottom) and buy the game if you are interested.  This visual novel has without a doubt earned its place among my favorites, and it is well worth your time/money in my opinion if you are a fan of story driven VN\u2019s.\n\nAnyways, to move on to what I have to say about the game, the way this synopsis describes the story is\u2026ambitious\u2026to say the least.  The promise of a story \u201cspanning nearly a millennium\u201d and incorporating numerous stories from different time periods is one that always makes me suspicious despite the high potential it might indicate for the story.  Perhaps I\u2019m too jaded, but too many times I\u2019ve seen similar promises not fully delivered on, generally either from wrapping everything together in a mostly nonsensical way, or from not wrapping anything up at all and keeping the separate stories as mostly that\u2014separate.  Despite that apprehension though, I am happy to say that The House in Fata Morgana is one of the exceedingly rare cases that delivers in full, creating a complete story that is both entirely satisfying and befitting the scale of that claim.  Obviously I\u2019m not going to say anything more here, but the way the story unfolds and wraps itself up is what I consider the greatest accomplishment of this visual novel. \n\nOn a related note, I\u2019d also like to touch on the characters here since--as with most cases--they\u2019re the driving forces of the story.  For whatever reason, another thing I was hesitant about going into this story was that the characters might come across as dull or lifeless, or might take second stage to the shock factor (for lack of a better term) of the tragedies which occur. I can again say though that this turned out not to be the case.  I ended up loving most of the characters from this story, and with few exceptions they felt human in the best possible way.  There is no reliance on typical character archetypes; they  have believable motivations for their actions; and the writers have incorporated both light and darkness (or good/evil or however you like to think of it) into every character in the story.  And, it is this imperfectly human portrayal of the characters that makes the various emotional highs and lows of the story that much more impactful.\n\nThe last main thing I\u2019d like to say is that this VN is great at setting whatever atmosphere the story needs at that point (and there are a variety of different atmospheres\u2014not just the bleak depression you see at the start of the game).  I think there\u2019s better ways to get a feel for this than by reading a review (see for example the promo material on the Steam page), so I\u2019ll mostly leave it at that.  I will however draw attention to the OST which is probably the largest contributing factor to this and is very good at its job.\n\nAnyways, I think that\u2019s everything I wanted to specifically talk about, so I\u2019ll just provide a brief overview of my overall opinion below.  All in all though I think this is a fantastic VN, and it\u2019s one I\u2019d recommend to anyone who is at all interested in what it has to offer.\n\nGood points:\n--Powerful and far-reaching story which delivers on all sides of the emotional spectrum and brings everything together nicely.\n--For those fans of tragedy specifically, this delivers in spades on that front.\n--Well-written characters that are both compelling and convincing.\n--Unique atmosphere which adds to the tragic and mysterious feel of the story\n--Diverse OST that complements the story well.\n\nBad points:\n--There are no voices, which I generally think can add a lot to VN\u2019s\n--Minor pacing issues at some points", "timestamp_created": 1464135764, "timestamp_updated": 1464135764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23151043": {"recommendationid": "23151043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025210572", "num_games_owned": 983, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487869927}, "language": "english", "review": "Now that I'm finally done with The House in Fata Morgana I have decided to gather my thoughts on it.\n\nThe House of Fata Morgana is really good visual novel that oozes atmosphere and doesn't go with a cliche anime visual style. A story that is pretty gruesome but it can have some light hearted moments to strike a decent contrast to the despair and messed up things to happen in the game. The whole cast has a purpose to being there and you will feel sad or hatred towards some of the characters which for most of the part seem intentional. The many endings and dead ends are mostly interesting and there is some extra dialogue on a few areas in the game if you play for the second time. Let's not forget one of the biggest stars in the game the OST that helps set everything of the atmosphere. The extra content is actually pretty nice. You get music, art gallery and some other things to look forward after clearing the game. It's mostly beginner friendly on terms of figuring out what to do and there are plenty of save slots for you to save every important moment of decision making.\n\n\nOn the negative side there is a few chapters that can drag with details that people can pretty much figure out themselves while playing. (Nothing wrong with details but sometimes it can be a bit too much), there are some important events that you'll wish could had some CGs and some cases more sprites for more expressions. (This might be mostly me complaining over my adoration of the artstyle) \n\nOverall and probably expected by now I recommend the game for anyone looking to play a pretty darn good visual novel.\n\n+Amazing Art Direction and Atmosphere\n+Outstanding OST\n+Great CGs\n+Really Good Story\n+Interesting Endings + Dead Ends\n+Characters are pretty fleshed out and play the role they should therefore getting your like or dislike of them.\n+Nice Extras\n\n- Some pretty cliche writing on parts of the starting chapters which mostly was intentional for future parts of the story but still doesn't change that it was expected..\n- Could have more sprites and CGs for some events that seemed pretty important.\n- Pacing issues (It can drag a bit too much on a few chapters)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1463981173, "timestamp_updated": 1463981173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23148818": {"recommendationid": "23148818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009633774", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477934216}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, you win Novectacle. I'm officially freaked out. Bravo.\nIt's as if the game read my mind... I won't spoil anything but...\nthat block of red text, hidden away... it freaked me the xxxx out, \nbecause I was so not expecting it. I even had goosebumps.\n\nThough I hesitate to call this a \"game\" in any traditional sense, it is a fantastically wonderful novel. Moreover, it's of my most favored genre, the \"mindxxxx\" genre. You think you have some idea of where things are going, then comes the big reveal. I've only come remotely close to correctly guessing the climax of one of the doors, and even then there were surprises.\n\nTruly a wonderful experience so far.\n\nAs for the technical stuff:\nVisually: The character design is wonderful. I appreciate that little detail was spent on the bachdrops and instead effort was concentrated on the actors themselves. The various emotions captured on their faces is very well done.\n\nAudibly: The music is beautifully done. There is a song to match every mood, from lite and cheerful to dark and eerie. By default it was a bit loud for my liking, but once I adjusted the settings it became a perfect \"cherry on top\" to the visuals and writing.\n\nFinally, the writing: They say to save the best for last, and that's what I decuded to do. The writing for this VN is truly wonderful, both plot-wise and in format. It's not so relaxed that it reads like your average conversation, but not so formal that it's Shakespearean, On several occasions the most subtle detail has later revealed itself to be of the utmost importance, and conversely something that might typically be very important in other novels turns out to be of little consequence.

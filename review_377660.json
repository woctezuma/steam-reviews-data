modern and clean feel that will certainly steal a good amount of time away from your life.[/b]\n\nBlockwick 2 is a game about moving blocks around until all blocks of the same color make contact with each other. Sounds easy but I assure you it's much more complicated than that. Some of the blocks are bolted down and can\u2019t move while others are forced to move when moving a different block. This type of puzzle is not the kind that you end up getting frustrated at when you can\u2019t solve it since the game lets you progress to the next level if you can find the hidden pear in every level. The soundtrack is very nice and goes with the game very well and can even be purchased on Bandcamp if you wish.\n\nI found this in my discovery queue and was instantly reminded of the original Blockwick that I played on iOS a long time ago. Kieffer Bros. has another game on iOS called Aqueduct and that\u2019s how I found out about them. Since I was very familiar with this developer I decided to give this game on steam a try and I think you should to. And if you decide you don\u2019t love this beautiful masterpiece of a game you can always return it if you want, that is if you haven\u2019t played it for too long.\n\nAlso really hoping that even though Aqueduct was made natively for iOS and Android I hope that the devs decide to port it over to steam.", "timestamp_created": 1498709734, "timestamp_updated": 1498709952, "voted_up": true,

After that there's only the option to restart the level.

Which sounds fairly simple, and it is - at first. As the levels get tighter and tighter and more, larger and strangely shaped blocks appear, and as you move on to later worlds and new types of blocks get added into the mix, again starting simple to show you how they work, then scaling up the difficulty again.\n\nThe game creates a good balance of having enough levels for each new mechanic it introduces into the game, and on the right difficulty curve, so as to avoid to much repetition, or the reverse issue (see Maze Lord) of introducing new mechanics too frequently and making too little use of them.\n\nOn top of the base gameplay there is also the nice addition of a couple of optional (achievement earning) extras of finding the pearl hidden under one of the blocks starting positions, and completing the level while sitting over 3 symbols marked on the game floor - in the early levels this isn't very much extra work, but on the complicated levels towards the end of each world it can make an already difficult puzzle fiendishly hard, but given they are optional not progression required this seems fine - it is up to you if you want to take on the extra challenge (or do it later).\n\nMy only real frustration with the game was the section with the sticky blocks, for some reason that mechanic annoyed me rather than all the rest that just felt like an extra challenge to overcome, I don't know why though.\n\nOverall an excellent puzzle game that is easy to recommend to anyone that likes the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1481218708, "timestamp_updated": 1481218708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

There are various worlds/chapters/sections, with new types of blocks introduced every so often to make the puzzles more difficult to solve.\n\nI found, overall, that this is a challenging but entertaining puzzle game! I really enjoyed the concept and the new mechanics as they were introduced. The goals and instructions are straightforward, making it easy to see what you can do and how you can do it, but harder to actually get the blocks to the solution right away. This forces you to really think spatially to find the solution. \n\nI personally found that the difficulty wasn't too high. It didn't gradually increase and instead I found myself going through most of the puzzles with relative ease with one random puzzle every once in a while that would spike in difficulty, leaving me struggling to find the solution for a good long while (note that I was going for trying to illuminate each level the first time through, which means not just having all the same-color blocks touch, but also covering all the runes). It's hard to say whether that was how the game was intented to be or if there were just certain types of puzzles that I found more difficult than others. Either way, the game kept me entertained and itching to try and complete a much as I could.\n\nI completed the game 100% in about 32 hours. The ambiant music was lovely to listen to, as it wasn't obnoxious or abrasive. However, I found that I was eventually becoming tired of the repetitive music after playing for hours and hours at a time. There are options to turn off the music and sound effects, so I ended up listening to my own music past that point. Other than those two options there is only a button to change the game from windowed mode to fullscreen. These few options work just fine for this game because there isn't really anything else that needs to be messed with. The game also has the original Blockwick \"Basics,\" which offers even more puzzles. I felt that \"Basics\" was much easier so I often switched and worked on some of those puzzles when I was stuck on a more difficult one in the other section.\n\nTL;DR Blockwick 2 is a challenging but enjoyable puzzle game with nice visuals and music that is definitely a great purchase for those interested in logical/spatial puzzle games!

The puzzles were very challenging; yet I never had to look up a LetsPlay cheater walkthrough, even though I played for the \"Illuminated\" achievement for perfect final configuration.\n\nSpacial movement game. Obviously, the basic strategy is to open up degrees of freedom to allow manipulation and throughput. The solutions are tight, VERY TIGHT--the avenue is often mandatory, but there is some freedom for the less important tiles.  Several times, I got one step away from the final solution, only to realize that I must reverse half my moves to get one last piece on the other side where I had not expected the solution. Yet, the solutions can be visualized and executed with wonderful ah-ha insightful moments. \"Wait! This is impossible without moving that piece around and under and through...It will NOT fit. Oh! It just may be possible.\" Brutal and brilliant.\n\n(Not a spoiler): One feature is the sticky tile. The instructions do not quite make it clear that they are sticky like peanut butter not like glue; you CAN scrape the tile off on an edge.\n\n9 chapters of 16 levels. 2 games in 1.

game.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n- Vibrant colors and a crisp presentation\n- Mixes it up by adding block behaviours, like sticky blocks, sleeping blocks, and snake blocks\n- Allows you to skip challenging levels via a mini-game, finding a pearl buried in each level\n- Want more challenge? Try beating the levels by matching the symbols on the blocks to their grid locations. Adds another layer of difficulty, and is completely optional\n- Has a beginner series of puzzles that was added later, giving you even more for your money\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- For some, the music may be distracting. Luckily there is a mute button.\n- The difficulty didn't progress smoothly. There were some dastardly puzzles in between otherwise simple ones. Not sure if this was by design.\n- The tutorial is very sparse. In specific, I found that the sticky blocks had a behaviour that I only discovered by accident. It would have been nice to explain these better to avoid getting stuck (pun intended)\n- Undo only goes back one step. I was forced to reset in some sleeping block stages, where it is quite possible to become trapped.\n\nIf you enjoy casual puzzle games, Blockwick 2 is a good deal. But if sliding block puzzles aren't your thing, you probably won't be won over by Blockwick 2. I found this to be an excellent way to take a break in between tasks by leaving it running in the background and solving a puzzle here and there. Walking away and coming back to it got me past some of the more challenging levels. It's also why my playtime is so exaggerated, pay it no mind.\n\nI strongly advise picking this up on sale. As much as I support the hard work put into Blockwick, I can't say it's worth the full sticker price.\n\nAchievement hunters: Assuming no use of a guide, may provide a fair challenge when trying to illuminate all levels. But nothing that time and persistence won't overcome. 100% is achievable.\n\n(Review updated 7/2017 for better clarity and formatting)", "timestamp_created": 1464673855, "timestamp_updated": 1500267426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659503", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23206381": {"recommendationid": "23206381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042646749", "num_games_owned": 898, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470596872}, "language": "english", "review": "Blockwick 2 is one of the best puzzle games I have played. Every aspect of this game is spot on: the basic premise, the visual execution, the amount of variation, the difficulty and learning curve, the music and the sound effects. They all contribute to feeling it's fun to play the game and it's satisfying to solve the puzzles.\n\nOne very noteworthy thing about Blockwick 2 is that the game doesn't need to end if you're stumped by one particular puzzle. In each puzzle, there is a pearl hidden underneath one of the blocks. Find that pearl and click on it and you can move to the next puzzle if you want. Sometimes it's a good idea to skip a puzzle for now and move on, just to be able to focus on a different problem for a while.

After completing each set of levels (16), the game introduces a new mechanic - first multiple colors, then blocks that can only move together, sticky blocks, etc. Finally, for a bigger challenge, you can seek a specific solution to each level where the position of the blocks also matters - you need to cover 3 floor symbols.\n\nThe visuals of the game are spartan but tastefully done, the music is good, and the controls are well executed - drag and drop works seamlessly on the PC, and I assume the touch controls work similarly well. Where the game really shines is the level design, though - the learning curve for each mechanic is properly cared for in the first 2-3 levels, and the remaining 13-14 challenges in the set (at least in the later sets) are generally quite good, occasionally bordering the fiendish. With 144 levels initally and then an added bonus level set, Blockwick 2 provides quality brain-teasing entertainment for many hours.\n\nHighly recommended.\n", "timestamp_created": 1458754721, "timestamp_updated": 1458754721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22005095": {"recommendationid": "22005095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193675425", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458830901}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u672c\u6765\u662f\u6253\u6298+1\u6302\u5361\u7684.....\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0....\u597d\u597d\u73a9.....\u753b\u98ce\u5f88\u827a\u672f....BGM\u914d\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u8da3.........\u7269\u8d85\u6240\u503c....\u5f3a\u70c8\u5efa\u8bae\u6253\u6298\u5165\nPS\uff1a\u56de\u5230\u6b63\u9898....\u5361\u771f\u503c\u94b1....\n", "timestamp_created": 1458746927, "timestamp_updated": 1458746927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21979573": {"recommendationid": "21979573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032582818", "num_games_owned": 1578, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458286155}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0441\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043a, \u043d\u043e \u043a \u0441\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"Blockwick 2\" \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0430\u043c, \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u044e \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0442\u0443\u043f\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0448\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0443. \n\n\u0418\u0434\u0435\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 -

STRONGLY recommend if you like that kind of puzzle.\n\nI never played the (mobile only?) original, so the title and developer were unfamiliar to me, and I don't know exactly which features were already present in that first entry.\n\nThe premise is fairly simple: join like-colored blocks together in contiguous groups (white blocks are the neutral exception).\n\nThis game does something that many puzzle games (at least on Steam) often overlook: offering several different puzzle gimmicks, easing you into them, and giving you lots of different use cases for each one without getting repetitive. Each specialty block concept has a set of 16 stages dedicated to exploring how that block can function. Once you've mastered a specialty block, that block type might make an appearance in a later zone, so you'll get to see how it interacts with (or obstructs) your current block type.\n\nSome stages feature huge blocks that are difficult to maneuver; others are claustrophic - loaded up with so many blocks that there's very little room to move; others are partitioned into multiple rooms that don't connect but must function together.\n\nPuzzles are unlocked in sequence, but the devs have mercifully included, in every level, a hidden pearl that will allow you to skip to the next puzzle if you get stuck (though even if you don't get stuck, you might want to seek them out anyway). A puzzle is considered \"solved\" once all the colors are grouped, but each puzzle also has a \"true\" solution which requires solving the puzzle while all 3 of the floor's glyph spaces are occupied by a colored block. This is a nice added challenge for the compulsive completionists.\n\nThe \"Basics\" level pack has also been added in, bringing an additional 144 puzzles. Basics puzzles are less complex and don't make use of all the specialty block types (which is fine!), but they do have glyphs and pearls.\n\nThe visual style is clean and bright. The art isn't cluttered, so you're able to keep your focus on the blocks. The backgrounds are just slightly tinted, and you can differentiate between the white blocks and the \"island\" walls. The music is pleasant and ambient but not boring. There's a surprising number of tracks in the soundtrack, too. I wouldn't have expected a block puzzle game to have 18 different tracks. Here's [u][url=https://kiefferbros.bandcamp.com/album/blockwick-2-soundtrack]the Bandcamp page[/url][/u] for the soundtrack, if you want to hear more than what's in the demo video.\n\nNote: I don't know if this game (as of this writing) will be accessible to colorblind players. I haven't seen any colorblindness options in the menu, and differentiating color is an absolutely integral part of every puzzle. Many of the colors appear to be roughly similar in value, so they might not be very distinguishable in greyscale.\n\nIllumination out of ten.", "timestamp_created": 1458397515, "timestamp_updated": 1459508979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21907995": {"recommendationid": "21907995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001072955", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458698871}, "language": "english", "review": "  With its subtle cleverness, Blockwick 2 has surprised and delighted me.

(You can connect them anyway on the level and feel proud too, you won't just \"illuminate\" the level.)\n\nDevelopers made a definitely great work on level design and overall game design, it feels really polished, and both relaxing and stressful, depending on your patience with harder levels and illumination.

The game starts you off with a very short tutorial even before you get to the main menu. Levels are unlocked sequentially, and you can either progress the easy way (move blocks around until you find the moon pearl), solve a puzzle by making all blocks of the same color touch (interesting when there's more than one color), or you can find and cover up 3 mysterious floor marks with your solution pattern (illumination). This can get tricky because for some reason those marks are in hard-to-reach places - I wonder why. ;-) There are also special blocks in later levels to keep things interesting, but I find that even with the not-so-special blocks, the levels are very well crafted and not boring.\n\nThe interface looks clean and never gets in the way: since you have these three levels of completing a puzzle, you tend to want to keep fiddling with it after you solve it to get the illumination, and the game lets you do that. It simply never pushes an intrusive \"you're done now\" window in your face, but it does let you know when you've solved it in an unmistakable way. There is no timer or move counter to bug you, you get the task done (or not) and move on. This probably plays well on smartphone screens, but it plays equally well with mouse control: the precision comes in handy when you need to funnel small objects through narrow spaces.\n\nThis game distills everything that's enjoyable about block-moving games in one colorful package. If you enjoy this kind of puzzle, there's no need to wait for a sale: Blockwick 2 is well worth its price.\n\n[i]The game contains 160 base levels and another 144 levels from a \"basics\" set that is slightly easier.

This is a secret). \n\nThere's also a secondary objective, in which you must beat all the levels with your blocks covering the runes makings, so you reach the \"illuminated\" rank. Trying to get all 160 levels illuminated will certainly keep you entertained for a good amount of hours!\n\nThe game is originally an application for smartphones (which I also recommend), but this Steam port is well done, and playing with a mouse is very pleasant - but if you've got a touchscreen computer, it's all for the best!\n\nThere's really not much to say about [i]Blockwick 2[/i].

If your looking for a game to challenge you to your limits; look no further! Blockwick 2 is a perfect blend of challenge and fun and allows players to decide for themselves how difficult the game is. If you just want to have fun and pass the time a little bit you can just find the moon pearls and solve the puzzles. I enjoyed just listening to the music and admiring the artwork while I solved the puzzles. There is also another way to play the game; now I may just be really bad at puzzle games, but I found this way to be very difficult. If you are a huge fan of puzzle games or are a completionist and want a real challenge, try illuminating all of the puzzles. By not only placing the blocks next to each other, but also lighting up the symbols on the floor you essentially 100% the level. The game is very rewarding when you finally beat a level, and seeing the cleared, illuminated chapter screens is a very satisfying sight. The duality of this game; being a fun and casual puzzle game, and being a great challenge by going for 100% completion makes it perfect for anyone to enjoy! 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1435348548, "timestamp_updated": 1435348586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16712785": {"recommendationid": "16712785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000736402", "num_games_owned": 1676, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482209527}, "language": "english", "review": "Blockwick is an excellent, challenging, relaxing puzzle game.

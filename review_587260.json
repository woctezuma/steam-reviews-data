"Tokyo Xanadu is an interesting fusion of ideas from different Falcom games, and this mix (while imperfect) works very well.  Its core structure is reminiscent of Trails of Cold Steel, and combat falls somewhere between Ys VII and VIII (closer to VIII) in style.  Its dungeons are quite varied in layout and design, although few are long enough to take more than 20 minutes to complete -- an intentional decision to encourage brisk speedruns and portability.\n\nStory wise, while the plot is generally more predictable than most other Falcom games outside of a handful of well-done twists, characterization is excellent and the cast is extremely likable.  Minor characters and NPCs are given the same sort of plot lines as can be seen in Trails/Kiseki, and many of these can be quite endearing as they develop over the course of the game.\n\nThe music is, of course, fantastic.  It's exactly what you'd expect from Falcom Sound Team, with a number of really outstanding dungeon tracks that will get you pumped for another go.  If you enjoy Falcom music, you'll have nothing to complain about on this front.\n\nThe port itself is quite good, and there are few technical issues to write home about.  There is a 60fps cap, but frame pacing is excellent and it is a very rock solid 60; most people on modern systems should never see frame drops.  It is also quite stable; I've only had one crash in close to 90 hours playing it.\n\nFull Disclosure: I was a beta tester for this game and as such received a free copy for testing.

Music is good. The assets are mid-tier so graphics and effects are not going to wow you. The story is mostly fine and have enough twists and turns to be entertaining even if you can see what's coming. As usual with Falcom, it is the whole that is more than the sum of its parts. \n\nNote to those who don't like reading. Lots of reading plus it is original Japanese speech with subtitles. No dub. \n\nThe good: \n[list]\n[*]A decently long adventure. I think the original release would had been lacking but the eX+ additions add a lot. \n[*]The episode format breaks things up into nice chunks so it doesn't drag too much, other than a couple of chapters that are a bit long in the middle. \n[*]Simple action that seems a bit too basic at first but actually flows well. \n[*]The well-fleshed out characters and NPCs you expect from Falcom (whether you like them or not is a matter of taste). \n[*]Some really nice voice-work for several of the characters! \n[*]Solid PC port. Nothing remarkable but was stable and ran well for my entire game. \n[*]Falcom music goodness! \n[*]More Towa! Maybe this is fan-service but she was a fun character nevertheless. \n[/list]\n\nThe kinda alright:\n[list]\n[*]A very middling localisation/translation. The first half was mostly fine but it may be Aksys didn't give it enough resources and ran out of time. The dialogue and translation becomes increasingly bad after the mid-point, with some parts \"all over the place\". Overall, I can only call it 'adequate', which is a shame because the start was pretty OK. \n[*]Some chapters drag a bit, especially if you want to run around to talk to everyone to avoid missing anything. \n[*]A couple of sudden difficulty spikes. Overall (on Normal) I had no trouble but the hard parts were a bit of a sudden shock. \n[*]Torn about how to judge this but for some parts, there is no text box and with the speech still in Japanese, it means unless you understand that a bit you won't know what they are saying. \n[/list]\n\nThe bad: \n[list]\n[*]I am not too particular about translations (whether you keep honourifics or not, or literal or not) but the number of *chortle* and *giggle* just got a bit much. Again, the start didn't seem quite as bad but and yes, I am sure that's how it is in the original Japanese but it was too much towards the end. \n[*]The camera hates you, especially in some of the later dungeons. It becomes pot-luck if the camera will decide to mess around and you end up fight it, the controls, and the monsters at the same time. \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1515271109, "timestamp_updated": 1515271175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39127450": {"recommendationid": "39127450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065477713", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1079, "last_played": 1515805311}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, it is a good game!\n\nI enjoyed very much the soundtrack\nThe combat system recalls me to a more sophisticated version of the Ys series\n\nThe only problem, at least for me, in this game are the conversations.

As such, it pains me to say that I honestly don't like Tokyo Xanadu very much.  I've tried to give it a fair chance and have pushed myself to play it, but I'm just not enjoying it.\n\nPeople have sometimes called it a \"combination of Ys and Trails of Cold Steel,\" and that's true, except it combined the worst parts of both.  The plot moves at a glacier's pace; every chapter follows the same formula of one of your friends getting into trouble, getting sucked into a portal into another dimension, you have to go rescue them, and then their personal problems are fixed.  Each chapter is bookended by a few mysterious characters doing mysterious things that you're supposed to be intrigued by, but the answers to the mysteries are not nearly as interesting as they lead you to believe.  The out-of-combat gameplay is very Trails-like, in that there are countless NPCs you're expected to talk to between every scene, except rather than being set in an interesting fantasy world, TX is set in modern Japan; if you've ever watched an anime series featuring high school students, you'll automatically recognize all of the tropes.  There's nothing new here.  Occasionally something interesting will happen at the end of a chapter, but then it's right back to the mundane.\n\nThe gameplay is decent, but not up to the level of any Ys game.  Movement and action are relatively slow; there are many characters you can play as, but each character has a very limited move set, and most of the characters' move sets are very similar to each other.  There's a wide variety of accessories you can equip to increase characters' stats and upgrade their abilities, but none of them offer any fundamental changes to the gameplay.  Palette-swapped enemies fill every dungeon, and after a while you'll even start running into palette-swapped bosses, which would have been inexcusable for an Ys game.  The Ys games are great because they're short and sweet and constantly throwing new things at you, but TX felt the need to pad out its gameplay enough to match the padded-out story, and it didn't go well.  In chapter 6, near the end of the game, I went through two entire dungeons in order so that I could fix an alarm clock and a broken TV.  They were both filled with enemies I had killed a dozen hours before.  Yawn.  I could have done a speed run of Ys: The Oath in Felghana in that time.\n\nIf you've played every other Falcom game on Steam and are jonesing for more, TX might give you what you want, if you can handle pushing through the boring parts.

But after completing the game (and all the extra content) in its entirety I can honestly say it's definitely worth the price tag for the amount of content you get. \n\nPlaying through the story is sort of like watching an anime set in the modern era with fantasy elements--- one that you would normally rate a 7/10 in your book. Solid, but hardly innovative in the genre. However the same story presented and executed well in video game format warrants this particular one a 9/10 in my book. Again, whilst it does nothing innovative in the genre in terms of storytelling, it does execute it in such a way that makes the story worth more than it is on paper.\n\nMany reviews have compared this to the Persona series and the Ys, and while I can't attest to it being similar to the latter (due to not having played any of the Ys games), it does have the makings of a Persona game in terms of how characters interact with one another, as well as the tropes used in said interactions. \n\nCombat is simple yet fulfilling when you play the game 'right'. With the player skill cap mostly coming from how you deal with the bosses and less about each character's (similar yet slightly different) mechanics. Grinding can get tiring as most of the dungeon monsters can be regarded as 'fillers' but I find the story was enough to keep me going-- and me being me, I didn't want to be 'weak' when it came down to fighting the bosses. \n\nAs someone who is interested in the world-building aspects of video games in general, I do hope that the developers continue this \"Xanadu\" world which they've built-- as the game leaves a lot of room for more stories to be told. Hopefully more people pay attention to this game and with luck, we'll get to see Nihon Falcom deliver more of it for us in the future-- perhaps with different characters in other parts of the Xanadu world.\n\nAll in all a well rounded package if you like an ARPG with a Persona style characters and tropes. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1514955003, "timestamp_updated": 1514955003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552770", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38996984": {"recommendationid": "38996984", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990641136", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514850835}, "language": "english", "review": "So i've only got 11 hours into this game, and roughly to Chapter 4 so take anything I say with a grain of salt.\n\nI like the game, its got interesting characters, and a cool \"world\" to explore.

[/h1]\n\nNihon Falcom... They're one of the Developers I like the most when it comes to JRPG's.\nStory is super deep - Characters will attach you more and more - you'll feel .. complete.\nCharacters/NPC's are the main part of Xanadu. If you've played any Nihon Falcom Game you'll know what I'm talking about when I say: \"They have a huge depth\". Characters ALWAYS tells you something new, something refreshing. Story is somewhat predictable but at some point in the Game it will hit you right in the feelings.\n\nGameplay-wise this is top-knotch. It felt a little bit weird when i started my first Playthrough but I got into it faster than I thought.  You don't need a super Pc to run this. It's a fun game overall. You get RPG elements: recipe, relationships,equipements, weapons and powers. But they are not that deep and the upgrade path follow closely the story and is pretty much linear. \n\nMost of the Cutscenes are fun to watch and the skipping function works well too. \n\nWith Xanadu [h1] Ex+ [/h1] You get the Definitive Version auf Xanadu. With Ex+ You'll get the \"After Story\". 6 Hours of extra content, just got added into this Version. Nihon Falcom always provides the best Version for us on PC - so Thanks to That!  :-)\n\nThe texture can be basic at times but that doesnt' concern me since I've played nearly every Game from them.\n\nI've played Xanadu after Cold Steel 1, and I would sugguest you to do the same. There are some Characters which will be seen in the Game from Cold Steel 1.\n\nXanadu is a Story in its own, so You wont loose anything by instantly going into it. You just get a better View overall if you have played Cold Steel first.\n\n[h1]\n\nits a Mix of \n\n- Persona\n- Trail of Cold Steel\n- Ys\n\n[/h1]\n\nin one Game. I kinda like that and I really hope you'll like that too.\n\nWith every Chapter + After Story and True Ending I got 51 Hours.

There are also social links. You can only choose a few people to spend your time with per chapter it seems.\n\nIt is Y's like due to the gameplay of the battles. The battles are an ARPG style similar to Y's 7 or 8. Each of your characters have an element that they use and some enemies in the dungeon are weak to that element. You can switch between three different party members while you are in the dungeon. That means you can customize your party for each dungeon and switch as you come across different enemies. \n\nCon's\n\nThe dungeons are kinda stale in style.

So far, this is perhaps the only JRPG with a modern urban fantasy setting in the PC market and that makes it unique to some extent [b](If anyone has any reccomendations for more such urban fantasy JRPGs for the PC, feel free to leave suggestions. I love the genre and would love to play more)[/b].\n\nFirst off, yes, the game borrows heavily from Persona in terms of some settings but the similarities end about halfway into the first chapter. The biggest change being that the protagonist here has a well-defined personality and is not a blank slate unlike in the Persona games. Other obvious differences include the action combat, the way the bonding events take place and of course, the packaging of the game. The game also goes the extra mile of fleshing out the NPCs, on whom you can collect trivia which will flesh out their characters throughout the entire length of the game.\n\nThe packaging is the best part of this game, as every chapter is its own self-contained story arc which has one of the playbable characters as the focus but also advances the overarching plot. Every chapter has its prologue and an epilogue which is followed up immediately by an interlude like Side Story. These Side Stories are short episodes featuring the characters other than the main playable character which give a definitive end to their individual story arcs. These also set up the [spoiler]After Story Plot[/spoiler] as well as flesh out the characters as individuals. However, the main plot develops these same characters as a collective. Every chapter also has an opening theme, making the chapters feel like episodes of an anime (which was a major appeal to me, I admit) and is a signature of other Falcom games as well.\n\nThe plot and setting are quite intriguing, placing the players in a world fraught with mystery and intrigue filled with esoteric organizations springing around an unexplained phenomenon called \"The Eclipse\". The main characters decide to unravel the mystery after they are inadvertently drawn into a series of incidents which may have connections to an event [spoiler](Tokyo Earthquake/Tokyo Twilight Disaster)[/spoiler] that happened 10 years ago in the game's timeline. The lore is rich and the enemy designs are pretty good.\n\nThe game is fairly long and like me, if you take time playing the various mini-games (there are a LOT and some even have great prizes like master cores and helpful elements) and farming materials for upgrades and equipment, it will take quite a bit of time. The eX+ in the title isn't just for show either as the game has a very pronounced post-game content along with a new game+ mode that has extra dungeons not found in the first playthrough. The music and the three songs featured in the game are good.\n\nFinally, the localization might be spotty at places but it is still enjoyable and some of the translations have quite the comedic value (both intentional and unintentional, Aksys employees love the Cthulhu mythos and World of Darkness). Other miscellaneous additions include the boss rush mode where you can replay the boss battles in the game. The Gallery and Character Viewer are also fun additions.\n\nOverall, for the asking price Tokyo Xanadu eX+ is engaging and enjoyable. This is the true definitive edition of Tokyo Xanadu and comes with all associated bells and whistles so the DLCs (which are atrociously priced) can be igonred without issue. That's about it, I guess. Hopefully, we get a sequel for this sometime soon.", "timestamp_created": 1514300850, "timestamp_updated": 1514301101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38679691": {"recommendationid": "38679691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034856755", "num_games_owned": 1334, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1515368183}, "language": "english", "review": "Tokyo Xanadu eX+ is a Action RPG by Nihon Falcom, best known for the Legend of Heroes series and the Ys Series, that is certainly not their best work and has its fair share of flaws however in the it it still manages to be a good game that is fun to play.\n\nThe gameplay can be described as Ys with (I have not played Ys 8 yet so this based on the old series that are on Steam) extra resources to spend in battle along with the inventory system of Legend of Heroes.\nThis does cause that the game can feel quite easy at times, I was playing on hard, since the only limit on items is the 99 cap and a cooldown on certain difficulties.\n\nIt also has an orbment system alike to the Legend of Heroes series, mostly to the Cold Steel entries although with the names altered. Also has cooking and several mini-games inside the game. The Dungeons are very basic most of them are just simple \"go down this corridor, kill some mobs and then get to the boss\" with sometimes \"oh yeah press these buttons on the way\" so there isn't much to write about this. What is fun is how the game plays and the feeling of going fast and killing a lot of enemies.\n\nStory wise, The story is not bad but it does suffer from an abundance of generic anime cliches that make the story quite predictable in places, the characters are the strong point of the narrative though that is a pattern with some of Falcom's games. But at least in my opinion it does things worse than those games. Also might get a bit formulaic at times.\n\nHowever, and while this is a Falcom standard, what I really do appreciate is the huge amount of NPC flavor text and whilst the quests that the game has are quite few compared to other RPG's with open world elements, the quests that are there are interesting since they often times offer a mini-story that affects things in the world and even has effects for longer then just right after doing the quest.\n\nGraphically it is pretty standard, nothing to write home about I personally enjoy this style and I wouldn't mind if the graphical levels didn't change. The options for this game are rather lackluster compared to other Falcom games but this is a port by a company that doesn't really do PC ports that often and whilst barebones it does run solid at 1080p60fps on my machine.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good but that is to be expected from Falcom since they just have a way with soundtracks.\nAksys Games translated this game and whilst I did notice some irregularities(and I generally don't pay attention to those) on the surface level it seems like they translated it just fine(though serious from \"this is our final stage lets do this or something\" to \"this is it\" is a bit.... lackluster I suppose?).\n\n- Should you buy this game?\nThe amount of content that this game has to offer is good for current price point but that only applies if you like it.\nRight now I'd say it is a hard sell if you aren't a fan of Nihon Falcom or if you haven't played most of the flagship titles by Falcom that are on Steam(Trails in the Sky, Cold Steel and Ys series).\nHowever if you are a fan of the games they have made, then I'd say the game currently is worth it at the price. Even more if you buy via humble bundle if you have a monthly subscription.\nOtherwise, I'd say buy the flagship titles of Nihon before this one because they excel at certain points where this game is good to great at those points.\n\nIf the legend of heroes/ys was an 9/10 then this game is a 7,5 due to some issues in areas that make it inferior to either of them but whilst providing both of them.

The story is entertaining enough, city environment looks detailed, cool music, the voice actors do a pretty good job with the characters, punching monsters in the face with different characters with their unique abilities is satisfying.\n\nHowever the dungeons themselfs look kinda empty with nothing really going on, \"Punch this switch and a door opens\".\nI only have played Ys origins, 3 and 7 and to me, dungeons in those games have a better design in my opinion.\nBoss fights are cool though.\n\nAlso, why hiding some of the side quests and events? To encourage the player to explore the city and talk to people? I like to do side quests and such but running back and forward all over the place I was before every time just to check if something new happened is quite annoying. It seems some events will only happend if you do certain side quests first.\n\nOverall, the story and combat are pretty solid but the dungeons and some characters are not that interesting.\nI don't regret my purchase but I don't feel like it's worth the 60\u20ac.

I waited almost 2 years for it to get localized and it did not disappoint me in the slightest. The PC port is really well optimized. I'm sure low end PCs will have no problem running it although there is a lack of graphical settings I'd still say It's a great port. My favorite part is the gameplay. The combat system is kinda similar to zwei!! at first but later as you unlock more characters it becomes unique. with that said, the combat is amazing. I had a lot of fun with it. The bonding system is the same as Trails of Cold Steel. You can spend time with characters every chapter by watching their bonding episodes and improve your bond with them. It's the same as ToCS really. The game is similar to persona in regard that you spend 70% of the game talking, watching cutscenes, doing side-quests in the city or playing a mini-game and 30% in combat or dungeon exploration. There is a lot of talking in this game even by falcom's standards. so be prepared for that.\n\nThe story is somewhat predictable. Not saying it's bad It's just that it lacks any plot twist until the final chapter. It has great character development. Even the characters you may not like at first start to grow on you as you play the story. Like every falcom game, the NPCs are amazing. You can really connect with them nicely if you talk to them every chapter. The same opening plays after every chapter which kinda gives a feeling that you're playing a shounen anime. It's really nice. It also has a really satisfying and heartwarming ending. Overall while the story is not anything mind blowing, It's still really nice for an RPG.\n\nLike every falcom game the soundtrack is great. No complaints there. For an RPG this game has a decent amount of content. In 80+ hours I completed main story + Epilogue + After story, did every side-quest, Talked to every NPC every chapter and completed most mini-games.\n\nFinal Score: 9/10 If you wanna scratch that Falcom itch or just wanna play a good dialogue heavy action RPG.

What was substantial was pretty good though. Combat system is pretty neat.\n\nHonestly if you're looking at this store page and this review chances are you're in to this sort of game and if you're in to this sort of game (like me) then you'll love it without me having to sing any praises.\n\n-Visual are pretty good.\n-Character seem pretty interesting.\n-Japanese VO only (Might be a seller for some, detterent for others. I personally don't care either way)\n-Sound track is ok-ish. Same sorta deal for this kinda game really.\n- Nice ballance of RPG elements, Action and social elements surprisingly enough.\n\nHere is how the game goes so far from my few hours of play:\n\n-Anime Tiddies gets pulled in to some kind of rift\n-You must go in to the rift\n-Kill everything in the rift\n-Save anime tiddies\n-Repeat\n\nThere's a story of course and it's a pretty good one so far.\n\nIt does have a bug though. The only one I have encountered so far is with rebinding keys if you're using a controler. For example I wanted to change the (A) button to jump rather than attack so I did but then suddenly I was locked in menus.The  (A) became the button to confirm an option and back out of an option. It seems changing the keybinds for in game combat/exploration changes the keybinds for menu navigation too even though it does not say anything about doing that when you are changing them.\n\nThere's also a lack of graphics options as in \"There aren't any graphics options at all\". It doesn't really need them though I suppose. Its not exactly a demanding game.\n\nNOTE: This is a very -VERY- story heavy game. If you're looking to play just for the combat you'll be sorely dissapointed as the combat to story ratio heavily favours story elements.", "timestamp_created": 1513735584, "timestamp_updated": 1513932633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38427177": {"recommendationid": "38427177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093984780", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 336, "last_played": 1515851257}, "language": "schinese", "review": "PS4\u548cPSV\u53cc\u767d\u91d1\u8def\u8fc7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u8bf4", "timestamp_created": 1513676555, "timestamp_updated": 1513676555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38396561": {"recommendationid": "38396561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260946244", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514956592}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game\nGood Gameplay\nAmazing Story\nCool Design\n", "timestamp_created": 1513592956, "timestamp_updated": 1513592956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38392536": {"recommendationid": "38392536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132233832", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514808054}, "language": "schinese", "review": "FALCOM\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u53ea\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1513571077, "timestamp_updated": 1513571077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38392278": {"recommendationid": "38392278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076668755", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513878695}, "language": "english", "review": "Tokyo Xanadu has a Kiseiki-like content-rich story and a SOLID action-based battle system, both are not groundbreaking but enjoyable enough.

A common one, but shallow, as the commonalities start disappearing well into the first act.  Progression is closer to the way Cold Steel does it, and combat is completely different, more akin to Ys. Also has decent, rebindable controls for both controller & kb/m , although I can't comment much on kb/m.\nMusic-wise, this game obviously delivers, with Falcom's JDK team continuing to make rock-solid music pieces that generally fit the tone and enhance an already great game.\n\nLocalization-wise,  the game is sub-only. The translation is still a bit spotty, but should be far ahead of the VITA version, at the very least.\nPort-wise, it mostly delivers on the basics. 1080p60 with reports of the game doing 4k with not too much trouble. If you're expecting a \"Cold Steel\" quality port with Durante magic in it, you will come out disappointed, as aside from resolution, it's a match-4-match with the PS4 version.\n\n\nAlthough the game is a tad bit pricey, I still think the asking price is worth it, if you have the money,at least. This only applies to the main game, the DLC is preposterously pricey and I confess I'm rather surprised Aksys went with that value, specially for the basic cheat ones.", "timestamp_created": 1513391953, "timestamp_updated": 1513391953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38336954": {"recommendationid": "38336954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095539926", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 603, "last_played": 1516423991}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished this game, and gotta say its amazingly done.

You'll get into it in no time. Plus it's like watching an anime, that's really the sensation that I got while playing this game.\n\nFree time is a lot like the free time you got in the Persona series, you have a \"bonding time\" with other characters, you get to know your friends better that's really interesting. But this isn't Persona, you won't get an insane amount of free time. Actually you're just playing few days.\nYou can also walk freely in various places, there's some littles things to do, there's a lot of npc moving around it gives you the impression that you're living there, it's very lively. And even randoms npcs has some backgrounds.\n\nThe combat is fast paced, each characters has their own style (slow attacks but hits like a truck or fast light damages for exemple). You don't need to grind in this game, that's something I like. Overall the combat system is pretty fun. Bosses can be tricky/challenging if you're on a high difficulty but you have your best weapon : The roll. It makes you INVINCIBLE for a short time rolling into an attack nullifies it (even lasers) and you can spam it there's no stamina, time it well and you'll destroy everything (there's also an element that can enhance the duration of the invincibility if you're bad at this), it's pretty fun to read bosses attacks/pattern. But in the end it's fairly easy.\n\nThe OST has some nice epic tracks, but what did you expect ?

I'm enjoying the story and characters, I adore the music, and the action-RPG gameplay is great.\n\nIt absolutely is Persona-inspired in terms of setup. In fact, some of the camera angles in the school building are so close to Yasogami High School from Persona 4 that I'm surprised more people haven't noticed.\n\nHowever, it doesn't feel like a rip-off as a game. Nihon Falcom took Persona's world building and fused it into their own style of story telling and gameplay, and I really like the result.  \n\nI'm a huge fan of the Persona series but its turn-based combat is definitely not my favorite part about it. \nWhile I'm not going to try to claim that Tokyo Xanadu's story so is better than Persona 3, 4, & 5 (Atlus are probably the best at what they do) but it's good enough that I'm actively enjoying it rather than simply tolerating it. The fact that I enjoy the combat as well means at no point am I just waiting to get through one aspect of the game to hurry on to the next.\n\nI discovered this game by chance. I've seen almost no marketing for it so I'm worried it won't reach all of its potential audience in the West. It seems to have sold \"ok\" in Japan, so I really hope Nihon Falcom and Aksys Games both exceed or at least meet their sales expectations. \n\nI really want Tokyo Xanadu to continue. It doesn't need to be the same characters or continuity (in fact I hear the ending of this one is pretty definitive), but Nihon Falcom is off to a great start with this new IP and I want to see the results of them taking time to refine what they've created here.\n\n(Also, I'm fine with them continuing to make it for handheld. If that means the series will continue to be graphically minimalist, I'm good. A great art style/aesthetic and sharpness is more imporant than realistic graphics anyway. \nIn fact, Nihon Falcom - it seems like this would be a great game to port over to the Switch as well.)", "timestamp_created": 1513269739, "timestamp_updated": 1513269821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647053", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38299807": {"recommendationid": "38299807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114028344", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514215877}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud50c\uc2a4 \ud310\uc744 \ud50c\ub798\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub534 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c PC\ud310\uc774 \ub098\uc654\ub2e4\uace0 \ud574\uc11c \uc0c0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uad1c\ucc2e\uace0 \ud55c\uae00\uc774 \uc548\ub098\uc624\uae30\ub294 \ud55c\ub370 \ud50c\uc2a4\ud310 \ud588\ub358 \ub290\ub08c\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c\ub4e0 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8 \ub098\uc628\uac70\uace0 \ud314\ucf64 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1\ud55c \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \ucc38\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uac13\uac9c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uc774 \uc0ac\uc591\uba39\ub294\uac83\ub300\ube44 \ud6c4\uc9c4\uc810\uc774 \uc880 \uc548\ud0c0\uae5d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1513253327, "timestamp_updated": 1513253397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38295752": {"recommendationid": "38295752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128122149", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 1516345299}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u771f\u7684\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4e1c\u4eac\u8ff7\u57ce\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u662f\u95ea\u4e4b\u8f68\u8ff92\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u548c\u4f0a\u82cf\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f81\u7eca\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u95ea\u8f68\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7f81\u7eca\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u53ef\u4ee5\u653e\u5fc3\u53bb\u968f\u4fbf\u653b\u7565[spoiler]\uff08\u53cd\u6b63\u5b98\u65b9\u6307\u5b9a\u660e\u65e5\u9999\u548c\u681e\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4e3b\u89d2\u9009\u7684\u8c01\uff09[/spoiler]\u3002\u6709\u5927\u4f6c\u6709\u6c49\u5316\u5417\uff0c\u754c\u9762\u82f1\u8bed\u5565\u90fd\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\u5927\u4f6c\u522b\u55b7\u6211\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1513233801, "timestamp_updated": 1513233801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38293972": {"recommendationid": "38293972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107032449", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514168724}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Se tu gosta de persona este e fortin.", "timestamp_created": 1513224671, "timestamp_updated": 1513224671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438066", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38293858": {"recommendationid": "38293858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039020399", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513223790}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is very persona like but unique in its own way.

If you're a Falcom fan, I definitely recommend this game to you; story-telling is solid with a lot of entertaining NPC dialogues, doesn't require grinding a lot, very likable characters, and world-building that makes you feel like that you're living in there etc.... Don't expect nothing less from the company with 40 years of RPG developing experience. Scenario really need to learn how to write more creative side stories because this kind of feels like the extension of trails of cold steel but with slightly better graphics and characters.", "timestamp_created": 1512954106, "timestamp_updated": 1512954106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38224366": {"recommendationid": "38224366", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995128549", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513725395}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1512951938, "timestamp_updated": 1512951938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38223215": {"recommendationid": "38223215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351261361", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513950535}, "language": "english", "review": "ever played Trails of Cold Steel? ever played YS? ever thought what if we can throw ARCUS into YS?\nFalcom's got the answer for you\nand Aksys manages to get the game in English! woohoo!\nBeing a Falcom game, you can expect quite a lot of content\n\nhowever, as you can guess, seeing as the game does not take years to localize, you're not getting ~80 hours per gameplay like Trails do (assuming you try to do everything)\naside from that, Aksys might want to get the game under a little more editing, I can find some inconsistencies:\n1. the store clerk saying that our protag is a third year (protip - he's second year)\n2. somewhere there's a... right, the most common mistake ever made these days... you're as your\n3. sometime before the final boss battle, that's this line Mitsuki said... in question, yet is totally a statement in her text. gosh\nthere are a few hiccups here and there but that does not make the game any less amazing!\n\n*updated since I just went through the true ending:\nAksys, \"According to the keikaku\" is so not funny here.

But it's also really good. It's got good writing, music, and the gameplay (once you're not talking to all the amazing npcs, which you should be doing) is pretty fun too, it's a nice balance of being simple to learn, tough to git gud. And they fixed the localisation mostly compared to the vita version! So now that's pretty good too, a few minor things aside. (Nothing immersion breaking, trust me. It's mostly in the tutorial graphic things? I assume they were more difficult to change for the localisation team.)\n\nI'll probably come back and add an in-depth review once I've finished the game, but I'd recommend it to anyone who likes good writing, or any of the Ys games (as an example), or any of the games I joked about earlier.

This will definitely be something you want to pick up if you\u2019re a fan of Nihon Falcom in general.\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1512760320, "timestamp_updated": 1512760320, "voted_up": true,

I never played the original release as I'm strictly a PC gamer, so I was able to come into this title with no expectations and a clear, level head.\n\n---\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nThe story and cast of characters are engaging and really grabbed my attention. I didn't expect the story to go the way it did and every time I thought it was over, something else happened and it continued. Most of the characters had a decent amount of growth, except the main character. He basically stuck with his original personality throughout the entire game (not a complaint). \n\nGame performance was consistent and enjoyable throughout my entire playthrough of the game, the true ending and the eX+ content. I held an extremely smooth and consistent 60fps the entire time with my system. 4790k/290x/16gb\n\nNow for the bad stuff:\n\nUntil you get accustomed to the controls, the combat can feel a bit clunky. Somewhere between a fast paced version of Cold Steel and a slower clunkier version of Ys. Once you get used to it, it becomes much more enjoyable.\n\nThe story had a few slower moments, but they were few and far between.\n\nNot enough time spent with Rion. Just sayin'.\n\n---\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nWith this being a remaster/port of a 2 year old game, I honestly cannot justify the $60 price tag. It's an excellent game, but it's several years old at this point and honestly it deserves something more like a $40 MSRP because of this. If you're interested in the genre and/or Falcom games in general, go buy it. It's totally worth it. \n\nRion best girl.", "timestamp_created": 1512746678, "timestamp_updated": 1512746678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512682",

Falcom has a way of taking generic settings, ideas, and sterotypes found in other mediums, and taking them that one step futher to create something genuinely stunning and unforgettable. \n\nTokyo Xanadu has an interesting premise no doubt, however that's not to say that the story is comparable to that of Falcom's flagship Trails series. Though interesting enough, the story boils down to (for the most part) episodic sequences that contain slice-of-life moments, an introduction or reveal that leads to the climax, the climax, and finally a wrap up of the chapter (pretty similar to Cold Steel 1). Though great in its own right, just don't expect anything quite [i]that[/i] amazing.\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\nThink Ys with slower paced combat. The Trails series, with near identical story and character progression. This game for the most part, follows the same three day story structure each chapter. [b]Day one[/b] is your slice-of-life wandering around areas doing quests and whatever. [b]Day two[/b] is the lead up or climax of the chapter, and [b]day three[/b] is the conclusion to the chapter. \n\nTokyo Xanadu, like Ys, takes an action combat approach to the game, and oh boy does it get fun. Once you get past the tutorial dungeons, you'll be speeding through corridors, slaying enemies left and right, switching out party members, all the while in pursuit of the dungeon's boss.\n\n[h1][u]Graphics & Presentation[/u][/h1]\nI am blown away by the amount of detail Falcom have put into their world. From the bookstores and hardware stores in Station Street, to the Arcades and Florist in the entertainment district and Brick Alley respectively. If you have played through any of Falcom's previous titles you [i]will[/i] no doubt find amusing and downright in-your-face references left and right. This also includes bonding scenes! [spoiler]Towa has one where she makes Kou help with her shopping, only to make Kou carry an abundant amount of bags. This is followed by her stating that she claims to have done something similar before, like deja vu...(Cold Steel I reference)[/spoiler]\n\nGraphic wise, there's not much to coment on. It's pretty good for a HD remaster and quite the bit better than Cold Steel I and II, while falling behind CSIII. It might not blow anyone's mind, but at least the expressions are there, and there are some pretty impressive character models.\n\n[h1][u]The PC Port[/u][/h1]\nThis time around, Aksys teamed up with Ghostlight to create the port. I can safely say that this game runs like a dream on my i3 6100 GTX 1060 3GB at 1080p and yes, that is overkill. I have seen reports of this game running on 5 year old laptops with minimal frame drops @60fps. \n\nTranslation wise, Aksys have taken it upon themselves to look over the script from the Vita version and for the most part, I have had absolutely no complaints about the translation quality. With the help of the beta testers, most if not all grammar and text errors should have been ironed out. I wouldn't say that it is to the standards we've all come to expect out of  XSEED, but nothing I have come across so far has taken away from my enjoyment.\n\n[h1][u]The Not-So-Good[/u][/h1]\n- The enemy targeting system can feel - at times - clunky, preventing you from locking onto your desired target.\n- Dungeon design. Though each main dungeon has its own defining aesthetic, the designs are straightforward, with the occasional branching corridor. \n- The button combos to do certain actions can be a bit too sensitive(?). For example, when trying to air dash across gaps, you may end up charging up an aerial spin attack with Kou.\n- The linear story progression may start to show its wear. Going back to square one and etc..\n\n[h1]Final Score: 8.5/10\nIf you love Falcom or more dialogue heavy games with damn good OSTs and addicting gameplay, picking this game up is a no brainer.

diff\u00e9rents d'un monde \u00e0 un autre cela donne une bonne ambiance au jeu.\nJe mettrai un 8/10 pour le Gameplay\n\nL'optimisation/Performances/Graphismes : \nc'est un jeu qui ne demande pas beaucoup de ressources, je l'ai fait tourner sans probl\u00e8mes avec mon AsusROG G752 .\nTr\u00e8s fluide mais pendant les petites cin\u00e9matiques.\nLes graphismes sont tr\u00e8s enfantins mais

I enjoyed myself overall, with a few of the puzzles really requiring me to slow down and use the ol' noggin. However, I'm not really a huge fan of puzzle games, and solving one puzzle after another caused me a little fatigue. I usually could only complete one of the four worlds at a time, and even then I was feeling quite burned out by the end. This is in contrast to many of the other titles I play, where I can play four hours at a time (almost the entire length of this particular game) and not break a sweat, so to speak.\n\nMy main issue with this title is the stability. We had a couple of disconnections (one of which took place at the end of a somewhat challenging level), and on perhaps 5-6 occasions my partner glitched out, getting stuck in the middle of a platform or blinking in and out of existence. Hilariously, my co-op partner actually took video of the nonsense he was seeing on his end.\n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that my co-op partner (who plays many more platformers than I do) found the platforming a little loose. Perhaps the character did not respond to his controller inputs quickly, or it was difficult to determine which jumps would succeed or fail. This issue did not seem as prevalent to me, but I typically shy away from platformers anyway.\n\nEither way, it's a charming little game that's fun with a friend, and contains some pretty creative puzzles.

However, a lackluster single player campaign and a lack of variety throughout the memorable levels didn't hook me, leaving Shift Happens to be a \"one and done\" experience.

Wo vorher jeder selbstbestimmt seine Form wann immer \u00e4ndern konnte, sind sie nun voneinander abh\u00e4ngig. Ist der eine gro\u00df, muss der andere zwingend klein sein. \n\nDoch des Wunsches nach Individualismus und Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit strebend, begeben sich das farblich auch ungleiche Paar auf eine Reise durch die Labore von Aperture Sciene \u00e4hnlich strukturierten Gefilden. \n\nSpielweise/Gameplay\nShift Happens spielt sich wie ein Plattformer mit 2D - Ansicht.  So steuert man (mit XBox-One-Controller nat\u00fcrlich) sein Pudding Personal, l\u00e4sst es h\u00fcpfen, greifen (Kisten schieben) und transformieren. Was nach drei recht simplen Aktionen klingt entpuppt sich aber, dank guter R\u00e4tsel, zu einem komplexen System. \nHier macht Klonk als Studio vieles richtig.\nDie R\u00e4tsel sind f\u00fcr das Level immer wieder frisch und vor allem neu, da sie auch das letzte Qu\u00e4ntchen an Ideen aus dieser simplen Spielmechanik herausholen. Es gab keinen Moment, an dem ich schon wusste, wie ein R\u00e4tsel ausging, noch f\u00fchlte sich das Spiel irgendwie repetitiv an. \n\nEs gab zwar einige Elemente, die sich wiederholten, aber sie waren gut in das Level verzahnt, sodass sie nie st\u00f6rend wirkten.\n\nLeider hat der Spielfluss bei meinen Onlinepartien mit meinem Kollegen besonders im letzten Level gelitten. Ob daf\u00fcr das Spiel, oder doch die Internetleitung meiens Kollegen verantwortlich ist, konnte ich nicht direkt feststellen. Andere Spiele haben nicht so spielbeeinflussend gelaggt. \n\nMusik/Grafik\n\nDas Spiel ist kein cineastisches Meisterwerk, aber bedient sich gut bei der Portal und Mirrors Edge Farbpalette. Die Level, die \"au\u00dferhalb\" spielen, haben mir umso besser gefallen, wenn man vorher nur von klinisch wei\u00dfen W\u00e4nden umgeben war. \nIch h\u00e4tte mir bei der Grotte noch ein wenig mehr Farbvielfalt gegen\u00fcber den vorherigen \"Welten\" gew\u00fcnscht.\n\nFazit\nF\u00fcr ein Koop-Spiel macht Shift Happens vieles richtig. Wenn man einen guten Freund/Freundin hat, dann kann man jeden Abend 1 bis 2 sch\u00f6ne Stunden haben, indem man sich gegenseitig in die Lava wirft, falsch abspricht und gemeinsam stirbt, oder trotz aller Unf\u00e4higkeit dann doch einen geheimen Raum voller Bonuspunkte findet.\nEs gab wirklich Momente, wo wir gelacht haben, aber leider auch welche, wo wir genervt waren, wegen dieser Latenzangelegenheit.\n\nF\u00fcr Solospieler w\u00fcrde ich es nicht empfehlen, f\u00fcr alle anderen kriegt ihr ein solides Denkvergn\u00fcgen von ca. 8 Stunden.

Despite both games having some identical game mechanics, they are very different games. It's similar to Halo versus Doom. Both are FPS games where a green marine blasts through unnatural creatures, but the gameplay is not the same. Having played around 5 hours both shifty games, I'm making a short comparison.\n\nShiftlings:\n- Shiftlings singleplayer/co-op is both the same game, in singleplayer you just switch between characters\n- Shiftlings ties  players together with a leash\n- Puzzles  focus more around the leash and the bigger character working as a bouncy platform for the little one\n- Somewhat cruel: single checkpoint per level. Puzzles easy to screw up with wrong shift move\n- High production in graphics and animations\n- ...but overproduced and visually crowded\n\nShift Happens:\n- Separate singleplayer and co-op campaigns, though in singleplayer you keep switching between characters\n- No leash: the players are more independent\n- Puzzles resolve around shifting, bouncy platforms and big character throwing the little one\n- Forgiving: death is only punishing if both screw up at the same time\n- ...but offers also hard challenges, eg. bonus levels\n- Visually simple, but very pleasing to the eye\n\nBiggest problems in Shiftlings are the overcrowded visuals and rope. Rope mechanic works in Red Rope: Don't Fall Behind, but leads to quite frustrating puzzles in Shiftlings. Especially as the gravity pulls bigger player down. Shift at the wrong moment, the hanging bigger player drops down and drags the smaller player with him, starting the puzzle all over again. Shiftlings could have benefited from leaving either shift or rope away, or introducing the second mechanic later in the game. Shift happens has a little more leisure pace still offering a challenge. Tiny bit of the challenge comes from some rough edges: Catching the other player midair can be confusing, since there is a special way to press the button. If you press it even slightly too long, the grab is not performed. The small effective area for grabbing can also lead to mild annoyance when you are trying to position the players correctly.\n\nI do not mind both games existing - they both cater to a niche: co-op focused games. Either one is NOT recommendable for singleplayer only. I'm definitely preferring Shift Happens over Shiftlings due to visuals, less frustrating puzzles and separate campaigns for one and two players. As a co-op puzzle platformer, Shift Happens is not the best I've played, but clearly in the top.\n\n...the name is a lame pun.

It's in early-access currently and some areas like the menu's do show this.  \n\nFantastic that the developer has made the decision to make this online co-op, some of the puzzle solving will probably require some form of communication between players to be most efficient, e.g messaging at the minimum, VOIP as a preference.  Obviously for couch play you can shout at your mate when he doesn't do the right thing at the right time!!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623253197\n\nThe game itself and the mechanics involved really are great fun and it's teamwork all the way!  The game involves you and your partner switching between characters (a large one and a small one) to progress the level via obstacle style puzzles.  After the first couple of levels changing forms can result in the death of your team-mate which can lead to some hilarity, if you swtich forms whilst your large team-mate is standing in deep water making him take the small form and thus being submerged and drowning!!\n\nThe optional challenges also involve completing the level in set times and the Gold times are set at a level where both players are going to have to operate as a very smoothly oiled machine.  Any mistakes and you probably won't make it, but really satisfying when you do!!

Best played with a friend. You should get it!\n\nLong version:\nShift Happens is a puzzle intense platformer featuring two characters who can switch their masses (One is always small, while the other one is huge). The developers make what is in my opinion the most out of this great mechanic! The puzzles are very well designed, as are the levels.\n\nThe singleplayer works surprisingly well. You control both of the characters (one at a time) and have to puzzle your way through the levels. The learning curve is very nice, and in later levels it can get very tricky - which I love!\n\nHowever, the focus of the game lays on Coop. The devs really understood what Coop-fun is based on! You'll have to play together, think together and coordinate your actions to succeed. BUT: Every player has an own coin-count and you're able to trick your mate and steal his coins.

Since they share the same mass, when one creature is large the other has to be small and vice versa. The two creatures can change shape at any time. Many of the puzzles in the game are designed around this premise. This mechanic is interesting and the developers have created some puzzles that do a good job utilizing it.\n\nWhile the single player levels are better than I expected, the multiplayer is the best part of the game. I played the multiplayer local co-op so I can't comment on how well the online co-op works. I thought the game did a good job of keeping both players active in the puzzle solving making it that no one player can take control over everything. \n\nAt this early stage of early access there are a couple issues that will be hopefully resolved through further development. In around 2 hours I completed all but the most recently added levels. I also found the puzzles to be kind of easy. I play a lot of puzzle platformers though so that could be a contributing factor. As the developers add more levels I think both issues could be resolved. \n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Shift Happens.

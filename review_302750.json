We cover a lot of the bases but we've been lacking on the math front. Her mother is really skeptical about videogames and thinks it turns brains to mush. I went ahead and got this game for her and have had her playing it while I make dinner. \n\nAh Yeah....She's become a math wizard!\n\nWhat's great about this game is that she is learning while you as a parent can be partially passive getting things done around the house but checking in to see if she needs help from time to time. I hate sticking my kids in front of the TV so I can get downtime to get things done, but this just takes the guilt away. \n\nThe game itself feels a little reminiscent of angry birds with their cut scene when explaining the story, but the game play is its own unique character. Endless ways to solving the math problems and it increases in difficulty in a very steady way for developing minds. I highly recommend this game.

At the end, you are rewarded with a giant cake, which you share with the monsters, because you are a sweet boy, although in such case I hope you have not actually been murdering the monsters with your math acumen.\n\nGameplay wise, Counting Kingdom is a turn-based tower defense game. Each monster has a number. You have various \u201cspells\u201d at your disposal, small-to-large numbers that you must add up the monsters to equal. A handful of potions allow you to tweak monster numbers or \u201ccheat\u201d by exploding or freezing a line of combatants. And since spell numbers don\u2019t always match monster numbers, if you can\u2019t apply the right \u201cspells\u201d right off, the monster horde increases next turn, and so forth. \n\nI don\u2019t think the game will ever pose a significant challenge to an adult of average math skills, but the sums, and the hordes, still get large enough to require thinking and strategy. And it\u2019s a great help for kids transitioning to big-number addition (look! a big number is just smaller numbers added together. You don\u2019t have to add all the numbers on screen up at once. You can make 10 out of these numbers, and 11 out of these numbers, and bam! 21!). \n\nAnyhoo.

So this game is great.\n\nThe UX is quite streamlined and feels targetted towards younger players. The tutorial levels are intuitive and gradual, as they should be. Even after the tutorial levels are complete, I feel like the game's AI is coordinating the presentation of available spells, potions and monsters to encourage abstract thinking and help the player, but I might be giving it too much credit.\n\nOverall I'm very glad I got this game for my child.

For some one that has only just started learning addition and subtraction it may progress in to bigger numbers a little to quickly but overall it has a nicely balanced paceing that keeps things entertaining as you progress. \n\nIf the game was extended more variety in music, art and the inclusion of multiplication would be welcome. In this case, for the price and scope of the game it holds up very well.\n", "timestamp_created": 1418225205, "timestamp_updated": 1418225205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13132607": {"recommendationid": "13132607", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993207977", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417157650}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cute math-based matching game.

To do this you will have potions and spells to help defeat the monsters that are invading. In a turn-based, grid tower defense game you will be faced with monsters that contain numbers, only the exact amount of the number, or a combination of the monsters to a number can stop them. Can you take care of all the monsters before the knock down the walls?\n\nGraphically this has a light cartoony kids feeling to it. With the light colors, and the cute looking monsters you can see that this game is meant to be played by all ages. I really liked the layout of how everything fit on the screen, it wasn't ever too cluttered but it also didn't feel empty. \n\nThe map music is this nice light guitar solo that makes me think of story time. The in game music is a fun battle tune. The sounds of the monsters grunting as you select them does get a little old if you play for a long time, but its nothing that is going to cause you to quit the game.\n\nThe controls are simply point and click. You click on the next castle you are going to have to protect, and then you will be clicking on potions, monsters, and spells in game.\n\nAs you can probably tell this is an educational game that is masquerading as a turn-based tower defense game. I have to say that they have done a DAMN good job making it both enjoyable, entertaining, and of course educational. Sure it has been a long time since last I had to deal with addition and subtraction, but I tell you what, there was something about this game that made me want to keep playing the next level. My only true gripe about the game is that you were taken back to the map screen after successfully completing each level. I would have liked a smooth transition between at least all the levels in a certain area. There are a couple of different areas, and of course as the game progresses the numbers on the monsters gets bigger, but you also get more types of potions to use. These potions range from ones that increase the monster's number, decrease the monster's number, zero out the monster's number, move a monster to a different row, clear off an entire row, or freeze an entire row for a couple of turns.\n\nIf you are looking for something that the whole family to play, this is the game to play. There's a difficulty setting, as part of the game, so if you need to make it easy you can do so, or you can pump it up to be a little more challenging. All I have to say is that I couldn't put the game down until I finished it, and I was left wanting more, I wanted to save more castles, defeat more monsters, and though I technically could have started the game over again, I would be very interested to see what the developers could have given us as the next area, or hopefully area(s).

Will I still play Warhammer: Space Marine? Yes I will. I would like to play games around my kids as well and then I\u2019d also like them to play with me at times. If at all possible, maybe they could even learn something. The Counting Kingdom does this well. With numbers as your spells to cast on the appropriate number of bad guys, you should be well equipped for this challenge.\n\nLet\u2019s break down one of the most important things for me lately: difficulty. The Counting Kingdom is as difficult as you want to make it. In its basic form, it\u2019s not that bad. Granted, the equations get a bit more complicated later on by making you count a bit higher. You can overlap your spells to get higher totals to help clear the whole map and get bonuses, but you don\u2019t need to\u2026. but you can. There are potions for you to use to raise or lower the numbers on the monsters attacking your castle to help match your spells. There are also potions to move monsters about the board to help connect and clear the board.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point to this whole exercise? Well, to keep a sharp mind and save a kingdom! Both of which are worthy goals. Like I said before, you don\u2019t have to race though this game. The game seems to punish you more for bad tactical errors than it does math mistakes. Take your time and try to clear the board for a bonus if you can. Don\u2019t freak, this isn\u2019t a game with a hard grading curve. Getting three stars doesn\u2019t take much effort and that\u2019s fine for building up confidence in my kids when they old enough to know that I\u2019m not just killing monsters, but saving a kingdom using mathematics as well.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nThe Counting Kingdom is a learning game based on simple addition math mixed with some tactics and strategy. They don\u2019t have you do more than addition, but I\u2019m not really sure how they could anyway. It\u2019s simple, but can be as complicated as you want it to be while you can sharpen your quick math skills. Little Worlds Interactive went out to make a fun math game and they succeeded!

The lay out of the game is well done and is fluid during combat. Sadly it only contains adding not subtracting or any other math related subjects. The game makes the player feel in control as they learn, and leaves them with a sense of accomplishment. Its not that long but could be a teaching aid to someone learning the basics of math, as the adding count does not go above 50.  It has no major depth or progression in which would then leave people who just like the game-play style and not seeking to learn to be left wanting more. It is not bad for what it does, and is meant to aid in teaching, and I feel it does that well enough allowing the player to gain critical thinking skills.

It's a kids game targeted at children ages 6 - 8 or so, and this review largely is as well (or moreso: any parents reading this)\n\nThe game is polished & adorable, with bright colors, pleasant music, and cute monsters that are largely nonthreatening and quite imaginative.\n\nAt its core it's a puzzle game using pretty much the most basic of addition/subtraction- and while the difficulty/complexity of the math problems never really increased, it would have felt out of character for the game to do so.\n\nThe gameplay is solid & bug free, with a simple premise (matching the values of monsters on the field with \"spells\" in your spellbook. You can modify the values of the monsters, and add your spells for greater sums to be used in combos, not as a requirement- just for a higher score. Though clearing 7 monsters at once with a well placed spell is fairly satisfying, even as a 24-year old adult.\n\nIt's fairly long too, which is a pretty nice plus for a $4 game.\n\nIf you have kids learning math, I'd highly recommend this one. It's pretty easy to pick up, no stress, and just as fun as any of the more mindless apps on the market (Angry Birds/Temple Run, that kind of time vortexes.) Seriously, I would have loved to play this as a child, and still had fun with this as an adult. So if you're an adult that's bored and would like a time-waster, this is actually a fairly decent/low-commitment game as well!\n\nI also did a video review if you'd like to see gameplay/more in-depth impressions (kid friendly): http://youtu.be/QVl0dvIv3zQ", "timestamp_created": 1402040611, "timestamp_updated": 1402040611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "10354981": {"recommendationid": "10354981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078998138", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401893510}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is adorable and is definitely NOT just for kids!

The simple premise of turn based tower defense type gameplay where numbered cards must be combined and discarded to match the number of a selected group of attacking monsters grows deeper as the game progresses.

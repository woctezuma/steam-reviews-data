The dialogue and story development is light but sufficient.  The battle and character development mechanics are inspired by Final Fantasy Tactics. Every character has a main class they gain experience for after battle, but have access to the skills of a secondary class.  New and more powerful classes are unlocked through progressing through a combination of lesser classes.  Unlike FFT, character statistics are developed by spending star points that which you gain in parallel to experience.  After 30 hours of gameplay I\u2019ve unlocked every class across my four characters.  \n\nThe encounter and exploration systems are more like Chrono Trigger though.  You can visit towns and ransack an NPCs house with impunity.  You can see enemies on the map and can buff and strategically engage them.  Unlike CT, the inventory system is bag-based, much like the Divinity series.  Like Divinity, there is also an inventory based crafting system. For example, using shears on a blanket creates a bandage for healing minor wounds.  New armor and weapons are commonly gained through crafting.  In fact, using tools and spells outside of combat for exploration is a large part of the game.  Also unlike CT, the great majority of encounters do not respawn.  To grind, you have a choice of only a few repeatable encounters which become dull quickly. \n\nI would highly recommend to anyone looking to satisfy a craving for FFT and willing to tolerate the graphics.   However, the rudimentary Earthbound-esque look of the game belie a varied environment filled with myriad secrets.", "timestamp_created": 1514737356, "timestamp_updated": 1514737356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38810595": {"recommendationid": "38810595", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985497075", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460630223}, "language": "english", "review": "p cool", "timestamp_created": 1514535275, "timestamp_updated": 1514535275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38808169": {"recommendationid": "38808169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095741779", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514558265}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u771f\u597d\u73a9 \u592a\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4 \u53ef\u60dc\u6d41\u7a0b\u611f\u89c9\u77ed  \u7ed3\u5c40\u592a\u4e8c \u7ebf\u4e0b\u73a9\u768418h\u5de6\u53f3 Hayden\u4e00\u5bb6\u4eb2\u621a\u51fa\u54c1\u7684\u4e48......", "timestamp_created": 1514528326, "timestamp_updated": 1514528326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38764823": {"recommendationid": "38764823", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970625686", "num_games_owned": 697, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451856641}, "language": "english", "review": "Definition of a diamond in the rough.

I went into it hoping to just hack it with custom keys linked to my button presses, but there is just way too much mouse interaction to make it work well.\n- The game has too much emphasis on inventory management. Imagine Diablo II x 10, without the fun of sorting magical equipment. You have 4 separate character inventories whilst most things don't stack as well as bag-inside-bag nesting. It gets quite out of hand.\n- Healing items felt pointless. I imagine they'd be essential to a mostly physical party, but considering magic users seem to be the best classes, you'll probably gravitate to having 2 casters. This means you'll get all your health and energy healing from them instead of items.\n\nPros:\n- Character creation is pretty fun. No character is pidgeon-holed into their starting class, making it easy to change your mind if you don't like a certain class.\n- Complex magic system is really sweet! I loved drenching a battle arena in water and then electrifying it shocking all the  enemies still standing there.\n- A lot of the music is really good, it's a shame there were so many \"quiet\" area or places with ambient rumbling when there was plenty of good music when it was playing, but when the music did kick in it was pretty awesome.\n- Non linear areas are pretty awesome, you can play much of the game in any order you want. You can even fight the end boss and beat him way before the end of the game. One of the best uses of this I've seen in a game like this.\n- Lots of classes dedicated to 4 major playstyles. I took a Melee/Ranged+Stealth/Mage/Healer party and still had to make some tough choices about how they were kitted out. There's 18 classes in the game with a sub-class system which is really awesome.\n\nIf I didn't have to spend so much time dealing with the literal piles of gear on the ground this game would have been a solid 8/10 for me.

Absolutely RECOMMENDED for both fans of western style CRPGs/ Console JRPGs\nI did beat the game and got 100% of the achievements but I am positive I missed some secrets and there were two optional battles that I could not beat.\n\nPROS/CONS for four categories: Gameplay, Graphics, Story, and Music/Sound.\nAgain I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this game so take the negatives with a grain of salt.\n\nGameplay\n+ Really unique. Combines things from Ultima, Metroidvania, and Turn based SRPGs. The part that\u2019s Ultima is the interface with drag and drop interaction. The part that is Metroidvania is exploring a fairly large world with TONS of secrets. It restricts from you from going to later areas at the start by needing certain items or abilities. There are quite a few areas at the start that can be completed in any order. The part that is \u201cTactics\u201d or  turn based SRPG is the battle system like Shining Force. Final Fantasy Tactics etc\n+ Lots of interactable objects within that system. \n+ The level design is well thought out with nice shortcuts that help with backtracking.\n+ A lot of the secret areas are logical. I fought an Enemy that exists on a wall after defeating it I pick axed that wall and found a secret area.\n+ Secret areas reward exploration/use of the interaction system.\n+ Most battles are with less than 10 enemies so nothing drags on too long.\n+ Perfect length (20-30 hours on first playthrough) doesn\u2019t pull JRPG bullshit to pad game time. \n+/- The tactics gameplay relies heavily on positioning your enemies by use of walls/turrets to be able to cast AoE magic spells.\n\u2013 The inventory is straight from Ultima 7.  drag and drop nightmare\n- Items won\u2019t always stack if you have them in another bag within your inventory.   \n- It\u2019s a Metroidvania in level design. Although its mitigated by shortcuts, there is backtracking especially if you\u2019re stuck\n- Some of the secret areas are really obscure wall hugging/pixel finding stuff.  \n- Enemies can take a really long time on their turns planning out their actions.\n\nGraphics \n+/- So it does use pixel graphics. They are on par with early Super Nintendo stuff (sprites are flat colors with little shading). At first I felt like everything was way too big and blocky at 1080p. But as I played it grew on me. \n+Overall it was consistent nothing feels out of place within the world.\n+ Not typical fantasy \n+ Character Races are interesting and offer some customization. \n+ Enough variation in areas and enemies to keep it interesting and made me want to see what was next.\n+ Weapons change appearance. A couple of accessories actually show on your character.\n+ Different classes have different appearances.\n- It\u2019s ugly compared to most SNES RPGs  that were released in the US.\n- Character Customization is fairly basic.\n- Birds. Everything on these sprites is ugly/weird. Also awkward death animations.\n- The accessories that do change your character is limited to (I think?) one or two. You can loot a cape that will show on your character but its right before the final boss.\n- Different armor just changes the color of your character\u2019s armor. Again other than one or two accessories /class changing your armor stays the same other than color.\n\nStory \n+ It has some cool ideas. Doesn\u2019t have some Characters as completely good or evil.\n+ There are some choices. (Though there are a couple that can make the difficulty sky rocket.)\n+ Good length \n+/- Moves at a good pace. Good flow of story events. Nothing drags or gets in the way of exploration/combat.\n+/- Not typical fantasy but just barely.\n- The story was \u201cok\u201d at best.\n- Most of the characters/motivations are simple.\n\nMusic \n+/- The first impression of the music isn\u2019t great. The first \"real\" town's music. Holy fuck, is it annoying ear piercing and repetitive. The first merchant\u2019s music isn't great either. I almost muted it.  DON'T! \nBecause most of the music is AWESOME. It's really catchy and fits the mood of what is going on most of the time. Multiple battle themes! That alone makes it better than most JRPGs. The secret crypt slowdown music is fucking amazing/terrifying! \n+/- Sounds are typical 8 bit bloops and bleeps but all the sounds fit/feel impactful and satisfying (killing spiders especially.)\n", "timestamp_created": 1500164966, "timestamp_updated": 1500164966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33406308": {"recommendationid": "33406308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026191345", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501031794}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite a great number of reviews praising this game already, I feel compelled to leave another glowing review.  Voidspire Tactics, especially having purchased it 50% off during this Summer Sale, has been one of my favorite games played in the last few years.\n\nThe combat is indeed strategic and tactical.  You have access to view every statistic and class, both of your characters and enemy combatants, and the time/ATB is very transparent to ensure you know when an action will happen, is going to happen, and what area(s) of the field it will affect.\n\nAlthough the game gives a great deal of flexibility to your characters, it does not feel grindy or as though you are punished for choosing things poorly.  I played on the standard Veteran difficulty, and found the game to be challenging but fair throughout.  I almost wished at times that the game had more opportunities to earn xp, to beef up characters just a bit more or to experiment with classes, but the pace is set very nicely.\n\nThe art is charming to me, and I think it has a ton of style.  Coupled with the music choices, many places have uniquely identifiable atmospheres that are memorable and fun to explore.  On that topic, there are quite a few things to explore, by virtue of having items that can expose and help you gain access to new pathways.  The exploration is put together very creatively, and allows you at some times to make shortcuts by dropping a rope, or forcing your way through a cave wall via pickaxe.\n\nThe story is interesting and engaging, with quirky humor and dialogue choices that give you at least the illusion of inclusion into this world.  Using the Look feature gives some useful information, but also fills in a lot of backstory to add depth to the experience.

I've tried everything from Disgaea, the spin-offs, hard-mode mods (In fact an FFT mod forum is where I discovered this) and consider myself an enthusiast of the Strategy RPG genre overall. When I played this game it scratched that itch and MORE. Hands-down, this quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. The feeling of wonder as you combine tools and discover new locations is so gratifying.\n\nThe best part is how seamless the open combat merges with the exploration. Grow plants that act as ladders, dig through walls and discover hidden tunnels, freeze the water and find that you can walk into a new area. Voidspire has created a robust and addicting system that isn't overwhelming, and encourages a child-like sense of experimentation.\n\nWhen I say open combat I really mean it. The dual-class system allows for extremely creative combinations. Things like teleporting your elemental sword attacks across space, setting up turrets behind magic barriers for a zombie shelter, or improvising a trap with corpses left on the battlefield are all possible. You can really come up with so many playstyles and strategies, and yet the power curve is still very hard to break. This is in my opinion, one of its best traits. While it is an RPG, the stat-crunching aspect is heavily underplayed in exchange for small damage numbers and controllable difficulty. This leads to very consistently challenging and exciting battles that while never frustrating, will always encourage you to play intelligently.\n\nI have almost 80 hours into the game and I'm still tackling secret bosses, and discovering extra rooms and items. This game is a hidden gem and its currently on sale for %50 off. It's a crime how underplayed this game is.

Your ability to control your guys makes all the difference. You're not just watching stacks of hitpoints go down. There's a lot of interplay in the skills your guys learn, and how and when they use them.\n\nThe game lets you explore far and wide, so you can find encounters that really challenge you. \n\nThe puzzles are engaging in the intuitive way. They ramp up over time, and the same bits and pieces are used by the crafting system. There's a lot of 'aha!' moments. Without spoiling anything, they use common sense a lot. \n\nCharacter progression is deep and fun. I was worried that I mis-created my party, when they didn't start out with the classes I wanted, but class-switching is effortless and you can't make a mistake. All XP is useful. Advanced classes require many beginner classes so if your warrior started as a scout, no big deal, that scout xp will come in handy later. This is very valuable, you can't screw yourself with a bad decision - at least early on - it might be different in late game, but I'm not there yet.\n\nCrafting reminds me a lot of divinity, where you combine objects in mostly obvious ways to make new things out of them.\n\nThose empty bottles at the beginning are useful.

But, I did find it worked well enough with the four you get.\n\nCrafting (at least for equipment, which is all I really used it for) is simple and forgiving. You can recycle weapons/armor by melting them down and re-crafting them as something else. Even for the stuff that doesn't make sense, like spidest fangs, so you can experiment without feeling the need to save a unique material for the right moment. That said, managing your inventory is a bit of a drag -- lots of shuffling items around and opening and closing various bags within bags to figure out what all you've got on you.\n\nBy the time I was about 3/4 through, I was getting excited to play again with new race unlocks and different class combos.

If steam shows that I just played it a couple of min than it is lying. Check out my screenshots, there is a pic with my ingame safe files!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=828233837\nThat said lets start with a small review.\n\nGameplay:\n- Needed more than 20 hours to finish the game\n- After finishing it, you will unlock new races, a new difficulty lvl and a retro graphics option\n- There are different weapons and armors you can find and forge\n- Some can only be found and other can only be  forged\n- Once equiped your char will look a little bit different (mostly in color)\n- THOUGH every new class gives your char a new look (not only in color)\n- You start with 3 chosable classes (I think)\n- While playing and fighting you can unlock new ones(I don\u00b4t know all criteria for unlocking. Actually I didn\u00b4t unlock four classe I think)\n- The Battles are turnbased and challenging (nearly every fight is satisfying and winable. I lost only one fight and for the other ones I had to really think to win them. This is the main reason why I like this game! )\n- little puzzles you must solve (not to hard but fun)\n- Dialogues are sparse\n- Stroyline is simple but still enjoyable (seriously you don\u00b4t play this game for the storyline, but it has a lot of potential that is the reason why I enjoyed it!)\n- The music and the soundFX seem like 8bit but I believe they are not completely so (Nevertheless it fits to the games art style and I liked it a lot whyle playing)\n- Not much lore in the game\n- There are some hidden secrets you can discover like hidden rooms and enemies (the loot is mostly satisfying)\n- Forging is simple. You only need a book, one ingredient (e.g. raw iron) and an ambos\n\nResume:\nI hope there will be a sequel with improved storyline(but don\u00b4t overdo or the chances are high it will be bad, especially if you have no prof. writer!) and more items. I wouldn\u00b4t care if the graphics wouldn\u00b4t improve(But improved animation and effects would be cool) and the battle system stays (maybe some more skills would be awesome?!).",

There are hundreds of items to acquire from multiple sources (hidden treasures, crafting, harvestables, unique drops, shops) and a journal that encourage you to \"scan\" everything (Bestiary, lore, game info) like in metroid prime. \n\nSo many skill/elemental interactions to discover; you can splash enemies with water and then electrocute them, chill wet enemies, spread fire through wooden objects or oil, build walls out of bone...\n\nThe game has a \"linear\" path for you, as in you'll always start at A and finish at Z, but anything in-between is completely open-ended and focuses on self-exploration. There's no level-scaling so each zones will represents its own danger level. If you have a hard time dealing with a zone you can always come back to it later. This game has a LOT of hidden secrets and rewards exploration so keep your eyes peeled. There's plenty of optional backtracking that can be accomplished to obtain certain items. I just love the metroidvania-esque vibes I'm getting from this.\n\nIf you do get this time, I must recommend you to set both difficulty options to their levels. It really changed the game around for me, giving me a deep strategical experience where one wrong move would literally result in my party's defeat, but where every victory was well earned and could be celebrated.\n\nI know I could keep on describing and praising this game but I'm off to my 2nd playthrough...

I'm a sucker for doing things 'my way', so the sheer number of class/skill/passive combinations is like a wet dream. I haven't really hit a point in the game where minmaxing has been required but keep in mind that I'm nowhere near halfway yet (I assume). Until that comes to pass, I'll keep using my subpar inefficient party composition.\n\nAnother feature Voidspire offers is the ablity to use skills outside of combat to interact with the environment. I'm not sure how much this comes into play later in the game, but I can definitely see the potential. This is one of my pet features that I wish more games of the genre implemented so this may increase my love for the game more than it will for others. \n\nThe two weak points I've encountered so far are the storyline and inventory system. It's highly likely I haven't progressed far enough for the story to really take hold, but as far as the beginning of the game is concerned there isn't very much motivation to progress outside of wanting to see what the game has to offer. Again, I haven't progressed very far yet so don't take this as a serious criticism for now. Secondly, the inventory system isn't my favorite. This is another empty complaint because I can't really suggest a better alternative - the caft that opening the inventory blocks your party in the center of the screen from view coupled with opening bags within a character's inventory blocking their main inventory screen from view makes it difficult for me to keep track of who has what and keep things organized. I do not know if there is a way to change the default inventory locations on your screen (I'm unaware if there is) so hopefully this isn't a permenant concern.\n\nAgain, these are just my first impressions of the game. Right now I'm thoroughly in love with the game, and although it's not perfect I still highly recommend it if you're a friend of the genre. I know $15 is a bit high for some people to go out on a limb for an unknown game, but I'd definitely file Voidspire under 'Hidden Gem'.\n\n(Also, the dev is arguably one of the nicest fellas I've interacted with.

Now any game involving strategy/tactical combat always piques my interest and i must say when I first saw this game I was curious but a little skeptical about the graphics/presentation. After much consideration I decided to buy Voidspire Tactics on one of the generous Steam sales (i forget which). \n\nI am much satisfied with my purchase because even after the first 30 minutes or so this game introduced some mechanics and depth i haven't seen since FFT or Tactics Ogre, with a nicely implemented class system each with their own unique skill trees and passive abilities that can be kept throughout class changes. Even some of the puzzles, while not particularly challenging, in the game revolve around figuring out which combination of items/spells are needed to proceed into the next area which was a nice change of pace from the combat which I will talk about later. For instance, in one area I thought there was an impassible river towards one of the areas which I needed to advance to, but after finding out that Ice Magic can freeze the river I was finally able to cross, to my surpise that this game had that amount of hidden depth. All this depth translates over into the combat as well, with over a dozen different classes each with their own playstyle and nuances that can take some time researching what they are exceptional at. I love learning new things and Voidspire Tactics satisfies my need for discovering new class combinations, new spells, and even optimizing my parties' equipment. \n\nThe combat in this game is turn-based but what I most enjoy is how each character, depending on their class, has their own speed timer which will determine the next time they act, much like in FFT where their speed values are added with each round and when they reach 100 it'll be that character's turn to act. This feature adds a lot tactical planning and a strategic layer in the game because certain spells and abilities have their own speed value which aren't casted until its speed reaches a certain point, and in that time an enemy may move out of the area of effect. With the amount of spells, abilities, and stats gained from gear and experience I will have to say that everything comes together quite well when you're fighting enemies in combat. \n\nThe only glaring weaknesses I feel that the game could've done better is making a more manageable inventory system and a more intuitive UI; Finding out which of my four characters have certain containers with items not stacking when you pick them up is quite tedious and can ruin the fun for other less patient players. Mix that with certain items that you may need to use from a character's inventory (such as a pickaxe) will sometimes not be selected correctly when you click on it and the game registers single clicks as double clicks quite often which doesn't sound that bad at first but when you're forced to repeatedly use said item it can be quite frusterating. The last couple of nitpicks i'll make is the story is a little lacking and I wish there were more playable races other than the four at the start.\n\nWhen all is said and done I am really glad that I purchased this game. I've been putting some good hours in and it has been enjoyable seeing the different classes and abilities that each class has to offer, all while making progress towards a functional story that keeps me wanting to play. If only I didn't have to sort through all my parties inventory manually and making sure I don't accidently drop items that I need would that enjoyment be non-stop.

Guide your party of four adventurers to try and escape the strange situation you're forced into at the start.\n\nThe game's combat and progression are easily its strongest suit-- positioning and facing are important, but on Normal mode there aren't many times that they're essential. Characters slowly unlock classes, abilities, and skills, and while a character can only use the abilities of two classes, they can use three passive abilities at a time from any class, leading to interesting combinations. Classes start generic-- Warrior, Scholar, and Scout are the opening options-- but become more diverse and complex with classes like the Enchanter, a hybrid caster/fighter class, and the Gatekeeper, a slow AOE caster that requires a lot of setup to unlock. Despite switching between classes, characters still feel more powerful over time through stronger items, more useful passive abilities, and permanent upgrades through skills. For example: one of the Scout passives allows the user to switch weapons for free, and crossbows typically require an action to reload. To avoid needing to reload, I had my Scout carry seven crossbows, switching them out after firing once for more damage.\n\nThe story starts with an interesting premise, but it's quickly made into a \"find 4\" quest and an endgame. However, the lore surrounding the world, while reasonably well-hidden, is interesting to discover. Don't expect the complexities of War of the Lions.

Character location becomes very important and setting up surpise attacks is a challenge if you do not go the way of range attacks. Character death, if your party survives, only incurs a health penalty until you rest and recuperate.\n\nEnjoying the class system. Not very complex. Have a main and a secondary class that gain xp. Every ~400 xp gets you stars that can boost stats and proficiencies. XP is used to gain and increase ranks in abilities. Meeting xp reqs in different classes open up more classes. Looking forward to opening up some of the higher tiers.\n\nExploration is great. Reminds me of Pokemon. Have a skill that boosts vegetable growth, use it to grow plants that you can harvest. Use axes to cut down trees. Use bottles on beer kegs to bottle beer. All sorts of stuff. Don't want to spoil anything else.

The rhythm of unlocking new skills, classes, passive abilities is spot on. After every battle there's usually something new to equip, or some ability to buy, or some stats to improve. \n\nCombat lacks the height mechanics of FFT/ Tactics Ogre, but there's still a lot to take in, with positioning and facing still matter, and spells modify terrain (Ala Bahamut Lagoon.) It's not quite Divinity: Original Sin, but magic interacts with the environment in some fun ways.\n\nOutside of combat, exploration is outstanding. Somewhat non-linear with a wide variety of environment types, visually the game never gets boring.  Plenty of secret items and even areas are stashed underground, down cliff faces, and just behind cave walls. I was surprised a number of times how a hunch or even a blind guess paid off.\n\nPlot is definitely not the main focus of the game, which may disappoint some RPG lovers, but I was so in love with the gameplay and exploration that I was glad to spend most of the game outside a dialogue box. There are some choices to be made, and an in-game bestiary/ item codex to fill out, so while a first time play-through may run about 15 hours, there's plenty of content to go back and look for.\n\nIn short, there's a lot to love about this game, whether you're a JRPG or WRPG fan.

Basically binge-played it from start to finish.\n\nIt's a total gem. It has simple yet fun combat mechanics. Combat manages to be tactical while not being tedious or slow. It also has neat and (mostly) intuitive explorational mechanics which gives you multiple ways to get your party across terrain/interact with the game world (ie, you find thick foliage blocking your path - you can hack through it with a machete or just set it on fire with a fire spell. Find a river too wide to jump, so freeze a patch with ice magic if you have it. Etc.). I also found the story, though simple, to be well told. Well told enough, honestly, that I could have done with more.\n\nIn fact, if I have a complaint, it's that the neat explorational mechanics and the intriguing storytelling made me want more world to explore. Would love to have been able to go to more towns and get to a more open-world section to explore in a more freeform fashion. More dialogue, world building, yadda yadda. A lot to ask from a lone developer, but what it really means is that I really liked what I got and would like more of it please and thank you. \n\nGraphics are retro, yet retro in a way which is highly competent.

There are also additional features like dialogue and inventory management, but they play more of a support role. This review of Voidspire Tactics focuses on the three main categories of gameplay mentioned earlier.\n\nScroll down to read the review, or watch the video review if you prefer:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563450552\n\nClass System:\n\nThe class system in Voidspire Tactics is relatively friendly to new players, but has a certain amount of depth and complexity to it as well, which becomes apparent over time. The ability to switch classes at any time can also lead to some interesting situations.\n\nCombat Gameplay:\n\nThe combat in Voidspire Tactics is great. The level design combines, the usefulness of the active abilities and spells , and the high overall level of interactivity combine together to produce a variety of interesting situation and a plethora of possible tactics to apply.\n\nNoncombat Gameplay:\n\nThe noncombat gameplay in Voidspire Tactics takes the form of environmental puzzles, which often have multiple solutions, based on your character's abilities. This is similar to Divinity: Original Sin, a game I adore, so I'm very happy with Voidspire Tactics as well. As a person who's not great at the traditional adventure game style puzzle solving where there's only one way to go about doing things, I love the noncombat gameplay in Voidspire.\n\nStory:\n\nAlthough this game features a dialogue system, a unique setting, and a story, I just don't find it very interesting. Coming from a crpg background, I'm used to more interactivity in the dialogue (I like it better when even the dialogue trees become a form of gameplay). What's more, the writing isn't compelling enough to make me care.\n\nOther:\n\nThere are some minor usability issues. In particular the movement controls are very strange, as you have to hold down the mouse button to walk instead of just clicking on a destination. Voidspire Tactics does have pathfinding, as shown during combat, so it seems unusual. The graphics are also low fidelity pixel art, which may be a problem for some people.\n\nOverall:\n\nVoidspire Tactics is a gem of a game. As a fan of tactical RPGs/SRPGs, I'm very happy with it. Not only is the combat excellent, but even the noncombat gameplay of Voidspire Tactics is fantastic. The story and graphics aren't great, but the the dialogue lines are short and to the point, and I don't mind the pixel art at all.", "timestamp_created": 1448641845, "timestamp_updated": 1448641963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552060", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19222522": {"recommendationid": "19222522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027636118", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489287844}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a competent turn based srpg mixed with very satisfying exploration.\nThe level of interaction between the player and objects in the world via spells or items is pleasantly high, i was shocked by how useful a random piece of wood can end up being.\nThe character progression is a solid fft-esque job system with a twist how it handles stats.\nMy biggest complaint is that there isn't more of it.", "timestamp_created": 1448223029, "timestamp_updated": 1448223085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502330", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19004098": {"recommendationid": "19004098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158149244", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 2166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447644026}, "language": "english", "review": "So for the short Version.....\n\nI am going to start of this review by saying CONGRATS!  You are now one step closer to unearthing the next indie gem in your steam collection. If the numbers I have seen on steamdb today are to be believed you are one of only a relative few that have been lucky enough to do so. This game is good buy it.\n\nAnd the rest of the story......\n\nI confess the reason I initially turned my nose up at this title was the asking price vs. the graphics shown in the screenshots. My gut reaction was this was going to be another \"proud\" indie developed game with alot of heart and not enough direction or triple AAA gloss to cover up the imperfections. Well I was wrong.\n\nSo I decided to make the purchase after seeing the slow trickle of \"recommend it\" reviews that seemed to be genuine come rolling in over the last few days. If you take the time to read them I think its pretty clear most of the reviewers would put this game in the 8-9 range on a 10 scale. I was also swayed by taking a visit to the game's dedicated page and browsing a few articles/blogposts from the developer (I think this is a one man show) detailing his take on the mechanics that govern rpg systems and challenges of allowing for intersting choice vs maintianing game balance. If you're still on the fence I'll do my best to tell you why you should be off it and walking this way already.\n\nStuff I liked.....\n\nSolid Combat Mechanics - Fairly standard Startegic RPG with a twist or two thrown in for fun\nExploration - Legend of Zelda comparision-worthy\nPacing - Excellent for me and you if your fan of exploring looking for secerets\nCasual plus/Hardcore-lite  - Voidspire found that sweet spot between making the game too simple and overly complex\nBalanced - Good build-up from a few gimmes to a casual brawl on up into a few semi-challenging to difficult scenarios. I love that I was required to make some strategic adjustments in the mid to late game but did not feel that one missmanaged attribute point early had destoryed my character builds.. Puzzles - These required work and a bit of effort plus perception\nInteractions - There's alot of them from icing down water to walk across to diggin up rubble and lighting camp fires. Big plus for me was that you can burn down a forest. It takes persistance and given there's no real strategic value in doing so. Regardless I reaaaaallllly enjoyed watching it burn up along with the hippie squatters that called it home. \nRetro-feeling good ness from the 16-bit era Super Nintendo style\nUnique (meaning there's only one) setting - Not your typical Orcs, Goblins, Dragons-to-go formula.\n\nAC/DC\n\n-Stats are not explained very well...for experience players this will not be an issue as the forumla is a pretty standard rpg - A bit of a plus if you don't like having your hand-held through familiar territory\n-UI kinda wonky at first but it grew on me as the game went on\n-Music is functional but repetetive and forgettable\n-Backtracking got a bit tedious in the late mid-game but was  most of the maps had shortcuts keeping this annoyance to a minimum\n-Story is Light on content and no attempt is made at character development. What you will find is adequate in giving some purpose to your actions and establishing the setting. The interactions with the environment act as a placeholder for the immersion offered by other title's central story and characters.\n-Graphically lackluster - Still manages to be effective in delivering the gameplay mechanics but nothing to right home about. A few of the character sprites have enough originality to push this up a notch.\n\n\nStuff for improvement....\n\nLength - Just a back-handed compliment reallly. The 30-35 hours spent here had me satisfied but still wanting more. Replay value is likely determined by how much time you spent exploring the first time around. An added difficulty adds some points here but I am not overly excited at going through the game knowing most of the suprises have already been found.\nInventory/Loot System -  Only aspect of the game I found myself completely unhappy with. Picking through spoils of wars for scrap metal has never been my favorite rpg trope. \nSlightly Underdeveloped Systems - Crafting is somewhat interesting in that there is an element of scarcity and choice to looting. However combining a craftbook and one element is a little too simple for my tastes. Exploration is fun and usually rewarding but would probably benefit addtional context clues, maps etc. The majority of the classes have at least two skills or passive that interested me but there were two or three that need some expansion. One seemed like a complete throwaway to me but I may need to give it a second look.\n\n\nI loved this game and enjoyed it enough to get a litte depressed finishing my first playthrough. I can not say this game has a WOW factor in any particular area but the sum of the parts wound up greater than I could have expected. Lack of an exciting or dynamic selling point might be a defeating characteristic for many titles but Voidspire Tactics wins with solid and familiar forumula. Minimizing the aspects of the experience that are secondary or superfoulous in order to maxmize the parts of the experience that shine. \n\nFun Game. Solid Game Design. Money and time well spent here.\n\n9/10 - Exceptionally \"Good\" one of my favorite games of 2015", "timestamp_created": 1447212892, "timestamp_updated": 1447456847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18968126": {"recommendationid": "18968126", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968521358", "num_games_owned": 1471, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462910483}, "language": "english", "review": "For those that would rather seem some live gameplay or perhaps a Full Let's Play to help you decide, as opposed to just reading a review, feel free to check out my LP here: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJEiBdq1RyE\n\nVoidspire Tactics is a fantastic turn based tactical RPG with a focus on exploration, character progression and combat.  I could list all the stuff that they do down below in the description of the game, but I'd rather focus on stuff I've experienced so far.  \n\nIt runs off of a 4 character party system that you can put whatever races you want in.  Want 4 humans, go for it?  Want diversity and each race, you can do that too.  You start with 3 classes, Warrior, Scout, and Scholar and you unlock several others throughout the game.  The first one I ended up unlocking was the rogue.  I earned this by gaining experience with one of the classes.  Once I had that unlocked, I was able to dual class with that character.  \n\nThe combat is what you would expect in a turn based tactical strategy game, every turn and action is made up in \"seconds\" which determines turn order.  I really like how they've done the turn order in this game.  You have weapon specializations with different classes that improve their ability to use those weapons.  Like a rogue, for instance, is better at using daggers than any of the starting 3 classes.  The scholar has no weapon proficiency and relies more on magic.  That's not to say that you can't still use weapons you aren't particularly skilled at.  I like the weapon variety so far, most notably has been the crossbow and bow.  The crossbow you have to reload after every shot, whereas the bow you do not.  The trade off is that the crossbow DOES hit harder.  Honestly, I'm not too far in my Let's Play of the game, and so this is just off of my experience within the first hour or so of gameplay.  (I'm already a fan)\n\nMovement was a LITTLE bit weird at first, but you pick it up quickly, or at least I did.  I will say I am using a keyboard and mouse for this and haven't tried a controller.  You can move around with WASD or just the mouse and there are plenty of keyboard shortcuts to make your life easier.   However, if you are a fan of clicking on things to open inventory, use skills, or to fight with, you can do that as well.\n\nGraphics are really well done for the pixellated 16 bit style it's going for.  Things are definitive and clear, a chair looks like  a chair, a bed looks like a bed.  You get the idea.  An added bonus is that all the items you equip on your characters DO actually show up on the characters.  Some people love \"retro graphics\", some people hate them, others simply don't care.  I personally think there are times when it takes away from a game, and times when it doesn't.  Honestly, I really feel that it works fantastically with this game and I really prefer it to the cookie cutter RPG maker characters that could have been.  :)\n\nIf you enjoyed Shining Force 1 & 2, The Fire Emblem Games, Final Fantasy: Tactics or more recently, a rare gem Telepath Tactics, this game SHOULD really be up your alley.  The only thing I'd say negatively about this game is a preference issue as opposed to a true con.  I would have loved this game to be a bit more like Final Fantasy: Tactics, or the Shining Force games in regards to more units in your party.   You create your party of 4 and, to my knowledge, that's it.  Now, you can change their classes over and over, and learn different skills and what not, but I think your \"4\" are with you the whole game.  Now that's fine and honestly in Final Fantasy Tactics, you probably only used 5-6 non-story characters anyway.  Still I enjoy having a party of 10-20 and only being able to field 5-12 in any given mission.  It just makes the battles a bit more dynamic, feel a bit larger, and it adds to the replayability, in my opinion.  Still...please be aware this is a preference *I* have and it's not really a con.

The overall experience feels tactical and immersive. The dialogue is well written and accessible, it is not too over saturated with plot yet still engaging.\n\nSo far Voidspire Tactics seems to fulfil my itch for a pixel RPG.

Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Advance 2, and Tactics Advance all have a spot somewhere in the top handful of my favorite games of all time. As such, I always lack of remotely similar titles that build on the style that they set the groundwork for!\n\nThis game, it seems, has at least some inspiration from that style. I'm just throwing down my first impressions here after making characters and jumping in.\n\nThe graphics are relatively simple pixelwork, but it's tightly controlled and well done, it's cohesive. The environments fit the style, there's no obnoxious 3d lighting effects thrown over pixels or backgrounds in a different resolution. The UI is fairly intuitive. Movement and actions in combat take a little getting used to but it's not bad.\n\nThere are four races at start; humans, of course, and three others.. which includes a furred race, a naga race, and some kinda weird faceless humanoids. You start by making a party of four and can change up the head style/hair/clothing colors/etc. to differentiate your characters. The game has a sort of open-worldness, think back to like.. Ultimate series? You can wander around outside combat and use abilities (light braziers after setting them back upright, manipulate terrain to traverse it, search crates, etc.) and it feels a lot like the later Ultimas, but with your party in tow, naturally.\n\nTo my surprise it even has a charge-time mechanic much like the original Final Fantasy Tactics! You have to be a bit more careful with the planning of dropping your spells and such.\n\nAt that point it drops you right in, and you start off with three available classes. There seems to be the ability to have a main and secondary class, again much like the tactics series. I can't comment yet on the overall balance with combat difficulty, classes, etc., but my first impressions are surprisingly positive! I've yet to find ANY other Tactics-style game that was really done remarkably well, so this is a treat for those like me potentially.\n\nI'm thoroughly impressed!\n\nOne big issue, though, is that at present (11/2/15), the saving appears to sometimes crash the game. :( The autosaving works and the save seems to work at least sometimes, but it's a bit hit or miss, so it's sort've a significant annoyance. ** This should be fixed now, saving works fine for me as of the built the other day. **\n\nEdit: Couple hours in now, totally worth the cost and then some. So far so good. There's a neat little crafting system, a mix-and-match of passives from various classes that encourages branching out, a  nice variety of weapons/status effects/etc. It definitely has a 'open world' kinda feel as it suggests, there's hints of directions but not tons, but it's also pretty engaging just to wander around and see what enemies/items you can find/craft, while also bulking up your classes a bit.\n\nThis is a definitely solid title.\n\nEdit edit: Just finished today!\n\nAbsolutely loved it. I did hit ONE major bug, but coincidentally I had just reported a smaller bug to the dev and, as such, he helped me out and he was able to not only fix the issue but isolate the bug and go ahead and update the build so it'd not be a game-breaker for any other users who play it.\n\nMy only real significant complaint is that I'd love more! A bit more depth to the dialogue or story wouldn't be bad, but I also realize that the goal here seemed to be more of an \"openness and exploration\" type approach as opposed to a deep and engrossing story. There was some intrigue and such at first while figuring out the gist of what's going on, so that was definitely better than nothing!\n\nI definitely enjoyed the game, and after beating it there even seem to be a few unlocks (a few races, new difficulty, etc.) so there may yet be more on harder difficulties/other play throughs? Not sure, but really, I'd give this game a solid thumbs-up if you are a fan of any of the Final Fantasy Tactics series.\n\nI do wish I had realized sooner that I could hover over the ?? for classes not yet unlocked and thus unlocked them sooner and, as such, be able to better plan out my characters. I was scrambling a bit at the end to kinda build up their skillsets some more with the last classes I unlocked. I will also say there were QUITE a few secrets, and I'm sure I missed a bunch.\n\nKeep a good eye out for nice Zelda-style breakable walls (and keep a hammer, axe, pickax, shovel, etc. handy for such occasions, too.) There are some moments when you need a precise one of a couple tools to get through something.\n\nI do wish the game was a bit longer, but for the cost and the style of game, I have no complaints.\n\nSuper good job, dev.

But, has a somewhat console-ish UI feel.\nFour member party generation\nFour races with basic racial ability/bonuses equivalent to Avrernum games\nCharacter development is through earning xp in a specific class and unlocking new classes.  You can have two classes activated at any time, and the abilities granted by these classes.  \nThere are three passive slots for slotting passive abilities you opened with classes.  Can have three from one class or mix and match.\nZelda like elements like picking through walls or shoveling to find secrets, etc.\nGameplay, to me, seems like a jrpg developer tried to make a western like crpg in the vein of Dark Sun, Avernum, or Albion.  \nCrafting is extensive.  Not extensive like in-depth and complicated, but extensive as in abundant.  \nFor instance \u2013 you can put oil in an empty bottle, put an oily rag on the empty bottle and you have a Molotov cocktail. \nTo craft weapons you need the weapon manual/book thing and put it on an anvil then put the mat on it and Wala you have a crafted weapon.  \nBetter mats make better weapons.\nPut a piston and rope together and you can climb down holes.\nChop trees for wood, etc.\nI never really pay attention to story but the dialogue has been very brief so I have read what has been said.  Story, so far, doesn\u2019t seem to be the focus of the game.\nLot of exploring.\nVery restricted equipment slots.

Short answer, yes, you will most likely be satisfied with your purchase because this game does a lot of things right. \n\nLet's get into it a bit more and I will explain a few reasons why I am enjoying this game so much. \n\nFor starters, the developer (I think it's only one guy) has clearly put a lot of heart into the overall design of his game. Every character feels unique and I feel encouraged to interact with them. The enviornments are pleasing to navigate and encourages you to explore each and every area. The music varies on the situation but it almost always goes well what your doing in game, whether is simply exploring a dungeon, or fighting in an epic battle. \n\nSecondly, and probably the best part about Voidspire, is the combat. There is a lot to love here and I have absolutley no gripes with combat thus far. It's very fair, and also challenging. I am playing the game on default settings right now and I'm still making some mistakes. I have accidentally downed one of my characters by hitting him with a my own lighting bolt.  \n\nThere are a variety of classes that you can start out with and I believe you can unlock more as you progress, and whats really cool is you can change up your class for your characters any time, as well as assign them secondary classes. And as you level up your characters you get new abilities at your disposal and this lets you fight the way you want to fight. I am having a lot of fun with one character whos primary class is warrior, but I also leveled up some scholar abilities as well.

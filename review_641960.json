Let me throw my hat in the ring . . . as a young frog, I used to be super fit, playing soccer at least four times a week (training), plus a full game on the weekend. Then I discovered cooking and fine wines in my mid-twenties, and since then I have accumulated a little bit of fat on my belly. Yeah, I am overweight! This year (2018), I am bringing back my fitness with a daily trip to the gym. Can I fit in some BOXVR as part of my daily routine?\n\nBOXVR is a VR Boxing game where you can take several workout sessions to eliminate as many calories as possible in the comfort of your own home.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to put your height and weight into the system. Then, you\u2019ll be prompted to go to the main menu where you\u2019ll see a board with your statistics on the left, telling you how many workouts you\u2019ve done, how many calories you\u2019ve burnt, and your percentage of hits.  The rest of the board will give you several other workout options and a tutorial. You can select workouts designed by the developers, try to exercise as long as you can with the survive mode, or train with your own favourite soundtracks. \n\nI was really excited the designed workouts. There are 17 available to you, choosing between beginner, power, speed, endurance or super endurance. The workout times vary from 5 to 37 minutes. You also have four locations in which to pursue your training: The New York gym, a graveyard, a dark tunnel and a festive winter holiday place. \n\nThe gameplay is absolutely sublime; balls of different colours will come at you at varying speeds, coordinated with music. Some balls will have an arrow, either on a side or underneath, which indicate from which direction you need to hit them, and with which hand.  So get ready to punch, jab and give your best uppercuts! You will have to block incoming objects, as well as squatting and ducking overhead bars.  The other aspect I like about BOXVR is the leader board, which will definitely push you do a good workout in order to grab the top spot, if that\u2019s your motivation. Plus, hitting a ball with more intensity will get you more points.  Keep up your hitting streak and you\u2019ll earn extra multiplier points.  There\u2019s plenty to challenge you and have a great workout!\n\nPersonally, I find this game very fluid; I tried several workouts, including the endurance, and I was buggered and dripping with sweat by the end of it! The funny part is that my 65 year-old mother gave it a go and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Then my wife hijacked my computer for a little try.  Fifty minutes later, her checks were bright red - we decided to have a session once a day as part of our daily routine. Yes, BOXVR will give you a seriously good workout! You can even set a daily goal of how many calories you wish to burn.\n\nGraphically, the game is fabulous and the soundtrack is really cool and upbeat; you can train with your own music too.  The developers are going to release more workouts, which will be fab!  One thing I would like to see is more locations; maybe in China, for example, hitting dragon heads.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tGreat graphics\n-\tGreat soundtrack\n-\tSeveral workout modes (beginner, speed, power, endurance)\n-\tTrain with your own music\n-\tYou\u2019ll burn plenty of calories\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tNo achievements or trading cards as yet\n-\tI\u2019ll love to see more locations with new themes\n\nWant a good workout to burn serious calories? Become a student of Sam and Jonno. I\u2019ll be seeing them daily from now on!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Just dont make a mistake like me and put too many songs on the playlist because if you dont finish it wont save your score and stats.\n\nThe best part of the game is how fast it seems to make the time go by while playing; before you know it 30 mins have gone by but it only seems like 5 or 10.

I want to say first up that spent some time on the forums and I think the devs are top notch. I have little doubt that this game will be worth purchasing down the road because the devs seem to be very active in the community and I think they're really working hard to make the game better. \n\nThat said, in the current form I find this game a lot more frustrating than fun. The biggest reason is that the hit detection is extremely poor in my experience. While it's possible that there's some issue with my setup (3 sensor Rift), I've had no issues with any other games. Maybe I just suck, but it's very difficult to tell what the source of the issue is because there is no feedback to allow you to improve. I see that this is listed as one of the dev goals; if properly implemented that could go a long way in improving the game. \n\nIt still stands that right now, a frustrating number of jab and cross orbs simply go right through your boxing glove. After a bunch of experimentation I found that using slow, swiping gestures resulted in the best game performance, but it doesn't result in much of a workout and it also doesn't feel very satisfying. Oddly I had no problems with the uppercuts or hooks -when I missed I felt like it was my own fault. The dodge and duck mechanics go totally the other way, being so absurdly forgiving that a slight dip of a few inches is enough to clear the obstacle. \n\nSo basically I can either try to punch hard and fast and have 80% of the orbs go right through my gloves, or do easy swipes and lazy dodges and get a pretty good score. \n\nThe other problem I have with the game isn't really early access related, and may be more of a long term problem. Compared to other workout games I've played (thinking mainly of Soundboxing and Holopoint here), BoxVR is just kind of boring. While the variety of punch types is awesome and the uppercuts and hooks feel great, still the punches all land at the same place and other than changing your stance a few times during a song and doing a few very forgiving squats you're not really moving around much. Also, compared to other rhythm VR games, even the fastest workout speeds are pretty slow.  \n\nThe end result to me is that it feels like you're doing a somewhat enjoyable but bland workout while wearing a headset. Soundboxing (with a decent beatmap) is a total blast of a game which just incidentally results in an amazing workout \u2013 you're using the whole width and height of your room and punching at a frantic rate.

It's impressive since I really love hip hop and I wouldn't consider Migos, Kanye West, Gucci Mane, and other rappers like that to be the main music that Vive/Rift owners listen to. So the other alternative Soundboxing may not have the songs I like mapped out to box to (I haven't tried it because I typically see pop music or EDM in the gameplay and I don't like that type of music at all). Well in BoxVR I don't need to worry about it.\n\nBoxVR has it's own algorithm that maps out your beats like Audioshield. Audioshield is enjoyable, but doesn't quite have the same effect as BoxVR since I really enjoying punching more than moving my hands around with the shields. Not to diss either game since I think they are both great, and I own both of them.\n\nAnyways, this is a good game for a quick work out or to just punch dance your rage out to your favorite songs!

While there are game-like aspects (e.g. high score list, etc.), it's emphasis is on giving you a great cardio workout. And it does that.\n\nBut, that's not to say that it isn't fun. It is fun. There is something incredibly satisfying about hitting the targets and seeing them burst into a spray of neon color. Getting into a good rhythm and powering my way through the routines gives me an incredible rush of positive energy.\n\nAs for the quality of the workout, you'll find that you get out of it what you put in. Some knowledge of actual boxing (or martial arts) is probably required to really enjoy this and get the most out of it. You don't need to be Sugar Ray Leonard, but If you don't already know how to throw a proper punch, BoxVR may not appeal to you. As of this writing, BoxVR doesn't teach you how to box or throw  punches. The short tutorial is helpful, but it won't serve to teach a complete beginner.\n\nOne criticism of the current state of BoxVR is that the \"calorie\" counter is ... aspirational, at best. By which I mean that if you put 100% effort and proper form and power into each punch, then the calories displayed in the game may be somewhat accurate. It's possible, however, to do the routines \"lightly\" and simply touch the targets and still get points. In that case, you will not be burning anywhere near the number of calories displayed. The displayed calories are therefore misleading, and I wish the developers would be even more clear that the calorie count is a rough estimate of an optimal workout and not an accurate measure of what you personally are achieving in a given workout (they do have a blanket statement to that effect in the fine print at the start of the game).\n\nAs I write this, BoxVR is still in early access, and there are regular updates coming from the developers as they add new features and make changes. I've found a few hiccups in the game: some odd behavior and a glitch here and there. That said, the developers appear (at the time of this writing) to be very responsive and seem to care about making their product better.\n\nIf you have some experience with boxing (or cardio boxing, or martial arts, or what have you) and are looking for a fun workout, then you could do far worse that give BoxVR at try.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513873562, "timestamp_updated": 1513873562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38468017": {"recommendationid": "38468017", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987797023", "num_games_owned": 1522, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1515886575}, "language": "english", "review": "I was looking for a more active workout compared to Audioshield which has been my go to for a while, but I never felt like it was really doing anything.\n\nI've done a few 15 minute sessions of this so far, and I really can only make it 15 minutes in my current shape.\n\nIt feels like a great cardio workout, and while the calorie burn counts are probably exaggerated, my muscles the next day definitely felt the burn.\n\nDefinitely a good choice for a VR workout, though I don't think it lends itself as well to just playing music as games devoted to that like Audioshield and Holodance.", "timestamp_created": 1513805220, "timestamp_updated": 1513805220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38435149": {"recommendationid": "38435149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345667092", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515562280}, "language": "english", "review": "So, I love rhytm games and I love the workout you get from them.

(...wistful sigh)\n\nAlso, I am an idiot, so take my feedback with a pinch of salt... this is an Early Access title so there's scope for change, and there's lots of positive reviews as well... etc etc.\n\nThat said, out of the box this game breaks one of the most simple rules of game development: don't needlessly frustrate the user!!\n\nThe premise is to exercise by hitting orbs in particular fashion, but the gameplay is very unrewarding because unless you do precisely what the game wants you to, the orbs phase right through your fists... And what it wants isn't clear! The biggest offenders were hitting the orbs from the sides. Uppercuts seem to work fairly well. \n\nThis is game development 101!!! If I hit the orb... I HIT THE ORB!! Argh. By all means deduct points, or tell me my technique is wrong/isn't hard enough/etc etc... but REGISTER that I hit the orb and give me the feedback through the controller!! Don't phase it through my angry, flailing limbs like I became a ghost for 200 milliseconds. Straight punches work perfectly for instance, even if you lazily extend your fist and wait for the orb to blithely plow into it.\n\nI survived about 20 minutes, with a break in between to test Audioshield and confirm that yes, that is way, WAY better for a workout and a million times less frustrating, and then take my arm weights off to see if them slowing down my punches was causing the hits not to count. But it wasn't! Yep... if you're trying to be like Piccolo from Dragonball Z training with hundreds of pounds of weights on your body, you can keep on doing what you're doing, it isn't affecting your gameplay here, it seems.\n\nI varied the speed, to no avail. I varied the timing, to no avail. I tried adjusting the glove position relative to my controllers to ensure I really hit the orbs squarely on the side (THAT is a cool feature, I like that) but to no avail. Bewildered, I began to question my sanity. I even tried looking at videos of blokes punching things to make sure I even understood what a proper hook was. Do I just not know how to punch stuff in the side? Should I have punched more stuff in the past? Fought more people throughout life? Maybe I could've tried to be angrier as a teenager, I don't know.\n\nAnd then, as I reuminated over my newfound relatively nonviolent regrets of the past, I found the answer. The terrible, awful answer. It seems I have more success \"slapping\" the orbs. \n\nThat's right... punch, duck, punch, uppercut, UNMANLY EFFEMINATE SLAPPING, punch, duck, punch... \n\nIf I didn't feel silly before, I certainly did when I realised that was the only way to *partially* increase the chances of scoring a hit. I mean I don't mind if they do want me to slap dat but they should've said so, don't make it sound all fighty and awesome.\n\nIn short: If you're used to Audioshield, this is not for you. It's VERY frustrating to play. Stick with Audioshield, pick an aggressive song on Elite difficulty, and try not to die by the end of it. If you've never played Audioshield and want to get reaaaally good at slapping things, this game is right up your street.", "timestamp_created": 1511817964, "timestamp_updated": 1511820002, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572519", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37682733": {"recommendationid": "37682733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009540780", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514309763}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein wirklich Klasse Spiel um ein wenig Sport im Eigenheim zu treiben....nach 30min BoxVR war ich gut am schwitzen und es macht wirklich Spass.\n\nMan kann auch wie bei Audioshield seine eigene Musik abspielen lassen und zum Takt Boxen.

Others want to feel immersed. Pretend to be a war hero. A cyber ninja. For some it's about weight loss.\n\nWeight loss? Yes, weight loss. See: During VR gameplay you move your body a lot. Wether it's steps or other physical movements, you tend to burn a lot of calories. There is even a case of someone losing more than 50 pounds playing a VR game. So losing weight and VR comes hand-in-hand. But of course these games aren't really focused on cardio.\n\nThat's where BOXVR comes in. \n\nUnlike other games, this game (well, fitness program might be a better fit) has been made with real fitness instructors aboard the advisory train. It's aim? Get your cardio going and shed some weight while you're at it.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You punch, dodge and block incoming balls to the beat of your own music. \n\nYou hit them straight forward, you do uppercuts and sidejabs. Sometimes you'll have to put your arms up to dodge, sometimes you'll be squatting. It's very simple to pick-up-and-play. But the thing is: You're continously moving. The great thing about BOXVR is that you actually have to throw in some weight with your punches. You don't just touch the balls, no. You need to actually exercise and punch. The squats add to the workout so by the end of a session your whole body will have had some work. \n\nIncoming projectiles are generated based on your own music. That's right, you can load-up your own music straight into the game and it'll use it to custom-tailor a workout to the beats of your own music. You can choose from 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard. I, personally, recommend hard. It'll keep you moving continously and after 30 minutes I definitely felt a little bit sore in my arms and I was sweating like crazy. A sweatband comes highly recommended. You don't want your foam to soak up your sweet due to hygienic reasons. \n\nDuring a workout the game gives you a score (it's really fun trying to beat your own scores!), the amount of calories burned, time left and your current hit streak. It's simplistic yet: this game requires nothing more than the basic information. Calories burned are taken from calculations based on your height and weight which you input into the game. I kinda feel like the game overshoots a little with how many calories you burn, but that's understandable considering you don't need measurement hardware for the game to function. \n\nOf course, with the game still being in Early Access, there are some bugs here 'n there. For example: I think the calories-burned tracker kinda overshoots a little bit. Sometimes the game won't track burned calories in songs you've loaded in. Everything else functions perfectly. All the punch hits are detected instantly and flawlessly. The graphics are alright, the motions are great and fluid. The UI easy to use. \n\nAll in all: I don't see BOXVR as a game. I see it more as a cardio workout. Want to lose some weight? Go for it. Want to stay in shape/keep your cardio up? Go for it!\n\nI know I'll be throwing that gym membership out the window for sure. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1511484220, "timestamp_updated": 1512260528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36681113": {"recommendationid": "36681113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096392601", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "last_played": 1516335265}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Burn, burn, burn.", "timestamp_created": 1511289692, "timestamp_updated": 1511289692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36603735": {"recommendationid": "36603735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046109809", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513453095}, "language": "english", "review": "So, I have to wholeheartedly recommend this, because this is actually going to keep me working out because it's a hell of a lot funner than regular exercise.

Well first off I have to say this game has plenty of staying power. I had bought this alongside several other fitness type games to get me into shape and this, far and away is the most addictive and compelling. I have now put in 25 hours and haven't missed a day's training since I bought it, averaging 45 minutes a night. My fitness has hugely improved, I have a flat stomach now and I've even started doing push ups and pull ups after workouts as it's got me fired up to train! The gameplay is simple but compelliing, and works the whole body. Power workouts give you lots of squats and leg work, Speed workouts are great fun allowing you throw dozens up fast combinations and really get into a fitness zone training like you're Floyd Mayweather. Endurance mixes the two styles and extends the workouts to between 20 and 35 minutes. Some of the workouts are short but it literally takes about 10 seconds to transition from the end of one workout to starting a new one so don't avoid them, and they are timed well giving you a chance to wipe the sweat from your headset before you dive into the next one.

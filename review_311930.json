It automatically saves your times as well as the number of rockets used to complete the stage. So basically a speedrun leaderboard + a efficiency leaderboard. This feature is 10/10 for competitive players. I was shocked to see myself in the top 10/20 in the starting levels. Hours were quickly lost to this game.

Almost everything about it is fantastic from the deep movement mechanics to the clever level design, pleasant aesthetics, and music that does a great job of keeping you engrossed as you're replaying the same levels again and again. It's brilliant. This is one of the best games in my sizable Steam library and one of the few that I can actually recommend picking up at full price.\n\nEven once you've managed to get through the levels, which past the first world is quite a task in its own right, there's secondary goals to finish within a certain amount of time / rockets used (thankfully both don't have to be done on the same run) which add a great deal of replayability, and you can compete against other players' best runs with both friend and global leaderboards. The variety of gimmicks is great too, you aren't just running through the same design tropes world after world. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're into repeating an area until you get every movement exactly right ala Super Meat Boy or Hotline Miami then this is going to be a perfect fit for your collection.\n\nI do have a few issues with the game but they're all fairly minor. Menu navigation is clunky unless you're using a controller (inexplicably, since this was originally designed for keyboard and mouse). Antialiasing is FXAA only and it definitely reduces the aesthetic quality of the game, though it still looks very nice overall. You can supersample it if you have the GPU power without breaking anything in the game, but that shouldn't be the only option for proper AA. Vsync causes massive performance problems, though in a game like this I'm not sure why you'd be using it anyway. It's recommended using driver forced vsync rather than the in game option but I haven't actually tried this to see if it works any better. Other than that, the graphics options given are respectable, offering you the ability to turn on or off ambient occlusion occlusion and depth of field, as well as a generic 'quality' selector which gives you six options from 'lowest' to 'ultra' (points for granularity). It's never specifically stated what each of these different qualities entails, but since the game's rendering adjusts in real time as you change it, you can pretty well see what happens by looking in the background of the menu. Even on lowest, the game still looks quite nice, and my GTX 760 keeps up with ultra just fine, no glaring performance issues outside of the mentioned problem with vsync.\n\nI think the progression system could be improved. The game is strictly linear and doesn't give you any way to bypass a level if you get stuck on a particularly tough one. A mouse sensitivity slider would be a welcome addition, as would the option to rebind keys which is completely absent for both keyboard / mouse and gamepad. And the current gamepad setup makes pulling off advanced jumping techniques that require rapidly firing off a series of rockets almost impossible. Tinertia really needs an alternate control scheme allowing you to aim with right stick and fire rockets with the trigger button, rather than having them fire on movement of the right stick, as is currently the only option. This would facilitate much more precise control and closer parity to playing with a mouse. Gamepad may never be the first choice for serious players, but that doesn't that it shouldn't be the best experience it could possibly be for those who want to use it.\n\nOverall, though, I can't praise this game enough. It's highly polished and just feels great to play. You can definitely tell that there was a lot of love that went into this project, and I hope that they will have a chance to make a sequel or campaign DLC. I'm surprised that it isn't getting more hype than I've seen thus far, especially as one of the rare early access projects that hasn't turned into a grand disappointment.

Using rockets to jump/boost you through the level forces your brain to adjust to the non-traditional movement mechanics.

If you ever get stuck on a level, it's really easy to go look at the top 20 run times and see a replay of how other people completed the level. They're pretty crafty!\n\nThis game is quite difficult, but don't let that disuade you. Tinertia is surprisingly addictive.\n\nMy only complaint is that using an analog stick (notably on my 360 controller, but I'm sure it's a universal issue) can make it somewhat difficult to precisely shoot the rockets. That is to say, sometimes you go higher or lower than you intend because you were slightly off by so many degrees. This may be solved by increasing the dead zone on the controller (which is an option they included in the game). Regardless, it's not a huge issue, and has not negatively impacted my experience of Tinertia.\n\nIf you're still thinking about whether you want to invest in this game or not, DO IT!

You have access to a inifinite rocket launcher and one airdash, which resets everytime you touch the ground. Those sets of mechanics create a really dinamic and fast paced experience, it also adds a huge layer of depth and therefore a high skill ceiling.\n\nYou play throught a set of 6 worlds, with most of them having 10 levels each. You could compare it to Super Meat Boy for example. The levels are generally short and reward with you badges depending on your completion. All levels have a time badge (self explanatory) and missiles badge (you can only use a certain number of rockets). They both create different ways to play through the levels and a good deal of replayability, the missiles badges in particular turns the levels in a sort of \"puzzles\".\n\nThe controls are really precise, I played it with a keyboard and had no problems with it. Everything responds incredibly well as long you understand the physics of the game. There is no way to remap them, but they suit the game. There's gamepad support, and that seems to be prefered way to play, so should work just as well.\n\nThe music is also really solid. I didn't quite like 2 tracks but everything else was really enjoyable.\n\nFinally, the graphics are really nicely done. Other than the death animations when falling out of levels (which you likely won't experience because of the quick resets), everything is great.\n\nEasiest way to say it, is that if you enjoy platformers, this is a easy choice even at full price. You can easily get around 20-40 hours of gameplay if you are going to get all the achievements, more time or so if you get invested in to the leaderboards. If you are not huge on platformers, you probably will not get as much replay value out of it, but It's still a really solid purchase for a really fun and unique 8-10 hours, definitely get it on sale in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1451757250, "timestamp_updated": 1451757250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19596094": {"recommendationid": "19596094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992286206", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502545777}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is GREAT.

In fact, it was the very last level. Anyways. In the last level, you first have climb whilst avoiding yellow bullets that shoot down the sides of the walls you are supposed to use. This is all fine and good, and I really enjoyed beating that part, however, directly after that, you jump to the left and you have to do the same thing, but this time, the platforms are falling. All of that is ok too, except for one thing. On the section where the platforms are falling, I felt like it was a bit random whether I succeeded or not. This is due to the fact that I could not see the yellow bullet things being shot down before I had to jump of the falling platforms. This made it impossible for me to time when I needed to jump onto the falling platforms to continue the level. And since I couldn't time it, I just kept playing till I got lucky.

Dans les niveaux principaux, elles sont assez calme mais celles des boss sont plus dynamiques.\n\nEt pour finir, la rejouabiliter. Tinertia propose de gagner deux medailes par niveaux, l'une vous demande de finir le niveau assez vite et l'autre, de le terminer en tirant le moin de rocket possible. Mis \u00e0 part le mode campagne, il y a deux autre mode de jeux, le mode speedrun (Dans lequel il faut terminer un monde le plus rapidement possible), et le mode boss rush (O\u00f9 il faut battre les 7 boss en une seule vie).\n\nPour conclure, c'est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu, malgr\u00e9 sa difficulter qui peut vous faire rager.

Tinertia sets itself up to be a hardcore platformer and they succeeded. Maybe a bit too much success for my personal tastes, but it succeeds none-the-less.\n\nI like a good challenge. I appreciate it when games don\u2019t hold your hand and actually make you think. Tinertia will do that in two ways. First up there\u2019s the controls. They tout that they don\u2019t have a jump button. You\u2019ll be rocket-jumping your way across the maps. That also means you\u2019ll have to pick an angle to shoot the rockets out. You\u2019ll need good angles to get across wide gaps filled with all sorts of things that will make you restart the level. While that would be easy enough, you still have to control your movements aside from the rocket-jumping. If they would have made the game without this, it would have possibly been a bit easier. Then again, \u201ceasy\u201d wasn\u2019t what the developers were going for.\n\nTo paint a picture to what I\u2019m dealing with here and my lack of skill, there are eight stages in total. If the pattern holds, there will be nine levels each plus a boss stage at the end. I was stuck on the fourth* of nine levels on the first stage for so long it felt like forever. The kicker was, it was about five minutes! I\u2019m not one for rage-quiting, but I do turn the game off frequently knowing that I don\u2019t want to go to that place (bottom of the article).\n\n*Edit: I\u2019ve now made it to the eighth stage! Hey! It\u2019s progress!\n\nAesthetically, the game is fantastic. Everything runs smooth and looks good doing it; even dying was kind of shiny. The levels, character design and overlays that tell you what\u2019s up in-game all look good. This is one of those games on Steam Early Access that seem to exist simply to make other Early Access games look bad. Overall I enjoyed my time while and I\u2019ll inch my way through this game if I have too. I at least want to see a boss!\n\nScore: Support This Title!\n\nThis isn\u2019t a blanket supporting statement here. This one comes with a stipulation. If you are not looking for a challengingly difficult platformer that may make you want to chuck a controller through your monitor, I wouldn\u2019t spend my money on this. Pure and simple really. If you do like a challenge and platformers are where you get your kick, Tinertia will rock your socks off. Just be warned, this game will not play nice. As they say on their store page, \u201cPrepare to die. But then you\u2019ll get awesome, and that will be awesome.\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1428279177, "timestamp_updated": 1428279177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15201844": {"recommendationid": "15201844", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998391180", "num_games_owned": 1564, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428197523}, "language": "english", "review": "Platforming games are an interesting beast. They can be a relaxing and fun game to kick back with after a long day at work, or they can be difficult enough to crush your soul into a fine powder. There are very few games that have what it takes to be both at the same time, but Tinertia is most assuredly one of them. You control a tiny robot who cannot jump. Luckily he comes equipped with a rocket launcher, unlimited ammunition, and the ability to rocketjump without taking damage. You will blast yourself around the various stages, avoiding obstacles on your way to the finish. There are a multitude of action-based puzzles that are sure to wrack your brain, even after solving them your reflexes and speed will still be tested to actually make your way through. In addition, there is a par amount of missiles for each stage as well as a finish-time. If you are compulsive like me, many hours will be spent trying to get all the flashy little medals on the character profile that (currently) nobody else can view. Tinertia is a great likeable game, with very few flaws. It certainly isn\u2019t scared to turn up the heat, and for that I love it immeasurably.\n\nThe aesthetic in the game is really something to behold. Levels are broken down into 10 sections but are actually all interconnected, as can be seen when you go to the level selection screen. Each stage also has an extremely unique aesthetic to it. The Core is a giant recycling scrapyard, and the background is alive with hunks of metal being melted down for reuse. The Mines are technologically advanced, but have apparently been abandoned. There are slums and sewers to rocket yourself through, and the levels and backgrounds all seem to embody not only the basic idea for the area, but the lost and forlorn feeling of a little robot left to his own devices on a mostly abandoned planet of trash. The music is great especially for the boss stages, and while most of it is ambient the emotions being portrayed are captured perfectly almost every time. Sound effects serve their purpose for the most part, but when you are trying to perfect a speedrun and resetting the first section of a stage 20 times, eventually the sound of your rocket exploding or a certain laser powering on will work itself into your brain like a splinter. None of the sounds are terrible or overwhelming, just somewhat repetitive. Turning the sound off felt weird, so I attempted to concentrate on the music instead.\n\nThe gameplay is just undeniably likeable. Your bashed up little bolt-bucket might have smashed into the same pillar of lava 30 times, but dammit 31 might just be his lucky number! The game is intuitive, and although there are a couple of tutorial points, the game largely lets your experiment and figure out the best course of action for yourself. This is something that should certainly be applauded in the age of tutorials that last until the end of the game. Once you\u2019ve learned the basics, you will begin to apply logic to what you\u2019ve learned and expand. Is simply falling not giving you the speed you need to beat the clock? Blast a rocket into the ceiling and give gravity a hand! The freedom allowed makes for an almost infinite skill-curve. Replaying a level, even after just an hour of practice will probably yield some impressive results. What seemed like an insurmountable task before turns into something relatively routine, something to be conquered beyond any shadow of a doubt. This is a lesson that I\u2019m not sure whether or not the game meant to teach, but it will certainly stick with me in my personal life.\n\nTinertia presents a great package with very little to nitpick. The story isn\u2019t extremely fleshed out and could do with some more in-game presentation. The repetitive sound of the rocket is probably just me being crazy, but after a couple hours it can really start to drive me bonkers. I did have a little trouble firing my rocket to the bottom-left initially, but this was remedied by a conscious effort to make a full, complete flick of the stick. I would also really like to see a global par/time scoreboard so I can show off my awesome score and rub my friend\u2019s noses in it without needing to take a screenshot. Haha, that\u2019s just a joke. I don\u2019t have any friends. Am I projecting my feelings onto this poor little robot? Maybe I watched Wall-E one time too many. I bet the little guy has a full and happy social life and is just too polite to correct me. Erm, anyways\u2026 Big thanks to Candescent Games and Section Games for making an extremely fun platformer that is certainly worth replaying more than a couple times.

In Tinertia that point is when the player becomes the robot and he\u2019s the target of the three Rs.\n\nTinertia, the product of a collaboration between Candescent Games and Section Studios, is an original twist to a very traditional formula \u2013 platform games. The player takes control of a small, cannon-propelled robot in the strange, mechanical world of Tinertia. Fleeing Tinertia and its mysterious artificially-intelligent A.R.C, players are equipped with no weapons, relying instead on their thrust cannon to escape the metallic horrors of recycling.\n\nThe game\u2019s mechanisms are relatively simple, yet astonishingly effective and refreshing. Players use their mouse or, better yet, their controller to aim and shoot. Unlike the rest of platform games, players have to aim at the ground and shoot to jump, rather than simply pressing a button. And if you need a boost, just aim backwards and shoot. Whilst the physics aspect could come off as demanding, this is not the case in Tinertia.\n\nThe game starts off rather easily, allowing the player to find his bearings, and the one thing gamers will learn first is that the game isn\u2019t overly-punishing. Jumping via shooting a cannon quickly starts to feel natural, and players rarely need pixel-precision in order to reach their goals. No, the punishing part comes later in the game.\n\nTaking over Weldon, the robotic protagonist, gamers will likely end up comparing Tinertia to games such as Super Meat Boy, in spite of their contrasting playing styles. Death is a common occurrence in every level, pushing players\u2019 limits and forcing them to boost their reflexes or learn new techniques. The game does ease the player into the game with a number of well-placed visual tutorials, yet the player will find himself discovering otherwise-simple techniques in order to conquer levels and, later on, boss fights.\n\nThe boss battles will likely take players by surprise as the game\u2019s relatively mild difficulty curve suddenly slopes up in exponential manner. A reminder of other rage-quit games, the boss battles will likely leave players infuriated, yet they also push them to discover new ways to play the game \u2013 some of which would likely be found only through chance. Just like the rest of the levels, death means that players have to re-attempt to conquer the boss battles from the level\u2019s only respawn point \u2013 right in the beginning. In the meantime, if boss battles aren\u2019t enough of a challenge, there are other ways players can challenge themselves in Tinertia.\n\nEach level gives players two optional performance bars to beat, involving time constraints and a limit on the number of rockets fired. And if that\u2019s not enough, Tinertia allows players to revisit the ravishing world in two different game modes \u2013 the Speedrun and #YOLO challenges.\n\nUnfortunately, Tinertia\u2019s promising storyline comes off as just a backstory to the game, at least in its Early-Access version. With no ingame introduction to what\u2019s happening, Tinertia\u2019s lore and Weldon\u2019s endeavours remain a tale you read on the product\u2019s case cover. The A.R.C signage scattered around the automated planet of Tinertia does invoke a 1984 feel, yet without the backing of a proper plot they\u2019re simply smoke without fire. There are plans to introduce some sort of a storyline as the game develops, yet there are no plans to make the game story-centered. And while the game\u2019s storyline is still underdeveloped, the graphics tell a story of their own.\n\nThe world of Tinertia doesn\u2019t allow the mundane environment of mechanical gear restrict its he facade. The game\u2019s obstacles manage to breathe life into the robotic planet, creating a factory-like habitat for Weldon not to simply fight through, but also to wonder at. The game\u2019s graphics are refined, varied and polished, yet Tinertia\u2019s visuals have their own issues.\n\nThe game\u2019s graphics are coherent throughout the game, with dynamic backgrounds and animated foregrounds creating a sense of awe throughout the game, yet contrast becomes a problem on occasion. Weldon\u2019s colors offer little in the way of visual distinction, and when there are a number of rocket projectiles flying around, as inevitably happens during action-packed boss fights, players find themselves frantically looking for their robot on the screen. On the other hand, Tinertia\u2019s variation makes any playthrough as interesting as the one preceding it.\n\nThe game currently boasts three unique environments, yet there are plans to introduce five more. Each environment so far is refreshing, introducing new obstacles and mechanical enemies, whilst the boss battles are well-animated. Yet in spite of the game\u2019s excellence in gameplay and graphics, the soundtrack feels out of place.\n\nTinertia\u2019s sound effects are just about what we\u2019ve come to expect from an action platform game \u2013 simple, yet helping the player immerse himself in the game. Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said about the included score. With Tinertia encouraging fast-paced gameplay and action-packed playthroughs, the musical soundtrack is remarkably mellow at times, taking away from the game\u2019s rapid pace.\n\nSpeedy gameplay and rocket-wasting is the order of the day in Tinertia. Incorporating challenging levels and innovative gameplay whilst remaining fair throughout, Tinertia will likely apply to a broad spectrum of the gaming community. With a world that not only looks, but also feels alive, a single aspect holds back Tinertia \u2013 a solid, non recycled storyline.", "timestamp_created": 1410293242, "timestamp_updated": 1410293242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500478", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11906658": {"recommendationid": "11906658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142023603", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412852749}, "language": "english", "review": "Tinertia is mind numbingly difficult but also deeply satisfying when levels are completed.

Only the watchful eye of the rogue A.I. known as A.R.C and his recycled minions stand inbetween you and your freedom. Tinertia features a simple, effective and intuitive Rocketjump oriented platforming mechanic utilizing only twin-stick controls and no jump button. The gameplay itself however is anything but simple pitting you against a harsh dystopic landscape of the most treacherous of hazards and its maze-like passages each protected by deranged titan-like bosses.\n\nTinertia is exceedingly easy to pick up and play, yet manages to be deceptively difficult enough to keep the most refined platformer fans retrying stages for hours before things really click and gravity-defying skills are fully employed. Remember the excitement of discovering rocket jumping in Quake or the aerial excitement of concussion maps from Team Fortress Classic?  If you've ever wanted to see those concepts applied to another genre as badly as I did, this is the game for you.\n \nThe gameplay features a concrete combination of the fiendishly difficult and precise platforming of Super Meat Boy with the over-the-top acrobatics and visually stimulating polish of Trials: Evolution, but most importantly retains the strongest element of both; speed-running and record setting. The levels are short and sweet and the physics add a lot of variation to the challenge, making it perfect for pushing yourself to learn the workings of each one inside-and-out in order to shoot for a speedrun of an entire stage. The more you fail the more you learn, and the better you become with an end result of blasting through complex stages with style in record time and feeling great.\n \nAlthough your ammo is infinite and you're free to blast around the stages willy-nilly, getting a good score depends on keeping under the Par number of rocket boosts allowed. This means that to play competitively you'll need to learn to use each rocket to its full effect and place your shots as accurately as possible. This leads to a very high skill-ceiling and some ridiculous amounts of replayability, in the same way that Trials would keep you repeating the same track over and over in order to smash that last best time.\n\nThe game contains 8 variously themed stages all taking place throughout the recycled metal planet, starting you off in the heat of the magma-filled core. These are some of the more simple and enjoyable courses that mostly get you into the motion of placing your rocketjumps accurately and avoiding the burning hot edges of hot obstacles. Ending the first stage is a massive chainsaw-fingered boss, the first of many, pushing from left to right with its threatening arm of blades forcing you to escape at incredible speeds.\n\nThe stages are pretty damn difficult at this point, and had me attempting several times before a successful run and never under par time at first. As you delve into the second area, the mines, you're faced with strips of timed lazers which force you to shred through the stages at a consistent speed. This is where things start to take a lot of practice and patience as you learn to cope with the split-second hazards denying you your right to take a moment and breathe.\n\nTinertia looks and sounds great, with some of slickest visuals around for a platfomer that are even more eye-popping in combination with the fluid and destructive physics filling your screen with bits of particles after each blast. The electronic and ambient soundtrack is also catchy and fits the scrapped metal planet and its aesthetics more than perfectly. Overall what you have is not only the most explosive and fast-paced action around for a platformer, but a complete package with all the audio and visual sugar-coating needed for an awesome experience.\n\nEven with Tinertia in Early Access it's a feature complete game that already includes all of the mechanics and solid gameplay that you can expect on release, with lots of new stages, levels, features and bosses you can look forward to during its early period.

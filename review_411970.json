I understand that some people may think that this game is boring and repetitive, however I disagree. I want to address this first before I get into the nitty gritty of this game. I understand that some levels (i.e. the helicopter and mech missions) people find repetitive, but repetetive level ideas happen in ALL games. Dishonored was assassin simulator, GTA is drive to this location and shoot people, and then there's Banjo Kazooie (Which I feel is very similar to Ty) which is collect random items and finish a level. Most games have the same level formulae.\n\nNow that rant is out of the way, I think it's time we get into what makes Ty 2 good/bad depending on perception and preferences. I'm going to start off with the negatives first. I do agree that some of the controls (I.e. the mechs) control a bit bad along with the forubie. But considering that the game was released in 2004, I think that we can let it slide.\n\nTo be absolutely honest, I don't really have any other negative opinions about this game. The positives on the other hand expand far beyond the negatives. The voice acting in this game seems much better than the first (I know, controversial opinion), but it is, Ty seems more mature along with the other characters they don't sound like 10 year old Aussie kids hyped up on Pepsi. The variety of rangs is far better as well and their uses are soemtimes vital for some missions, which gives more meaning to collecting opals until you have all of the rangs and bunyips. The story and free-roam was appealing to me as a child and it still does now. The issue with the first game for me was that the missions were too cloase to each other and it made the game feel too short. The music in Ty 2 feels far more upbeat and joyful with the addition of more guitars and such whilst still retaining the Australian style. One of the greatest things I find about this remaster however is the care and love the developers have for it. Most devs would rip the original and port it to PC with no change. Not Krome. Krome have added to this game extensively and made it what it was intended to be. They have fixed bugs that existed in the original games, added features not available on console due to memory limitations and have good contact with the community and fanbase.\n\nPersonally I find that this release has only improved on the experience that Ty gave me as a lad. I can't wait for 2018 when Krome release Ty 3 and then improvge on that. I would rate this game a solid 8.2/10, only downfalling on some wonky PS2/Xbox/Gamecube controls and a tad repetitiveness in some levels (Only the helicopter ones really).", "timestamp_created": 1514683597, "timestamp_updated": 1514683597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38793786": {"recommendationid": "38793786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132222632", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 387, "last_played": 1514409575}, "language": "english", "review": "Ahhhh the memories.

I have a heavy set of nostalgia for this game. That, however, does not give it the right to stay exactly the same, this is supposed to be an HD Remake, and with that I will treat it almost as if it came out within this generation.\n\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue, a game Krome Studios have remade from 2004 and brought back to life this year. So, what happened since then? Krome Studios sort of \"fell out\" somewhere after the mid-2000s, creators of great games like the Ty series right here, as well as helped develop some side games for the Spyro series, as well as developed Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. In 2010 they made a sort of small reappearance with Blade Kitten, then fell out again, and seemed to be missing for years, until lately. Before now, they also developed some mobile games, many of which you probably have never heard of.\n\nKrome came back to life in 2015, when Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 1 was released for Early Access on Steam. Praised for it's re-release, Krome announced that they would be updating the game constantly, making it feel smoother, look nicer, and feel more \"up to date\". Being a fan of the series, I was skeptical of this, Early Access games tend to not leave it's Early Access state, either due to time constraints or lack of money. They, however, pushed through, the game looks beautiful for being an astonishingly 15 years old, released on the sixth generation of consoles (Gamecube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox), yet somehow looks like it was made in the last few years.\n\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger 2  was originally released in 2004, and it's been 13 years since. Being released on the computer earlier in 2017, it definitely deserved the Early Access title, multiple bugs and issues, frame drops every few minutes, as well as hundreds, if not thousands of areas where the camera would try to make the game unplayable. 8 months later, there are very few bugs, but still some, the frame drops have been more or less dealt with, and the camera no longer tempts you to jump off a cliff. \n\nOn to gameplay, there's two big things you're going to do in this game, walking and driving. Walking is as great as it's going to get, however, with the ability to glide, you have far more mobility than most games give. There is, however, some side minigames, the biggest one being Kart racing. Kart racing has a very, [i]very[/i] odd way of moving around, the ability to drift feels like you're losing speed but doesn't at the same time, there's powerups that can ruin your amazing run, AI that seems to pass mach 3 the moment you pass them, just all sorts of iffy things. Another minigame, which is not as big, is one where you, the player, get to pilot and shoot as a helicopter. Adding these minigames in the original game was not the best idea, however it did offer something new to do other than run around. There were multiple things off with them that seem to have been more or less fixed, if not feel much nicer than before, thanks for community feedback. There still needs to be work done on the game, though the UI feels better, the menus work better, there's support for multiple languages, online leaderboards, and achievements. Multiple new ideas have been implimented into the game that the community has suggested, including shops that make you want to go for more collectables, and a 'rang wheel that was added quickly from community feedback.\n\nSpeaking of, the Dev team for this game is outstanding, they clearly care for this game and heavily rely on it's amazing community for feedback. Something wrong? Tell them, they'll fix it, think of a cool new idea? Tell them, they'll think about it, something annoying you? Tell them, they could help. The team heavily uses the discussions page on Steam, far more than any other team I've seen before, they have a thread for bugs, a thread for suggestions, a thread for achievement ideas, they have a thread for almost anything, and if you don't see it there, make your own.\n\nWith a game this old, you'd expect it to look it's age, you'd expect the team to more or less run away, you'd expect a lot of bad things to happen, but with this game, the team didn't run, they came back to it. The game is still iffy, and that's not something to look past, the team wants to show they care for it, and they're trying to show so. There's still bugs, issues, errors, etc. and those will always be in games, no matter how old it is. However, this game has a wonderful community, it has a wonderful team, and it has wonderful gameplay.\n\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is a great game, it has great controls and an amazing development team. There are issues here and there, but they can be, and more than likely will be fixed. I would suggest getting this game and helping the team make it even better, and if we're lucky, they might even release the third game on Steam as well.", "timestamp_created": 1511395658, "timestamp_updated": 1511396063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36802288": {"recommendationid": "36802288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061969604", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1513874439}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the original, and I absolutely love the remake!

I feel like I know why, and I don't want to be rude or anything about it, but the only fun I kind of had was in the main story stuff(Which I'm not sure if I was supposed to do all the little side busy work stuff), also don't feel like this is the Ty I remember loving as a child, it feels like a weird genre shift and I think the Open world nature of the game causes it, even though its kind of.. bi-openworld. \n\nYou basically have all these little tiny instances, and what I loved about the first Ty is you had these big massive areas you could explore, collect and get rewards. I'm not sure if nostalgia stops me from looking at Ty1 critically, even though I feel like Ty1 has its own issues, I'm just not sure what Ty2 is supposed to be. All the new rangs and stuff is cool. I loved the drunk/drug dealer guy personally, made me want to search a lot of the game, even though I don't plan to 100% it. \n\nI usually don't mind \"tedious\" things, if the core game feels realized and fun to me. I got all 900 korok seeds and filled up the dictionary on breath of the wild and that was really tedious.

Originally played it as a young child on the Original Xbox console. I already had a soft spot for the game, and when it got re-released on steam I just had to grab it.\n\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\nTy 2 start off shortly after where Ty 1 left off\u2026 the Reptile forces are trying to break Boss Cass free from Currawong Jail. The prison where boss Cass got locked up following the event of ty 1. Ty and his friends do their very best to keep him locked up. But their efforts are not enough. Boss Cass breaks free with the help of his lead henchwoman Fluffy\u2026\n\nFollowing their failed attempt to keep Cass locked up the heroes form Bush Rescue. This strike team will allow them to better respond to distress calls all over the outback. Boss Cass his whereabouts are known but due to diplomatic immunity the heroes cannot arrest him. This is because Cass has setup his own country called Cassopolis.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nSoon after the first mission you get dropped in to the open world, here you can do mission that become available to you. Once you've done enough mission within the outback the game will progress its story. This goes in the form of a boss battle or special mission. Just like the opening mission these are very scripted, But most importantly very fun! \n\nTy 2 is a platformer in heart. The core gameplay is solid and fun. Ty feels good to control, And jumping feels responsive and fast. Two attack types are available: his Boomerangs and a Bite Attack, he is a Tiger after all. \n\nThe boomerangs come in many types, like Fire, Ice and rope Boomerangs. You can get them in shops in town and upgrade at Sly\u2019s tree house. You use the Red Coins you collect all over the outback to pay for them. These 'Rangs make combat and platforming easier and will allow ty to reach places he couldn\u2019t reach before.\n\nOther than 'Rangs you can also buy Bunyip license. Bunyip\u2019s are mech suits used for combat, exploration or clearing a path. \n\nHaving the licenses is required to do some missions, same goes for the Boomerangs. This is a very annoying aspect of the design, because you're not always told what license or 'Rang you will need to do the mission. (Get them as soon as you can!)\n\n\n[h1]COLLECTION[/h1]\nWithin the world of Ty2 you can collect many things. Of course the currency is all over the place, but you can also get Cogs, Chromium Orbs and Bilbies. The Chromium Orbs can be used to buy maps, they will show you the location of the other items to collect, they are required to get 100%. Also one of the best things to find is a guy called goo-boo (lost) Steve.\n\n\n[h1]OTHER[/h1]\nYou might also have noticed I have not mentioned the cart racing mini game, they are scattered around the open world for you to do, luckily they are not required for the main plot to go forward because they (\u2018\u2019Suuuuuuuuuck\u2019\u2019) are very bad. I\u2019m pretty sure some people find them enjoyable but I can't get in to them. That's why I didn\u2019t include them in this review. \n\nThis review is based on the latest ''Experimental'' build of TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 on Steam.\nVersion: Build r2675_v071\n\nIf youre a big fan of platformers like Rayman 2 and if you have a soft spot of cheesy Saturday morning cartoons Ty the Tasmanian tiger 2 will be right up your ally   \n\nTitle: TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access\nDeveloper: [url=http://www.kromestudios.com/]Krome Studios[/url]\nPublisher: [url=http://www.kromestudios.com/]Krome Studios[/url]\nRelease Date: 20 Mar, 2017\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=888007235\n[i]If you spot a mistake in grammer you can let me know, ill try to fix it.[/i]\n\nCheers,", "timestamp_created": 1506496605, "timestamp_updated": 1507022060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780768", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35184236": {"recommendationid": "35184236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234456208", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511722236}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1506268075, "timestamp_updated": 1506268075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35114983": {"recommendationid": "35114983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094717503", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508586576}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was pretty great on the PS2. the gameplay wasnt ever dull & always exciting. \nwhen they first made the re-release for PC the game was almost identical to the original & based on how good it was even just in beta form ( all things considered ) i knew the devs were serious about re-making this not only for their fans , but to finaly do what they wanted to but couldnt due to limitations of the technoloygy at that time.\novertime they improved the graphics & controls while still keeping all the things we loved in the game. anything they changed they left an \" OG option\" as i called it for those who wanted to keep things original which was always great. and they went out of their way to add small little things that just made the game abit easier that we all wished for in the past ( removing the wall in the home work , a jump flower for sly's shack )\noverall the game designers the company is a 10/10\nthe game itself , it was kept intact and the same unlike a lot of \" re mastered\" games coming out now , so for that another 10/10\nthe gameplay is a 10/10 , its fun and exciting & a fresh feel from the original ty game.\ni can't express how much i recommend this game to fans old and new.\nthe same goes for my feelings towards a ty 3 port. the day i see that in this store my wallet is getting pulled out.", "timestamp_created": 1506031998, "timestamp_updated": 1506031998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35039299": {"recommendationid": "35039299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312172230", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500708532}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game then and I love it still!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1505711777, "timestamp_updated": 1505711777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34926920": {"recommendationid": "34926920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215038691", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505095741}, "language": "english", "review": "hell of a good game", "timestamp_created": 1505335481, "timestamp_updated": 1505335481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34892676": {"recommendationid": "34892676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281732632", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511388847}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the beta stage this game is in, it feels just like it did years ago when i first played it.

Looking back, I can say that this game, while not particularly a pioneer of the system, was very well made for the system and its time. The game takes the parts of its predecessor that worked very well (the rang variation, story, setting, characters, and physics, among many other things) and fleshs them out to a much fuller extent.\n\nThe voice actors (some of whom are different from the first) did a much better job with their voicing of the characters. The new \"home area\", Bush rescue HQ along with the city of Burramudgee serve as a much improved replacement to the hub world of rainbow cliffs from the first game. Rather than being big and bland, this new area is home to lost of things to do, from getting collectibles to even some missions. As mentioned before, Ty 1's hub world was how you accessed missions. Ty 2, however, has you driving in a somewhat open world, choosing what missions you do in the various areas available. This areas are rather pretty too.\n\nMore than just pretty, however, they are populated, with enemies, npcs and missions. and while each area is surrounded by a large fence on the outside, within the areas there exist very few if any invisible walls, meaning you're allowed rather free movement throughout them. Something other platformers often suffer from that Ty 2 doesnt is weapon restriction. Ty 2, rather than relying on limited power ups or loadout slots, can carry any rang he owns with him, wherever he goes, meaning you can use any weapon you want at your pleasure.\n\nWhat does Ty 2 do wrong however? No game is perfect, and certainly Ty 2 does not break free from that. Ty 2 on the ps2 suffered from a multitude of lock up issues and performance issues, however those issues were largely corrected in this port (as well were the graphics. It's rather pretty now). In my opinion, the only real thing that hurts Ty 2 is the cart racing minigame. \n\nObviously inspired by mario kart, its a shame work on the real game was diverted to it. It's not all that bad. Especially with the port's recent updates to it. But it does feel rather like a ripoff of mario kart, and it's not really fun. Requiring it to 100% the game is rather annoying as well.\n\nBut overall, I say the base game stands the test of time, and the HD remaster port of it updates it to be on level with other games released in this generation. If you like platformers, you'll love this game. If you like stylized games, you'll love this game. And if you liked the ps2, gamecube or xbox versions of this game, well duh youll especially love this game.

It was already a very good game back then, and 13 years later, it still holds the same level of polish and fun it used to. This is a collectathon platformer, though the collectables are not completely required to comeplete it unlike others. There are the Krome coins and silver cogs, which are hidden around or require hard platforming to reach, and there are also \"billibies,\" which require rescuing. Unlike Ty 1, there is often only 1 to save in each level, compared to the 5 in the predecessor. \n\nAlso unlike the original, the game takes place in an \"open world\" connected by driving a jeep around to each stopping point. Some are full levels, others are side missions. Some are even racetracks, which have a similar feel to Crash Team Racing, while being a bit more... loose in some regards. This is required for 100%, so meh.\n\nRather than using guns or other weapons, Ty's gimmick is throwing twin boomerangs, which have various effects tied to them. From being able to see hidden boxes, to melting ice, and grappling onto rings, there is more than enough variety, even over the original to keep changing it up for yourself. This time around, Ty gets to use large mechs called \"Bunyips,\" that allow you to extinguish flames, lift impossibly heavy objects, and dish out massive physical damage. The segments are laid out perfectly to introduce new stronger enemies, or explore some areas more effectively.\n\nUnlocking new Rangs', more health, and the keys needed to control the Bunyips require the game's currency, Opals. They can be found floating around, but the majority of them are gained by completing missions, collecting the collectables, and finding bags of them around the game world.\n\nOverall, this is a really good game. It's what I think Spyro could have been post S3, and far, far more. Getting this game on console would be good, and I would recommend the Gamecube release over the others from my own experience with all the controllers/console specs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow, to my review of this port:\n\nThe most notible thing is that the game runs 60 FPS over the original 30. Wow what a difference this makes to this game. It runs so well, even on ageing hardware. But the real fun is how the enhancements are. The game has options for resolutions of 1920x1080 and up, anti-aliesing of up to 8x, better texture/bumpmapping, and more to be added by the developers in the coming months. For even the max of the max, my GTX860M could more than keep up with everything, and still deliver buttery smooth performance. \n\nThe only issue, is how the effects of some rangs' and far off objects, such as the oil platform at the beach wouldnt render properly. This is more than likely an error of the new camera system, but it is still an issue affecting me with this review.\n\nThis is the most excellent port of any game I have seen on Steam so far, how it hasn't caught enough traction yet is beyond me.

If your coming to this from the original game then don't expect it to be structured the same way. It is no longer a collectathon but rather a GTA styled platformer with missions you can complete to get opals (currency) which let you purchase bunyip vehicles and different boomerangs. The vehicles are cool but barely get used each one getting 2 to 3 uses before never touching them again. Getting different boomerangs will allow you to explore little sections of each area, complete small puzzles to get extra collectables which usually end up awarding you with more opals, and can just be applied to combat. On top of this you can purchase upgraded versions of boomerangs you already own, ranging from the multirang which allows you to throw large heaps of basic boomerangs at once to the deadlyrang which grants remote control and explodes. These upgraded 'rangs are necessary to defeat the bigger enemies so you should at least get one of these to handle those.\nAll in all this game is fun and filled with the same platforming the original had just in a different structure and a slightly larger emphasis on combat.", "timestamp_created": 1498661391, "timestamp_updated": 1498661391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32914645": {"recommendationid": "32914645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078575744", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512548426}, "language": "english", "review": "Ahhhh the nestalgia :Pizza:", "timestamp_created": 1498630497, "timestamp_updated": 1511411182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32865466": {"recommendationid": "32865466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092732122", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1513701907}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game", "timestamp_created": 1498584119, "timestamp_updated": 1511376538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32767288": {"recommendationid": "32767288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061153897", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506767207}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aun cuando te advierte que es un juego en alpha no he sufrido nada m\u00e1s que alg\u00fan baj\u00f3n de FPS y alg\u00fan problemilla a nivel de textura.

There aren't any bugs I've came across, and it seems to be built quite well, But I don't really know why you wanted to port this game to PC....\n\nFirst things first, The characters dialogs are just outright hard to hear, Most of the game literally takes place with doing Helicopter, Mech missions, Which really just killed the series for me TBH. I feel that Mechs, and other stuff like that Just don't quite fit TY at all. There are some parts of the game where you collect Opals which I really liked about the first game. I also don't dig the character design in this game, I think Ty looked better in the first one. The music is awful too. The overall layout of this game is completely irrevelent to TY. It's more like a GTA type game with a map, and vehicle. Bottomline is I think they ran out of ideas when they made this game and above. Hopefully maybe sometime in the future they'll consider making a new Ty game That's actually good, and won't have all these stupid Helicopter and mech missions. Id reccomend waiting for a sale, or buy right now Since the summer sale. I also hate having a map on the side of the screen all the time which is annoying I wish they could've just kept that in the pause menu.

So here are some things that suck about the game:\n\n1 .the car handels like a potato.\n\n2. the weapons (bommerangs) are unbalanced.\n\n3. the combat is EXTREMELY repetitive and dull. Like you only (realistically speaking) press the same button over and over again because you never actually have a reason to use the \"bite\" ability in combat.\n\n4. there is like the combined total of maybe 5 different enemys (exluding the bosses)\n\n5. the story is beyond stupid, like how the main villan creates his own country (5 min away from the main city) so he can get \"diplomatic immunity\" therefore can't be caught comiting criminal acts.\n\n6. the helicopter segments are really just poorly exictuted fillers for a boring story.\n\n\n\nif I had more time to think I'd probably come up with at least 5 more reasons why I hate this game.

The default controls are not very good for keyboard (though most of them are rebindable), the camera is a traitor that will stab you in the back when you least expect it (especially when platforming), the platforming can be a pain on occasion, especially when falling kills you or forces you to reclimb the entire puzzle. I also feel like the different boomerangs could all just be one boomerang with various upgrades applied, or have a better system for swapping, as switching between them isn't as comfortable as it was on the PS2 (to be fair, at least it freezes the game when the boomerang menu is open, so it isn't as bad as it could be).\n\nPS: This should probably be in a bug report, but I noticed that alot of the achievements seem bugged. In my case, I haven't gotten the one for bying out the Rang Shop, or the one for buying all Bunyip Keys, nor have I gotten the one for finding Steve in every location. I haven't used cheats, but I did notice when I returned to Madame Mopoke, and I had found 27 of the things, that I had 27 to spend despite already having bought the first map near the beginning of the game, suggesting that she hadn't subtracted for the first purchase. Maybe the game thought I was cheating because of that?\n\nIt's currently early access, so these problems are forgiveable, but they do need to be straightened out before the full release.\n\nEDIT: I initally gave this game a negative review primarily based on the racing. The racing has now been improved in the experimental beta to the point where I feel I can legitimately recommend this game when these racing changes are implemented in the main game. It still feels like it needs a little bit of improvement, but I commend the developers for their work, which made the racing feel more smooth and natural. It does feel more natural on the controller than the keyboard, but given that it was initially released on the PS2, this is fair enough. I recommend playing with a controller.\n\nThis is why I have now changed my review.

No. But they are fun little games with a lot of crazy charm.\n\nThis one differs from the first game in that it has a more open-world feel, or at least that is what they are going for but it is still linear when you figure it out. Regardless, it does not have as clear of a \"hub\" world, and whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you. Also, you don't have to collect every single opal like in the first game. Opals are now currency for purchasing rangs, and your opals are tracked globally (not per-level).

However, it's not perfect either.  I only encountered 2 somewhat major issues with the game.\n\nFirstly, in the main game, I saw and talked to someone in a sewer area, and while in this area, the echo effect applied to the voices was a bit overkill making it hard to understand what the character was saying, especially without subtitles, and this effect stuck around for a bit even after I had exited the sewer into the outside world!\n\nSecondly, the Cart Racing game. While I find it an interesting distraction from the main game, the controls could definitely use some work, especially when powersliding. \nIn fact, in the game's current state, the powerslide is not only cumbersome, but unnecessary, as when you turn your vehicle normally, you don't appear to lose any speed as in other Kart Racers such as Mario Kart or CTR.\nAnd when you do powerslide, the angle you turn at is practically 90 degrees, almost invariably sending you into the wall.\n\nStill, the rest of what I played of the game has me very excited for the full release!

Its amazing to see Ty 2 finally ported over and its something i never thought would happen. The game looks just like i remember (which was probably shit back in the day compared to modern standards) but that is thanks to it being redone in HD and a lot more grass (The only difference i can remember visually). Even today the whole look of the game still stands up and thats without nostalgia factor: its more of a cartoon look to begin with so it can visually stand the test of time better than games meant to represent true-to-life. It can be better compared to an Indy game by todays standards and a great one at that. With the Game only being $20 back in the day, the $12 price for early-access is amazing (id pay the full $20 anyways). The best $12 nostalgia-buy i've done.

And especially if you are looking to go back to your childhood.\n\n I'd pay 15$ myself, and i'm very critical of overpricing.\n\n_______\n\nNegatives.\n\nCam. (but again that will be rectified at a later date, so far it's more than playable.)\n\nSo far i've only played on the controller and the layout is fairly intuitive. I've noticed though that sometimes the ''zoom out'' (Dpad up/down) resets. It can be quite annoying, but once again, that's under the cam section wich so far is my only gripe with it.\n\n\nI would definetly recommend it, even at this moment as the bugs are relatively small. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1490543056, "timestamp_updated": 1490543056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30751638": {"recommendationid": "30751638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055444034", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490482266}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u00b4m doing a complete playthrough of it right now you can watch it here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-LmaulN0w\nThe nostalgia <3", "timestamp_created": 1490536176, "timestamp_updated": 1490536176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413651", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30741934": {"recommendationid": "30741934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146224334", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512087071}, "language": "english", "review": "So much nostalgia overload that I beat this game within 4 hours (for the main storyline/all call missions, at least).

Only in minor areas has the game just slowed down for no real reason but has quickly fixed itself. I believe the loading gates are to thank for this and they don't seem to drag on as much as I remember they used to do.\n\nNot really much to put for what is good about the game other than it runs well, more to do and explore. It is a nice upgrade from Ty 1. It is fun, the charm is still there, it feels like a more better world due to the towns and other characters being involved.\n\nThere are more puzzles, some which are harder than others to solve (looking at you Volcano!) but still enjoyable. You are getting your money's worth in game-play but also in memories for those that grew up playing the series.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nNow, my issue is with a few things, or nit-picks. \n\nFirstly Ty will often face left or right randomly after 3-4 bites of a spy egg breaking your combo. This can be an issue for some collectables or area's.\nThere is no check-list (yet) of what collectables you are missing from which map which can be annoying when finding picture frames but due to some other power-ups it is not a big issue as after all it is quite fun to explore the new maps you are given.\nThe voices in cut-scenes are too low and can rarely be heard, many are having this issue and the developers have said they will be sorting it :).\n\n\nThe races in the game, are complete frustration. Around 3 races are fine, no issue but the final 4 races is where you see an issue. The A.I suddenly speeds up without a power-up, cut corners perfectly and tend to auto-aim at you. It is pure luck with some drifting skill and short-cut usage to complete some of the maps. It will take a few tries but you will see the pure luck involved such as the A.I attacking each other or even getting stuck on a turtle they didn't before so you could steal the win. But this issue is back from the platform version so just a heads up on how annoying they may be for some users even to this day.\n\n\n\nAgain most of these are just nit-picks. Some of the collectables are a pain to get due to perfect pixel jumps are needed but the game is not fully done and some bugs and such are being found and solved by the developers which I thank for their quick response on certain issues.\nThe developers are active in fixing any new issues found and are proven to be more than one-off's as well as the community's input on certain parts of the game.\n\nKeep it up developers~", "timestamp_created": 1490387689, "timestamp_updated": 1497730042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650952", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30711537": {"recommendationid": "30711537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129393726", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490816501}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made my dreams come true.

Another masterpiece released by Krome. One of my very first Gamecube game I owned back when I was little. Seeing this game run in 60 fps is soooo different. Enhanced colors, shading, highlights...even bloom. Extra sound effects, etc.  It's all so different yet so much better! Thanks Krome for releasing these bits of childhood to us again. TY 2 is my second favorite, right after the 3rd.  can't wait for that one either!\n\nFor who played Crash, Spyro, Sonic, Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Rayman....anything like those, please check this platformer out! I ALWAYS recommend the second game to starter TY fans.\n\nFor all those who have played the first and are new to the second, this game is A LOT better than the first. It's free-roam, big hub world. Shops, NPC's everywhere. You can even drive a car around and have a taste of the real Outback! The music and actual scenery you run around makes you really feel like you're in Australia. Every little corner, every narrow and every little detail was handled with care.  This game is so cheap now, Krome really does a good job working out bugs and making it better. Please support them and get this game while its cheap;  I promise it's worth it!", "timestamp_created": 1490115521, "timestamp_updated": 1490115854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30654068": {"recommendationid": "30654068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044352252", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490995305}, "language": "english", "review": "Now we just need the third.

My biggest complaint however is that I can't collect everything and obtain 100%. This all has to do with the lasharaing, which made it's debut within this game as an optional boomerang that you can get a the rang shop that is owned my Ty's mother and father for 4,000 opal. Whenever I use the lasharang, Ty's character model goes all over the place, making it impossible to make precise platforming, especially when trying to get the Kromomiums within Burramudge Town. I also kind of don't like the way that the lighting of the flamarang reflects on Ty. In the original games, I always loved using the flamarang because I thought that it made Ty look bada$% with the whole lighting effects. Personally, I can forgive all of these problems and concerns that I have noticed so far, since the game is still in early access, meaning that Krome Studios isn't truely finished working on the HD port of Ty 2 Bush Rescue, again, the lasharang being a great example of this. I'm sorry, but I'm a completionists, and whenever I see a collectable that I can't obtain, I get upset. Overall, I am very pleased with how this game has turned out from what I have played so far. I also love how GORGEOUS this game looks. Krome Studios, if you are reading this, and you probably are, thank you for doing an amazing job bringing this classic game to steam in glorious, crisp HD.

But even if you've never played it before it still holds up to this very day, surely the graphics aren't as fancy as some of the titles of today but the gameplay, the voice acting, and humor is all here in one solid package. Krome studios really does Early Access the right way.\n\nIn terms of graphics it's more or less the same as the previous game, a flashback to the sixth generation console graphics, and features a very colorful and cartoony art-style.\n\nThis sequel features australian accents, cute koalas and a whole lot of collecting items just like most old-school 3D platformers did, including the previous game TY the Tasmanian Tiger 1. But this time they've spiced things up by adding a lot more variation compared to the previous game, for example you get to use more types of vehicles including go-karts, trucks, mechanical body suits, submarines and turrets. \n\nAlso the way you progress in this game has been changed, instead of collecting \"thunder eggs\" to progress in the game you complete various missions to unlock a crucial story mission which will move you forward in the story and unlock new areas in the game.\n\nOverall TY 2 is a great game for both kids aswell as adults, doesn't matter if you played the game almost 13 years ago when it first was released or decide to give it a go today. And while the story is one of those typical stories about a suprisingly rich mastermind who wants to take over the world it's still very intriguing and gives you the desire to progress further into the game. I strongly recommend this game since it's a lot of fun, especially for the pricetag and even more if you're a fan of older 3D platformers. And as I mentioned, Krome did Early Access right with TY 1 and knowing them I'm sure they will with TY 2 aswell, also a very friendly bunch of developers clearly passionated about the game and the franchise. A few people have had issues with getting this game to work with a keyboard and a mouse at launch, but right away they got a respons from one of the developers saying they're already working on it, which brings a smile to my face knowing that they care about the fans and listens to what the fans have to say.", "timestamp_created": 1490038803, "timestamp_updated": 1490038803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732971", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30640397": {"recommendationid": "30640397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296119568", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509561766}, "language": "english", "review": "Best remastered game I have ever played.

They will fix that in the near future but this is just a review that just came out right after the game release. \n\n\nThe game runs well on my end. Sometimes it goes from 60fps to 30 but they did achieve the goal to make it early access and that is by making it playable!

So far I've noticed a few bugs such as Ty not moving at full speed even though I have my analog stick pushed down all the way, for some reason the sound effects cut out while doing Julius's first training mission, and the game crashed as I was going around looking for opals in the beginning area of the game. On top of that, that camera is a bit of a pain when it comes to close quarters and jumping, best way I can put it is either I'm just bad keeping the camera undercontrol or it moves to far down when jumping? Not sure, was never they best at describing these things.\n\nNow aside from issues with the performance and glitches, the game is GREAT. As SOON as I heard the beat from the title screen I was INTO THIS GAME! And the sounds when performing specific actions just fit so well. On top of that, Ty 2's beginning mission is one of my favorites openings to a video game, and it just got an upgrade. *spoiler* when fighting the Demon Fluffies, the sounds and control of the battle mortar just fit. I LOVED it.\n\nSo once the Devs get the bugs fixed, and I know they will :), this game is going to be even better than the first remake.

menu, the game tells me to connect a controller then hit \"Start\". Anyway, I'll be editing this review later when it's fixed. I just wanted to post one of the first reviews for the game. Have a nice day.\n\nEdit 1:\nThe main menu soundtrack is awesome. That's all I've got so far.\n\nEdit 2:\nThe issue was fixed with a quick patch. I will come up with an actual review after playing it for a while.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nI gotta say that I'm quite fond of this game. First off, I really love the sounds on this game: that includes both the soundtrack and voiceacting. There is always a chill and appropriate music going on in the background and the 'Stralian accent of the characters is awesome. The story is meh. It's just a classic \"Go after the bad guy\" story. While the gameplay is really fun, I'm not a big fan of the combat system. You just keep spamming Left-click until all the enemies lay dead with a very few things you have to do to avoid getting hit. The atmosphere is great and chill. And lastly, there are still a few issues. The hints display XBOX keys even if you're playing with keyboard & mouse, there are other XBOX related things here and there too so it's really easy to tell that it's an XBOX port. Anyway, I'm sure those will be fixed as this game is still on Early Access. I'd recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1490026545, "timestamp_updated": 1490122161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540700", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30637388": {"recommendationid": "30637388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355013084", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500304274}, "language": "english", "review": "Game of the year 2017, possibly game of the millenium.\n\nSub to Mattownzyou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrewth.", "timestamp_created": 1490026515, "timestamp_updated": 1490026515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39376135": {"recommendationid": "39376135", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997217411", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1515649843}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant game!

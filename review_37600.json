It's hard to find anything to dislike, mostly because it's so brief, and while it's not deep, incredible or revolutionary, it harkens back to those Amanita style games that are content in being merely a short, pleasant experience with minimal gameplay elements, and that's fine by me.\n\n[h1]Highlights[/h1]\n\nThe key to Windosill lies in the combination of the pleasant and absorbing animation, reminiscent of early Pixar works, and the incredibly smooth difficulty spike. They marry together for a soft, short and casual ride of discovery and intrigue which is best explained as simply pleasant.\n\n[h1]Mistakes and Annoyances[/h1]\n\nThere're no mistakes to speak of with this title, and the few things that are worth mentioning are incidental. While there may be a moment or two where you wont know how to progress, and might resort to simply repeating the same incorrect step a few times, I feel like this would have become more of a problem had the game grown longer, and as it stands the frustrating part(s) are negligible.\nThe main concern and criticism then, is the short length of play. Average completion time sits at less than an hour, and my second run through took me less than 10 minutes. Normally I'd dismiss this concern and state that the quality of the content and the price compensate, but it may be a genuine reason not to buy if you're on a budget or looking for something deeper. I feel it would've been very simple for the developer to add another layer of content, a difficultly mechanic, a few more levels or even something as simple as hidden collectables which would've added a reason to spend more time with the title.\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\n\nPriced at \u00a31.99/2.49\u20ac/$2.99 on Steam at the time of review, Windosill is worth looking out for, and the concerns about value for money in terms of length can be mitigated by waiting for a sale, but at $2.99 it's very worth picking up if you can let go of the play length.\n\nVector Park Inc. also have a number of demos [url=http://vectorpark.com/]available on their website[/url], playable directly from your browser which are well worth checking out, including the entire first half of Windosill.\n\n[code]Unedited review notes 24/08/2015 for Windosill\n\n+Strange style without forced \"weirdness\"\n+Genuinely pleasant\n-Too short, even at the low price\n+First half of game available free, could be seen as a bad thing, personally find it an awesome move\n+Only one annoying/frustrating part, important for this style of game\n+The character isn't the central part of the game\n-Secrets/extras would've went a long way in this game, perhaps for backtracking[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1441120913, "timestamp_updated": 1441121139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17818422": {"recommendationid": "17818422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122845171", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441053161}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute, casual and really short.

It's a great thing to have in your back pocket for those times when you're going stir crazy because you have to wait for something and need something short to occupy your time that you can put down in a hurry whenever it's time to do whatever it is (like go with your relatives that are all FINALLY ready. Yay family reunions.)\n\nThe puzzles are pretty engaging but you can figure them out without any hair pulling especially if you're an experienced puzzle solver. I didn't have to use any guides. Each level involves moving a car from one door on the left side of the room to the door on the right, which you have to unlock. Most of the objects you can click on do something, so it's fun to see what they'll do. I was disappointed that there weren't any achievements or anything at all, but I guess that's what you can expect for such a short game. Still it is a nice time filler and I'll keep it in mind if I need something short and relaxing.\n\n+ Positives: \n * Whimsical art \n * Engaging puzzles that require you to think outside the box--and sometimes even sideways!\n * Cute sound effects\n * Not too long\n * You can leave it without worry of dying (so it's safe to fall asleep. really! you can use this when you have insomnia. it's relaxing)\n * You can play with or without sound so as not to bother/wake others\n\n- Negatives\n * Some people really don't like Flash\n * Some of the puzzles really aren't intuitive\n * It's short. Really short. Especially if you're an experienced puzzle solver. I didn't even use any guides. I saw one picture in the forums, but it didn't help me solve anything. It was just a screenshot. I didn't count, but I think there are only ten levels or so. \n * It really isn't replayable unless you *really, REALLY* enjoyed it or want to wait a year or so until you forget most of it\n (that said you can use steam family share and let your family play it. oops, this should have gone under positives. oh well.

You can say that it's point'n'click adventure, but actually it's a short toybox, so to say. You can check out demo at Windosill site, which is half of  a game.\n\nNow, game only has 10 or so rooms (screens). Objective of which is to find a cube to unlock door and get wagon through door. Puzzles aren't compilated or hardcore and game will take maximum half-hour to beat with no real replaybility.\n\nAnd I probably should not recommend this game due to being so short and not gamey, but it's a little curiousity.

game consists of 11 levels that have the same goal: you are required to move a toy car from one side on the room to another, by interacting with different abstract objects in a certain order. The objects react differently to your clicks, they surprise you with their reactions and discovering their meanings or roles is part of the fun of solving every puzzle. Putting it all together makes use of your creative thinking and seeing the picture in full is a very satisfying feeling.\n\nWhat I liked a lot about this game was the difficulty of the levels: they\u2019re neither too simplistic, nor too challenging, just the right amount to keep you wanting to solve the puzzle by yourself while being tempted to check a guide. I personally didn\u2019t need to check a guide and I managed to find the solution to every puzzle only after a few minutes of poking around. The solution was never obvious, but the puzzles are designed so that you\u2019ll always figure it out.\n\nI think that this game would fit better on a touch screen device than on PC since it consists in a lot of experimenting with objects, clicking them or dragging them, and there\u2019s no time limit or time requirement to solve the puzzles.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s quite short (45 mins \u2013 1h), Windosill is a wonderful and relaxing experience, and I think it\u2019s worth the price.\n\n[quote]More reviews on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lillyscorner/curation]Lilly's Corner Curator page[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1427510816, "timestamp_updated": 1453061194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15052570": {"recommendationid": "15052570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078527134", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427319078}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430 40 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442).", "timestamp_created": 1427319345, "timestamp_updated": 1427319345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15034299": {"recommendationid": "15034299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076621614", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428675756}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uac8c Thief \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1427207982, "timestamp_updated": 1427207982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14965136": {"recommendationid": "14965136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014058913", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420394609}, "language": "greek", "review": "\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 flash game \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b3\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. \u03a9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5. \u03a5.\u0393. \u03bf \u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03c6\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03be\u03b5 \u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9...", "timestamp_created": 1426801809, "timestamp_updated": 1426801809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14957286": {"recommendationid": "14957286", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974274776", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426705097}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little flash game where you have to take your train through some rooms by clicking some things in the background until you find the key (a cube) for each room.

First of all, let me just say. You have no reason to not have this right now because its only like 3 dollars!? I'd buy it for 15 at least! \nAlright, so why is this game so cool? For me the thing I loved most about this game was the way it felt. Everything feels so perfect to interact with. The gameplay itself is immsersive. Everything moves very realistically, and nothing breaks and you can't get an object stuck anywhere. Its solid. It feels like your really just reaching out and touching and exploring the world. \n\nAnd the world is so creative. The art style is so clean, but simple. It's like an old kids book almost. And everything so weird, but strangly peaceful too. And ontop of that the puzzles are fun to figure out. None of the puzzles are particually hard to figure out, but the answers are never obvious either. \n\nYou know what this game is like? You remeber Gepetto? The guy from Pinocchio? He had all sorts of weird little wooden clocks in his store. Very bizzare, always strange those clocks. but they were all charming in a way too. Thats sort of what this game is like. Each room gives you a bunch of strange little toys to interact with, and it's all very charming. Everything is a charming surprise in this game. I'm just really blown away by it all really.  \n\nWords REALLY don't help for this game though, because the main appeal to the game is how it feels.

Parece ser m\u00e1s apropiado para una tablet o un dispositivo m\u00f3vil que para el PC, que es donde yo juego. Esto, junto a sus intenciones, y junto al hecho de que pretende ser visual, provoca que este an\u00e1lisis no le haga justicia (pero yo tengo que atenerme a mis criterios). \n\n-Jugabilidad: puntero y hacer click, es m\u00e1s simple que el mecanismo de un botijo (\u00a1Pero cuidado! a veces hay que arrastrar...). Y no es que sea bueno o malo, es que \u00e9se es el objetivo del creador de este juego. Despu\u00e9s de la tendencia actual a videojuegos de mec\u00e1nica complicada, largos tutoriales y muchas instrucciones, este juego busca salir de la tendencia... y lo consigue.\n\n-Gr\u00e1ficos: un dibujo bonito, limpio y en tonos claros y pasteles. El estilo se sit\u00faa entre juguetes tiernos y los t\u00edpicos dibujos brit\u00e1nicos de caricatura propios de pel\u00edculas de los Monty Python (como los de la apertura de La Vida de Brian).\n\n-Gui\u00f3n: el juego es muy corto, demasiado corto. Al jugarlo tuve la sensaci\u00f3n de que busca alargar su duraci\u00f3n con puzzles enrevesados, y es verdad que a veces lo consigue... Pero quince minutos de duraci\u00f3n es muy poco para un juego que no da posibilidad de volver a ser jugado (me refiero a juegos que pese a durar quince minutos, te plantean desaf\u00edos generados aleatoriamente y se prestan a volver a ser jugados), sea como sea. \n\n-Trama: el juego es una caja de juguetes llena de locura, vida y extravagancia. Est\u00e1 bien ambientado y ning\u00fan ente/objeto/cosa se sale de esa ambientaci\u00f3n. Tal vez, su corta duraci\u00f3n haga que no te de tiempo a sentirte dentro de ese mundo por completo. A pesar de todo esto, s\u00ed que te deja con ganas de saber m\u00e1s sobre ese mundo extra\u00f1o y vivo que presenta.\n\n-M\u00fasica: escasa o ausente. Como mucho se oyen los sonidos de los objetos, y tampoco son tantos. Este juego necesita m\u00fasica (una m\u00fasica de juguete de cuna ser\u00eda ideal) y m\u00e1s efectos de sonido (por supuesto, no hablo de explosiones, sino de efectos que sigan la l\u00ednea de los que ya tiene, que de por s\u00ed ya son buenos).\n\nJugabilidad: cumple sus objetivos con creces 4/5\nGr\u00e1ficos: es m\u00e1s arte que juego 4.5/5\nGui\u00f3n: quince minutos 1/5\nTrama: ambiente ex\u00f3tico y fuera de tendencias 3.5/5\nM\u00fasica: escasa 0.5/5\n\nValoraci\u00f3n global: \u00bfPese a todo lo escrito aqu\u00ed, recomiendas este juego?

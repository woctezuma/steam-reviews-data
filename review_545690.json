Personally I was able to pass the entire game myself without needing a walk through, though some people have claimed that they got themselves in a bit of a 'rhombus'. \n\nWhat makes this a 'diamond' is it's minimalistic approach. It's basically just you and the puzzle. Also to add to the pleasure is a constructive acute and not obtuse soundtrack and FX which seemed to improve my 'cartioid' and my 'deltoid' as I swayed while my 'heartagon' went skipping in a 'lune'.\n\nIf like me you enjoy puzzles then you really should join the 'pyramid' scheme of encouraging others to get into this. You don't have to be as clever as those in the 'Pentagon' to play this, but you can still be the 'Star' if you manage not to get 'trapezoid' in a mental 'prism'.

And it's ok since there aren't thousands of levels, anyways :)\nBack to the game, there's black and white - the figures occupy the 1 on that chart and the white background is the 0; this means that when two black shapes are superimposed, the middle part becomes 0, like the background. Of course, completing the paradigm, 1+0 still means 1 so a black figure on any kind of white space stays black.\nI know that it's quite difficult to explain these mechanics, but there aren't other things and you'll get them surely by playing the game!\nIt just increases difficulty by requiring complex shapes to make and so giving you more and more black/1 figures that you have to use to recreate the given model.\nOn the other hand, I strongly disagree to other reviewers who asked for more complexity, more colors (here you have only border colors, so that you only can generate black or white shapes) and so on. Trust me, if you're not into these games (and this is surely a unique one) it's already very difficult as it is to complete. \nWithout a Steam guide, I personally hadn't been able to finish some levels at all!\nYou also will get a nice tutorial that will guide you in these mechanics I tried to summarize.. it's not that difficult to learn the mechanics, the difficult thing will be in the later levels to recreate the given figure by moving here and there ten different shapes creating black and white patterns xD\nIt's a game I'd completely recommend to anyone who likes logic and minimalistic puzzles, this one's really particular too and comes for only 1\u20ac/$ :)\nMany said that it's too short but really, to me it's perfect as it is. Maybe it's just me that I'm not a mathematician and I've studied history and literature for all my life, but I'm also an experienced gamer especially on the RPG and the logic/minimalistic/Flash side and well I have to say that this game is really perfect as you can buy it with its 66 levels. They will keep you occupied for hours, trust me :)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513722754, "timestamp_updated": 1513722754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38321650": {"recommendationid": "38321650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284006007", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1515586804}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u76ca\u667a\u7c7b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff01\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6709\u70b9\u70e7\u8111\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1513335697, "timestamp_updated": 1513335697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38222532": {"recommendationid": "38222532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055366530", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515426623}, "language": "english", "review": "Another relaxing puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1512944687, "timestamp_updated": 1512944687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38119375": {"recommendationid": "38119375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352904065", "num_games_owned": 1237, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512982173}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u8fd1\u5f88\u8ff7\u8fd9\u79cd\u6781\u7b80\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u8003\u9a8c\u8111\u529b\u7684\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1512616486, "timestamp_updated": 1512616486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38078567": {"recommendationid": "38078567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440289757", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512433047}, "language": "english", "review": "You feel so smart after getting the hang of these.", "timestamp_created": 1512477710, "timestamp_updated": 1512477710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38054950": {"recommendationid": "38054950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254760343", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512307290}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\ucc98\ub7fc \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc870\uc791\uac10\uacfc\n\uc0ac\uace0 \ubc1c\ub2ec \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc\n\uc9c0\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\ub3c4 \uae38\ub7ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\ub9c8\uce58 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc2e0\uc138\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc138\ub85c\ub85c \uc77d\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc138\n\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1512387276, "timestamp_updated": 1512387276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38054673": {"recommendationid": "38054673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409529031", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514030230}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e !\n\u0417\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1512386148, "timestamp_updated": 1512386148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37968746": {"recommendationid": "37968746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053713050", "num_games_owned": 1947, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512104156}, "language": "english", "review": "One of many 99 cent simple puzzle games available on Steam, VOI is competent enough to spend an hour on.

Sometimes it feels like you just got lucky and only a handful of levels were actually challenging. However, the gameplay is unique and for the most part well designed. \n\nThe game is rather short, with just 66 levels I completed everything it had to offer in 36 minutes. For $1 (I payed $0.60), I feel like it is worth it but don't expect to spend more than an hour playing this. \n\nVOI also isn't very competently made. There were multiple issues I encountered in my short playthrough, usually related to things failing to render (like the level number and background grid) but these were fixed by restarting the game. \n\nWhen you finish the final level, no animation or indication that you completed the game appears. An achievement pops up leading to a very unsatisfying and anti-climatic ending. \n\nFor only $1, puzzle game fans should check this out.

I expect some congratulation, balloon, fireworks and a $100 swc. lol, jk \n\n\n[b][i]\"How much I like enjoy this game\"[/i] score:[/b] 7/10 - would give 9/10 if finishing final level congratulate me.\n\n[b][i]How much I want to recommend this game score:[/i][/b] 8/10, it's cheap and good.", "timestamp_created": 1504766378, "timestamp_updated": 1504773181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34775385": {"recommendationid": "34775385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366847934", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504703932}, "language": "polish", "review": "taki tam casual", "timestamp_created": 1504704015, "timestamp_updated": 1506939073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34762501": {"recommendationid": "34762501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068811407", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504889948}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm passed level 33 at the moment.

Unlike other shape-fitting games, this game uses the \"XOR\" principle whereby overlapping a piece over another piece produces a white gap.   \n\nYou have a small number of squares, diamonds and triangles placed in the middle of the screen, and you have to use the limited space, aligning them using the grid of dots to make the pattern shown on the right.\n\nThe puzzles are all relatively straightforward.  one or two require a bit of cunning, but for the most part they can be solved in less than 60 seconds.  Some of them in less than 30.\n\nThe music is just ambient chillout music, and the sounds are soft chimes, so you're not jarred from your relaxed gameplay.  The only two colours are black and white, but that's just perfect for what is really a very simple, flowy, fun little game, which doesn't get in your way while you're puzzling it out.  It just has exactly what you need.\n\nI think die-hard puzzlers who prefer the Times Crossword will find this a little simple for their tastes, unless they just want to relax with a cup of tea for an hour or so.   Those who don't really like puzzlers, or who find other games (like Lyne, Knights) look a little hardcore, this is perfect.  \n\nOne of the unexpected pleasures of this game was accidentelly creating really pretty (but wrong) patterns as the solution to some puzzles.  Sometimes, those pretty patterns would reappear later as solutions.  Another unintented amusement was when the shapes can come together to make the solution's 90-degree rotation, and then spending 2x as long trying to make it the right way.\n\nYes, it could do with a little more interaction (A \"well done, thanks for playing\" at the end would be nice, or a \"quit\" button?), also a sandbox mode, or the ability to make some cool shapes and upload them to user challenges would be fun...  But for the price, I can't complain.    Get it on sale, or as part of a bundle, and leave it for a lazy afternoon where you just want to put your feet up for an hour and while away some time.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1491860243,

This however is no simple shape matching game. \nThe idea is you are given a bunch of basic shapes and you have to use them to create the picture you are given, however the twist is overlapping your shapes inverts the shape color from black to white. The shape you need to create is Black and the Background White so an understanding of how shapes invert to create over shapes helps. \n\nThis also means you can use shapes not only to add to the creation of the overall shape but to also remove (subtract) from it. The game starts off very simple and the first 33 levels were a breeze. First level I got stuck on was level 40 then later on a few more here and there, then at 57 I just couldn't anymore... You win this time game. LUCKLY! There is a guide to help out those who were not gifted by the gods with multi-dimensional shape wizard powers. \n\nOn the Brightside, It gives an easy 100% achievement, has 66 levels, cost like $1 or 50c on sale and a pretty chill game for a few hours. \n\nGame is a little buggy but it's fine, Shift+ Tab breaks the game, Alt tabbing is not a good idea either and the last level freezes the game as well.

Even with a correct solution, there is no congratulation, no roll-credits, no jump menu back to beginning. It just stays on puzzle 66 and you think you got something wrong. I retried 3 or 4 times before I realized I had already been given the achievement.\n\nI tore through this game in a sitting, and if you're a fan of this type of geometric puzzle, you'll probably tear through it quickly as well.

It gets quite challenging in spots.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, but for visual thinkers especially.

Such a simple concept can quite literally force you to think outside the box until the box doesn't even look like a box anymore.\n\nAlso, a quick tip that seemed to help a bit - It's good to start by looking for larger shapes inside of the figure instead of piecing together the bits to create the bigger pieces.

that really gets you thinking. It's far from being perfect, and I have a [i]lot[/i] of pet-peeves that I'm going to list soon, but for the price of this game, I'd recommend it.\n\nHere are the pros:\n - Straight forward and easy to get;\n - Very cheap (as of writing this review);\n - Intuitive and interesting.\n\nAnd the cons:\n - This game doesn't have an user interface: you start at the game, no pause: just a button to turn off the music and a button to turn off \"FX\" (which didn't seem to make a difference for me). There is no level reseting: you have to switch between levels to restart. No quitting button either: pressing \"esc\" toggles windowed mode, and then you close it;\n - The \"board\" is way too small and finicky, making you have to \"struggle\" to move pieces around. Could definitely use a bigger board (or one that wasn't round), or maybe even a \"pocket\" to keep pieces you're not using instead of putting them in the corner while solving the puzzles;\n - The rendering of the pieces wasn't really that good: some edges would overlap in weird ways. Also, the level number that display in the middle of the screen gets messed up after a while, so you can't really tell in which level you are except for the achievements;\n - The gameplay itself is wonky: getting pieces near the edges of the board will make them go back to their original position, even when you've technically placed them still inside the boundaries of the board. This game could also use some sort of piece highlight for when similar pieces overlap and get white: you can actually lose the pieces if you don't pay attention. And even if you do, you can't pick specific pieces when overlaping: the one you get is the one you get. You have to put it aside to get the ones beneath it out (refer to point #2);\n - I'm okay with simplistic styles, but when it's so simplistic that you don't have much to do, I don't quite like. This game has too few elements to go on: it's basically play the game or not play the game, no middle ground like a menu or pause, or settings to poke at;\n - The puzzles were quite fun, and although this might be because I was lucky/unlucky, the difficulty curve felt rather random after the first few puzzles: some levels were really tough, taking like 5 whole minutes, but the next one could be solved in 10 seconds;\n - Last, but not least, the last level just sits there. After you solved it, it doesn't do anything: I genuinely thought the game had bugged out and didn't recognize that I beat the level. It doesn't display any messages or change anything (like going back to the first level or resetting the same). So you may just sit there for a while trying to understand what went wrong.\n\nI think that, given an update to improve some of the points I mentioned would make this game much more worth it. The idea of the puzzles is pretty neat, but if it wasn't for the low price, I wouldn't recommend. Still had plenty of fun with it, it's quite challenging and gets you thinking in all sorts of strategies!", "timestamp_created": 1481256497, "timestamp_updated": 1481256796, "voted_up": true,

This would be an example of a Zen-like game. It's minimalistic, has a simple rule-set, two positives equals a negative, two blacks make a white, etc, but quite quickly you realize there is a nice interplay of reason and intuition.\n\nIt is this interaction of vague logic with intuitive or trial and error game-play that makes the game not entirely Zen, but instead at times quite frustrating. It's not like other similar experiences that are minimalistic and rely heavily on sound and simple mechanics to create some type of relaxing situations. It does not retain its tranquility in a consistent way. Not that it's a bad thing, but it goes from intuitive and pleasant to logically dizzying swiftly, and without consistency.\n\nI'd say the vast majority of the puzzles are very simple, they are solved within a 30-second span of time. Then we have more complex ones, that I for no good reason understand the complexity of. Usually you can count how many square dots the new form you are creating is confined to, and you can at times reduce the possible positions of the forms you have available quite a bit, \u201cthis particular shape can only be created by having this piece here\u201d. So you start to build up this logic for how to approach the puzzle, but it all breaks apart as soon as you run into a wall, after having tried these methods. At least that was the case for me.\n\nPerhaps my thinking with shapes is not as sharp as it should be, or could be, and I suppose that is where the difficulty of this game sometimes come from; not knowing how to create one set of shapes with a different set of shapes. It is so deceptively simple that it's infuriating to not be able to pinpoint a method or thought-process to deal with these puzzles. The puzzles that were solved within 30-seconds were so intuitive that it felt brilliant, I solved it before I could acknowledge \u201cYes, that's how you do it!\u201d. And many times I redid the puzzles after having thought \u201cWhat was it I actually did here?\u201d. \n\nThe puzzles are always solved in a sequence, and after you apply the method of looking at how the shapes interact with each other and within what confines they need to exist, solutions come about almost automatically. This adds to the idea of a calm and relaxing experience, every solution is coupled with a pretty sound and a clear sense of progression and accomplishment which reinforces this feeling. But then you have the ones where you get stuck. I probably had one or two of them that I was stuck on for at least 20 minutes each one. Each time I thought to myself that I had hit the difficulty curve, but after every such difficult puzzle, the subsequent puzzle was solved in a matter of seconds. If this was intentional, it's a very nice aspect, and relieves a lot of that frustration. The worst thing in a game is to hit a wall, after which you hit an even bigger wall \u2013 it becomes somewhat demoralizing, unless you like that kind of thing, a \u201cchallenge\u201d. While it is possible this difficulty curve was a matter of chance, a lapse in logic or luck not at all to do with the puzzles themselves or any intentional difficulty spike from the developer, My experience became ameliorated as a result of the fortunate difficulty-flux.\n\nI believe, despite its simplicity and lacking visuals, that it holds up as a game. The audibles are constituted by a general droning of soft meditative tones, which further adds to the relaxation factor, despite being a distinct loop. Looping drones usually add to what I consider to be relaxing, but I imagine that's far from a universal opinion. The audio could similarly be called minimalistic, and if minimalism isn't you thing, then obviously this game isn't either, more than for its (to my knowledge) novel game mechanic. It's a nice holistic experience, every aspect fits together well and makes for an interesting exploration of a simple game-mechanic based in a logical rule and geometrical shapes. If you are in the mood for an at times relaxing, at times challenging, puzzle-game, this is cheap and short enough to not really serve as a risk by any means. I imagine it is also more pleasant if you, instead of forcing yourself to try to figure out a puzzle, leave it and come back to it later, maybe even another day. That seems to reset your mindset a bit, and gives recourse to the intuitive solutions, and eliminates the greater feelings of frustration.

Black shapes occupy positive space, while the white background/shapes occupy negative space. (black = 1, white = 0)\n2. When black shapes overlap each other, the overlapping part becomes white negative space. (1 - 1 = 0)*\n3. When a black shape overlaps within a white shape, the overlapping part remains as a black positive space. (1 - 0 = 1)\n\nThough simplistic they may sound, these premises can produce a variety of brain teasers. Each level requires the player to arrange a set of shapes so that it matches the given picture. The earlier tutorial levels are straightforward, but soon you'll probably find your own eyes playing tricks on your mind, especially when it's hard to tell where you need to overlap the shapes exactly.\n\nOn the other hand, the level navigation needs work since there is no proper \"menu\" for the players to jump into a specific level.

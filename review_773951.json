It's actually a pretty fresh, original PVE FPS with elements of strategy. \n\nEven though it's a recent release EA title, the game is quite enjoyable in it's current state.  The battles are fun and addictive.  Flanking and finding cover are legit tactics.  One gripe I have is that once you learn the mechanics and get a good gun the fights become trivially easy.  All you have to do is play defensive and snipe.  Hopefully the devs can find ways to make it more challenging.  It's still early though, and they are off to a great start.  \n\nThe strategy is simple and has room to grow.  The AI factions seem to be busy fighting each other and doing their things. \n Hopefully with diplomacy, etc. it will become more fleshed out in the future.  Again, it is a bit too easy once you learn the ropes.  Trade and carefully picked battles will get you rich fast.  \n\nOverall a promising and surprisingly fresh take on the M&B concept.  The price isn't obscene either.  Add in the frenzied pace the devs have been updating (so far...) and you have a solid EA game well worth full price.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521559937, "timestamp_updated": 1521559937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40940188": {"recommendationid": "40940188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337391375", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519455103}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e0c\u671b\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1521559208, "timestamp_updated": 1521559208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40938065": {"recommendationid": "40938065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274184226", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "last_played": 1521438787}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u505a\u7684\u597d\u4e0d\u597d\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u7684\u4e00\u70b9\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u8ba9\u4f60\u73a9\u5b8c\u90a32\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6ca1\u67092\u5c0f\u65f6\u5c31\u9000\u6b3e\u3002\n\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u4e0b\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5dee\u8bc4\u548c\u9000\u6b3e\uff1a1\uff0c\u665a\u4e0a\u654c\u4eba\u7684\u89c6\u529b\u771f\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u6839\u672c\u770b\u4e0d\u5230\u654c\u4eba\u548c\u6253\u9776\u5b50\u4e00\u6837\u6253\u4f60\n2\uff0c\u7784\u51c6\u955c\u771f\u662f\u5199\u5b9e\uff0c\u6253\u5f00\u773c\u775b\u90fd\u8981\u82b1\u4e86\u3002\u673a\u7784\u611f\u89c9\u6bd4\u7784\u51c6\u955c\u597d\u7528\n3\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u96f7\u8fbe\u6ca1\u6709\u5c0f\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u6218\u672f\u5730\u56fe\u53ea\u663e\u793a\u654c\u4eba\u8fdb\u653b\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u8ddf\u7740\u5c0f\u961f\u8d70\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u88ab\u72d9\u72d9\u4e86\uff0c\u621150\u4e2a\u4eba\u625326\u4e2a\u4eba\u5c45\u7136\u6ca1\u6253\u8d62\n4\uff0c\u654c\u4eba\u548c\u53cb\u519b\u7684\u533a\u522b\u53ea\u5728\u4e8e\u53cb\u519b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e70\u4f60\u4e1c\u897f\u654c\u4eba\u4e0d\u80fd", "timestamp_created": 1521551943, "timestamp_updated": 1521551943, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.342105", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40935349": {"recommendationid": "40935349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321443899", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "last_played": 1521550818}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a", "timestamp_created": 1521538582, "timestamp_updated": 1521538582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40934570": {"recommendationid": "40934570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998240408", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 540, "last_played": 1521567953}, "language": "english", "review": "Great idea with an awesome dev team.

You start out with 2 squads and can hire more to replenish your company. The rest of the days you will spend fighting Bandits and Rebels, looting their equipment and selling it while your squads level up and unlock new weaponry and strengths, which makes them more effective at killing enemies as now they may be able to throw grenades.\n\nThere are various factions, each with their own units, which you can now capture and possible convert to your cause.\n\nYou also have 2 companions which are at your side and can be equipped, and leveld up, just like you.\n\nThe map right now is pretty barebones still with only a single mission for you to take and the rest of the time you'll spend hunting mobs to pay your squad.\n\n----\n\nIn short, if you liked Mount & Blade and want it in modern times, then buy this game.

of the videos and the trailers for this game is a major let down i was hesitant to buy the game to start with due to the trailors with the voice over being very dull and plain,\n\nbecause of the price i thought aaa to hell with it ill give it a shot.\n\nthis game is a fantastic game please dont let the trailers be a put of granted there is alot of work that needs doing but the basic idea i love, to compare to another game it is identical in so many aspects to a game i realy enjoy called mount and blade packs.\n\ni highly recomend this game and say you wont be disappointed.\n\njust remember at this stage of development it is early accses and there are obvouise flaws but for the price of under 12 pounds its a bargin. \n\nill give this game 4 out of 5 stairs purly because it is still in

This means, your job is to raid towns, enslave the locals and naturally, Russian weapons are superior to NATO platforms. Every meme about Russian propaganda is alive & well in this game. CNN could not have asked for a better cutout / sockpuppet case study. \n\nThe game itself is made by two models, both of which were banned from twitter & twitch for copyright violations (by the real models/identities), their 10 undisclosed asian backers who operate out of a multi million dollar office in Hong Kong (naturally not registered with the authorities), and their shady Iranian asset developers, who work on cutout projects and run bot farms.\n\nQuestionable production history and team aside, the game is well done and is coming along nicely. It's like President Putin went to Daybreak games and wanted a Mount & Blade knockoff, with some added features like open network connections, stolen art assets & bad AI to try and get people interested in raping & looting small countries. \n\nIn that respect, the game works well. You get to caputre locals, raid their villages, execute hostages and that's about it.  \n\nIf you assume the game is likely a shell and keylogger and follow along, it could become something impressive or at least a proof of concept for a real studio to try and expand on the M&B concept.\n\nIf you look at the reviews, some of these are astroturf accounts on Steam, which is also a red flag. \n\n(I wish I was joking, but this post is 100% real on the warning & game quality / backer relationships).\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521268883, "timestamp_updated": 1521268883, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500850", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40864615": {"recommendationid": "40864615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020386444", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 534, "last_played": 1520937251}, "language": "schinese", "review": "        \u9996\u5148,\u629b\u5f00\u9a91\u780d\u5c31\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u770b\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8bdd,\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519,\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e,\u8bb8\u591a\u4e1c\u897f\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0,BUG\u4e5f\u6709,\u4f46\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u826f\u5fc3\u554a,\u7b2c\u4e00 \u5b98\u4e2d\uff01\uff01\uff01\u7b2c\u4e8c \u5bf9\u6e38\u620f \u5bf9\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u8ba4\u771f\u5ea6 \u503c\u5f97\u8868\u626c\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BUG \u80fd\u591f\u53ca\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b0\u8981\u7d20\u3002\n        \u82e5\u6e38\u620f\u957f\u671f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u53bb\u5b9a\u662f\u6b3e\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u524d\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u4e45\u4e86\u4f1a\u89c9\u5f97\u67af\u71e5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u963b\u6b62\u6211\u5bf9\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u559c\u7231\u3002\n        \u6e38\u620f\u6bcf\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u73a9\u5bb6\u90fd\u5728\u540e\u9762\u7559\u8a00\u63d0\u51faBUG\u7b49,\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u53bb\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u8bf4\u8bf4\u6c49\u5316\uff0c\u6211\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u6c49\u5316\u7ec4\u7684\u6210\u5458\u5bf9\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u6ee1\u610f\uff0c\u5f53\u6211\u5728\u524d\u4e24\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u62c6\u5f00Assembly-UnityScript\u770b\u4e86\u4e0b\u5f88\u591a\u90fd\u6ca1\u6c49\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u4ef7\u683c \u4e2d\u7acb  \u4ea4\u6218\u7b49\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u6da6\u8272\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u5230\u4f4d\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u5355\u8fd8\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u80fd\u591f\u53ca\u65f6\u8ddf\u8fdb\u6c49\u5316\u3002\n        \u6700\u540e\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5f00\u542fMOD\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\u5175\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u76f8\u514b\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\u5f00\u542f\u6218\u8f66,\u88c5\u7532\u8f66,\u5766\u514b\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\u597d\u5427\uff0c\u4f60\u8fd8\u662f\u6162\u6162\u5f00\u53d1\u5427\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u7740\u6025\u3002\n        \u5f85\u4f60\u66f4\u52a0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86\u518d\u6765\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e00\u756a\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1521264713, "timestamp_updated": 1521264713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40864178": {"recommendationid": "40864178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061467754", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1520776380}, "language": "english", "review": "Ole!!!\n* Mount&Blade + guns\n\nOle!!\n* Great Developer Support\n* Good FPS Gameplay\n\nOle!\n* Good Performance\n* Very Good Graphics\n\nNot Ole\nRelative Poor Animations\n\nOle Rating:\n9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1521262595, "timestamp_updated": 1521262595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40863214": {"recommendationid": "40863214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001132635", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "last_played": 1521262388}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has lots of potential.

It is shaping up to be something like Mount and Blade plus Arma, and it's very good. The gunplay is very smooth, and is realistic. The maps are very open, unless you are doing a town fight. Early game you don't do a whole lot of town fighting, but late game you certainly do. The optimization keeps getting better but still leaves a bit to be desired. Further more I think the guns, although fun to shoot, need more diversity. Burstfire weapons, guns with higher or lower rates of fire, and I think they should widen the damage band so as to allow more diversity in how much damage weapons do. I hope they add vehicles one day, that would be a load of fun.\n\nOverall I do reccomend this game as it gets updated regularly. the devs are good, and the gameplay is fun.

However, I heavily dislike the addition of companion, because the leveling aspect of the game is a bit counterproductive right now. it feels like a cheap way of locking a big army at the start and feels like a forced progressionblocker. The first view levels there isnt even a choice for your skillpoint spending, since you need to get the maximum amount of squad per battle up asap. In later stages of the game, most of your choices are useless, since you probably only use one weapon type anyway. (and the weapons arent realy a choice either, you quickly end up with a good long range weapon like the as val) Since the skills are capped based on your current level you are more or less forced to pick useless traits for your skillpoints. And this all becomes a way worse situatuon for your comapnion, because the skill that are usefull for your maincharacter like the ones which increase your squad/party limit, or your navigation seem not to be working when ypu also level these points up for your companion.\n\nRight now i would NOT recommend to buy the game in the current state, it gets boring rather quick and the latest addition of these companions just force you to pay even more attention to a system, that was tedious and not well thought out in the first place.\n\nBut please, keep an eye on this game, because with a little

Freeman Guerrilla Warfare punktet bereits mit seiner d\u00fcsteren Zukunftsvision, kann es uns aber auch mit dem Gameplay begeistern?\n\n[h1][b]Allgemeines[/b][/h1]\n[u][Hierbei handelt es sich um eine fr\u00fche Version des Spiels][/u]\nFreeman Guerrilla Warfare wirft uns zu Beginn auf eine gro\u00dfe Insel. Wir blicken auf eine Einheit, welche auf einer gro\u00dfen Map, umringt von St\u00e4dten und anderen Einheiten darauf wartet von uns gesteuert zu werden. Schnell wird klar, dass es sich hierbei um eine Art \"Gruppe/Armee\" handelt. \n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\nDas Gameplay richtet sich vor allem an Spieler von Ego-Shootern und teilweise sogar Mount & Blade - Liebhabern. Auf der Karte hat man unendlich viel zeit, l\u00e4uft das Taktiksystem auf der Karte nur bei der Bewegung der eigenen Spielfigur. Ihr steuert diese mit der Maus auf der Weltkarte von A nach B, handelt mit St\u00e4dten, versucht Gegnern auszuweichen und/oder \u00fcberf\u00e4llt mit eurer Truppe eine Gruppe von Gegnern, w\u00e4hrend diese gerade ein Lager aufschlagen oder f\u00fcr euch einen Hinterhalt vorbereiten.\nDabei ist man am Anfang ziemlich auf sich alleine gestellt, ist das \"Tutorial\" nicht wirklich existent. Aber nach einigen Versuchen hat man das Spiel dann doch verstanden und wei\u00df, wie man sich auf der Map zurecht findet.\nHabt ihr euch nun schlussendlich dazu entschlossen eine gegnerische Gruppe anzugreifen, zoomt das Spielgeschehen auf eine weitere Taktikkarte. Diese ist kleiner und konzentriert sich auf einen kleinen Ausschnitt auf der gro\u00dfen Weltkarte. Hier positioniert ihr eure Truppen. Anhand von roten Bewegungspfeilen ist zu erkennen, woher die Gegner vermutlich kommen werden. \nDann, nach der Aufstellung, lasst ihr euch selbst auf die Karte nieder und k\u00f6nnt in der gewohnten Ego-Perspektive dem Gegner einheizen.\nDoch Vorsicht ist geboten. Ein wildes \"Drauflosrennen\" kann schnell zum Tod f\u00fchren. Daher muss man taktisch und vorsichtig an die Sache heran gehen. Auf der Karte kann man seinen Truppen Bewegungsbefehle erteilen und so die Verteidigung aufbauen oder eben die Ann\u00e4herung an den Feind organisieren. Der eigene Spieler kann sich Hinlegen, Hocken, rennen, vorsichtig vorr\u00fccken und und und. Veteranen aus der ArmA-Reihe f\u00fchlen sich hier vermutlich pudelwohl.\nDann, nachdem der Kampf beendet ist, kann man die Gegner looten und baut sich somit einen immer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Reichtum an. Dieser endet nicht bei dem Besitz der Truppe sondern m\u00fcndet in dem Aufbau einer ganzen eigenen Stadt. Freeman bietet viele tolle Ans\u00e4tze, befindet sich jedoch noch in der Entwicklung.\n\n[i][u]Positiv[/u][/i]\n[list]\n[*]Gute Grafik\n[*]Tolle Spielidee mit vielen taktischen M\u00f6glichkeiten\n[*]Herausforderndes Gameplay. Man m\u00f6chte immer mehr Gegner erwischen, bek\u00e4mpfen und sich weiterentwickeln.\n[*]Die Belohnung eines jeden gewonnenen Kampfes f\u00fchrt dazu, dass man sich immer gr\u00f6\u00dfere Ziele steckt. \n[*]Egoshooter meets Stratege meets Management. Was will man mehr?\n[/list]\n\n\n[i][u]Negativ[/u][/i]\n[list]\n[*]Manchmal triste Umgebungen \n[*]Detailarme Karte\n[*]Motivation f\u00e4llt nach einigen Stunden rapide ab. \n [/list]\n\n\n[h1][b]Technik[/b][/h1]\nDie Grafik schwankt zwischen wirklich h\u00fcbsch zu furchtbar h\u00e4sslich. Die Animationen der einzelnen Soldaten brauchen ein Update, wirken sie doch noch zu plastisch.\nDas Spiel l\u00e4uft auf Mittelklasse-Rechnern fl\u00fcssig.\n\n\n[h1][b]Wiederspielwert[/b][/h1]\nIm Moment spielt man mehrere Runden und fragt sich dann, wann kommt mehr. Der Entwickler ist angehalten mehr Content zu bieten, denn ab einer gewissen Spielzeit ist leider etwas die Luft raus.\n\n[h1][b]Fazit[/b][/h1]\nDas Spiel ist derzeit f\u00fcr jeden etwas, der gerne Taktik-Shooter spielt und dazu auch etwas Managment nicht verachtet.\n\n\n[h1][b]Zusatz[/b][/h1]\nWer sich von dem Spiel extra \u00fcberzeugen m\u00f6chte, der kann auf das nun folgende Video

The game allows you to take part in the battle from first person but also command troops in a very simple yet effective map view simultaneously.

These guys really care about this game.\n- Combat system is solid\n- Being able to command your guys around the field in a map view as well as being able to fight fps, is amazing\n- The concept/idea of this game fills a much needed hole in the market\n- A really fun game. Even when you're losing and doing badly, I wouldn't describe it as frustrating or unenjoyable.\n- There is a good amount of weapons and character customisation which is a fun aspect to this game - although the ability to actually see your character in the outfit you've selected would be cool.\n- The sound effects in this game are great for an early access game. Really adds to the games atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n- The AI in combat can be poor, and you'll see your guys lie down in the open NEAR cover, rather than behind it.\n- When you tell your guys to move to a position on the map, they'll move to it.... roughly. When you tell them to move to an area because it'll provide them cover, they'll go in that general direction but they won't really register it as cover that they should hide behind.\n- Relating to the previous point - AI have no awareness of buildings/structures. There are different buildings around the map, but if you tell your guys to move to a building that would be great for them to go into to take a defensive stance, they will just stand around the building. A way to improve this would be adding the option to \"point and command\" during the first person view. Being able to tell them to hug a wall for example.\n- The quests and interactions are minimal. The only quests so far (that I've seen anyway) is to take/capture a certain amount of cities... which is a bit lazy. I get the impression this is because it is early access though and more intersting quests and interactions with parties will be added. An idea of having character Leaders for each parties going around would be a good idea and an opportunity to develop more interesting quests.\n\nThis is by far a perfect game, but it is very enjoyable. Even though I have quite a large list of cons, this is one of my favourite games to play at the moment and I don't see me getting particularly bored of it any time soon. The room for development that it has I think will gradually get addressed by the very active development team, and when they do get addressed, I could see myself logging an embarrassing amount of hours playing this game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1520795296, "timestamp_updated": 1520795296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40748866": {"recommendationid": "40748866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099350180", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1918, "last_played": 1521723377}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u603b\u4f53\u8fd8\u884c\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65b0\u961f\u53cb\u5b8c\u5168\u662f\u5751 \uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6839\u672c\u5347\u4e0d\u4e86\u7ea7\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ea\u5e26\u4e863\u4e2a\u5175\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u9001\u7684\u961f\u53cb\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5347\u7ea7\u589e\u52a03\u4eba\u52305\u4eba\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5c31\u662f\u62db\u52df\u90e8\u961f\u6709\u65f6\u51fb\u6740\u4e0d\u52a0\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b58\u6863\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u5f88\u5751\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u591a\u51e0\u4e2a\u5b58\u6863\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u73b0\u5728\u53ea\u80fd\u5b58\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u6218\u7684\u573a\u666f\u591a\u505a\u70b9\uff0c\u6253\u6765\u6253\u53bb\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e48\u51e0\u4e2a\uff0c\u4f5c\u6218\u5730\u56fe\u9ad8\u4f4e\u5761\u5728\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u5f88\u96be\u5206\u8fa8\uff0c\u961f\u4f0d\u6307\u4ee4\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u6307\u6325\u90e8\u961f\u8d70\u505c\u51b2\u950b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u52a0\u5165\u8ba9\u90e8\u961f\u5367\u5012\uff0c\u4e22\u96f7\u554a \u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u9760AI\u5b9e\u5728\u4e0d\u9760\u8c31\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u90e8\u961f\u88ab\u6253\u6b7b\u4f24\u8fc7\u534a\u624d\u77e5\u9053\u8db4\u4e0b\uff0c\u603b\u4e4b\u6307\u4ee4\u5e0c\u671b\u591a\u52a0\u70b9\u5427\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u5c31\u662f\u6218\u5229\u54c1\u6389\u7684\u603b\u5f52\u90a3\u51e0\u6837\uff0c\u597d\u70b9\u7684\u67aa\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u6389\u4e0d\u51fa\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u5417\uff0c\u8981\u4e0d\u5237\u5175\u6ca1\u610f\u601d\u4e86\u3002\u603b\u4e4b\u671f\u5f85\u66f4\u65b0\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520793732, "timestamp_updated": 1520793732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40747340": {"recommendationid": "40747340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115179421", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "last_played": 1520789329}, "language": "english", "review": "Needs a lot of work but its fun in even its current state.

been dreaming of a strategic modern FPS. It fills a niche that AFAIK no-one has yet really addressed - ARMA has tried to do it but their system was just too hard to use and not enough fun to play.\n\nBasically you lead a small group of guerillas in a nation that is in a state of chaos, divided into factions controlling towns, and have the goal of founding your own state. At the start battles are very difficult, with only 10 men on your side against 15+ enemies even in the smallest group. Later on your group expands and you can upgrade your weapons an body-armour but you never feel like any battle bears no risk at all.\n\nMy main gripe at the moment is that there isn't enough in the way of a plot to the game, and that it doesn't really resemble guerilla warfare right now - instead its more like a turf war between factions in a failed state. Also the weapons upgrade a little too fast - you pretty much never use any of the less powerful/accurate guns. A bit more close-quarters combat in some battles might be good as well. These are all fairly minor complaints, though.\n\nMy ideal game would be one where you have to over-through a powerful government and have to grind your way up from leading a group of peasants army with hunting rifles, revolvers, and shot-guns battling against police/militia, to leading trained troops with modern assault rifles against fully equipped professional soldiers. Something like a modern version of the Cuban Revolution (but without necessarily having to be a communist) would be good.", "timestamp_created": 1520679412, "timestamp_updated": 1520679412,

what it was I instantly freaked out because I love M&B. First I can say this game is well worth the price it currently is ($15) and for it being at an early stage I'll try and write a fair review. So right now, as this game is, it's definitly playable. Right now theres one game mode called Domination where the goal is to take over the 10 towns on the map. You do so by getting better guns and armor and hiring/training an army. You get this money by defeating enemy squads roaming the map and selling their loot. (Some money is earned right after the fight). The money system is pretty well balanced I'd say. When your in what I would call a \"battle mode\" the game starts by giving you a command birds-eye view allowing you to see the enemies starting location an a chance for you to set up your squad. You can give them orders where to move, whether to be cautious or move fast, or follow you. The enemy AI and maps are a little iffy as of right now; sometimes I'll see rocks floating and AI will look up in the air or just stand still doing nothing while being shot at. The firefights are very fun though; large scale shooting with like 50 enemies while you're mowing em down is great. Truly a grind killing groups of people and selling their valuables and buying ammo and medpacks and upgrading my army to kill more things.\n\nHere's a list of Pros and Cons I've experienced with this game:\n\n[h1] PROS: [/h1]\n- Very balanced economy\n- Skills and Leveling\n- Decent amount of guns\n- Decent amount of gun and class/inventory customization\n- Armor customization\n- Smooth Gameplay\n- Basic command system\n- Can run town as you would normally (Taxes, add buildings for econ, garrison, etc.)\n- Multiple factions\n- Mount and Blade type feel\n\n[h1] CONS: [/h1]\n- Graphics are a little bleh\n- Enemy AI can be stupid\n- Not many commanding options\n- Floating buildings and environtmental objects\n- Can get repetetive\n- No autosave\n- One save slot\n- Object hit-boxes can be a little too large\n- No use for non-weapon/food/equipment related loot other than selling\n(Why is there such a variety of only sellable loot?)\n\n[h1] Things I can suggest adding in the future: [/h1]\n\n- More guns and armor (of cooourrsee)\n- Larger variety of troops\n- Touch up the textures a bit\n- procedurally generated combat maps\n- Rotate the map where you can move and see towns n stuff\n- Button to make all squads cautious or charge for commanding\n- Larger map\n- Tasks (Which I know the developers are working on can't wait)\n- Generals or higher-ups for squads and factions for diplomatic reasons\n- Able to join army of leader (off of last suggestion)\n- top of screen compass HUD\n- cancel medkit heal when moving\n- Walk around town and see civilians doin civilian stuff\n\nIm 100% positive if the devs keep up the good work and effort with this game it'll be very good in the future. As for now it gets a little repetetive after a while. Anyways a Mount and Blade type game with guns is dope props for making it and I hope Freeman: Guerilla Warfare has a thriving future and I'll surely be looking forward to it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1520650222, "timestamp_updated": 1520650222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40696367": {"recommendationid": "40696367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004305369", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 419, "last_played": 1520890237}, "language": "german", "review": "Man f\u00fchlt sich wie bei Operation Flashpoint oder Armed Assault zusammen mit Mount & Blade.

It is blatantly obvious that this game borrows heavily from that serious, which is a large part of the reason that this game is so good. If you are not a fan of Mount and Blade, you will likely not enjoy this game.\n\nLike the Mount and Blade serious, this game allows a player to act as an adventurer in a hostile world with a group of followers awaiting your command in battle with the goal of establishing your own state. This game is definitely still bare-bones but is showing a ton of potential.\n\nWhat makes this game different than Mount and Blade is the setting and the type of Warfare. The environment is definitely Easter Europe, and rather than a medieval world, it is a modern setting (possible post apocalyptic?).\n\nThis game includes a world travel mechanic, a first-person shooter battle function that includes a strategy/command function. On the world map their are towns and other parties to interact/battle with. At the towns there are merchants, hospitals, mercenaries and barracks to do business with for equiring equipment, healing and troops. The world map includes a day and night cycle and weather cycle which both influcence and are represented in the gameplay in the battle mode.\n\nThe Battle mode is still pretty basic but very fun. In the beginning, you place your troops and give them move orders and other orders. The friendly AI isn't the best (they try to shoot through objects), but they at least make some attempt to stay in cover and move in formation. The enemy AI varies heavily on their combat level, which is pretty realistic and cool. I would really like it if friendly troops could garrison buildings and other types of cover. What I like most about the battle portion of the game is that the gunplay is pretty decent. A lot of shooters are very lazy when it comes to shooting mechanics, but this game is an exception to that. Muzzle velocity of weapons matters, because ballistics exist. Also, it is necessary to use bullet impacts on the environment to determine point of aim hold over. It is important to control recoil as well. There are also a handful of accessories that you can attach to your weapons. Not bad. To speak to the battle maps, they are definitely not randomly generated, as I've only seen about a half dozn different maps used. However, the maps are decent in size, and the locations that you and the enemy start at always change, meaning the setup will usually be different.\n\nI'll sum this up with a few pros and cons\n\nPros:\n+ Borrows heavily from the successful Mount and Blade series\n+ Good gun play\n+ Factions offer some variation in troops\n+ Decent variety in weapons to choose from (for a game in alpha)\n+ Towns offer plently of resources to supply yourself and your troops\n+ Economic/merchant system is decent\n\nCons:\n- Map isn't easy to navigate\n          Needs compass, more ability to zoom out\n- Needs more faction variety\n- Gun models look goofy\n- Bugs exist, but none of them game-breaking, most just deny the use of some content\n- AI could use improvement\n- Very little instruction. Very hard to play for those with no Mount and Blade experience\n\nIn summary, this is a high quality alpha game and shows a lot of promise for its eventual release.\n\n8/10 would go guerrila again\n", "timestamp_created": 1520605928, "timestamp_updated": 1520605928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40681959": {"recommendationid": "40681959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031878166", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1520684580}, "language": "english", "review": "Good concept, high community interaction, frequent updates.

I mean, there are a few good parts to this game, I found it fun for a few hours. A few things..\n\nFirst : Instead of using 1-3 for your weapons, the mouse wheel would be better.\n\nSecond : More laid out unit stats and weapons, the weapons my units carry don't seem to have descriptions, just pictures.\n\nThird : While commanding units from the map is nice, it would be great to have a command while outside the map, saying \"Find Cover\" where units run to cover. This means you should mess with tree stumps and such more. It's fine if you only have like..3-4 Overworld maps.. just make sure they work. Infact, unit commands in general would be nice. Select a unit with 1-0 or whatever you need.. and then issue commands like *Run*, *Crouch*, *Prone*, *Grenades*\n\n\nFourth : Unit Veriety, so, having Rpgs is nice, but grenade launchers would also be nice. Having a unit go from Recruit, to Soldier, to Grenedier, to Elite ranger or whatever, is kind of boring.\n\n\nFifth : Character customization, things like looks, origin, and so fourth, which change your base stats and such..\n\nSixth : Leadership and command should be the same thing, so far it's a bit confusing on how it's written. I do like how there are only 3 attributes however.\n\nAside from all of that, the truth is, this feels like a serious Mount and Blade: Warband copy, or, an incomplete mod from Mount and Blade: Warband. . so I feel a bit odd buying this so far. I'm really hoping the game goes further than where it currently is, it has SUCH potential and I genuinely suggest people to play it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I definetly like this game, but it needs a lot of work.", "timestamp_created": 1520434356, "timestamp_updated": 1520434356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

Arma? No. Simply no.\n\nFun mechanics with a very active dev team (when needed, mods are more active), frequent updates (slower now than before but obviously due to heavier mechanics being added. Crossreference this review date with News Updates from this date.)\\\n\nGraphics are nice for and indie team that seems to be taking minimal risks(as per the best referance, they beat Mount and Blade- unmodded). Could they go back and fix things up? Yeah.  Will they? Probably. I don't know. I hope so. - Sound is also fine. Could use more dynamic sounds or at least outside sounds with a falloff raidous)\n\nBattle Maps are bland. They'd fit Mount and Blade well, sure. But for a shooter... they're just... no. Fine to an extent but c'mon. The team knows what they can achieve so hopefully they do. \n\nSo far there are no city maps, no maps that could lead to a narrow heavy 'contention' area/battles (sadly, the best reference is lanes in MOBAs or hell, even city maps from Garrys Mod)\nSo don't expect to be wowed by the Battle Maps. The crew could certainly use some extra minds to help create maps outside the box. (Naturally, no objective based battles have been implemented yet but i've heard rumours of them)\n\nAs for the World Map, it is currently small. Does this mean the Early Access game will end quick? No. I had to restart around 5 times to finally get how i could 'juke' the game to get ahead and finally progress without running out of funds and squad mates (Yes. The start is very unbalanced. My tip - sell your pistol and all ammo, let your crew win a few rounds by themselves, buy a cheap rifle and then watch the progression skyrocket)\n\nBack on track - the world map is small, but eventually you'll hit a grind (mine came heavily after my first base capture, before that, the grind was what any gamer will come to expect).\nObviously they're still adding features. So you're gonna hit a point where it becomes stagnant. Does that mean it isn't worth it? Buddha, no. \n\nEasily, one can see this game being worth upward to $40 max (to reiterate... MAX) if the Devs add more Battle Maps variety, expand World Map (and honestly, even that needs more variety or at least visual flair), and naturally - implement the features from Mount and Blade fully. It'd be nice to see what innovation can come from it being an FPS though (see current news of future off map Artillery)\n\nMod Tools would be very welcomed as well to assure longevity of this game as a service, unless they plan to make a sequel within under a year of release and make the game less of a service and more of a profit margin.\n\nTL:DR - Game is great for early access, but sadly lacking in variety and understandably lacking in features. Worth the buy as a future investment.\n\n\n(complaints: *seriously, no gamma option? *Details on what happens when you add parts -silencer, flashlight, etc... - are non existant(if they even exist yet) and for some reasion night vision goggles have to replace your goggles which provide extra protection... like... that's a joke right? My friend who did two tours in the Middle East thinks not being able to put your night op specs over your goggles -in his case, which would protect from sand or even wind in general- is silly. Also, gimme then dual optic scopes. Hell, gimme that 4x scope with a night vision filter. I'll drop 10k ingame on it, no ragrets. Also the game lags when switching weapons. Oddly i can't seem to replicate this lag late in batte, but for the majority of the battle *90% it will hitch as you switch - primarilly to your main weapon... less so secondary and heavy. Also, AI can't mark targets. I mean... neither  can you. But c'mon. I don't use the \"T\" key, lemme market \"T\"argets with it - and my AI. ARF Constript takes 2 rpgs to kill, and that's only if it connects. If it connects there seems to be splash damage, if you hit the ground in between an enemy 4+ times there seems to be no-to minimal splash. Switching to Pistol should be faster to match common FPS titles, but seriously why do i cock the pistol every time i pull it out? That's wasting ammo. Your teams AI seems to Queue - like, i'll notice when i've near 4 team mates 1 will always wait for the rest to trigger their variable before enacting their own, which can lead to an awkward 10 seconds of a team mate sitting there doing nothing while the rest move out)", "timestamp_created": 1520304369, "timestamp_updated": 1520313662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40598492": {"recommendationid": "40598492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161176055", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518748444}, "language": "english", "review": "Has tons of potential, Rigth now it's fun, but it's clear that it's in early access.

Cause, when I plan strategy and organize my troops according to battle, I myself become very back of the battle. So moving our character over strateegic view would be very very nice\n-When we open strategic map, may be there should be a slightly showen physical map too. To see where is hills and wtc. It is important to organize your troops uphill\n-To show direction of incoming enemy when starting battle very nice idea. May be you can think of, battl map size according to enemy? Cause sometimes attaking 16-18 member bandits and map becomes huge for that little shits :) so according to enemy, narrowed map etc. options could be useful\n-for battles, agian may be there can be some strategical point which can be captured like towers, houses etc. For exp. water tank like tower, and you can put your sniper on it :) it would be nice..\n\nGENERAL GAME\n-No quest (I think it will be added)\n-Squad size can be increased, 5 to 7-8. Cause at max you can deploy 7 squads. If you make larger squads, more violent battles(BTW 7 squad is ok I guess)\n-Definetly need more weapons. (Only has two type of sniper rifle.)\n-When we get castle/city we should train generals or squads to patrol.\n-When we get castle/city we garrison some units, so there should be traning are, which can give exp to garrisoned units.

The strategic element of building your rebel army, upgrading your squads, seiging towns and issuing orders to create flanking routes in the field so far is very satisfying.  Each engagement feels different and tense, especially at higher difficulties.  Play it how you want it whether you're RTS heavy and outmanuever your enemy with calculated orders or FPS heavy and want to join your men in the field.  There's still a lot more the studio is working on so don't sell it short if its not your thing right now.   \n\nMy personal recommendations for improvement would be to make issuing orders from the map a bit smoother especially when you're in a firefight, tweak the enemy AI so that once they're engaged enemy squads converge and try to flank you and possibly add in voice commands for a headset.  Other than that, its a solid game that I'm more than excited to see how it evolves.", "timestamp_created": 1520269739, "timestamp_updated": 1520269739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40589421": {"recommendationid": "40589421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051340400", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 277, "last_played": 1521367213}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b98\u4e2d\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u53ef\u73a9\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u8865\u5168\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520268540, "timestamp_updated": 1520268540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40588701": {"recommendationid": "40588701", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984704071", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 158, "last_played": 1520727119}, "language": "french", "review": "Modification avis Apr\u00e8s un premier avis plut\u00f4t positif je suis mainenat plut\u00f4t n\u00e9gatif\n\nActuellement 10 Mars 2018 le jeu n'est pas termin\u00e9 mais parfaitement jouable \nSur la partie tactique je donne une note de 7/10\nSur la partie strat\u00e9gique je donne une note de 3/10\n\nDans les deux cas mais surtout au niveau strat\u00e9gique le jeu peut et doit \u00e9voluer pour \u00eatre assez bon\n\nTactiquement c'est assez  bien avec le concept de g\u00e9r\u00e9 son perso en FPS + des groupe de combat ttactiquement \u00e7a change d'un FPS classique.

It can be easily outsmarted, but has it's moments. For instance, if you spray bullets around an enemy, they freak out and lay down, hoping to not be shot. Except they're in the middle of the field and making themselves bigger targets. \n\nThere is the ability to play stealthily, and you can take entire towns solo, but it's extremely hard to do.\n\nI'd like to see more uses for the items in game. Water and Pills, for example, are strictly trading supplies, and aren't useful in-game (at least from what I've played). I feel like if there's more uses for the items, that the gameplay would be much more involved. IE, do I use the pills to speed up recovery, or sell them for extra magazines? Should I trade away the shovels I've found, or use them to entrench a city of mine? \n\nI'd also like to see a way to automate your troops. An option to follow, or dig themselves into cover. Often times your allies will lay in the middle of the field instead of attempting to take cover behind the tree stump right next to them. \n\nAlso, the ladders and things attached to buildings really need to be useable. The first one I encountered was a stairway to the top of a building and I ended up walking right through it. Kinda lame. \n\nStill, I bought this game and played it for 10 straight hours....

they come for you its ez but when you attack then its hard. its hard to start but you will win just get you man to a camp and wait for the enemy to come to you. its hard to learn the mechanics but you will get it over time. i just think attacking camps it a little to hard i got the best men in the game and still lost did it bout 10 times differnt startegies. i know its in early access but they need to let the men you army go it to building. i think when you are a lower level why to many higher levels come to fight you like come up to you or thats how it was for me, when i got to a higher level noone came up to me. the trading nice nothing is to overpriced but the sniper is but you get money fast so i guess its blanced. again i know its in early access but the enemies have aimbot like wtf you peak for a sec and boom you get head shot. your men they retreat to much i have men all the time just retreting when non of them died they may be out numberd they should fight no retreat or retreat when some of them die and i havent seen an update in like 2 weeks wut the f**k. the things for steam the vids are so cringy.", "timestamp_created": 1520130457, "timestamp_updated": 1520130457,

but it is barebones as of now.  To be fair, it's a decent fun game for $15.\n\nBasically a Modern-era Mount and Blade or at least has the core basics of that game. \n\nTroops: Recruit, replenish, upkeep and upgrade as they grow with experience. Troops aren't customizable as of now, there's  supposed to be plans for future squads acting like the companions in M&B with gear. Each faction has it's own base recruit squad and can be upgraded later on. Mercs act the same way but can often be recruited at the highest level. Better troops means better firepower and higher upkeep. However, I've seen high level troops get wrecked by basic recruits due to the AI.\n\nTowns: Structures are built immediately after purchase. Affects properity and \"security\" (Barely. The more prosperous the town, the better the merchants restock it seems. Purchase items and sell for a profit in another town. Gear, weapons and recruitment. \n\nGear: Standard fare of having armor for body parts (torso, legs, etc). Ammo for weapons are kept in belts and reloading discards a whole mag. \n\nGuns: Only several available right now and the Machine Gun seems to be the better off since it has better trade-off when it comes to ammo per magazine and range/damage. There is a bullet drop system, pretty easy to learn after a few clicks.\n\nFactions: Move across the map and have their own settlement. Pay tribute and become friendly but they seem to allow you to wander into their towns no matter the level of hostility so long as you pay a \"safe passage\" fee. There's a few factions but most don't really feel that different from each other as of now.\n\nCombat: AI is somewhat sluggish but manages to be at least be a threat or at least a nuisance. AI squad isn't the greatest at path finding but it does the job most of the time. Placement matters a lot here, higher terrain with cover(trees) can absolutley be lethal. Squads will take cover or go prone if necessary. I've taken heavily fortified towns with just a  few Sniper squads and Machine Gun teams. \n\nOverall a decent fun simplistic M&B shooter. Devs seem to be active on the discussion board and constantly offering updates/patches. I'm usually against Early Access games but this one is all right. Probably wait until it gets better patches and added content. \n\n$15 no regrets.

It does have far better modern combat then Warband offered in the various mods found over the years.  It does need more content for the current sandbox map.  I made my way around the map to the multiple towns, but never found a quest beyond the win condition you get a the start.  While some more options for weapons/gear might be nice I do not see a reason for it beyond cosmetic options.  Adding different ammo (AP, FMJ, HP) to counter armor, cause bleed damage, or other effects might add to the combat experience.  More food/medicine items could offer a bit more challenge for morale of troops, and also health options.  This would be for faster healing due to more food variety, and better medical care due to varied drugs/supplies.  Vehicles might be okay for world map travel, but I do not think they would help encounter event combat.  Tanks, Humvees, and other vehicles would not add to the experience.  I even think adding simple support options due to vehicles like faster resupply, reinforcement, and supporting fire might lower the experience rather then add to the tactics.\n\nOverall I liked my play experience so far, and look forward to what the future holds.  I have spent much free time on Warband, and the mods for it, just enjoying the sandbox open world experience.  I see that happening with Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare.  I dare say I might even enjoy a zombie mode of this game.  I do hate that I want a zombie mode, but I could see that working with this games decent FPS combat.", "timestamp_created": 1520050567, "timestamp_updated": 1520050567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40524930": {"recommendationid": "40524930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398406047", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520053415}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e70\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5b98\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5c45\u7136\u6709\u4e86\uff1f\uff1f\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u597d\u8bc4", "timestamp_created": 1520048623, "timestamp_updated": 1520048623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40521912": {"recommendationid": "40521912", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977593152", "num_games_owned": 1054, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "last_played": 1521279185}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing.

The player finds themselves the leader of a group of guerilla soldiers as you try to create and defend a new nation. The overworld has the player going to allied towns to trade, get recruits, or potentially attack. Enemies can be battled on the overworld also. Battles with enemy groups are in an FPS style where the player can order their soldier to move in a real time tactics style. \n\n[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nWhen a player starts up the game they are thrown right into the game. The player\u2019s goal is to craft a strong nation of 10 cities. During this overworld phase the player is free to trade, recruit, and battle enemies. By default the player is allied with American style army and the Russian style army. The player is at war with bandits and terrorists. Each faction has its own units with their own unique upgrades, so it can be important to diversify a player\u2019s army. The player is also force to pay and feed their army. These are both due at the end of a day, which last a while, and are received when an enemy army is defeated. The overworld management is very similar to Mount & Blade, so if you enjoy that kind of game and FPS games, then this is the title for you.\n\nThe game also has an RPG system. The player\u2019s character will gain experience for killing units and participating in battles. This allows the player to gain stat points such as strength, dexterity, and intelligence. Strength give more HP and inventory slots, dexterity provides a boost in weapon damage, and intelligence provides an extra skill point for every point in the stat. Skill points allow the player to get better with certain weapons types such as rifles or heavy weapons. Others proved extra loot, more unit experience, and extra inventory slots.\n\nUpon entering a battle, the tactics screen appears. The player can then deploy their recruited squads to fight alongside them. Squads can then be given orders such as multiple movement order. Units can also be told how to move such as charge which makes all your units run in a straight line no matter what, and proceed with caution where a player\u2019s units will wall cautiously until they see an enemy. They will then move into cover and shoot back. Units can also be ordered to retreat, where they will run back to the spawn point and leave the battlefield. This is useful if a squad has heavy morale loss or only has one member left. \n\nThe player joins the fight with their own specially equipped inventory. The FPS mechanics are really solid and an enjoyable experience. Bullet spread and recoil make sure that every shot has a certain inaccuracy. Player weapons can also gain attachments such as a scope, a flashlight, or silencer. Stealth works surprisingly well, and definitely feels like a viable strategy. The player can also equip body armor. This will slowly break as it takes damage, but it will often save valuable hp. What I really like about this game is that even though the player has an RPG system, they aren\u2019t some superhuman gunslinger. A player who isn\u2019t properly equipped will die just as quickly, if not faster, than their units.\n\n[u]Sound:[/u]\nThe weapon sounds are so satisfying and were recorded very well. Each shot felt like it had a weight to it. Body armor sounds are also great. My adrenaline started pumping when I was low health and heard the \u201cting\u201d of body armor breaking instead of my hp. Footstep sounds are decent and are just an ambient sound like in most games. Besides battle sounds, there aren\u2019t that many sound effects which I found enjoyable as they didn\u2019t distract from this game\u2019s tense combat.\n\n [u]Graphics:[/u]\nThe graphics in this game are surprisingly good for an indie title. The weather effects are just beautiful. I loved the rain effects as they really add some interesting variety in a game that could start to look graphically stagnant. Weapons look amazing and so do the character models. The animations could use some work however. Characters getting up from the prone position while firing look very odd.\nThe HUD is minimal and non-obtrusive. The developers have created a perfect balance of informational, and leaving screen space open. The same goes for the strategy layer's graphics. The UI is minimal but effective allowing me to effortlessly create a strategy instead of being troubled by menus.\n\n[u]Performance:[/u]\nThe game runs quite well. When I turned down the graphics from very high to high, I had difficulty telling these graphic levels apart. This allows players with lower specs to enjoy just as much graphical fidelity. I am also happy to report that overworld doesn\u2019t have any lag even though there are often many different armies walking around simultaneously. I think there is currently a bug where units will look straight up after standing up after being prone.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u]Pros:[/u]\nSolid FPS Gameplay\nGreat Developer Support\nGreat Performance\nGreat Graphics\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\nAnimations Could Use Some Work\nTooltips could use some work.\n\n[u]Rating[/u]\n[b]8/10[/b].\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1519872498, "timestamp_updated": 1521475856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730718", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40472874": {"recommendationid": "40472874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359954805", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1521144880}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u0432\u044b \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044c, \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435, \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043a, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c \u043c\u0443\u044e\u044e\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0437\u044e\u043c\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043b \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043b \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u044f) \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b \u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f) \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451\u043c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438)", "timestamp_created": 1519856807, "timestamp_updated": 1519856807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40470641": {"recommendationid": "40470641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327384084", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "last_played": 1520985210}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic. Fantastico.\nOf course the game is on early access but the core and essence of it is very well denoted. It is more than obvios that it's biggest inspiration has been Mount&Blade Series and guess what, it works. \nThink about it. M&B Series are all about Medieval warfare, how could Modern warfare fit into this style? \nWell basically, moving your \"Character/Party\" across the map is of course quite boring sometimes, (in both games) unless you have a mission or need to fullfill, but here, the combat turns into something completely new as the game has a great AI and combat mechanic. Completely different to many other shooters we can come across. Think about ArmA for instance. It is a Slow paced warfare game (And an excellent one) yet, haven't you tried searching a game that actually gives you any sort of freedom, action and actual tactics in the midst of combat? Worry no more. F:GW is your pick! \nSo far, you'll be able to pick between several rifles, pistols, SMGs, even machineguns and an RPG. Also, there is lot of gear to protect yourself, and this is something i really have to point out. Getting a good helmet for example, will not only protect you more but also keep your head in place one you are hit. Same goes for the vests. \nCreating an army is WAY easier than M&B series (and sorry for repeating this too much) so far, but loosing it is also quite easy. Tactics are essential, and besides the game so far is really limited when it comes to the orders and the maps, it is simple incomparable to run between the woods, a hill or even in the open field while getting shot from every place, then taking cover, ordering your troops what to do while these inform you what the hell is going on! \nThe campaign map is of course really basic so far.

Granted, it does still need a few tweaks here and there, but it does offer lots of hours of fun.  Basically, the best way to describe this game would be to take Mount and Blade, and add in FPS to it.  \n\nThat being said, the game does come with a few quirks, but judgeing from the Dev team's response to issues addressed on the forums, they are looking at and working on them.  Granted, not every issue can be addressed, but their presence and interaction with the community is pretty solid.\n\nNow for Pro's vs Con's:\n\nPros:\n\nVisual:\n\nVisually the game isn't stunning, but it still renders a respectful graphical approch.  There are a few things that need to be fixes (mostly in the deployment map,  It can be difficult at times to properly judges the height and incline of hills) However all in all, the graphics are pretty well done, especially when zooming, even though the graphics at times may seem a bit...clunky/rectuangler.\n\nAudio:\nThe ambient sounds while in battle are well done, and give you a excellent heads up to local surroundings.  The audio helps you \"audioably\" locate the next battle, as well as if there are a few enemy units taking pot shots at you.\n\nThe only down side is that when you or one of your teammates are hit, it sounds like glass shattering, not actual body hits.  This may have been by design, but it can be a wee bit jarring.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game is very fun, and I find that I can loose myself for a hour or two, killing bandits and the such, as well as building up my company.  It very fun, and I've spent quite a few hours working on my own stratagey, as well as stareing at the deployment map, re-adjusting my attacks and such to make sure that my units level up and get the most exp possiable; all the while closing the map to wreck the poor sap that tried to step up to me.  \n\nAll in all, this game IS fun, and a enjoyable experiance.  The devs are very active on the forums, and they deserve respect.  Not may AAA titls even come close to this closeness of interaction with the community.  They have a long way to go, and they know it, but they are still working on it.  \n\nIf you are looking for a \"M&B\" style game with FPS mechanics added in,  I strongly suggest giving this a buy.

Mais c'est clair qu'il vaut mieux avoir une petite r\u00e9solution sympa . Les combats , si vous attendez tranquillement l'ennemi , commencent d'assez loin . je ne veux pas dire que le jeu est injouable sans \u00e7a , certainement pas , mais un vrai confort pour atteindre les cibles semi lointaines sans sniper  \n\nJe vais attendre encore un peu mais je pense que je viendrais rajouter que c'est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu .\n\nApr\u00e8s 14 heures de jeu , je me r\u00e9gale toujours autant . Il faut combattre pas mal de temps avant de pouvoir attaquer l' objectif principal . Avec les sc\u00e9ances de combats et gestion de ses troupes \u00e7a ne se ressent gu\u00e8re et on avance ... prudemment et avec plaisir . \n\nPour am\u00e9liorer le jeu : L'environnement de combat qui devient r\u00e9p\u00e9titif assez vite . Quelques zones suppl\u00e9mentaires seraient le bienvenue . Compens\u00e9 quand m\u00eame par le tr\u00e8s bon gameplay des combats et l'\u00e9volution de ses troupes . \n\n                                    Avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de switcher ses scopes pendant les combats seraient un plus aussi je trouve .", "timestamp_created": 1519812773, "timestamp_updated": 1520050297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40457444": {"recommendationid": "40457444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150220855", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "last_played": 1521193250}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[strike]\u6309\u793e\u533a\u6307\u5357\u6253\u4e86\u4e2a\u4fee\u6539MOD\u611f\u89c9\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u6bd4\u539f\u6765\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\u3002[/strike]\n\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u680f\u53ea\u9650\u653eRPG\u771f\u662f\u592a\u9e21\u808b\u4e86\uff0c\u4e00\u680f\u8f7b\u578b\u6b66\u5668\u4e00\u680f\u91cd\u578b\u6b66\u5668\u5c31\u5f88\u597d\u3002\n\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u80fd\u5e267\u4e2a\u5c0f\u961f\u7684\u9650\u5236\u4e5f\u6709\u70b9\u86cb\u75bc\uff0c\u60f3\u4e00\u6b21\u5e03\u5175\u653b\u57ce\u592a\u96be\uff0c\u4eba\u6570\u591a\u7684\u5fc5\u987b\u53cd\u590d\u6307\u6325\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u70b9\u723d\u5feb\u611f\u3002\n\u53e6\u5916\u6bcf\u6b21\u8bfb\u6863\u58eb\u6c14\u90fd\u4f1a\u6389\u5230\u4e03\u516b\u5341\n\n\u8fd8\u662f\u7b49\u4ee5\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u786e\u53ea\u6709\u7a81\u7a81\u7a81\u3002\n[spoiler] END\u952e\u5f00\u542f\u4f5c\u5f0a[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1519810369, "timestamp_updated": 1519810369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40457116": {"recommendationid": "40457116", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994407059", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1520712650}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is cracc", "timestamp_created": 1519808881, "timestamp_updated": 1519808881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491159", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40456575": {"recommendationid": "40456575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198818318763", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519828011}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u654c\u6211\u5b9e\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u592a\u5927\u4e86 \u540c\u5175\u79cd\u6211\u7684\u72d9\u51fb\u624b5\u67aa\u6253\u4e0d\u6b7b\u4e00\u4e2a\u654c\u4eba\u654c\u4eba\u72d9\u51fb\u624b\u4e00\u58f0\u67aa\u54cd\u6211\u8fd9\u8fb9\u6700\u5c11\u6b7b\u4e09\u4e2a", "timestamp_created": 1519806916, "timestamp_updated": 1519806916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40455455": {"recommendationid": "40455455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970432989", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 533, "last_played": 1521472362}, "language": "english", "review": "Freeman: Geurrilla Warfare is a Mount and Blade inspired FPS/Strategy/Management game set in modern times, where rebel factions of a collapsing nation (resembling Russia) duke it out for control. \n\nEquipped with the same rough-around-the-edges charm of Mount and Blade, but backed up by a team of impassioned and competent developers, Freeman is a sure fire purchase for anyone who enjoyed Mount and Blade. \n\nThough still early in development, the game already consists of a fully functional world map, fully functional battle encounters, a whole roster of troops to recruit/upgrade, and a boat load of weapons/armour to purchase. In short, the game is more than playable in its current state. I've already put 20 hours into it, and I think that'll double in the coming days. \n\nGameplay-wise, if you're familiar with Mount and Blade, then this is more of the same (in almost every detail). However what I appreciate most with this game, is that the gunplay and FPS elements match the quality of Mount and Blade's combat system punch by punch, leaving you with the impression that effort and time were put into it to get things feeling right.\n\nIn short, you cannot go wrong with purchasing this.

It is not like other first person shooters, it is quite reasonable with you get shot 2-4 times and your dead. And the bots also dont seem to be as dumb as they are in M&B, the will often try to flank you - although their performance on the world map may need touches obv. Overall - Great game and I would recomend it to anyone that liked M&B or similar games.

Die K\u00e4mpfe machen Spa\u00df und man freut sich, wenn der eigene Squad den Gegner dezimiert. Die Men\u00fcs sind noch etwas spartanisch, aber alles da was man braucht. Zum Gl\u00fcck gibt es regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Updates.\nBisher sind mir aber auch einige Fehler aufgefallen:\n- Beim Spielstand laden befindet sich mein Trupp irgendwo, aber nicht auf der letzten gespeicherten Position und die Motivationspunkte sind auch niedriger als beim Speichern\n- im Verteidigungsfall der eigenen Stadt sind meine Truppen nicht zum Bewegen zu motivieren, bleiben einfach stehen oder h\u00e4ngen in der Luft.

amazing!\nI love the way they mixed a strategy game and an FPS!\nYou can either take the role of a strategist/tactitian or just a field commander,you can order your troops around idividually\nor rush in as a group,i love the freedom of choice...\n-2:For a brand new early access game it's suprisingly \"realistic\"\nWell it's not as hard as arma but not as easy as call of duty i think it has a good balance of both\nYou gotta keep the moral of your troops high or they will just leave you mid battle #NotCoolMan\nWell morale is easy to get...just pay them...Apparantly..money buys happiness! So yeah..to keep a high morale just make it rain...\nNow for the FPS part...There is bullet drop and bullet travel time...i love it!\n-3:There is some kind of diplomatic relationship thing going on, it's very basic but it has a lot of potential!\n-4:Trading is awesome! If you know the location and demands of the merchants you can make some dank profits!\nFor example i can buy jewlery from one merchant for idk....1000 and go to the other merchant that want's to buy jewlery and sell it for 1410, love it....\nNow....THE CONS!\n-1: A lot of bugs! i found one that lets you aim and shoot through a tree..\nSometimes when you press escape in the combat map you glitch and get stuck in the main menu.....and some others....\n-2: No autosave feature...Yes....Yo uhave to save manually...you get used to it after a while but....in the beginning...\nI lost my progress twice already... now i save every time i finish trading....\n-3:The graphics are bad, well they aren't GREAT , but it's not really a big issue...(although..the weapon designs/models are FREAKING AMAZING!)\nSuggestion to the devs:okay so in this game i think that COOP would be really interesting & fun! Online would be too much and would maybe not fit the game...idk really...but i know that COOP would be amazing!\n\n7/10...\nIts only 15 euros....a game like that (in its finished state) could sell for 60 euros...it's worth it! it's Fun!", "timestamp_created": 1519470911, "timestamp_updated": 1519470911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

I like the concept of this game, or rather I love it. I know its very early access, but this game has made me rage and thats something Mount & Blade hasn't done for me. I enjoy the tactical fights, but the bugs at the moment make me upset to play it.\n\nWhen I've spent the better part of a day leveling, upgrading, and outfitting myself. I take up a tactical position to support my troops, move my high armor people to overwatch and suppress in trees. Snipers take up on another copse of trees, then I start popping heads and moving for an advantage and I turn around to see that a common looter just killed three of my rangers? My MG team is 2 units down? Cover? Tactics? Nothing matters when 40 looters litterally spawn on top of my flanking position with me and my snipers and we all get mowed down instantly. Welp...I guess I should have predicted that? lol\n\nYes, the game is good, the concept is good, but the spawning needs to be fixed. Yes, Mount and Blade had weird spawns in battle, but you generally knew where they were after 1 large fight. This has happened a dozen times to me in various ranges and spots. I am just...I can't right now. This game is wonderful, it really is, buts its too early to enjoy. Thanks for the hard work. I impulse bought the game and put too many hours in to refund, so I guess I'll wait till its better balanced and I don't see effort I've put in learning and tactically positioning just to have my entire 60+ men of upgraded squads litterally die to a bunch of looters with SMGs and T-shirts.\n\nUPDATE 2/26/2018 12 PM (Storytime)\nSo I just experienced what I could only describe as a hour long bug. It is day 4 in my campaign, I have liberated one town. I have 50 units of Tier 1-3 quality (Snipers, MG, FCA rangers). The town gets attacked by 95 men, 3 star, of looters/marauders. (Mind you, 3 starring my own units isnt implemented yet!) I defend my town with the garrison 63+50 garrison. I deploy my men strategically (Or try to) Snipers on far side overwatch, armored marauders in the trees/behind buildings, Rangers/Grenadiers on the sides. (Can only Deploy seven squads). Raiders go in....first six casualties in killfeed are my rangers/Grenadiers. Im supporting them with rocket/AR41. 2/5 rangers left, retreat, replace, reposition. Finally down to 10 units, conscripts, to the enemy's 23. So? Run them out of my town, run out as well, decide to pick off slowly with my remaining conscripts. Red High light area where enemy is. Slowly move in. Now its my remaining 8 VS 4 looters. \"This will be worth it..\" I move in, crouching, crawling....Conscript team watching me from the hill about 20m back..... The remaining four looters teleport next to me from the red area, of which I am in the blue area (My spawn area) and without allowing me any chance at cover. Unload into my face and im dead. I am then givin the option to send my units in to \"clean up\" where I get a screen of the enemy forces somehow regaining 23 Units, wiping out my group of 113 to 70+ losses, and 85% of my army has left me. If I go back in to fight, I will receive around 2000 dollars as opposed to potentially 20000+Guns/loot all because the game decided I was too far from the enemies and so that I must want them to be closer to me...So teleport them onto me? It made me laugh and rage and also made my friends laugh who are watching me stream this to them.\n\nFinal Thoughts?\n\nIn the end, after spending nearly 30 hours with the game...Ive decided to change my mind. This is early access, and I feel the game is 60% or a solid 6/10 already, bugs included. So I figure when its fully done, hell, two or three more updates. This game will be nearing a 10/10 on any scale. This may sound negative, but for people in the M&B community, there is some good jank here. I love the animations of death, I love that my squad will scream for help because one guy with an SMG came out of the bushes and they shot him so many times that his body was a bloodmist before he hit the floor. Its...just great. For hardcore fans of this type of game? Buy now, support the devs, and save a little cash. For casual people? Give it some more time to cook.", "timestamp_created": 1519449315, "timestamp_updated": 1519675450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514476", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40344926": {"recommendationid": "40344926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279543295", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "last_played": 1521544540}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u6cd5\u81ea\u5df1\u9009\u62e9\u5b58\u6863\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u73a9\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b58\u6863", "timestamp_created": 1519443717, "timestamp_updated": 1519443717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40344872": {"recommendationid": "40344872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388543244", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519406205}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u76ee\u524d\u5c31\u662f\u4e2a\u534a\u6210\u54c1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5f88\u5dee\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\u914d\u7f6e\u8981\u6c42", "timestamp_created": 1519443520, "timestamp_updated": 1519443520, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40344584": {"recommendationid": "40344584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398418795", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519715931}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0a\u5e1d\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u6211\uff01\uff01\uff01 \u5f53\u6211\u5173\u95ed\u6218\u6597\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u523b\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u6211\u9519\u4e86....", "timestamp_created": 1519442304, "timestamp_updated": 1519442304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40344475": {"recommendationid": "40344475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204963639", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1521034307}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u4e2a\u4eba\u63a8\u8350\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1519441939, "timestamp_updated": 1519441939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40343868": {"recommendationid": "40343868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119476759", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520195607}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun.

SplatterCatGaming and found their letsplays thinking wow what an interesting game hope they continue their letsplays as it makes for great entertainment seeing how people play differently\n\niv played for 2 hours so far and the only reason iv not played it longer is its bed time \n\nim sure going to be playing this game more once im back home tomoz night \n\nwhat this game offers \n\nTactical map squad control along with first person gun fighting play how you want .. lone sniper or squad hide somewhere and tell them where to go .. they often find cover lie down etc which is rather neat .. but if they are told to stand somewhere silly like in a gorge hiding is often off the table and unless you tell them to retreat they will just stand their ground and die .. meaning you really need to think about how your troops get to a location with waypoints and that the location is a great location eg top of a hill over looking a large open area with tree cover etc makes a large difference \n\n\ntho the menu and interface takes a little bit of understanding eg paying your men etc i was able to pick it up really quickly and i am registered blind their are a few areas where text overlaps etc but this is EAG it will be fixed and it is hit and miss perhaps my windows DPi is high or something who knows HAHA...\n\n\ni do find myself just walking on the world map to pass time until day as i cant see very well in night time this is just me tho steejo for eg manages just fine XD .. if i get cought i spend the night battle telling my men to climb on a hill and the others to move around the enemy and attack sideways etc  .. perhaps difficulty settings could have say a day only game and for harder modes perhaps night only ...they do have night vision goggles but they cost alot so its more of a early-mid game buy if u need currently im not at the point of affording night vision....\n\nhaving the day only option (PLZ devs add maybe hugs) is so i enjoy more of the game than just walking around the world map passing the time till day XD dont get me wrong the day and night cycle is great how its implimented just wish i could have an easier time mode hehe .. \n\nbut so far i have myself a 3 squad setup who are higher level than me because erm they can see better XD  does help when shooting people to have good eyesight.. tho in RL im great with a bow XD\n\n\n\nso if you like gunfighting FPS and or tactical squad control this is certainly a game i would point you too and im sure the devs are going to make this into a very interesting game reminds me of ghost recon if they made it into a world map mercenary conquest \n\nplayable... yes 100% playable it is a game .. it is not a tech demo but an actual game you can play and enjoy with goals etc\n\ngraphics...4/10 they are ok they are not AAA but its an EAG so im sure in time they will polish it out eventually the graphics atm are certainly playable personally i like pretty but i play a game for the game not the graphics \n\nAudio... 6/10 i would say its ok but it really needs more options as the birds are loud etc .. needs more atmosphere sounds wind(howling) debris settle(leave rattle) weather.. seems abit oddball be nice for more control but im sure that will come in time\n\ngameplay 7/10 .. played 2 hours writing this not a single bug or crash game worked exactly as intended and the game plays really well tho my PC isnt exactly a potato so its not exactly useful in spec limiting Threadripper x1950 kind of not potato\n\nreplayability 10/10 ... well im sure when i max out and conquest the whole map like in a long time because im poo at games i will certainly try and do it better again and by then im sure the devs will have added more game modes they have added a drop down box so that is certainly expected.. perhaps in time they add a day count how many ingame days did it take to complete a playthrough and unite the nation? i know they have a killcounter etc \n\ninterface 6/10 ... it works but things like clicking into a town the option right under the curser is attack eek .. there is a few graphical glitchs on the menu but nothing that causes issues in gameplay just names splashing over buttons eg the top of the squad menu other than that its functional and im sure the devs will add and make adjustments as development continues \n\ndevelopers 10/10 ... they are always patching and updating the game is alive and kicking to be played from what i have seen from the patch notes the devs are hot on fixing bugs everyone reports etc .. it makes me confident the game is worth investment hugs to the devs and thanks for making this game :)\n\npersonally i bought the game not knowing if i could play it and if not well im supporting a game i enjoy watching others play so why not .. as it turns out the game is certainly playable for me and i cant wait to see what the devs make of it \n\nthe game page is awash with hints of a large update in the works cant wait to see what they add .. so expect my review to change as the game does \n\nand yeah im terrible at english xx", "timestamp_created": 1519432499, "timestamp_updated": 1519433785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

I have to say at first I was extremely disappointed due to the amount of glitches with movement and other things but the devs are really active and patched them within a day or two from when I got it.

It is a very unique and interesting take on the RTS genre and kind of accomplishes that dream of being able to be on ground level amid the action and actually take part with your soldiers. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes strategy or even casual games as it isn't too difficult or complex. For those of you who are more interested in the FPS side of it, I can say the graphics are decent. Obviously from the screenshots you shouldn't expect the best but the textures for guns and characters (units and player) are average for games without millions of dollars smacked into them. The ground and tree textures on the other hand are decent at best but it shouldn't really bother anyone who isn't a snob. One last thing to mention is since this game is brand new, there are going to be bugs, like the ones I have encountered along with game crashes. This has happened every now and then to me and I try to save before/after every battle and significant part of the game to avoid losing half my progress through a campaign.

It's Early Access and it shows, but the support from the developers seems really strong and the concept has so much potential. \n\nHere's what I'd like to see in the future from it though: \n-Vehicles: if possible, I'm not sure if this is a realistic demand for the dev team, but it would be very fitting, you could slowly buy much more powerful vehicles as well, from quad bikes, to an old truck with a mounted MG, to  heavy tanks, and I don't think this is possible, but if we could get helicopters that would be cool too.\n\n-Alliances: If you could choose ideologies and have the AI factions react to you in certain ways because of your choice that would be totally awesome. I'd love to see the ablity to influence other factions also. \n\n-Better feel: It's Early Access, so of course it's going to be clunky, but a lot of Unity Engine EA games never escape the broken feeling they started off with, so I hope these devs can prove me wrong. My main problems with the clunkyness is from movement, animations, and overall slow responses, it would be lovely to see them make the game feel more snappier in some aspects, it doesn't have to be an arcade game like COD, but you can still have a satisfying movement system that is realistic.\n\n-Defences: I'd org@sm if they added some structures you could place down, like barbedwire, sniper towers, fences, bunkers, and the ability to dug up some trenches.\n\nG a m e G o o d", "timestamp_created": 1519340161, "timestamp_updated": 1519340882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny":

"playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1521084389}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] TL;DR [/h1]\n\nMount & Blade with AKs. Nice concept, a lot of fun in its current stage already, but it's very early in development, so expect bugs, glitches, performance problems, AI blackouts etc. Also a little repetitive, but I expect more features to come over time. Would still recommend it for its full price.\n\n[h1] The Long Version [/h1]\n\nThis one's an unexpected gem. As many stated before me, it's basically Mount & Blade in a contemporary setting. I always liked the concept of M&B, but I am not really a medieval fan, so I never really got into it that much.\n\nWhile it is EA and there are a hell lot of bugs, technical problems and what not, the general gameplay is already there. I like the gunplay a lot as it requires some skill and training, but it's not overly complicated. The strategy part is also a lot of fun, but the AI and the controls don't work as expected at times.\n\nApart from the polish, performance, UI tweaks and everything that is probably going to be improved in future updates anyway, I have a few suggestions:\n\n- background info: I know this is never going to be a story driven game with a fully fleshed out backstory, I'd still like to see some basic info added about...well, pretty much everything. Where are we fighting, why did this conflict break out, who are the other factions, what are their motives? Just a few bits of background, for the immersion.\n\n- more variety and options: all you do for now is engaging enemies, taking their loot, selling it in cities, buying new troops and equipment for the money, rinse and repeat. I'd like to see random encounters with all kinds of factions and places. M&B e.g. had random cow herds running across the map which you could chase for food. This exact mechanic wouldn't fit this game's setting of course, but that's just an example. Why not trading caravans? You can buy and sell your stuff there on the go or...well, rob them. Why not civilian groups who you could help...or rob. Why not stumbling across an abandoned mine where you randomly find some gold ore? You know, just stuff like that gives you more to see and do.\n\n- quests: to prevent repetitiveness, there should be a variety of quests in towns and by random encounters that differ a little from current combat focused gameplay. For example, I imagine an escort mission where you have to bring a certain person or object to another town without it getting stolen/kidnapped/killed. That way you could also go for more roleplaying as a peaceful merchant or whatever.\n\n- moral: the game already has a karma system, I haven't figured out if it has any impact yet, but as this games takes on a modern day civil war scenario, you could use this opportunity to put the player into the difficult situation of making difficult choices in wartimes. It would also harmonize perfectly with what I've mentioned above. Help civilians or use them to your own advantage? Based on your decisions, the karma you have (or don't have...) should have some impact on gameplay, how people react to you e.g.\n\nThat's my \"short\" list of suggestions for this game. It will probably take some time as priorities are set elsewhere for now and there's a lot of work to do in general, but from what I've seen and heard so far the devs are very active, so even though EA can be a risky deal sometimes, I'd still recommend this game at its full price. I have a feeling that it is going in a very right direction and we can expect a lot if we are patient enough, and even though this is a very rough gem for now, it is already a lot of fun and feels very satisfying.

Right now there aren't any side quests or anything like that, so the only objective is to grow your army and fight skirmishes with the different factions. However, the gun and shooting mechanics are excellent, with most of the mechanics for it already put in place. This game is semi-realistic, so the guns aren't hitscan but rather have bullet drop. Since most of the fighting you do is fairly long distance, this means you have to rethink your aiming somewhat.\n\nI'm looking forward to when they introduce the quest system, as well as more weapons and map variety to come. They already introduced a patch that adds buildings and roads to the skirmish maps, when before it was just forests and plains. The dev team seems to be active in the forums and they are pushing out updates quickly.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how the game develops over time.

Commander, it\u2019s time to make your mark in this world! Mobilize an army, from conscripts to mercenaries, and capture cities from your enemies and bandits. This is not going to be easy and you\u2019ll need the best leader to command his men in this guerrilla warfare. \n\nFreeman: Guerrilla Warfare is a FPS / strategy and management game where you lead your own faction with the primarily goal of capturing and managing more towns than your opponents to win the game.\n\nAfter launching a new campaign, you\u2019ll arrive in the world map. Your army will be represented with a soldier and the flags you have chosen when you created your faction. Underneath your animated figurine a number will be displayed which represents the number of men you\u2019ll have under your command. The map world is a nice 3D map where you\u2019ll be able to see towns and other armies moving around. You\u2019ll also have the ability to check out your party at any given time, as well as your inventory, the number of prisoners you have, and information on the different factions, by clicking the tabs at the bottom of your screen. You can move all around the world very easily and at the start of the game you\u2019ll not be at war with any factions, but beware of the bandits. Actually, it\u2019s best to attack them first by clicking on their respective figurines. Try to attack the smaller group first.  When your figurine reaches its target, the battle phase will take place. First, you\u2019ll have to place your squads (five men per squad) in the spawning green circle. Somewhere within the battle map a red circle will also be displayed and that is where your enemies will most likely be spawning. Make your way to that circle with your squads and engage with the enemy. You have the ability to swap from the FPS to the battle map and vice versa as you wish.  You can also select waypoints for your squads to follow and select whether you want them to move cautiously or as fast as they can to reach a certain position. If they need to, you can choose to have them fire at will or follow a choice of other commands. Bear in mind, you can\u2019t jump into one of your squads and take control of one of its members. They\u2019ll engage the enemy as soon as they see them and they\u2019ll be marked with a small red circle on the battle map. On your first battle, you\u2019ll only have a revolver at your disposal, and you won\u2019t have any armour. Eliminate all enemies and collect your loot, which will always include money, weapons and other items which you can trade each time you visit a town. If this is the other way around, the likelihood of losing your squad is pretty high and you\u2019ll probably need to get to hospital (in towns) to regenerate your health. I must mention that each time you personally eliminate an enemy (not your squad), you\u2019ll earn experience points and each time you reach a new level, skills points will be allocated to you, which you can then distribute into a large number of skills on the skill tree. \n\nA few options are also available in the towns; selling or buying weapons, armour and/or food, and hiring mercenaries, too. If it\u2019s your town, you can construct buildings such as factories and markets, as well as farms to generate income; also houses, police stations and a few others. Make sure you always have money and food in your inventory so you can pay your men and keep their morale running high. \n\nI really like what I am seeing here and the developers are updating the game frequently. The FPS phase is pretty fluid but needs some polishing. The strategy and management aspect is really easy to use and you get all of that for only $14.99 USD. Excellent value, I must say!\n\nGraphically it\u2019s good, but as I mentioned above, needs a bit of polishing in the FPS phase. Plenty of weapons, amour and items to loot, buy or sell. This is a superb game and it\u2019s only on early access!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n+\tGood graphics\n+\tFPS, strategy and management phases\n+\tLarge number of weapons, armour and items to loot, buy or trade\n+\tEasy to learn and play; challenging and addictive\n+\tGood value for money\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tNeeds to be polished a bit\n-\tNo achievements or trading cards as yet \n\nIf you like strategy, FPS and management games, you\u2019ll get all in one in Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare. Superb value!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Not quite yet. This game is literally Mount and Blade meets guns. It follows the same platoon based party system, leveling, inventory, recruiting, and everything else.

That is not a bad thing. Yes, it has some bugs (I'm looking at YOU, floating immobile troops on town defense mission!). This is early access.  I hope to see this game continue to be developed and polished, because it is a solid concept.\n\nSome unexpected pluses... the weapons are not hitscan but actually model a reasonably in-depth ballistics system- I was surprised to discover this as I noticed my tracers and dust plumes from shot impacts hitting low of my aim point and was satisfyingly rewarded with hits/kills once I adjusted my aim to more carefully account for both elevation and recoil. 9mm carbines/pistols will not shoot as flat as 5.56mm rifles, just as should be the case.\n\nAnother pleasant surprise is the troop AI. Your troops will follow your orders (providing their morale isn't too low) and the orders both make sense and are followed sensibly. In other words, if you order a unit to move to a point on the map and \"proceed with caution\", you can tag along and see that they will, indeed, move along in a cautious, alert fashion, keeping low, scanning for enemies, etc. If they spot enemies, they react accordingly. They don't just blunder along oblivious to incoming enemy fire. Order them to \"charge\" and they move with more urgency, but again, they act like they have brains.\n\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing the progress this game makes.", "timestamp_created": 1519095243, "timestamp_updated": 1519095458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40241017": {"recommendationid": "40241017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071841422", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520308197}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, got hooked in half an hour, my one reccomendation would be to watch a walkthrough, not all the way but just so you know how to do everything.

Here's why. [/h1]\n\nI've had a blast with Freeman with my time with it over the weekend.  It describes itself as a sort of Mount and Blade + Arma cross, and MaB and Arma are two of my favorite games of all time.  And in large part, it holds well to said description.  The game is almost better labeled as some sort of MaB conversion mod with its very clear and obvious parallels.  You have the same Overworld view with little dudes with flags sticking out of them representing armies, you have very similar leveling/skills systems, you have very similar economic systems, and the same goal of achieving regional/continental/global/whateveritis domination.  You have warring factions such as the ARF, FCA, Unman Brotherhood, etc.  If you've played MaB, these similarities are blaring, for better or worse.  \n\nAs for being like Arma though.. that I'd say is more or less debatable.  The combat is often very long range as it often is in Arma, but Freeman has a faster pace to it.  The combat revolves around commanding squads of 3-5 men each.  The trick is outmaneuvering your enemy utilizing the terrain to your advantage, whether it be for cover, concealment or higher ground.  While Arma's isn't necessarily absent from those aspects, Arma's combat features far more depth that provides a totally different feel of the play.  I'm not necessarily suggesting that Freeman's combat is worse than Arma's, but rather that it may be subject to some debate.  I will say what Freeman specifically does NOT do as well as Arma, and that is immersion.  Freeman's sound systems seemed at times glitched and ultimately pale in comparison to Arma's especially when you factor mods such as Dynasound and Enhanced Soundscape.  Though, really, this review shouldn't revolve around comparisons to other games.  Let's look at the state of this game and where it may be going.  \n\nLet's set one obvious and very important factor in place: [b]Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare is still currently in a very immature state of early access.[/b]  The game has only been out for a few weeks though the developers seem to be keeping on top of updates and content.  There isn't a ton of content as it stands, but I'm sure that that will change with time.  There are a number of weapons, equipment, and economic goods that can give you some options, though it's obvious that some articles of gear are meant to be more powerful than others.  Currently, there isn't much to do other than to just fight, though there is plenty of indication that there will be some kind of questing system at some point.  The economic system seems pretty straightforward for now, and while that may be okey for early access, the economy is very exploitable.  It involves little to no guesswork and allows you to turn small amounts of $2000ish into FAR larger sums such as $80-100k in only a couple hours of trading (and even then I'm sure that I could've done it more efficiently than I did.)  The economy as it stands is one thing I think the devs should rework a bit to make it a bit tougher.  For instance, changing the cities' Demands ingame every week or so rather than just at startup of the game, or maybe you have to have some points in the Trade skill to get more benefit from Demands or something.  I'm sure there are better ways of doing it, but right now it simply feels cheaty.\n\nThere are MANY other issues in the game, but almost entirely they all fall under the bug category.  As this game is in early access, [b]it is 110% plagued with bugs, some minor, others game-breaking. [/b]  Here are some of the more major issues I encountered while playing:\n\n[list]\n    [*]One of the guns (I forget which, it was a 5.56 weapon) seemed to shoot very high when equipped with the ACOG scope.  I had to aim low against my target instead of high like others (to compensate for bullet drop)\n    [*]The map of the city that you start the campaign with (Gornisk or something like that) seems to be bugged to hecc and back.  AI on both sides float in the sky, sink into the ground, totally ignore my orders and seem to be totally invisible.  That map is unplayable.\n    [*]My cities seem to get besieged by the Unmen way too often.  I've had to fend them of the aforementioned Gopnik or whatever its called map several times in a short period against my will.  It was incredibly annoying.\n    [*]Leaving the game map to leave the battle (also on this same cursed map) brings me to a dialog that displays the enemy's ever so thoughtful comment of \"My men will have no mercy!\" with no way to close it, leaving me to have to restart the game (often without having saved for a long time which I guess is my fault.)\n    [*]The prisoner's screen bugged on me a few times, sometimes not letting me do anything to my prisoners other than try to convince them to join which doesn't work often because I didn't get to do anything else to them.\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure this wasn't all the issues I encountered and I'm sure that others have found many more.  But these and other issues is why I suggested at the top of this review that the game may very well fail without attention directed at this sort of thing.  I think the devs said somewhere that a bug fixing patch was coming up which I hope pans out well.  My suggestion to the devs is to hold off on content and focus a while on retracing their steps and fixing as many of the left behind messes as possible.  Though, I'm not a game developer.  I don't know how or when they intend to go about fixing the issues, and frankly may well just be an impatient consumer waiting for them to rush to me an experience I'd enjoy.  I suppose the key for we consumers is to simply [b]wait and see if the bugs turnaround.[/b]  If the devs pay adequate attention to this issue, then [b]Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare may become one of my favorite games.[/b]  Otherwise, well... it may just kinda drift into the cheap-clone oblivion.\n\nEDIT: A dev has said after posting this review that they've fixed the more aggregious issues I previously mentioned in this upcoming patch.\n\nEDIT: Composition and formatting mistakes.", "timestamp_created": 1519088051, "timestamp_updated": 1519096995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515315", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40237761": {"recommendationid": "40237761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059779351", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519103381}, "language": "english", "review": "Prepare to invest hours of time just to lose your army and restart, refunded", "timestamp_created": 1519081269, "timestamp_updated": 1519081269, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421477", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40234250": {"recommendationid": "40234250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079304791", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 70, "last_played": 1521227039}, "language": "german", "review": "Echt geiles Spiel.

If this sounds like the sort of game that you're looking for, it probably is. The gameplay loop is very addicting, even if there is very little polish atm.\n\nA few gripes:\n\n- No auto save. I've lost two campaigns now, one because I didn't manually save (my fault) and one because I accidentally hit 'quit game' in the menu, which booted me to desktop without a confirmation. UI is still really, really rough.\n\n- Sound is... weird. There seems to be no direction to the sound. Sounds are oddly tinny, especially at a distance. \n\n- Gunplay needs work.\n\n- General jankiness, but you have to expect that lol\n\nOverall, this game is really promising. I'm already haing a lot of fun with it. The shooting already feels good, even if gunplay needs a lot of work overall.

Shooting  feels tight, but the bullets travel too slow imo. RTS elements show potential but a formation setting would be nice so you could move everyone as a group. City defense feels weird, it seems like your garrisoned troops should already be tactically placed before the wave arives but instead you have to spwan them in a small starting area which most of the time leaves them very vulnerable. Also if i have an army at my town why do i have to walk my character all the way to the town to defend? I think this game would benefit from the ability to move multiple armys around. That way you could maybe one army around defending your towns while move off with another for conquest.

Devs have made a great start on this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Great skirmishes which feel way more authentic than popular shooters\n- Awesome sound effects\n- Really fun progression (what there is so far)\n- The weapons are great overall (see performance comment below)\n- Enjoying the Eastern European flavour of the voices and style a lot\n\nImproves:\n\n- Get a military advisor, especially when characterising and naming equipment\n- Get an English native speaker to check everything\n- Check the maths on the bullet drop - I wouldn't expect to have to aim 8 feet high over 200m with 7.62mm rifle.\n- More equipment: a range finder would be particularly useful to make up for the lack of visual acuity in the game vs real life when judging distances\n- Bigger deployment areas would help when placing troops: Would also be great to have set formations rather than micro-manage, as well as troops who know to speed up when they are lagging behind the others. Another refinement would be for soldiers to prefer side-by-side positions when firing, rather than shooting past each other which is really dangerous and looks a bit silly\n\nFurther ideas for the devs:\n- Eliminate radar images of enemy - not realistic, it's cheating. Substitute with sound or visual signatures that are temporary. The red indicators could maybe become available later with ground-sensing radar purchase? This could need a squad to operate.\n- Eliminate the time limit with showing enemy's location: Substitute enemy that are more aggressive who come forward\n- Teach the AI flanking manoeuvres\n- IR lasers at night for aiming weapons\n- Artillery would be a great addition, start with a mortar team\n- This game is screaming for tactical UAV to help sense the enemy! This should also be operated by a squad. It could also be cool to have a Cessna fly overhead and provide verbal indications over the radio (NOT map indications - it's too easy!)\n\nOverall really impressed with this game, definitely got my $15 worth of fun!", "timestamp_created": 1518995084, "timestamp_updated": 1518995501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40207276": {"recommendationid": "40207276", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987942391", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519095134}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1518993627, "timestamp_updated": 1518993627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40205615": {"recommendationid": "40205615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113963577", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1521754117}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0647\u0630\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u062a\u062f\u0645\u062c \u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0647\u064a: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062a\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0648\u062a\u0631.\n\u0648\u0645\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0635\u0646\u0639 \u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0645\u062a\u0639\u0647 \n\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0639 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0644\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0629 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0643\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0646\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0632 .\n\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u0637\u0648\u0631\u064a \u0648\u064a\u062f\u0639\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0623\u0648\u0644. \n\n\u0644\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0645..", "timestamp_created": 1518989067, "timestamp_updated": 1518989067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555307", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40203626": {"recommendationid": "40203626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398099492", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519569120}, "language": "english", "review": "===[ \u2764 Audience: ]===\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2610 Pro players\n\n===[ \u263c Graphics: ]===\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n===[ $ Price/quality: ]===\n\u2611 Full price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\u2610 Free\n\n===[ \u2623 Requirments: ]===\n\u2610 90' PC\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2611 Medium\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n===[ \u263c Difficulty: ]===\n\u2610 You just need 2 arms\n\u2610 Ez\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Hard (first few hours)\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ \u06de Game time/length ]===\n\u2610 Really short ( 0 -

However, the only way to get a town is by removing the opposing faction by force.\n- Trading is pretty much the same, however, the best place to sell commodities doesn't change, yet.\n- Recruiting newbs in towns or hire trained merchenaries in each town is about the same. Every faction has it's own strengths and weaknesses on their troops.\n- They seemed to have added the infrastructure for NPCs to give you tasks, however, they don't yet.\n- Gear can be looted or bought.\n- Overmap movement, hunting bandits or npcs of opposing factions.\n- Battles are similar, you start in one spot on the map, and have time to set up your troops before engaging.\n\nOf course M&B is older and much more polished. Not to mention the mod support which makes the game better overall.\n\nThe things that Freeman: Guerilla Warfare bring to the table.\n\n- Modern warfare and FPS.\n- The way you can command your troops is more effective over what of M&B has, with an overlay map display. To which you can go back to at any point during the engagements to command.\n\nI may have missed mentioning some things, however as it is, this game shows promise.

My friend recommended me this game, saying that it is like Mount and Blade mixed with ArmA, and ofc that did catch my intrigue.\n\nI will say this, although this game is in early access and still very early in its development, the potensial and fun is definitely here. Currently I have about 8 hours in this game and I can already make out that this game, with proper support and continues updates from the devs, will surely become something big. Even though it is rather niche of a game, I do believe that there is a market here, for specific people like myself.\n\nI will say this, stable game all around, no crashes so far, performance is rather good, albeit in some instances it will drop somewhat, from 60 - 50. Usually this is because of the map and when there is a lot of combat going on.\n\nThere are ofc room for imporvements, one of these would to make the open world combat more interesting, for instance instead of always getting a random forest map, why not have like a road and some buildings a long it to fight in, or maybe a tiny village etc. It would also be great to see the houses in the Town battles be enterable, currently I have not found a building that I can get into.\n\nAll in all this game so far, I super fun, it's just the right mix of ArmA and with some Modern Millitary Shooter mechanics, not to realistic, and not to arcade.", "timestamp_created": 1518976519, "timestamp_updated": 1518976519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40197961": {"recommendationid": "40197961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023710274", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 267, "last_played": 1521572523}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game with alot of potential.

method of movement is great for setting a patrol or advance path. I wanted to flank a group of people and was able to queue and then fine tine waypoints for my flanking group.\n\nAs everyone says, yeah, it's Mount and Blade: Warband with guns, but it's that in a not-Ukraine/Donbass setting, which is very interesting. Games like Syrian Warfare and this game are taking a great look at modern low intensity conflicts with many actors, whether it be through a state lense or non-state lense.\n\nMy biggest problems so far is the AI. Not the enemy AI, who are light infantry gods, but your party's AI. You definitely need to position section level weapons like machine guns and RPGs a certain way. You can't do that sometimes because the AI just says fuck it and stands there pointing guns in random directions. Yeah, they do go to ground and move far less when in contact, but out of contact they can just stand there doing nothing or appear four metres in the sky for no reason. As this is EA, I'm guessing this will be ironed out.\n\nIt would be great if there was a campaign that had a bit of a story or NPC commanders offered tasks. That's probably coming, but right now, it's just a sandbox to walk around in. There's definitely nothing wrong with that, as it's a very fun sandbox.

If you've played M&B, the above decription should give you an accurate description. If you haven't, make sure you buy mount and blade too because it is also a great game.\n\nThe developers update frequently and it's pretty good for a game in beta. I love that the ballistics are fairly realistic and the AI is pretty good (though unforgiving)\n\nSo I'll focus on the things I want to see moving forward:\n1. I'd like the faction army spawning to be persistent and strategic, not random. I'm sure this is in the works but it does bother me a little for the game to be billed as part strategy when on the overall map there isn't really any more strategy to picking who to fight than picking which mobs to farm in an MMORPG. Ideally the NPC's would be on foraging missions or whatever tied to the faction's ability to spawn more dudes so that there is a strategic incentive to raid rather than just leveling your guys.\n2. More interesting and more varied terrain. don't get me wrong, I just did a couple of battles in poor weather and the effects, moving trees, etc really wowed me but I'd like to see more cliffs, ravines, urban environments. Picking terrain matters a little but not a lot right now.\n3. More variation in troops. The Uman terrorists are running around in red which is great because it makes them easy to shoot. I think if they were easier to spot/target by the AI but had stronger morale that would be sufficiently unique for them. \n4. kind of tying into the first item, a point to anything. Right now armies aren't really doing anything unless they're attacking one of your settlements. maybe have a villiage kind of thing where each settlement has outlying villages that must be protected to provide income or can be raided by an opportunistic army.

An endless sandbox with modern weapons.\n\nAre there any problems? Of course yes. This is an early access and if you support the devs, then they can easily solve those problems. There are some bugs. Sometimes the enemy just doesn't attack you and your guys may not move either. The only solution of this bug is your movement. You have to find out where the enemy is and go there. Anyway, not a big deal. Will be probably solved with the next update.\n\nAnd here are some suggestions for the devs:\n- We may be able to pick up the weapons of dead guys on the ground.\n- The bodies of dead ones are disappearing sometimes. Has to be solved.\n- We may be able to manage the weapons of our troops. I mean, their inventory.\n- More flags will be appreciated.\n- There is a little shaky thing when you use your scope.

You try to rush in you will die.\nIntersting leveling and upgrade system: The leveling system is very in depth and similar to that of Mount and Blade, as you do need to level up skills to command more troops and inprove your own character, however, you also need to level up skills to be able to bring more troops into a battle itself. the leveling system is nice, but some changes to it could make it better, for example expereince gained only appiles to the squad or person that killed the enemy, this means that some squads get levels very quickly while others are struggling to get experience, maybe if their was a way to train troops outside of battle it could make sure that all your troops stay at similar levels.\ndiffereing Factions with pros and cons to each: this helps it feel though you are in a different world, and gives reasons to troops from each faction in your army, as one faction might have good snipers, but little to no heavy or close combat troops.\n\nCons: Siege/ defence battles need more work: It seems in every siege or defence battle I constantly see mine or the enemy troops flying in the air or glicthed out beneth the map or even in trees, and this is in every battle which makes the battle unwinnable as the only way to win is kill all the enemy troops. Maybe adding a timer for the defenders to hold out and make the battles shorter and it would be better then just kill all enemies.\nRepetative gameplay: As of now this is every battle in the game Get attacked/attack enemies kill all of them to win this just gets boring after a while since is basically the same thing over and over. \nFrame Rate drops: While in battle my FPS usually stays at a reasonable level and I have no problems there, In the world map my FPS sometimes goes as low as 10 FPS and my laptop is pretty good. \nFinal thoughts:\nI would give this game a 4/5 and i know this came out very recently, but until the bugs are fixed I just cant give this game a higher rating, and is it worth the money I would say yes as the gameplay is great if repetative at times, the leveling system is very complex, and combat is intense but at the same time just think that this game is still in early acess and still has many bugs so think before you buy this game. However, if your a fan of games like Mount and Blade or Arma, I would without a doubt recomand you play this game, as it combines the best of both games into a thrilling experience.", "timestamp_created": 1518904489, "timestamp_updated": 1518904489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40171228": {"recommendationid": "40171228", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987459624", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518361784}, "language": "english", "review": "Make this into Combat Mission with the player as the platoon commander.\nThen Put in an operational layer so it becomes Graviteam tactics\nThen put in a strategic layer so it becomes heart of Iron 3 (which is way better than 4)\n\nThats what i want.\nFor now, ill settle for realstic morale.", "timestamp_created": 1518903718, "timestamp_updated": 1518903718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40169161": {"recommendationid": "40169161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198453018075", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518903666}, "language": "english", "review": "remember when far cry 3 came out and everyone said it was skyrim with guns. well guess what.

There is realism but it comes more from tactics and company composition, Superior Firepower is the name of the game and it's not acheived through sheer numbers though they do help.

The gunplay is nice and the animation and textures are good ,just a a little rough around the edges. It scrathed a werid little itch for a Yugoslavia c.1990s simulator. The potential for modding makes me giddy and I really hope KK Game Studios opens this game up to the steam workshop soon. As of its current state it seems a little bare-bones when it comes to content, The lack of quests and RP is a little sad, but im willing to bet its on the way. As of now though KK has created a wonderful foundation for themselves. So far there have been a few annoying bugs i've delt with, if you recruit a squad of bandits after you capture them, when you deploy them they wont follow orders even if your stats are high enough to control all the squads you have. On top of that when you attack a group of bandits with the same type of unit that you recruited, they wont spawn and you have to wait out the timer to reveal the enemy location on the map, only to find that your uncontrolable bandit squad is being registered as the only enemies. I made this mistake only twice and found I had to restart the game or retreat (that has some negative effects). I also noticed that when I was putting a bunch of new gear on, I put night vision goggles on last and they removed my armor value, slightly annoying to say the least. Other than that I have only had some basic bugs with hit boxes being weird and buttons being weird in menus. I went into detail about these issues not to scare you off but to make known of some issues I have seen. I've had a great time so far and am really pleased, and for the humble price of $15 I can easily overlook any little bugs I have encountered.

A few major updates with more content, bug fixes and general tidyness in menus will make this game simply awesome.

Dann gehts weiter auf die Taktikkarte. Dort steht man mit seiner Figur und kann sich frei per Mausklick bewegen. Ein Klick auf eine freundlich gesindte Ortschaft und unsere Figur Marschiert schon los. Angekommen werden uns verschiedene Interaktionsm\u00f6glichkeiten angeboten. So sachen wie Handel, Krankenhaus, Rekrutieren etc. Dort kann man jedenfalls im Kampf erworbene Gegenst\u00e4nde verkaufen und wiederum neue Gegenst\u00e4nde einkaufen, denn man startet zu Anfang nur mit einer simplen Handfeuerwaffe.\n\nSomit komme ich zum eigentlichen Gameplay:\nWir k\u00f6nnen diese St\u00e4dte nehmlich nicht nur in freundlicher Absicht ansteuern, sondern auch um diese zu erobern. Die K\u00e4mpfe sehen so aus, das man auf einem Kartenabschnit seine Truppen in Stellung bringt und an deren Seite als Kommandant der Schlacht in der Ego-Perspektive bewohnt. W\u00e4rent des Gefechts, kann man seine Truppen via Wegpunkte oder sonstigen Befehlen navigieren.\n\nDas Spiel ist noch recht jung, ich schreibe dennoch dieses Review, da ich hoffe weitere Leute daf\u00fcr zu begeistern!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1518788575, "timestamp_updated": 1518788575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40125924": {"recommendationid": "40125924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137354981", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1520953293}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u4e0a\u57fa\u672c\u7167\u6284\u4e86\u9a91\u780d\u7684\u6c99\u76d2\u4e16\u754c\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u540e\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u6709\uff09\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u50cf\u4e00\u4e2a\u519b\u9600\u90a3\u6837\u53bb\u5f81\u670d\u548c\u5360\u9886\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u672c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u5927\u6d3e\u522b\uff0c\u6682\u65f6\u8fd8\u4e0d\u80fd\u52a0\u5165\u6d3e\u7cfb\u3002\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u7c7b\u4f3cARMA3\u6b66\u88c5\u7a81\u88ad\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\uff08\u7b80\u5316\u7248\uff09\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u5165\u624b\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u5916\uff08FPS\u6e38\u620f\u4f60\u770b\u5b57\uff1f\uff09\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u7b97\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u6709\u5355\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u52a0\u5165\u73a9\u5bb6\u6218\u6597\u4f24\u4ea1\u592a\u9ad8\u8fd8\u4e0d\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u6218\u6597\u6218\u679c\u5927\uff08\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u83dc\uff1f\uff09\u62a2\u5148\u4f53\u9a8c\u7248\uff0c\u6f5c\u529b\u503c\u5f97\u671f\u5f85\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1518787407, "timestamp_updated": 1518787407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40125642": {"recommendationid": "40125642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060473416", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1520675429}, "language": "english", "review": "like m&b but with guns and stuff", "timestamp_created": 1518786644, "timestamp_updated": 1518786644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40125608": {"recommendationid": "40125608", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987840521", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 167, "last_played": 1521234662}, "language": "english", "review": "+ similar to M&B = lot of potential\n+ like a Gun specialized Mod; if you enjoyed Gun Mods like 1866 you will love this game\n+ Devs working on it\n\n- at this time, there is not a lot of content (you will be bored after some hours, there is not much to do)\n- price with 15 \u20ac is way to much for actual content\n\nFor all beginners: Invest in Troops first, then in a solid rifle (then scope!).

If you die, you somehow (bug should be fixed, but it's still there) don't get loot even if your troops win.\n\nWeapons: Most important factor in my opinion is muzzle velocity because the bullet drop is very strong, you will feel like in a tank simulator :)\nlater, if you have the choice, don't play with guns less than 2000m/s- you can take the vintorez like me, which has 2600, enough damage and 20 bullet mag. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1518786561, "timestamp_updated": 1518786561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40124288": {"recommendationid": "40124288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144872373", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519303692}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e0c\u671b\u52a0\u5165\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1518782808, "timestamp_updated": 1518782808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40123386": {"recommendationid": "40123386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105754249", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 151, "last_played": 1521384752}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u559c\u6b22\u73a9\u9a91\u780d\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\u63a8\u8350\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u76ee\u524d\u7248\u672cBUG\u592a\u591a\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u66f4\u65b0\n\n------------------------------------------2/20\u66f4\u65b0---------------------------------------------\n\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u5566\uff01\u6492\u82b1*\u2605,\u00b0*:.\u2606(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)/$:*.\u00b0\u2605* \u3002", "timestamp_created": 1518780007, "timestamp_updated": 1519131590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40122911": {"recommendationid": "40122911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126145172", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519175133}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u4eba\u5728\u54ea", "timestamp_created": 1518778348, "timestamp_updated": 1518778348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40121644": {"recommendationid": "40121644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129255985", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1521370081}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u9a91\u9a6c\u4e0e\u780d\u6740\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u65e9\u65e5\u52a0\u5165\u4e2d\u6587", "timestamp_created": 1518773987, "timestamp_updated": 1518773987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40121178": {"recommendationid": "40121178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035767369", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518773964}, "language": "english", "review": "Great sandbox and real addicting squad building game.

The combat is good, the guns handle well and the 'basic' elements to the troop strategy and movement are both nice! Hit boxes function as intended and the coriolis effect is a great touch that many shooters lack these days!! Can't wait to see what, even more, improvements they make to this game! \nWorth the money to spend just to support devs that actually deliver on something for once!\nI'm impressed and excited for the

I attacked but no enemy unit was there. Ran around and the \"Enemy\" was the bandits I had just captured in the last fight.

In addition, we hope that the game will add more special features, such as transport troops, trucks or armored vehicles. When facing the enemy, the fixed machine guns above the armored cars can be used as support weapons. Vehicles can also be appropriately accelerated for the team and reduce the speed penalty for carrying too much cargo.Accordingly, specific soldiers can carry antitank weapons. Besides, we hope that there are more kinds of terrain in the battle map, for example, there are highways on the main map. There are winding roads across the map on the battle map. The main map is the open plain, and there are few forests and mountains in the battle map. It is hoped that the players can set up their own weapons to recruit each member of the team through their own city building.

There are so many things that this game \ndoes well, but as with any game this early in development, it has its\nflaws. There are a certain amount of bugs, that just become a pain \nin the ass. The hitboxes on items, felt like they were cut out quickly \nso in many cases, when you are trying to get an angle, you'll end up\nshooting the rock, or building in front of you. This im sure will be fixed \nin time, but for now is just a minor convenience. As for the RTS portion of \nof the game. It feels unfinished, and is very unsatisfactory.\n\n\nFPS\nThe FPS portion of this game is what the devs seem to be focusing on.\nThey have done pretty well with the combat so far. The guns seem to be \nfairly well balanced, and trying to get better guns does something. \nCons: The only issues I have with combat, are the hitboxes of all\nthe scenery. The hitboxes seem to be much bigger than the actual object\nwhich make peeking corners very hard. The other issue is that, the AI,\nisnt very smart, making it very easy for you to kill them, without \nputting yourself at risk.\n\nRTS\nThe RTS of this game, is not all there to say the least. For long time\nlovers of RTS's this game, comes as a disapointment. There are only basic\ncontrols of squads, you are only able to tell them where to go, and even then\nthe shoddy AI, might not go there. The base is there to make the RTS good though.\nThe RTS isn't great, but it still might make it.\n\nWorld Map\nThe actualy campaign portion of the game, is a great concept. They dont have turns\nin this game, instead, while you are moving your army of mercenairies, time goes then,\nbut when you are stopped, time is paused. It's a concept i've never seen in an RTS, and works\nquite well. When enough time has passed, you have to pay your armys salary, the longer it takes you \nto pay them, the more their moral/loyalty goes down.\n\nPlayer\nThe player customization is quite good also. The more battles you win, more kills you get\nthe more XP and levels you get, and the more levels, the more skill points, and with those skill\npoints you can get a large amount of things, such as more health, more weapon damage,\nor more squads you can lead into battle.\n\nConclusion: I will keep updating the review as the game gets updated, but currently, refining hitboxes,\nfixing the AI, and hopefully giving a little more love to the RTS part of the game.\nThis game sitting at 15 dollars, is a worth purchase(for me) I've gotten quite a few hours \nof good fun out of it already, and i'm hoping to get even more. \n", "timestamp_created": 1518668450, "timestamp_updated": 1518668450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40089922": {"recommendationid": "40089922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158618139", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1521597447}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, highly reccomended if you love fps, stratgy and mangement", "timestamp_created": 1518656067, "timestamp_updated": 1518656067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40089825": {"recommendationid": "40089825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093043873", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 355, "last_played": 1521744937}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally Mount and Bland, but with guns, and it does it pretty well. \n\nBarely in Early Access but I can tell it's going to be a good game", "timestamp_created": 1518655455, "timestamp_updated": 1518655455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40079588": {"recommendationid": "40079588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100186884", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519920910}, "language": "english", "review": "A mix of Mount and Blade and Arma.

something else, thats not generally a good thing.\n\nHowever, Freeman:GW has quite a lot going for it, and considering how recently it went live, it's state in early access, and what we already have to work with in terms of content, I think it's safe to say this game will most likely be worth your time. [b]If you can take the good with the bad, and the concept alone sounds great, then the game will be worth the $15 price of admission for you. If not, give it some time[/b], as the game is quite honestly PLAGUED with rough edges. But for the most part, what's in the game does function more or less. \n\nAs a last general statement, [b]I really do want to reccomend this game, but as with any early access title, tread lightly.[/b]\n\nNow, in regards to early access period specifics that don't seem to pertain to random bugs:\n[list]\n[*]The UI needs a bit of work, there is an annoying issue pertaining to buttons staying \"selected\" even when the mouse cursor has moved to another button, hard to explain, easy to notice\n\n[*]There could stand to be a bit more optimization with either the player models or the gun-scope models, one of them is killing my frames in even smaller battles\n\n[*]The gunplay is functional and not altogether bad, but sights (both irons and magnified optics alike) are all over the place, quite literally; they tend to simply line up somewhere on the screen and it's hard to tell if you're supposed to be using the sights themselves or the invisible crosshair in the middle of the screen, I'm 90% sure it's the latter since you seemingly have to compensate for bullet drop at every range, even point blank (although this one could just be me being bad)\n\n[*]The AI seems to have the unfortunately common ability to see and shoot through non-solid objects the player cannot (bushes, grass, etc.) making for some potentially annoying moments considering the more or less \"open field\" layout of the battlefields thus far\n\n[*]There are just so many ways to lose frames in this game that to list them all would likely double the length of this review\n[/list]\nThese are all ultimately minor gripes in the grand scheme of things, and as stated I do not see them as bugs, more design oversights/mid-development hitches that otherwise don't seem to belong in the final product, whenever that release may be. While at time of writing I have a mere 5 hours of game time, [b]these have all been apparent enough and common enough that even in that small time span, these things were easily identifiable. The dev team seem to have their shit together (another notable positive) so I have faith that most of these will be addressed in the forseeable future.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1518573418, "timestamp_updated": 1518573418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698259", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40058757": {"recommendationid": "40058757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241408114", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1521348488}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far one of the best games I have simply ever played.

The setting in and of itself is that of insurrectionary warfare and it would be cool to see the devs make our paramilitary groups able to do more, y'know, paramilitary stuff. Like maybe drug dealing, or building tunnel networks, or smuggling guns, or helping foreign governments who have economic interests in the region in return for funding or weapons or soldiers or something. Also some sabotage might be fun. Like one thing about being an insurgent group is being able to bomb things. I'd love it if we had some options there.\n\nLike there's half a century worth of cold war history full with ideas. What made Mount and Blade so good wasn't just the combat. But rather the big breathing world full of interactivity. The inter-politics within the factions, being able to start enterprises, that sort of thing.

Comment dire ils sont vos chiens de gardes , ils vont tirer sans regarder devant eux , qu'ils aient un arbres , un mur , un rocher, ... \u00c7a les emp\u00eacheront pas de tirer dessus si l'ennemi et en face deux \u00e0 100m un petit hic mais difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9gler je pense encore , apr\u00e8s il y a aussi le buisson impossible \u00e0 traverser haha \nUn reproche que je pourrais faire ces t le manque de combat en urbain car la plus part de vos affrontement seront dans des pleins style M&B , je veux bien croire que des escarmouches dans les plaines \u00e7a existe mais pas \u00e0 chaque fois , il y a bien des cabanes de chasseurs , usines , \u00e9coles, b\u00e2timents abandonn\u00e9 dans les plaines parce que les seuls combats avec b\u00e2timents seront les prises ou d\u00e9fense de ville pour ma part ce que je trouve dommage car avec le plan et les ordres cela pourrait vraiment rendre les combat encore plus int\u00e9ressant \n\n\nNiveau carte \nSa pr\u00e9sentation est comme M&B donc on ne s'y perd pas , assez similaire, oubli\u00e9 le fait de vous balader dans les villes \u00e0 pieds , cela n'existe pas \nUn bug assez r\u00e9gulier pour ma part c'est que par moment mon perso refuse de se d\u00e9placer sur la mal alors que le monde bouge ou bien il se met \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat et refuse de se remettre sur play...\nCe que je trouve dommage mais peut \u00eatre que \u00e7a viendra plus tard ce sont les v\u00e9hicules , que \u00e7a soit pour le d\u00e9placement ou les combats , dans les combats moderne il y a toujours au minimum une jeep qui tra\u00eene par la ^^ car faire les d\u00e9placements \u00e0 pied constamment c'est assez lassant \n\nJe pense que ce jeu pourra plaire \u00e0 pas mal d'entre vous , apr\u00e8s 15e ce n'est pas ch\u00e8re pour ce jeu puis je pense que \u00e7a va un peu monte une fois qu'il sera un peu plus connu , j'esp\u00e8re que des v\u00e9hicules seront vite mis en place et pourquoi pas un Mod  multijoueur \n\nSi vous avez des

"language": "english", "review": "**REFUNDED**\nThis game has a lot of potential but in the current state is no where near worth $15. Maybe I will buy it on sale or something unless it improves greatly. At this point in time I am done buying games that aren't finished. I would rather pay a higher price for something I will love then pay a low price and wait 2 years just to be let down by unfulfilled promises and lack of delivery.... like we see ALLL THE TIME... Don't get me wrong. I had a little bit of fun and can see this game turning into a favorite. Just don't want to spend money on something like this just to wait around for it to happen.... \n\nI have checked the \"Follow\" box and will keep up to date on what seems to have the potential to be an awesome game. Although I am unsure how long that will take. I will be back and will change this review to recommended should the development justify it.\n\n\nIn Short.. I would rather wait till the game has more content and is more playable rather then throw away $15 for the current state of the game. The hour and a half I played I had a little fun and was more trying to figure out commands, controls, and what to do. \n\nOverview:\nThere is only one play mode, one campaign where you start out with yourself and a band of rag tag bandits.\n\nThe objective is to overtake the world... or well... Island you start on. It was awesome to find a game like there where you can take control of your player in the battle field and fight in hopes to sway the tide.\n\nPositives:\nIt has a lot of potential.\nThe combat seems pretty good for what it is... but I would hope it improves with the rest of the game.\nStrategy counts, rocks, trees, buildings, where you go and what you do matters on the battlefield.\nRPS and Grenades make cool booms\nCharging at the enemy with 4 groups of troops is a really cool experience (you will probably die though)\n\nNegatives:\nThere are a lot of things missing... A LOT. Pretty much the only thing you can do at this point is find enemies like bandits and fight them over and over till you can afford to buy better guns and troops to take with you.\nYou can only play one person, and if you are wounded to near death you are taken out of the fight.\nNo Difficulty Changes... only one difficulty setting\nOnly one small map to play on\nNo back story, no dialog, no tutorial...\n\n\nWhat would make me buy it again:\nContent, content, content....\nI was weary as the game is in early beta stages and it looks awesome from the store page.

It shows a lot of promise!  As everyone else has pointed out, FGW is essentially the wedlock child of Mount & Blade and whichever FPS Maury discovers to be the father through paternity testing.  If you are familiar with M&B, you will instantly become familiar with the overall map, town layout, combat setup, trading, etc.  In addition, you'll be familiar with the \"started from bottom, now we here\" routine in that you begin with a Makarov pistol and two squads of rebels without a cause.  Like nearly all ground force commanders, your early success largely depends on riding the backs of your soldiers to victory against fairly less competent armed groups, all the while you mindlessly stand out in the open trying to figure what everyone is shooting at.  Fortunately, from my observation the AI is pretty strong; your squads will not foolishly rush into open fire, and have the sense to take available cover or hit the dirt while sending steel downrange.  Of course, you will have to take out some tangoes on your own in order to gain any experience and the confidence of your men.  As you gain some XP, you will be able to command more men and take more squad into battle (assuming you spend your skill point wisely).  In the world map, you can trade, recruit, heal up, and lay siege to villages belonging to different factions involved in the conflict.  Your men have the luxury of limitless ammo, your character will regular refits of ammo, medkits, frags, etc. (do your damn PCCs).  \n\nWhile the game is obviously incomplete, I see a lot of potential for this game and believe it will grow to be a good sleeper title.  Worst case scenerio, it will serve as a placeholder for M&B Bannerlord. I believe that most of the cons I see for this game will be addressed during its EA period, and highly recommend it based on potential:\n\nPros:\n+ M&B w/ mordern weaponry (enough said)\n\n+ Ballistic trajectory.  I can appreciate the facts that rounds are not always going to land exactly where my line up at distance.  You'll find that dirt kick up and Kentucky windage will be your friend.\n\n+ Weapon Variety.  The different types and calibers of weapons is quite impressive IMO. \n\n+ Sound quality.  Seems like a small thing, but the sounds of gunfire are quite effective in letting me know what type of squad I'm up against.  Also, while generic, your squads do well to notify you of their situation (although it may be difficult to determine is providing the feedback).\n\n+ Strategy Map.  The map to command your squads during is pretty useful in that terrain and vegetation is well depicted, and it easily allows you to set up waypoints and make quidk drag-n-drop adjustment in the event of contact.  Known enemy positions are also shown easily.  After a set amountof time, enmey locations are revealed, which may be a bit cheesy, but helpful given the rather large map size.  \n\n+ Inventory Management.  Having to manage your own inventory put me back to Faces of War (another favorite mine), and to some degree adds to the realism.  That being said, it may be a bit weird that YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE who has to worry about an ammo count.  Fortunately, ammo is priced reasonably enough for it to not be a big deal.\n\n+ M&B w/ guns (I may have said that already).\n\nCons:\n- No missions.  Obviously the devs are working this, but currently the only quest is to take over 10 towns and oblierate some of the game's factions.  It's certainly easy to piss people off, but I haven't seen a way to gain favor of a group that at least neutral to you. \n\n- No vehicles.  The battle maps are quite large and IMO shoudl be able to support light armor or transport vehicle at the least.\n\n- Body physics.  The ragdoll effect from neutralized soldiers is neat, but sometimes they seem to die in a crounched position with a weird head nod going on.  From distance it may seem like your target is still a alive.  Certainly not a deal breaker, but something I ould like to see fixed.\n\nReccomendations:\n~ Minimap.  A minimap, or at least a compass would be a welcome addition to the UI.  It is very easy to become disorientated and switching to the startegy map just to get your bearing can be frustrating.\n\n~ EPWs.  In M&B, you're able to take prisoners whom you may decide to recruit, ransom, etc.  Seeing as to how FGW already draws so many similarities, I think it neat would be neat to incorporate this well, with similar options, or even the ability to interrogate prisoners on intel of thier group's future movement or something\n\n~ DIrect Command.  I may be wrong, but as far as I can tell the only to command your squads is through the strategy map.  It would nice to have to some quick direct commands (move to flank, suppress, run like hell...) to squads in your proximity without having to cycle to the map.\n\n~ Specialized Squads.  I don't think a single hero would be appropriate in this game, but it would be cool to occasionally run into a spec ops team or some form of special group that you hire to join your force.\n\n~ Rollover Squad Members.  While I can understand the frustation of the two men who weren't selected to be the MG or sniper team, I would to have ability to refit them as a different squad rather than let them take their ball and go home.\n\nMay be some things I but that's about the gist of it.  If you enjoy M&B, this is well in your comfort zone.  If you're on the fence, I say give it a shot if you nothing better to do with $15.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1518501722, "timestamp_updated": 1518501722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40038071": {"recommendationid": "40038071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333381980", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 826, "last_played": 1521714157}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice combination of FPS and strategy with lots of potential.

Especially with internet not being available at my house, the basis of it keeps it very entertaining. I think especially in the future it will be AMAZING, but for now I can still have a lot of fun on it. It's a great mix of command and action, your the general of a small army and you can control them, but you are alos one of the soldies. Amazing concept and good execution so far. That is my schpeal to those looking to see if they want to get this game. Get it. Even if you buy it now and wait a year for it be polished. Help support this project! The reast of this review is for devs..\n\nMy suggestions/issues\n\nI may not have the greatest graphics card in the world, but I can usually run most games on high if not ultra. However, this game I have settings to performance rather than graphics, and everything else on low; however if Im using a sniper or the pka scope im almost unable to see whats going on because my screen is skipping around really bad, especially the more troops I have deployed or enemys spawned.Even with an assault rifle and a red dot, it will get choopy if 10 enemies are spawned. I also tried lower resolution, to no avail. But realistically I shouldn't need a top notch computer to play any game on low resolution, as not very many people have those anyway. I hope that's something that can be fixed seim-easily. That is my main issue currently. If that was fixed I would have no other issues with the game. Just makes it hard to play. I understand there are many non-funtioning features currently and I'm positiive you are already aware of them.\n\n\nSo I'll finish off with this:\nNothing I say here is knocking your game, just trying to help you with the things that would matter most to me at least while were in the developmental part, as well as seeing a couple of them in the final edition.. \n\nSuggestions\n-Maybe add a way to control troops while in the FPS mode\n-Our own squad with us as leader that plays while we are on the map screen controlling troops so we don't have to catch up\n-Pick up ammo/other things off dead soliders\n-Variable zoom scopes, and scopes with metering (for gravity of bullets)\n-Melee weapons, crossbows, other unique weapons would be cool\n-Add a \"take cover\" command for troops with the \"caution\" and \"charge\" commands\n- Ability to make stuff out of the random drops (ie. electronics, gears, camos, skins, maybe moss to help with camo while in the field or ghillie suits for us snipers, or abilty to make cover out of nothing (maybe utilizing the shovel to dig a mini trech, or sandbags for bunkers,something like that)\n-A button that we as players can use to mark enemies our troops haven't seen yet\n-Vehicles, and drones for scouting (something to help us scout so we can prepare for an ambush from behind) when deployed\n-Enemies actually spawning inside of red-zone\n-Leveling our own troops up further (not sure if that's implemented yet just haven't been able to upgrade my snipers at all)\n-Buildings on atack battlefield would add different strategies and more than just hills, rocks, and trees. \n-hitmarkers, so we know if we actually hit someone from across the map when it's hard to see.\n-Day and night (night battles would be awesome, but then make sure to add night-vision and infrared scopes, as well as utilizing the flashlight - maybe let us attach it to gun as well) - Give AI snipers this ability as well\n-Being able to revivie our troops would be cool, though not necessary. that ones up to you.\n-Stealth missions or something involving more stealth. Maybe a whole force full of stealthy snipers to take down a base - mission\n-Last but not least, don't be afraid to take ideas from some of the more popular games and implement them.I fel like COD mixed with skyrim mixed with GTA mixed with Payday II mixed with God of War mixed with Fallout would be badass (obviously. Why not add great ideas from other games to this one?\n\n\n\nJust an idea.. It would be cool if you  gave the option for the character to follow troops when your in the map -m- mode, as I find myself constantly falling behind when I have 7 troops to tell what to do. If not that, maybe a flank option that AI can do itself. Just something to speed up the commander process and make the game a little more on-the-go instead of play-pause-command-play-find cover-command etc.. Something more intuitive. A huge plus of this game is that it's got both MMO and FPS in it, which keeps the player in control of others, as well as ourselves. A great way to capture the minds of many different types of players. But if we have a bunch of troops to control, the FPS side (my favorite aspect) is taken away from, making it a tiny bit less fun for me.\n\nJust in case anyone reads this whole post.. I love this game, has turned into pretty much my new favorite game besides GTAV. I am stoked to see it's development over the the next year. However, it is very early so I felt it might be helpful to put my two cents in. I'm sure I'll add more as I play more, those are just my immediate thoughts now that I'm about 5 hours in. \n\nFinally, keep going on this game. It's amazing, especially for how long it's been out. It's a great idea and I think there are infinite amounts of directions you can take it and features you can add to make it fully immersive, and bothy easy as well as challenging to play. I am excited to see what you guys do with it.

If you attack a smaller group, they will try to wait for you to come to them but if they outnumber you they will try to attack you from all sides.

Be warned this is early access and you may only get 20 hours of game time out of now if the devs abandon it.

EL HIJO PREDILECTO\n\nEchando un ojo a algunos an\u00e1lisis me encuentro con una mayor\u00eda de jugadores ensimismados con la idea... y no es para menos, por fin alguien es capaz de entrelazar dos g\u00e9neros tan aclamados y venerados por la comunidad. Por un lado M&B, que result\u00f3 ser una obra maestra con su enfoque m\u00e1s que original y bien balanceado. Cualquiera que le dedique al menos 5 minutos se encontrar\u00e1 con un interfaz que roza lo calcado, as\u00ed como sus mec\u00e1nicas de juego o su mundo din\u00e1mico con diversas facciones (a\u00fan por implementar)\n\nPor otro lado hay qui\u00e9n se encarga de atribuirle las caracter\u00edsticas del t\u00edtulo de simulaci\u00f3n Arma. Si bien es cierto, se trata de un juego que est\u00e1 ambientado en la guerra moderna pero\u2026. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9  Arma si existen tantos juegos que cumplen esta misma premisa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no Call Of Duty o Medal of Honor? Tengo que decir soy un activo jugador de ambos juegos, tanto M&B como Arma (desde que se llamaba Operation Flashpoint) y es bien sabido que f\u00e1cilmente, he podido establecer diversas relaciones entre el primer t\u00edtulo y el  juego en cuesti\u00f3n, sin embargo, me resulta casi imposible hacerlo con Arma. Pues aun habiendo jugado una media de 6 horas he podido observar que en FGW la inteligencia artificial es bastante capaz de tomar decisiones b\u00e1sicas y asegurar su supervivencia en combate (tomar coberturas o incluso avanzar haciendo supresi\u00f3n) algo impensable en Arma (soldados que no cubren sectores o que no son capaces de ponerse a cubierto, veh\u00edculos pasando por encima de tus tropas, helic\u00f3pteros que se chocan entre s\u00ed\u2026.) as\u00ed como la interfaz gr\u00e1fica o m\u00e1s bien, la jugabilidad, que ofrece alternativas mucho m\u00e1s simples y funcionales que los enrevesados men\u00fas con los que Arma aturulla al jugador y sobre todo y m\u00e1s importante, en FGW mi personaje puede resistir m\u00e1s tiros que el T800 en Terminator, algo que en Arma resulta inconcebible, pues cualquier jugador sabe que puedes morir de un tiro a m\u00e1s de 800 metros por la IA que dispara sin ning\u00fan tipo de visor y con el viento en contra\u2026. (La misma que momentos antes bajo tu mando no es capaz de seguir tus \u00f3rdenes)\n\nDejando a un lado este ataque a la poca coherencia que me suscita la comparaci\u00f3n con Arma, he de decir, que FGW se trata de una idea innovadora cuanto menos, pero que por el momento es s\u00f3lo una idea. Creo firmemente que se trata de un juego que tiene que trabajar mucho y ofrecer al menos el mismo dinamismo en lo que el mundo se refiere que nos ofreci\u00f3 M&B. Por el momento, las facciones no se atacan entre s\u00ed, no existen sistemas de alianzas o ning\u00fan tipo de diplomacia y no hay m\u00e1s misiones que la principal (controlar territorios).

Whilst this can be fun occassionally, it gets stale very quickly as the game doesn't currently have a \"Delegate\" option for your troops to command themselves, nor does it have an autoresolve feature, meaning you have to actively search for enemies rather carefully (even if you greatly outnumber them) every battle or risk taking heavy casualties.\n\nThat being said, the game has an extreme amount of potential overall with a whole plethora of great ideas that would hopefully one day develop into a great and grand game. \n\nThere are a couple of things I would really like to see in the finished game though:\n\n1. An option to have your troops autodeploy and delegate with the player being able to select if their troops should act on their own aggressively, defensively, or in a balanced manner.\n\n2. Some small form of interactivity in the game in the form of a story line or quests.\n\n3.

I always believe that devs need to earn their upvote. I'm not a blind fanboy bandwaggon kiddie (plenty of those around!). If I am paying for something I expect it to deliver what I'm paying for.\n\n[h1]So the important questions are...[/h1]\n[b]Do I regret buying another EA game?[/b]\n- Not sure yet. I have been REALLY burned on EA, but I chose to give this one a try anyway. Too early to tell if its another scam. But I am very optimistic about this game!\n\n[b]Is this game in a playable/enjoyable state?[/b]\n- Yes and No. Therefor the real answer is no. You can have 10 hours of fun but there just isnt much to do.\n\n[b]Is this game balanced?[/b]\n- Absolutely not. The AI is MUCH better than you. Take 30vs30 where your troops are superior (top-tier mercenary) vs their low-tier troops: your troops will still lose. I've run 50+ battles purely against uman terrorists and bandits (weakest troops on the map) vs my top-tier riflemen/snipers/veterans/MG squads. I carefully expand and try to flank and cover, getting my troops on high ground, in forest cover, etc. - but my troops always take higher losses than the enemy.\n\n[b]Is this game polished?[/b]\n- Absolutely not. There are critical & trivial things missing or broken. Dozens of them.\n- EG: Garrison menu doesnt scroll to the bottom?\n- EG: You cant even use the mouse scroll on inventory/squad menus?\n- EG: Movespeed is broken. On worldmap with more than 100 men = you cannot move. Even with 30 skill (from cheats) and no inventory. WTF?\n- EG: 90% of game items are useless / not implemented yet.\n- EG: FPS combat is still quite buggy, troops are fairly retarded other than \"see enemy, find cover\" (which is good), but then its just a firefight.\n- EG: Your own troops dont follow commands well. Give them waypoints? Flip a coin and hope they follow them without spreading out randomly and dying.\n- EG: Town management is very simplistic, basically M&B copy for now.\n- EG: Theres no depth to the game at all. You have an army, you can conquer towns and garrison troops, and thats it.\n\n[b]So whats good about this game?[/b]\n- So far it [i]looks[/i] like it is blending the FPS/RTS/RPG elements very well - but it has basically just copied Mount&Blade. Is that a bad thing? Hell no! M&B is one of the best games of all time! Gimme more!\n- FPS combat is good. Bullet drop, weapon range, weapon handling, different equipment uses. Its solid enough but does need improvements.\n- World map aspect is good, its literally identical to M&B. However M&B is 10 years old and I expect big ideas and improvements here. Not just a straight copy of a 10 year old game.\n- The squad aspect is good, instead of having individual troops like M&B - this is the ONE thing I see some good ideas/improvement on over M&B.\n- Equipment system is good, but also its a straight copy of M&B. Needs new ideas and improvements.\n- Basically everything good about this game is just copied from M&B... So if you like M&B this will be fun for 10 hours.\n\n[b]And whats bad about this game?[/b]\n- Still very buggy. Sometimes troops spawn in the air, and then cant move because they cant find a path to move, so they are just stuck there.\n- On a 130 troop town I sieged, all the AI troops spawned in clusters (like 40 troops stacked on top of eachother), and couldnt move. One RPG took out 20-30 troops (that was fun, but not supposed to happen).\n- [b]Its a FRIKKIN UNITY GAME! AAAGH![/b] Unity engine is NOT a game engine. It is for uni students to learn how to make games - NOT for professional / production games. It is a flawed engine that is COMPLETELY unoptimized and simply WILL NEVER RUN well. Period. I'm a software engineer and have made 2 games. This is not a debate. I am very very very worried about this game like 100% of every other unity PC games out there that never get completed because this is a fact: when a dev uses unity, its because they lack the skills to create their own engine = they lack the skills to complete a full game. So this game will NEVER be optimized and run well. The more assets they put in, the laggier it will become until its unplayable (LIKE EVERY OTHER UNITY GAME!).\n- So far its copying way too much from M&B and I see nothing new about this game. Its very scary to see a new indie dev take unity + copy M&B + put in guns = think they made a real game. Nope. Not even close.

There is some additional strategic gameplay in giving orders to your units, but the staples of guerilla warfare are missing - hit-and-fade attacks aren't possible, and you deploy in a ridiculously small area, so surrounding the enemy is impossible.\n\nAs far as the technical gameplay goes, it's even worse. I purchased a scope that doesn't zoom, my gun shudders even when I'm holding still, and my bullets hit well above the crosshairs even at long range. The game claims that the red zone details roughly where your enemies are, and that most combat will occur there. However, several times I have deployed, moved toward the red zone immediately, and been shot from directly behind me before we got anywhere near it, so very clearly it means nothing at all.\n\nNothing

(It's also a bit more barebones than M&B in its current state too). \n\nHowever, The devs are also extremely active and are releasing patches weekly as well, which is extremely nice to see, especially for EA.\n\nThe gunplay and movement feel really smooth as well and there is some degree of micromanagement you get to have regarding trading, cities, squads, and equipment.\n\nThe game will keep you busy for a good amount of time(if you are trying to beat it in its current state), as the main objective in the game is to conquer and hold 10 cities. Assuming you are playing without cheats, planning for each siege and winning battles with bandits/other factions to get money for more men & equipment will take a while. There is also currently one side mission implemented into the game (Escort mission).\n\n[u]Issues/bugs that I'm currently running into in the current patch (v0.133) :[/u]\n\n1. Troops that are placed near buildings on spawn have a chance to spawn inside/on top of buildings, which they get stuck in or on\n\n2. Sometimes after loading a game, the city interface will not display when clicking on a city (requires you to close and reopen the game)\n\n3. City numbers don't accurately match the number of troops you're fighting (Less than what is usaully displayed)\n\n[u]Suggestions for the game (Strikethroughs = implemented into game) :[/u]\n\n[strike]- Remove commanding skill limit (Currently capped at 5)[/strike]\n\n- Multiple Save Files\n\n- Weapon & [strike] Armor durability system[/strike] to encourage wide weapon usage and so Armor doesn't last forever (gun jamming could be added in as a gameplay mechanic from this as well)\n\n[strike]- More customiation for squads (individual skills, weapons, etc) for each squad member  [/strike]\n\n- Choose to side with a faction or take over the map yourself \n\n- Diplomacy options for factions & own faction\n\n- Different starting points\n\n- Vehicles\n\n- Melee weapons/ability to punch\n\n[strike]- Ways to reduce sway when aiming down the sights (upgrade the steady shot stat) [/strike]\n\n- Campaign Mode for each faction (Story & Winning conditions would be different for each Faction)\n\n- Additional places other than cities (Mines, Farms) Which could produce certain goods/provide bonuses to controlling faction\n\n- Co-op/Multiplayer (Confirmed for the future!)\n\n- More penalties for dying \n\nOther than that, I'm really enjoying the game so far. \n\nKeep it up, Devs. \n\nReally excited for the new content, quests, and more things that will be implemented into the game later\n\n9/10 Extremely fun for an early access game.\n\ntl;dr : The game is fun, is somewhat barebones in it's current state as there isn't much to do at the moment.

My issue isnt that they arnt spawning in that area but the fact they seem to be able to spawn anywhere which turns every battle into trying to get out of an ambush every singal time even though I was the one that engaged them.

I get the inventory loot. Then I leave the battle and boom Crash. I get frustrated and go back in starting all over. I kill bandits/levelup. Get guys to max level. Then I decide to rush in my FCA Rangers and some low level Mercenary Militia squads against looters (the easiest enemy in the game(I think)) and the Rangers die! I get mad and kill the looters. I then decide to try and build up an army to siege the Bandits town. Meanwhile the Red Boys (Uman Terrorist who we are at war with by default) start to build their armies and chase me as I build mine. I siege the Bandit Town and retreat after killing 20 Bandits and losing nearly my entire army of elite troops. I kill bandits to get money to get more soldiers and attack. (Also be sure to have a good gun with sights before you siege, it helps alot) I come back with my 25 men to their 60 men and I start killing some of them and slowly dwindling their numbers while my numbers also dwindle. But I somehow captured the town and get 15k in money and alot of loot for more money. I build 2 buildings for security and go back to the town you start near to get some cheap soldiers to garrison it. While I am away a group of 55 Red guys (They are annoying) come and siege the town. I get back and I defend it, almost. I die when they had 9 of them left. My Soldiers bring me back to safety and I heal my Mercenary Veterans and go back in.

FCA Recruits -> FCA Riflemen -> FCA Grenadiers -> FCA Rangers.\nStupid AI at times where they refuse to move.\nand maybe some I forgot to mention.\n\nBugs:\nOnly one I've seen if it even is a bug is where you have your map out at the end of a battle and leave you crash. I only did it that once and didn't try it again so I'm not sure.\n\n\nThat's it for my first review. If you made it this far I'm surprised since alot of time people don't read that  much.

I usually do not buy early access titles due to poor experiences in the past. This game is worth it though, granted I have only put an hour or so into it. The concept and gameplay sparked my interest and I had to try it. For a quick summery, it's a mix of the mechanics of the Arma series and the RTS elements of Company of Heroes/ other RTS series. This wouldn't necessarily make it stand out on its own, but the added first person and role-playing elements of trying to keep your band together while taking over or liberating towns is a fresh idea. I'll edit this as I play it more, but as of right now I'm quite enjoying being a war lord and trying to counquer the world.\n\nEDITED\nAs of when this edit was made, I have about 6 hours in it. Since it is an early access title, it does have some of the standard early access bugs like clunky menues and rough finish so I'm going to skip over that stuff and discuss the more important points.\n\nI must state this game is not for fans of COD or similar FPS's. You will die. A LOT. As for gameplay, it is a fun game if you enjoy RTS games, granted this game is not super forgiving if you're not on top of your troops and lead them into a bad situation since you can't keep making units while in battle, and if you like the Arma/Verdun/Argo FPS style and mechanics.  It does take a bit of getting used to since this mix of RTS and FPS does require you to be proficient at both aspects or either you will die, or you men will die. Battles start with you picking the squads you want to send into battle, these can be changed durring the battle, but it is much better if you can read the situation and enviroment and deploy accordingly. It does take time to get money and equipment for yourself and your soldiers but it doesnt seem forced. A lot of games make you grind for resources and it doesn't feel quite right. In FREEMAN there still is a bit of a grind but it feels natural and not like the devs made it purposefully annoying.

You also start out with 10 riflemen, and if you defend properly you can usualy kill 15-20 without loosing a full unit and then just heal back up. There arn't many armies running around with that low troop counts but there are atleast a few if you look. An alternate way to earn some starting cash is to run between the towns trading (i would recomend this, much faster cash income early game).\nThen after you figure out your best way to earn cash, you gear up, kill people to lvl up so you can command more troops and eventually attack and take over towns. Currently there are no quests or objectives other than \"hold 10 towns and kill everyone\". Even after taking every town from a faction, killing all his troops (or atleast i'm assuming they were all dead, overview put is army strength at 0) randomly that faction just spawns in 30+ armys with a total strength of 300k+. Luckaly if your town has atleast 50+ people in it, it will never get attacked but still it seems odd that a whiped out faction just spawns in massive amounts of troops randomly.\nThe combat is really fun, you need to make an actual stratigy and tell your troops to go to good spots, or they will just eat bullets and die quick. Once more gets added into the game this will be a great game, however for now there isnt much to do and after a few hours it seems like its too easy and you cant loose any fight (deploying 6 units, max army pop of 60 is when i found to be unkillable and every fight trivial)", "timestamp_created": 1518295896, "timestamp_updated": 1518295896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39986019": {"recommendationid": "39986019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044586658", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "last_played": 1521348151}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR Slavic Mount & Blade with AKs and lots of balaclavas, looks and sounds like AIDS but plays great. Is good game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nEssentially boils down to if Mount & Blade had modern combat and the gunplay was something like STALKER (not too realistic but definitely not extremely arcadey). Guns can be a bit wonky at times and sometimes feel like something that was bought off of the Unity store but its already doing better than most workshop games. I'm assuming it's planned to be implemented but other bands of enemies can't gang up on you and assrape you like in Mount & Blade. AI is surprisingly smart for an early access game. They seem to actually react to gunfire by either running to cover or going prone. Your own AI, when not told to move, will move to rocks and trees and try and cover themselves. In town raids the AI is a lot more broken, not to mention you walk straight through doors and can't shoot through glass in towns, it's really easy for the player to just make a shooting gallery of them. There's also no quests yet but they plan to add that because there are buttons in game that currently don't do anything. Also, I'm pretty sure your war party doesn't eat food because I have yet to see any food get depleted.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThis game looks better than Mount & Blade but is far from pretty. The terrain outside of towns looks like someone ate three different textures and puked them on the ground. The flora and rocks are a bit wonky in the mesh collider/hit detection department so just be careful when shooting from cover. The towns however look great, they really give off the vibe of an eastern European village. The UI is very basic, it gets the job done just fine but isn't very appealing.\n\nSOUND\nThe sounds in this game are kinda shit to be honest, a lot of them sound like any old sound effect taken from an asset store. The voice acting essentially comes down to 4 voice lines that get repeated very often and get annoying after a while. Shell casings don't seem to scale with the other sounds on the sound slider so if you turn the game down via in the in-game options the shell casings will be louder than gunfire. Then again, I didn't expect much more from an early access game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1518294937, "timestamp_updated": 1518294937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39985883": {"recommendationid": "39985883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033435213", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520090817}, "language": "english", "review": "Not finished but amazing \n\nI wonder if they add some more \"heavy\" weapons", "timestamp_created": 1518294576, "timestamp_updated": 1518294576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39985772": {"recommendationid": "39985772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031116815", "num_games_owned": 794, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1521524076}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it quite a bit so far, only real problems i had will be worked out eventually\nfor example, sieging a settlement is too easy due to the fact when you retreat or get knocked out you can easily just spam squad replenishment and attack and wear them down.\nanother little thing id like to see would be the ability to not have to go to the edge of the battle to retreat\n\npostive wise the gunplay is realistic, you have plumes of dirt kickup and the staccato of gunfire makes you feel like your actually in a hotzone which is pretty cool.\nstrating with the pistol wasn't a big deal like some folks said, a few shots with it and you get plenty of kills no problem\n\noh and i think the devs  already have the game half finished and are releasing patches daily to show off, no way they are pumping stuff out that fast :P", "timestamp_created": 1518294213, "timestamp_updated": 1518294279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39985308": {"recommendationid": "39985308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149364718", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1521275743}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709 \u6f5c\u529b \uff0c\u503c\u5f97 \u4e00\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1518292912, "timestamp_updated": 1518292912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39985255": {"recommendationid": "39985255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245940478", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 599, "last_played": 1521741197}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is well worth the 15$ to support the devs. The updates have steadily been rolling out, both fixing bugs and adding content.

This aspect \"slows down\" and takes away the rush of being in a shooting.\n\nYou will find some bugs, the one that stands out more is when defending a owned citie where your garrisson troops won't join the fight but still count to the squad cap. So you will have to fend off a group of 30-50 enemy combatants just with your gun and a couple of troops.

You start off hostile to the bandits and one faction, but the rest have towns you can visit to recruit, trade or attack, until you own them or forge an alliance yadda yadda yadda.\n\nBasic functions are there to gather squads, barter and fight with stat points similar to M&B (cap the amount of squads, inventory space, discounts etc. etc.).   \n\nI admit I have yet to try talking to any armies to get quests or faction points, but the system is there to make allies and enemies. \n\nPretty fun so far!  Combat is interesting, but mainly involves maneuvering your guys so that you aren't caught with your pants down when the wandering enemy squads cross your line of sight.  There is some pretty basic strategy involved, such as utilizing high-ground for your sniper/mg teams while your assault teams hang just below a berm to get those close shots.  Gun sounds at a distance definitely need work, because as of now they just sound like a crappy tiny speaker.

Our numbers have swelled from a mere dozen to fifty fighters, many veterans of previous conflicts, the others among them hardened by the endless skirmishes in this place. My Makarov was long ago sold to a merchant for food, but in its place, a modern American pistol, and my trusty RPK. Our outfit recently pitched in, and purchased an RPG launcher.

Currently, F:GW has a surprisingly impressive arsenal available to the player, though some in need of work in areas such as animation, the over all quality of the game's firearms is impressive for an early alpha game such as this.\n\nI often felt surprised by how I would engage the enemy combatants at first seeing mindless hordes until the tactical side of their AI took over. While the AI itself isn't massive in scale, I would often find enemy's out flanking my spear heads or assailing me from all directions, taking a charge at me if they felt that my men weren't up to the challenge of defeating them.\n\nCurrently as it stands, there isn't much to do but that is to be expected and is actually very acceptable. The game is very wide, and with each passing day gets deeper and deeper as the men and women at KK Game Studio continously update this game day in and day out. I watched gameplay from release and all ready there are new features in the game that I was not aware of, such as guns now being lootable from the enemy which originally wasn't implimented or as widely available.\n\nAs the game moves forward, I'd hope to see it incorporate much more militarism and potentially the political alliances that are tied to such a warzone. The potential to make alliances, friends, companions, outfit your army with armored vehicles (More so APCS and less tanks, as I feel tanks would perhaps be a little too chaotic on such small maps), and develop a story for your faction.\n\nAt its current price, I do recommend F:GW, the game is excellent for its state of development and I see such a purchase as a way to support the development team further. I would hate for this game to collapse under its own ambition and be left to rot in the cesspool of forgotten gems, lets not make Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare a forgotten gem, but support it in its excellency.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview Scores: - Please take these scores as a resource for feedback and not an actual rating of the game and its quality, all of these are subject to extreme levels of change and are only hereby relevant to version 0.110\n\nGameplay: 7.5/10 - Will most likely increase with development, weapons need some fine tuning, perhaps some mechanical annimations. Explosions are a bit bland at the moment but those faults can all be rectified and even if they remain it barely impacts the over all feel and enjoyment of the game itself\n\nGame World: 6/10 - The weakest part about F:GW in its amazing state of alpha release is the world is too bland and empty. You can only explore towns you are besieging and the enemy factions have no leader for you to hate or feel a friendship towards. Your player character is nameless and faceless, a possible character creation system would help benefit the world as well as implimenting the ability to enter settlements to access the markets/recruit squads/and visit the hospital. The world itself also feels very small and I hope that perhaps in the future it will be up scaled to prove an even greater challenge with more factions, more towns, and even more battles to be faught. \n\nVariety: 6.5/10 - F:GW has a moderate level of variety not to be scoffed at. It has a varried list of weaponry that you may arm yourself to take on your enemies and do so with delectable cunning and efficiency. Wether the amount of items stays the same, the game would benefit greatly from more weapons and in the worst case more equipment variation. \n\nSound: 6.5/10 - The sounds of bullets rushing over your head, the impacts of rounds on the opposite side of your cover, the explosion of RPG's impacting around your men. All of these excell in driving player experience to the brink of wonder, however while F:GW does these features well it is not rude to say it could use a bit more work. The Sounds are fine currently as place holders, but could use with some drastic improvement. Perhaps in the future, should profits be acceptable, KK Game Studio's should look into outsourcing or hiring a Audio Technician to touch up some of the game sounds as currently distant fire simply sounds like the volume of the effect was turned down, and all the weapons unfortunately sound the same at distances.\n\nOverall Ranking as of Version 0.110: 6.8/10 - F:GW is a great game, a 6.8/68 shouldn't be scoffed at and is indeed a positive review for such an early product. I will continue to put many hours into the game itself and will update this review as such when significant improvments are made. If you wish to support the game and its development, its current asking price is not, In my own personal consumer opinion too much to ask for. I look forward to continued updates for KK Game Studio and hope any would be buyers enjoy their time as I have with F:GW.", "timestamp_created": 1518212944, "timestamp_updated": 1518212944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39962772": {"recommendationid": "39962772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014746407", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517862027}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played that much, because I want to wait until the game is more fleshed out.

Maintenant il faut esp\u00e9rer que les d\u00e9vellopeurs n'abandonnent pas en cours de route ou ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 nos attentes/esp\u00e9rances.\nVous aurez d\u00e9j\u00e0 une dizaine d'heures suivant votre patience face \u00e0 la r\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9 actuelle (tout jeu est plus ou moins r\u00e9p\u00e9titif suivant la personne mais parfois un jeu est ressenti majoritairement par les individus comme r\u00e9p\u00e9titif et l\u00e0 c'est clairement le cas) et \u00e0 la difficult\u00e9. Mount and Blade est extr\u00eamement moins r\u00e9p\u00e9titif mais on est dans une alpha, donc on accepte pour le moment.\n-Les graphismes sont largement potable pour ce type de jeu (\u00e0 mes yeux qui ont 10/10 aux tests de vue lel). Les armes \u00e9tant plut\u00f4t jolie m\u00eame.\n-On a une carte \u00e0 la mount and blade, bien moins grande, bien moins vari\u00e9s dans ses paysages. \nQuand un combat d\u00e9marre, cela ne prend pas vraiment en compte le paysage du lieu, et les d\u00e9cors de ces combats strat\u00e9gique et fps (\u00e0 la mount and blade donc) sont tr\u00e8s ressemblant, beaucoup trop. Toujours la m\u00eame herbe, les m\u00eames cailloux, les m\u00eames petits bois. Ainsi il y a une lassitude visuelle.\n-Pour une alpha, je trouve qu'il y a pas mal d'armes m\u00eame si on en a vite fait le tour. La personnalisation est tr\u00e8s minime, quelques viseurs pour l'arme principale, bient\u00f4t des silencieux semble t il. On a divers pistolets et r\u00e9volvers, pas personnalisable. On a un lance roquette (rpg). On fini aussi par ressentir une lassitude des armes utilis\u00e9s.\n-Peu de choix pour le moment en terme de v\u00eatement/armure, mais vari\u00e9 dans ce que l'on peut porter, il y a des gants, des prot\u00e8ges genoux, un casque, un gilet par balle, un haut, un pantalon, des lunettes de protection.\n-L'IA se met assez \u00e0 couvert, l'ennemi sera parfois de tout c\u00f4t\u00e9s ce qui rendra les combats tr\u00e8s difficile. Les tireurs d'\u00e9lite font tr\u00e8s mal surtout \u00e0 vos troupes qui seront d\u00e9cim\u00e9s. \n-Pas \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'ordre mais cela me parait suffisant.\n-La gestion des villes captur\u00e9s sont tr\u00e8s peu int\u00e9ressantes. On construit quelques b\u00e2timents mais qui ne change pas l'aspect de la ville, et \u00e0 part gagner un peu plus d'argent cela ne change rien du tout.\n-On ne peut pas personnaliser ses troupes, seulement le chef d'arm\u00e9e que vous incarnez. On recrute des troupes qui peuvent gagner de l'exp\u00e9rience et \u00eatre upgrad\u00e9 jusqu'a un certain niveau.\n-La d\u00e9fense d'une ville peut \u00eatre excessivement trop dur. L'ennemi doit prendre le contr\u00f4le d'une zone, plus il y a de troupes qui y sont, plus la barre de contr\u00f4le monte vite. Vos troupes m\u00eame les meilleurs se font massacrer assez facilement vu que vous \u00eates facilement submerg\u00e9 suivant la zone d'apparition d'ennemis. Dommage de ne pas avoir de possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er des d\u00e9fenses qui se verraient lors d'une attaque.\n-On est tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9 pour faire appara\u00eetre des troupes (m\u00eame en ayant le niveau max dans la cat\u00e9gorie en lien), tandis que l'IA peut en avoir plus, donc vous serez tr\u00e8s souvent submerg\u00e9.\n-Un c\u00f4t\u00e9 rpg sympathique, 3 grandes branches (constitution, dext\u00e9rit\u00e9, intelligence) et un bon nombre de petites branches.\n-On avance extr\u00eamement lentement sur la carte de campagne, elle d\u00e9pend d'un trait qu'il faudra donc monter (impossibilit\u00e9 d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le temps), de ce que vous portez sur vous et du nombre de troupes sous vos ordres (l'IA n'est pas affect\u00e9 par ces malus...)\n-Plusieurs factions, mais pas \u00e9norm\u00e9ment, tr\u00e8s peu de diff\u00e9rences visuelles en plus.\n-Les factions ennemis ne se font pas la guerre, aucun combat entre l'IA pour le moment donc. La diplomatie est au strict minimum d\u00e9pend de votre r\u00e9putation (je me rappelle plus des chiffres exact mais en gros 50 on est copain, 0 on est neutre, -50 on est ennemi). L'IA en guerre contre vous viendra par contre attaquer vos villes qui seront tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre.\n-L'IA ne donne pour le moment aucun mission. Votre seule mission, c'est de massacrer tout le monde.\n-Pour gagner du pognon sans faire la guerre, on peut trouver dans les villes des objets d\u00e9sir\u00e9s par la ville et donc les lui revendre.\n-Peu de bug. Aucun crash perso. Optimisation correct.\n-Musique correct.

Identical gameplay but hope to see other things added to it to take it further into its own thing. It has tons of potential to flesh it out more and give it more variety. Currently no vehicles in it. Its priced right, but still could do with more content and some little polishing around the edges. But very playable apart from the odd bug. No side missions as yet but its coming apparently. \n\nWould like to see a larger world map (about the same or a little smaller than M&B) but if they add vehicles including choppers then i hope the world map size will increase, and possible battle map size as well (which is again about the same size as M&B if not a little bigger.

Maybe a little too much. I'm a big fan of M&B (400h+ played) and been around the game since the beggining. As much as this game is heavily inspired by M&B mechanics crossed with tactical FPS like Arma, it has the potential to get really really good. It's still on Alpha, but the 10 hours I spent playing it were really great. \n\nThe +\n- The difficulty in combats is much higher than it is in M&B. You can be anihilated if you don't use proper tactis (unless you heavily outnumber your opponents) and if you rush like a morron you'll get killed.\n- Even if the orders are still very basics for now, the waypoints allow you to make complex mooves if you use it well.\n- Even if the graphics and sounds aren't that good, you get a good immersion into the heat of the battlefield, specially when you try on taking cities. \n- Cities managment is archaic but promissing as you can build several buildings and stuff.\n- The troop managment is also cool, as you have a moral component, troop trees, wages, etc...\n\n\nThe -\n- the UI is what makes you feel this game is still in early Alpha. It's not really pleasant and fluid navigating in between menus. But it's okay for an alpha.\n- The RPG side is a bit less developped than the tactical/fps ones. You can develop basic skills, but can not really get involved into diplomacy which is sad regarding the \"eastern Europe guerilla\" style setting.\n- There are a few AI inconsistencies, making your mens as well as your enemies to act weirdly.\n- It's a bit repetitive for now as all you do is taking on looters to recruit and train your mens and get some gear and then you take on cities to expand you territory.

Here are my thoughts, for those who are curious:\n\n[b] TLDR: One of the best and brightest examples of a hybrid-genre, early access game to date. Although it has flaws, you'll still have fun. [/b]\n\nAt its core, as I'm sure 90% of the reviews state, it is the love child of Arma and Mount & Blade. It does both overlord real-time strategy and FPS combat surprsingly well given that it is a small indie team, and its EA was just released a week ago.\n\n[h1] Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Good balance of FPS and tactical strategy\n[*]High replayability, since groups and actions are randomized\n[*]Already dozens of hours of gameplay from domination mode alone\n[*]Functional trading, recruiting and rewarding town ownership\n[*]Very decent skill and perk tree after leveling up in combat\n[*]Stomping out the Uman Brotherhood because wow they make me angry\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Neutral:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are not bad. Nothing to write home about either. Environments are sharp but character models, not so much\n[*]Very limited selection of soldiers to include in your party (about 7ish or so)\n[*]Same with weapons. A good variety, but could be more\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Enemies can usually see you, although you can't see them. Unfortunately this is not a two-way street (they can see through trees, bushes, solid ground)\n[*]Lower level enemies can still wipe out a veteran squad of mercs with relative ease in some cases (i.e. need to add higher level friendlies)\n[*]With only one gamemode, if you have a short attention span it will get old. Don't fret, the devs are working very hard\n[/list]\n\nAll in all a very positive experience imo.

Many a time I wondered what this would be like if it took place in the modern day instead of the medieval era, and after playing Freeman: Guerilla Warfare I have a pretty good idea. If I told you FGW was a similar game to Mount and Blade I\u2019d be lying, it\u2019s the exact same game just with a different setting and some extremely minor gameplay tweaks. The character stats screen is the exact same, the town system is the same, if not worse, and even the overland max is pixel for pixel a mimicry of Mount and Blade. The only thing I can say that\u2019s even remotely different is the pre-battle screen where you can send out orders to your squads, other than that? Nothing. I suppose the fact that the men under your command are in squads, as opposed to just being individuals of a certain class, is unique, but it\u2019s not in a particularly good way. See, FGW has a system of morale for your squads. If it gets too low, they run away at the first signs of combat, and even if they don\u2019t they\u2019ll face significant penalties to effectiveness. This is absurd. Mount and Blade did see you worry about morale, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad because it actually went up by a significant amount if you won battles or increased certain skills. In FGW, the only real way for you to increase squad morale is to give them a pay reward of a couple hundred dollars, and though you can get morale from winning battles it\u2019s such an insignificant amount that it doesn\u2019t matter. In FGW you\u2019re already going to be tight on money, so having the only way to really increase morale be through pay makes for yet another drain on your already almost exhausted resources. That\u2019s not the only drain however, you also have to deal with absurd troop wages and weapon costs. You start out with a squad of volunteers and a squad of militiamen, with the latter being significantly better than the former in just about every way. If you want to upgrade or pick up some better squads, you have to be prepared to pay out the wazoo for the privilege. This makes it incredibly hard to actually upgrade the men who fight alongside you. I hate this, because the AI is great and I\u2019d love to make better use of it with stronger teammates. However even if I could afford their initial cost, better squads are simply not viable for the long-term. On top of increased wages, you also have to pay respawn costs for every single man that dies in the squad, each costing hundreds to replace. It\u2019s just frustrating feeling like your resources are constantly being drained while your enemies only grow stronger.\n\n[h1]Too Poor to Prosper[/h1]\n\nWhen you start the game, you\u2019re given a pathetic loadout of just a single 9mm handgun and some fragmentation grenades, while the squads beside you carry full assault rifles and submachine guns. So you\u2019re forced to almost wholly rely on your squadmates to do all the work for you, having to sit in hidden cover so that you make it out alive. Like Mount and Blade, FGW ends the battle if your commander dies, which is quite possibly the dumbest mechanic in the whole damn game. If you die and choose to send your men in without, never expect to win. Even though you may have crack troops and top-tier weapons, you\u2019ll still lose 9/10 times. It seems the AI has swung the entirely opposite direction on the pendulum. Whereas the in-battle AI listens to your commands and tactically operates, they seem to turn into lobotomites when you\u2019re not there, losing battles where the enemy is both outgunned and outnumbered. If you do manage to lose all your men, you may as well just start a new game instead of trying to work your way back to where you previously were. What was perfect about Mount and Blade is that no matter where you were, you could always find a town nearby to recruit ambitious peasants to fight and die at your side. This meant that regardless of how bad you messed up you always had a way to replenish your army and head out to win back the day. In FGW, even the most basic of volunteer squads with the most inadequate stats and dirt-poor gear costs way more than it should, meaning if you make a mistake it\u2019s almost impossible to recover. The root of all my problems comes back to that one point: you never have enough money to actually get to the fun parts of the game. In a game like Mount and Blade, you can just do quests for different lords, compete in a tournament, become a merchant, or even rob small towns if you had enough men. In FGW you can\u2019t do nearly as much. You can either loot the armies which you\u2019ve conquered for some money and random plunder, or run dry and starve. That\u2019s about it. There are quests in the game, but I went to dozens of different armies and every single one told me that they had no work available for me. I went around and checked the towns and, you may have guessed it, they were devoid of any sort of paying work as well. So I don\u2019t know if there actually are quests for you to do or not, because the only ones I ever had in my quest log were the few that you start off with. Things like annihilate another faction or control 10 towns, things you simply can\u2019t do without more resources.\n\n[h1]Missed the Mark[/h1]\n\nIf it sounds like I\u2019ve got a serious bone to pick with this game, well that\u2019s because I do. While I\u2019ve compared the game itself to Mount and Blade, the combat in particular is closer to that of ARMA. It\u2019s incredibly tense and equally tactical, making for some memorable engagements that felt borderline real. Every gun you pick up has the most satisfying kick and feels like you\u2019re out on the range instead of playing a video game. I was overjoyed when I fired even the most basic handgun, and don\u2019t even get me started on my feelings once I finally acquired an assault rifle. Not only is the act of firing the guns themselves satisfying, but commanding your men in the midst of battle, while being extremely basic, makes you feel like a badass squad leader. Some of the sounds need a bit of work, but the gunplay itself is impeccable and the aspect of command is something I would love to see improved upon. Sadly though, there\u2019s a catch. You can never get the most satisfying weapons like the AK-47 or the M4 because you\u2019ve spent all your money trying to keep the various squads under your employ from deserting. You can\u2019t afford to buy better squads to make even more money because you\u2019re too busy trying to scrounge up the weekly pay for your squad. Which sucks not only because it\u2019s annoying and discouraging for the player to deal with, it also makes it borderline impossible to get to the actually fun part of the game: the combat. I could go on for hours and hours, spewing page after page of praise for the combat in this game, but there wouldn\u2019t be a point. It doesn\u2019t matter if the later parts of your game are perfect if you can\u2019t ever get there in the first place because the early parts of the game are too frustrating and grindy. It\u2019s not fun, and it shows the game not only holds no respect for your time, but holds just as little respect for your money. Sad as it is, the one or two redeeming aspects of Freeman: Guerilla Warfare are gated by so many absolutely infuriating trivialities that it\u2019s just not worth your time.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nTrivial core mechanics constantly hamstring the only good part of Freeman: Guerilla Warfare, the combat, and keep it from truly shining.\n\n[h1]If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to leave a comment and join my Steam Curator Group at  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9577715-Mudkips-Gaming/]Mudkips Gaming![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1518144564, "timestamp_updated": 1518144564, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565571", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1518146354, "developer_response": "Hello, thanks for the honest review!

It just lost its fun factor way too quick. At first; stalking through the tree line was visceral and the bullets flying past you exhilirating.

I would also like to say that I am not writing these to discourage people from playing this game becayse it has only been out for a week so things could change.\n\nFirstly you only start off with a pistol, normally this would be fine but this game doesnt lend itself to close quarters combat considering almost all the combat takes place in open fields. This leaves you at a huge disadvantage from the get go since all AI start off with rifles and will attack from a distance, for my first 4 batlles i had to rely soley on my squads to defeat enemies which is fine but makes the FPS portion pointless till you can scrounge up the money for a weapon that can reach out and touch someone.\n\nSecond issue, tree hit boxes suck. Sometimes you can stand right next to a try and hit an invisible wall and sometimes you can succesfully peak around a tree without issue. This can be frustrating if you aree using a sniper rifle as well.\n\nThird issue, I have yet to encounter any weapons in loot. This may have been fixed in a recent update that is downloading as I type this.\n\nFourth issue, the second squad upgrade is either bugged or mislabeled. Visuaally they receive an upgrade as well as some units in the squad recive better weapons but their health, total damage, and other stats do not improve.\n\nBeyond that this game is fun, I don't want to get myself to hyped over this game in case it gets abandoned but I really hope this game doesnt end up getting nuked by an update or become broken.\n", "timestamp_created": 1518134648, "timestamp_updated": 1518134648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39941560": {"recommendationid": "39941560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107566795", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1521757312}, "language": "english", "review": "Never review games this early but this is just outstanding, devs are 2nd to none, what a game! and its only early access!!", "timestamp_created": 1518132044, "timestamp_updated": 1518132044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39941517": {"recommendationid": "39941517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077551153", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1520867254}, "language": "english", "review": "Like many other reviews have stated, this game is like M&B and Arma/Squad had a child.\nThis game is fun if you enjoyed Mount and Blade.

The core elements are there, and if they manage to fix up the game right I will be turning this negative into a positive. There is a ton of potential here and I hope to see the devs succeed at their vision for this game.\n\nHowever in its current state I cannot recomend you buy it yet, unless you just want to support the project finincially. There are alot of problems, serious missing components to features. Here are a few examples:\n\nYou spawn with just a pistol and a few magazines, and the cheapest rifles from shops cost 5-10k money which will take you very long to get. You fight battles with friendly and enemy soldiers who are all armed with rifles, and you cannot fight properly with a pistol. You cannot loot guns from friendly or enemy bodies so you are stuck with it. You run out of ammo incredibly quickly with just a couple of pistol magazines, and you cannot loot ammo from bodies either. So in every single battle, you run out of ammo spraying with your pistol at targets 50 yards away, and then you have to just sit and wait hoping that your ai team will win the fight. It totally ruins the fun of the battles. Even if you manage to get enough money to buy a rifle (which I have not yet despite winning many battles, because I have to spend all the looted money on troop upkeep) you will still not be able to loot ammo from bodies in battle and will have to conserve your ammo very carefully.\n\nThere are other smaller bugs/missing items that are less impactful, but also not forgivable. For example there is a leveling system like M&B with skill points that you assign into various talents, but the character HUD does not show you how many points you actually have to spend. You have to just put points in talents untill you run out, not knowing how many you even have to spend. Its a completely ridicoulous thing to not have put in the game, especially because it would take a very small amount of work.

level enemy\" to grind your XP so u become stronger like RPG game also your main objective is to capture all citys so you can become the strongest faction, Just like RPG game. I always have a dream of FPS RTS PRG game combine into one and this just capture what i wanted. Also Dev keep updating the game faster than some AAA company....\n\nGameplay:\n-On gameplay It more like ARMA style which is large map, no idea where enemy are until mark (ai did it for you) \n\n-You can join your troop to fight with them tho your troop aim not the best but they get job done\n\n-Bullet drop at distance\n\n-Sure the voice of your soldier sound like from indie game out there but I really hope to see it get fix in future. Dev If you can, Make those guy speak in Russia it sound better than indie military voice \n\n-Inventory system. Sure u see enemy using rifle but you get their crappy weapon instead or few loot to sell. I do believe it depend on enemy level just like RPG game which will reward you more and better loot. Also inventory screen just like ARMA but less confusetion (sorry I dont play ARMA alot)\n\n-Level up! do i need to explain how many skills in this game? aim better, doing more damage, can deploy more squad in battle, get more loot, heal better with first aid, etc...\n\n-Your City uhhh... Don't know yet since I dont get a chance to attack the city yet(still grind XP) but i visit another faction city. There is shop u can sell or buy weapons, sell loot, heal your troop and collect tax (need to take the city tho)\n\nSo far no bugs have been found and I really enjoy every minute of the game. Worth getting it? Probably!\n\n(Sorry for my not knowing RPG game style it because I am more of RTS and FPS player than JRPG or RPG genres)\n\nThings i want to dev to add\n- Tank and light tank or light vehicle (light vehicle can be destory by small arms)\n- Chopper\n- Artillery support (if u have artillery tank in your squad or your city being attack and u have artillery tank in there)\n- Air support\n- Larger map (more likely to add in)\n- Change soldier voices to russia (my opioin)\n- New Ui this old one look crappy and i believe it is placeholder", "timestamp_created": 1518094557, "timestamp_updated": 1518161363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39929181": {"recommendationid": "39929181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027615822", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519648738}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e0c\u671b\u505a\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c1070\u86ee\u5361\u7684\uff0c\u53e6\u5916ar\u7684acog\u955c\u5f88\u53cd\u4eba\u7c7b", "timestamp_created": 1518094118, "timestamp_updated": 1518094118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39929113": {"recommendationid": "39929113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146807570", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1521029536}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519,\u6f5c\u529b\u5f88\u5927,\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u65b0\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u5185\u5bb9..\u671f\u5f85\u4e2d\u6587\u7248!", "timestamp_created": 1518093889, "timestamp_updated": 1518093889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39929111": {"recommendationid": "39929111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006181094", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519925323}, "language": "english", "review": "i first sore this game by chance on youtube, and checked out some of the lets play before buying it and i was impressed, im not much of a ffp player, but the balance is perfect and also you dont have to be a sniper to do well. i have played about 6 hours so far and only killed one person, i mainly use the ffps as a way of scouting out the enermy as you can see them sooner than on the map,  so if like me your not keen on ffps the strategy element of this game is more than werth the 10 or so pound so but this game. but i would advice that you low your graphic spect as when you get to 5 squads in the fiield it get laggy and make it harder to give orders. but lets not for get that this is still an earliy access game.", "timestamp_created": 1518093876, "timestamp_updated": 1518093876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39929051": {"recommendationid": "39929051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347370703", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1520680098}, "language": "schinese", "review": "WE NEED CHINESE!!", "timestamp_created": 1518093654, "timestamp_updated": 1518093654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39929036": {"recommendationid": "39929036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072726891", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520461242}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game concept I hope this game sells well and blows up like it should. \n\n***This game is incredibly still alpha***\n-Bugs are everywhere but the gameplay from what I played works and the main issue for me is the menues.

Once that is fixed, this will no doubt become a positive review.\n\nEDIT 2: Changed to a positive. While some bugs still remain, the changes that have been implemented so far are fantastic improvements, and it looks set that this game will continue to improve.\n\nTL;DR: At the minute, it's too frustrating to recommend, but aside from that it seems as though it's going to turn out to be a great game. I'll start with the negatives, if you can see past those, then by all means go ahead and support the devs.\n\nNegatives\n\n-Bugs, specifally the following: Ultrawide monitors aren't yet supported, which is fine - but if you alt-tab out of the game it will bump you into ultrawide resolution. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if the UI didn't render outside your resolution and make quitting a battle impossible (resulting in you having to Alt + F4 and lose your progress).

The Mount and Blade comparisons are fair, the game plays and feels quite similar and honestly screams potential; it can certaily become a super enjoyable sandbox strat/shooter version of M&B on an engine that fits it.  \n\nRight now, the parts you can access are fun, but limited. Few towns/factions, and a small map limit total gametime, but more than that the battles all feel the same. Where a battle happens doesnt feel like it changes much. Everything is long ranged potshotting - even to take towns. As it stands, I can think of no conceivable reason why you would ever own a shotgun. \n\nAll that said, the game does what it already does extremely well. The gun fights are great, even if you can't modify weapons and start with a pistol (would be cool, if it were possible to use in current meta). The game doesn't make building up a chore, and you'll find you hit the ceiling before you tire of it. \n\nUnderstand what you're getting.

ESPECIALLY WHEN DEFENDING YOUR TOWNS. out of the 3 defenses ive played my spawn was right in front of the enemy advance. \n\n3. All other nations other than Bandits will absolutely obliterate you. They can play with their entire force even though you are limitted on yours based on your skill level of leadership. \n\n4. Most other armies are veteran levels with stars to establish their dominance. My armies can only seem to advance to new improved classes. But they can not become veteran squads with stars at all.\n\n5. I wish there was an option for cover when in a fire fight. Bullets ALWAYS seem to find a way to hit me no matter where or what im behind.\n\n6. When using garrisoned troops i can only deploy one squad before it says too many squads to be deployed. Basically if you deploy one garrisoned army it counts as the entirety of the garrison and you can not deploy any more soldiers.\n\nNow it is a fun game and definitely kept me entertained. Im sure the Dev's are working on some great things and its in very early stages. My best recommendation is allow the entirety of your rucruited forces to be deployed in any given battle.

You can build things and unlike M&B it doesn't take a month to build. You just have to have the cash.\n\nMorale is maintained through manual payments which is nice.\n\nCombat gets annoying rapidly. There's a timer but I can't discern what purpose it serves and you can spend 10 minutes looking for the last enemy. Right now you have to \u201cfind the enemy location\u201d and while it adds some challenge to your starting strategy it doesn\u2019t play out well.\n\nAnyway not too detailed a review but I will say that my initial reaction to this game is the same one that I had when I first played Rust and that that there is a lot of potential here.

It is such a great idea for a game I wish I had thought of it.\n\nHaving that capability of moving troops anywhere you want and how agressive you want them to move is an amazing feature. Only thing I would say, which i'm pretty sure that they are going to add later on, is add different types of formations of troops and to also allow for troop movements to be more detailed. Allow the player to move the troops into cover. I would say start off with making a present position they would take up if using a building as cover in or outside of it. From there broaden movement and cover styles. \n\nBeing able to be on the ground is awesome and being able to fight besides your troops is a great idea. Just like any other shooter, all I can say is add more weapons and tweak the weapons more. Tweak the sights as well, mostly just being able to add certain sights and attachments to your rifle to make it your own. Also with weapons for troops, I would say be able to purchase in bulk different weapons for your troops.

When a enemy crosses a open field and it takes multiple squads forever to wipe them out because they hit everything but the squad in the open but again this is a early development game so it's not like these things won't exist. \n\nOverall it's a pretty good game with a lot of potential if they design it right. It's extremely simular to Mount & Blade but at the same time not really competing with it because of the FPS element. Currently well worth what I paid for it but hopefully all those bugs will get worked out and a lot more features will be available to make it a game worth more than what they ask you to pay for it.\n\nI am also looking forward to the game getting released on steam workshop to let the modding community go ham on the game like they did with Mount & Blade to import aspects the development missed and for other mods that would play so well in this game like Star Wars which would work on so many levels including the shitty AI aim.

It is slow and sorta brutal starting off until you grasp what you're getting into. This isn't a battle royale game or COD.

Ijust have some issues that i hope you devs and others who read this would agree with.\n\n1. balance in P V E is a bit off,  you start out with no controlled town while the factions you fight start out with a town and multiple armies (idk if i just cant figure it out but i dont see how to build other armies).\n\n2. if youre going to make my skills/attributes determine how many soldiers i can recruit/command (which i really dont agree with that feature) the AI definetly shouldnt start out with so many soldiers (ex: the main faction you fight started with 99 dudes defending their base and like 5 different armies with 25-40 soldiers).\n\n3.  stuff costs way too much,between replenishing my troops and paying rewards to increase morale( i dont agree with that feature, also my dudes sometimes lose moral even when i win the battle) and recruting more for my army i dont see how im able to save up enough to buy weapons/gear for myself. I thought that maybe once i took a settlement id get way more funds but i only get 325 per day (day cycles last to long since i depend on taxes).\n\n4. I dont really see the benefits in having settlements, i think that feature needs to be fleshed out more like what does more security and prosperity provide me? why should i spend money on construction?  idk maybe thats part of the game that im not playing right.\n\n5. a mini map (kinda like the total war map) in first person would be much apprieciated, when the battles get big im unable to enjoy your awsome 1st person feature because i cant view my troops  or the enemy locations that pop up or even see where im going.\n\n6. also im assuming the red circle in the deployment phase is suspected enemy locations but sometimes ill move my dudes towardes it and the enemy will be like right behind me or off to the side far away from the red circle.\n\n7. there seems to be no advantage given when im defending either in a open battle or a siege, if im the one defending we should be givin the oppurtunity to set our defense within our deployment zone just like the AI does (set ambushes, emplace weapon systems, put my guys in buildings, maybe even a feature where they dig fox holes or smething).\n\n8. vehicles would be a cool feature.\n\n9. smoke grenades would be nice.\n\n\n10. finally some kind of fire support feature (mortor team, artillery, or air assets)\n\n\nagain i love what you guys are doing i hope you and whoever else reads this agrees with my points.", "timestamp_created": 1518021964, "timestamp_updated": 1518021964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39911810": {"recommendationid": "39911810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134622777", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "last_played": 1520960034}, "language": "english", "review": "Already awesome in it's early stages.

The mix of tactical real time strategy and first person shooter works extremely well together, in my opinion. You start out with a pistol and some soldiers, and then fight looters and bandits until you get better gear and soldiers, and then fight more powerful enemies and so it goes. A lot like in Mount and Blade. \n\nThe enemy AI is a lot more intelligent than I had expected. I've seen them hold their fire and attempt to move around my forces, staying out of sight so as to flank me. The AI is also extemely responsive, rushing for cover or falling to the ground the moment they get shot at.\n\nHowever, the game has very little content in it right now, and after my playthrough I can't find much else to do as of right now. The devs have release updates every single day so far, and adress issues and bugs the community encounter. \nThe game is very enjoyable, even in it's current state, and I would definitely recommend picking it up in order to support the devs, so they can make it excellent.\n\nAnd another important note, as of right now atleast, the system requirements are false. You definitely do not need an i7 4790K with 16gb of ram and a 970 to play on ultra.. I use an i5 4460, 8gb of ram, and a 1050 ti and play on the highest settings with no problems at all.\n\n(Side note : How awesome will this game be when the game is fully released and there are mods??

cities;regroup to have a deal,for example.\n\n-I have to say the battleground is for50 vs 50,that's big enough for a  battle legend,.but may not apropriate for just two teams.So , I mean when we five

a chance to enter in an empirer, to fight for their strong ambition?or just be a bandit ,to loot every trade group,and rob the refugees of their remaining bread?even have several general to

Basically this is a Mount & Blade : Warband mod with fully reworked combat, and with modern firearms. Surprisingly it works, and feels like an obvious genre, now that someone thought of it. Already a great early access title, with fantastic potential.\n\nThis feels right, and hopefully gets done right. It's amazingly playable even at this stage (v0.105). The campaign map mode is lifted straight from Mount & Blade: Warband, many menus and functions are exactly the same. But hey, I love Warband, and the familiarity helped me get right into the game.

This game is a wonderful surprise. It emulates Mount and Blade in modern times with Arma elements very well.\n\nThe game is obviously in early access. There are bugs, it's not feature complete, the performance isnt great, UI is pretty bad. But despite all those things, it already feels like it has a very solid foundation.

I have changed my review as they are showing their promises to the supporters. If you have any interest in this game buy it, updates are coming out like wildfire and the game is at a good place even for right now.\n\nPrevious review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGame needs a lot of work done, right now it is skin and bones. As everyone else has said the game has limitless potential, but right now it is very basic. \n\nSunk around five hours thus far, and it has been a rollercoaster so far. Obviously most people buying this game are taking it as it is, a newly released game with the need of support from players. It being new and in need of support does not justify the game being released in the current state. Although they have been spitting out updates like rapid fire, I still feel the game should have had more work done before being released to the public. \n\nThe glaring flaws, are, well, glaring. The audio is the first thing that comes to mind, it is just terrible, nothing is balanced correctly. Gun shots from a distance sound as if they are coming from a different planet, and most of the time it is difficult in telling where shots are coming from. Not even mentioning the footsteps, I have no idea what is up with that. Can also be updated, the audio feels outdated. Audio needs to be fixed immediately, it breaks immersion and makes the game feel poor.\n\nUI could be updated, just makes the game feel poor. Not much else to be said here.\n\nI read what the devs had to say about the early access and one thing that stuck to me is the comment about the AI. \"...advanced AI and territory conquest/defend/management are all in there but need further polish.\" The game is far from advanced AI, the AI, to my suprise is decent, enemies committed to basic tactics such as flanks and evasive maneuvers. Beyond that the AI is really basic, when commanding troops you have basic commands, and when your troops engage in combat they just stop and open fire. I also have no idea why there is a cease fire command, no situation would benefit from this. Anyways, friendly AI just shoot at enemies and enemies use basic tactics, to call it advanced is a bit of a stretch. \n\nGame just feels really old, for some reason I feel like I am playing a game made 10 years ago, it may just be me getting the Arma 2 vibe but it feels old. No idea why this is but I do not feel like I am playing a game made in 2018.\n\nBattlegrounds are really redundant, it is as if I was playing in the same battleground over and over, granted I have not explored the map too much, I still feel like I am playing the same map over and over. Anything different would help, a couple buildings here or there, but besides that you only see a difference when attacking a town. I fear for this one as it may be hard to fix due to where the game takes place in, but it still should have plenty of variety.\n\nEverything outside of combat is lackluster, trading, inventory/equipment, and everything else has little to no purpose. Towns are pointless besides capturing one, making relations is also pointless, everything just has no belonging. I can't put my tongue on it but it all feels empty.\n\nMy final rant is on the game just not making sense early on. You start with two squads fully loaded with automatic and semi-auto rifles. And you start with a Makarov. It is almost like hell to fight with that thing considering you are fighting from a distance 80% of the time. Makes no sense that you kill enemies with rifles and small arms and you cannot pick them up or do anything with them. It is a mess trying to buy a weapon. I can buy a squad of five vets two times over for the price of a rifle. And for higher grade rifles such as snipers and such, I can but ten vet squads for the price of it. It just does not make sense to me, if I am buying a rifle it should cost a fraction of what a squad of highly trained soldiers for hire should be, not the other way around. \n\nThe game in the current state does not justify a buy for those looking for a great game currently. I am a huge fan of M&B so I will support this game but I still stand by my statement that this game should have been released much later even if it was for support. \n\nThe plus that the game has going for it is that it is fun. I enjoyed playing, the reason I do not reccomend is that somebody who stumbles across this game and is not a M&B fan will not enjoy the game. Also it has way too many flaws to even have a public release which is also why I do not reccomend it.\n\nAs for whether you will get your money's worth. It will definitely pass. I can feel myself sinking 50+ hours into the game before it really gets going and probably 200+ at full release.

Currently there is around 6-15 hours of standard gameplay, more if you are a hardcore player and aren't put off by its current lack of features, which are as follows:\n\nPros:\n    -Not a whole lot of different items to loot\n    -Difficult in the beginning, but good strategy triumphs easily enough.\n    -No weapon customization or attachments (Yet, this is a planned feature.)\n    -Not much in the way of interaction with owned settlements\n    -Fairly slow character progression (Personal opinion. Not meant to be a run-and-gun game.)\n    -Not a lot of options in terms of squad variety.\n\nNow, most of this will probably be fixed or addressed to some degree in the future, this is just a review as of Patch V0.105. What this game does offer, on the other hand, is simply down right impressive for its current stage:\n\nCons:\n    -Seemless switching between FPS and RTS modes. (Seriously, you can switch back and forth all you like.)\n    -Decent enough graphics running on the Unity Engine.\n    -Command and upgrade multiple squads, giving exact orders of where to go and how to get there.\n    -Settlement seiges, including defenses and captures.\n    -Good variety of weapon classes to suit play styles. (If somewhat lacking in actual different weapons.)\n    -Settlement customization, tax collecting\n    -Barebones diplomacy system including demanding tributes, paying tributes and opting for truces.\n    -Barebones mission system with missions and side mission planned in the future.\n    -Slight RPG focus with character customization, i.e armor slots, weapon slots, equipments slots etc and a fairly fleshed \n     out skill and upgrade system.\n\nOverall, I would say buy the game and enjoy it for a few hours. Maybe you will like it enough to put in 10+ hours, maybe not. Either way, the devs have an outstanding track record for updates, releasing a patch almost daily.

There has been an update everyday since the launch of early access. Great communication in the Steam threads! You just don't see that very much. Thank you for your hard work!\n\nHaving a blast with this game so far! I have a ton of time in Mount & Blade and can appreciate the similarities. The game is very playable. Easily 50+ hours of content right from the get go. The start can be a bit punishing. I think a low level rifle instead of a pistol would be great. Gun play is fun, of course it can always improve. Sniper rifle is the way to go, as close combat with a shotgun just isn't viable in the current state of the game. The squad setup is easy to manage. Once you take your first town, there are actually upgrades! You can up your security and prosperity. \n\nI can't wait to see where this goes! Highly recommend this one if you enjoy M&B.

Its very unpolished and i do see the devs listening and putting out patches like clock work i honestly just dont see enough in game for it to even be in EA never the less a paid EA coulda made the game free for a week let ppl test it and have 10x the feedback. Would love to put more time in this game it honestly makes me want to inject some black tar heroin mid fight just to numb the pain i feel from the hot mess of a battlefield this game becomes.

make certain factions have certain formations they can rotate through in how they engage you in battle, same with bandits, they would randomly pick one type of formation/strategy and fight you that way; \n\nAlso I think the map should be larger with more factions, and perhaps I recommend the factions to have a more so Civilization-like leader to them like in those Civ guys where he pops up in

I can't fight as much as I want because of the commanding menu. I have to command my troops in order to fight the enemy in a better position all the time. So that makes me unable to fight most of the battles. Weapon animations should be better as well. Rifles are good enough to make you feel you are in a real combat but as this is a game its heartbreaking when your troops fight them and you cant as you cant see the enemy. Therefore developers can add binoculars for the rifles as their accessories/attachments as it is in Arma. Sniper rifles are good but the feel of using them is not comparable to Arma or any other shooting game. I didn't like the zooming, it could be better if you ask me, more realistic I mean. Other than that I like the idea behind the game, its entartaining, very good game to kill some time. It's a combination of Warband/Arma/Total War. \nThinking it's only in early access, developers will work on it and it will become a better game. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKomuta men\u00fcs\u00fc ve silah animasyonlar\u0131 geli\u015ftirilirse daha g\u00fczel bir oyun olabilir.

The mechanics are there, you can play a game and enjoy it as of now. Of course, the polish isn't there. Sounds are a bit jarring, graphics leave much to be desired. AI is pretty bad. Weapon and equipment is fairly basic in all honesty.\n\nHowever, the devs seem involved. They seem like they've got a decent plan togeather. I'm excited for where this game could go.

For example, compass which enable a boost to travel speed around the map,  Binoculars to help spot the enemy on the battlefield and to tag them so your troops can concetrate fire and spot threats quicker.  Tools and building materials so you can construct a base where you could train, recruit and deploy trrops from as long as you have the right designated skill to do so.  Multiplayer where you could do skirmishes against each other or perhaps a grand campaign!\n\nSo there is lots of opputunities for this to be a great game where the life expectancy of the game is huge.

I cannot recommend this game in this current state, but maybe a little bit down the line it will improve.\n\n~~Full Review~~\nFreeman: Guerrilla Warfare has all of the potentially great game in the future with a lot of tweaking, but right now this is kind of a huge dumpster fire. You load up the game, you start with two different squads with you as the leader. Everything seems okay. You see a couple of looters, and you go to attack them. Right off the bat the problems start. The sound mixing in this game sound like it was done by someone who was deaf. Footsteps are so loud that I genuinely confused them for gunshots at some points. And that isn't even talking about the ear rape danger music you experience when you get into a gunfight. I put that down to like 20% and it was still way too loud. I played the majority of it with the music at 2% because my ear's just couldn't take it.\n\nNow let's talk about balanced gameplay. Everyone else gets to start off with Assault Rifles and Submachine guns. But what do you get to start out with? A dinky little pistol. Now the only way to gain experience to level up is by killing enemies. Well you have an extremely short range weapon to kill guys at much farther range. Why do the weakest enemies in the game get pretty decent firearms, What are you supposed to do in that situation. You could let your troops do all the work, but this game main pulling point is putting you into the combat. So you move in closer to the enemies and what happens? You get completely mowed down because of course you do. So you die, almost instantly, great start right? These are the weakest enemies in the entire game, and there is nothing you can do about it to survive their onslaught.\n\nNow that you die, you kill X amount of bandits, but any loot they would have had just disappears from existence. The way loot is determined is by the last remaining guys in the most recent fight, so if you kill all but one of their guys(which did happen to me) you die, leave combat and have to re-enter, but when you kill this guy the loot is calculated based on just one enemy, instead of the starting total. So this would make it even harder to make money and break even. This is something from Mount and Blade, but the difficulty in this is multiplied by so much that the penalty from losing the reward is much more game crippling.\n\nSo fast forward to beating my first bandits. I got a pitiful reward that put me out for about $300 after healing and upgrading everyone back to where I started. Honestly, at this point, I don't even want to try and get the other cool weapons. For a game that copied so much from Mount and Blade it certainly didn't take many of it's good point. \n\n~~Suggestions to improve the game~~\n\nAbility to pick up enemy weapons after they die would be a big one. It would almost completely circumvent the problem if you can use good weapons during the early game starting out. \n\nProper audio mixing is the other really big one to me. It is unacceptable to make your game actively hurt player's ears at basic and even below basic settings.\n\nMaking a more basic enemy bandit, that uses things like pistols would also help so I don't have to worry about getting so one-sidedly destroyed and can help bridge the gap to more dangerous enemies.\n", "timestamp_created": 1517922074, "timestamp_updated": 1517922074, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423077", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39886826": {"recommendationid": "39886826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401394040", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "last_played": 1521091095}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6230\u6597\u597d\u50cf\u7121\u610f\u4e2d\u6309\u5230\u4e86END\u9375 \u7136\u540e\u795e\u5947\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u767c\u751f\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1517922033, "timestamp_updated": 1517922033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39886769": {"recommendationid": "39886769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084664414", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520977138}, "language": "english", "review": "This has the potential for an awesome game. The comparisons between M&B and Arma are pretty accurrate. But there are other reviews that go into the similarities better than I. So I'll just jump into suggestions in no particular order for the devs:\n\n- Accessible inventories: Make the equipment of the soldiers you kill (and friendlies that die) accessible. If you run out of ammo you should be able to snag a gun off the ground. To balance this, just make guns less expensive.\n- Add vehicles:* To fill the void of progression with guns less expensive, add Just like M&B, except instead of horses you have BMPs and Humvees and Apaches. Have a realistic use for RPGs.\n- AI Battles: Other nations declare war. They fight. You can  help or avoid conflict.\n- AI Aggression: Currently AI do not attack you even if you walk right by them and they have far more troops\n- Expensive Ammo: Make the ammo a little more expensive to balance with the lowering of gun prices. Right now the only reason you need to conserve ammo is inventory space and how scarce it is in towns. It costs nothing.\n- Ability to Drag Mouse and Select: Self explanatory - we really need to be able to select multiple squads in a hurry. Or multiple squads at all. \n\n\nI know it's early access these are just some of the things that I think would really improve the game. The first one is probably the biggest priority. Right now the scaling of the game revolves around weapons. You start with a pistol. Okay that's cool, but once you kill a jeshnup with that pistol you can snag his AK and ammo.

You have your own faction/band in which you can recruit soldiers, upgrade them, capture towns, kill bandits and get all the loot.\n\nIt also feels like ArmA in a sense because the gunplay is believable enough to pass as a realistic game, for starters there's bullet drop and velocity in place. You also get to play it in a simplistic RTS fashion, issue commands like fire at will, follow me, and proceed to waypoints, reminds me of all those ArmA Sandbox Warfare mods that I used to play.\n\nThe game is currently barebones at the moment, it's advisable to wait for more updates before trying to actually enjoy the game, but I do recommend it now, why? to support the Devs. It gives life to the game, allows for more updates to push through and eventually, the release of the game.. It's very hard to develop a game especially one that's ambitious as this and the Developers need all the early support they can get if they are to succeed. who wouldn't want to see a fully fleshed out and refined realistic and modern Mount and Blade game? plus you get it at a cheaper price for supporting it early, Nothing is currently in the market that is even close to this so there are no alternatives to it.\n\nWhile the game is indeed barebones, it has all the necessary foundations in place. The gunplay mechanics are well made, the Graphics are also visually nice, and it's quite optimized as well. I didn't experience any FPS drops or any other weird performance issues, aside from the fact that I was having a slight input delay and slightly less frame rates that my rig is used to in games.\n\nThe world map is nicely setup, towns are in place, you can interact with it: attack, trade, or recruit soldiers, you can see other armies and bands on the map, although they cannot fight each other atm. The whole system is already in place, they just need to add more stuff into it: vehicles, more factions, more towns, more options for interactions with the towns and factions, more soldiers, named companions/enemy warlords with different personalities, missions and quests, NPC friendly armies, more commands to issue in Battle, more weapons, and quality of life improvements such as: the ability to pan the map using the right click, or to see enemy icons while in battle and not only on the Strategy map, UI improvements, etc.\n\nThe game is already WIDE but currently shallow, which is not a problem as you could always fill it up to however deep you want. that's what early access is for. Impressive for a one week old early access game on Steam.

I lucked out and was 1 of 50 people that got lucky and won the game for free simply just by entering my email on the website.\n\nThis game is genuinly amazing for an early access game. It was a well polished and playable game from the day it was released 4 days ago on steam and has already had 4 patches that have significantly improved my experience since i started playing. The Devs are active on the discord and pretty much anywhere you would think you could get ahold of them.\n\nPros\n-Pretty good gun play especially beeing this early, only really needs minor tweaks\n-Lead squads of units in large scale combat against your enemies simulatiously as the leader and a warrior\n-Decent amount of weaponry on release, ranging from M4,Ak47,Ak12,240ish MMG,1911,glock,pump shotty,semi shotty, auto shotty, Rpk74,Vss,Rpg,357 mag,Mp5, and many more\n-Level up your self improving your different skills aswell as level up your squads improving their gear and weapons(ie lvl 3 militia recieve 40mm UBGLs)\n-An assortment of gear to build a loadout with, change everything from goggles to body armor and gloves, aswell as load your inventory with Mags, grenades, Med kits, and rockets. You have 10 slots on your belt i believe so you need to choose wisely what you take into the fight. If you run out of ammo you may find yourself running back to your supply crate to grab more mags, if you get messed up and run out of medkits you may not even make it back to your supply box alive to grab meds.\n-You have to manage your ammo, you must buy every mag you shoot. If you dont have money for magazines you dont have bullets to shoot. (CON imo) Sadely you dont have to worry about your army yet, they appear to have infinite ammo atm aswell as enemy\n-Units have a start to realistic tactical behavior, they try taking cover and if there is none will go prone. They seam to use fire and movement tho not perfectly atm, which is a military term for 1 guy prone shooting while 1 guy charges and goes prone and switches roles in order to gain ground.\n-Many other things that i could go about for awhile\n\nCons\n-Sometimes units do stupid thing involving animations and path finding like aiming at the sky when reloading or laying behind a tree shooting at it trying to shoot the enemy\n-Really basic trading system atm\n-Really basic settlement management system atm, basically there are 8 buildings at every settlement that can all be built at the same time no need to make tough choices other then deciding wether to spend the $ or not\n-Small map atm\n-Auto battle is retarded. if you die in a fight with 60 vs 40 and have to auto resolve it you will lose horribly so dont die be smart take cover\n-If you use cover properly you can rambo small armies, i can go into a 60 vs 60 fight and ill kill 40 of the 60 just from useing cover properly. sadely makes the game alil easy at times if your smart, tho i deffinetly still have challenges ive lost entire armies. If you dont use cover and run out in the open in line of sight of a none noob enemy squad you boutta get lit fam\n-There is probably some more stuff i could put here but it doesnt matter really because id say the Pros out weigh the F out of the Cons\n\nAll in all like every person before me has said Arma+Mount&Blade=Freeman.

From day one, the game was in a playable state with a fair amount of content to keep me interested - something many Early Access games lack upon release. A diamond in the rough of Early Access games, if you will.\n[h1]Strong Community-Developer Relationship[/h1]\nIn addition to a strong EA release, Freeman has a strong community-developer relationship right off the bat, something that is crucial to the success of any game. The developers are very active in answering questions and are actively working on implementing suggestions made by the community, both on the Steam Community Hub and on their public Discord server. \n[h1]Familiar but Innovative[/h1]\nI think it goes without saying that most developers struggle with originality. Although Freeman is similar to the Mount & Blade series in many ways, the developers found a way to build upon that likeness and create something of their own. The combat is similar to that of familiar military shooters, such as Insurgency or, to a lesser extent, ArmA. The added real time strategy element makes for an interesting spin on that familiarity, adding an entirely different gameplay element to think about and utilize while playing. These two key gameplay features, combined with the core RPG elements of Mount & Blade, make for a familiar, but innovative and exciting game. \n[h1]Tl;DR[/h1]\n[b]A must have for fans of military shooters.[/b]\nTo recap:\n[list] [*]Early Access provides an actual playable game from day one\n[*]Developers are very involved with the community and actively implement community suggestions\n[*]Gameplay is familiar enough to pick up and play for almost any player, but the developers' innovations make this a fresh entry into the military shooter genre [/list]", "timestamp_created": 1517869078, "timestamp_updated": 1517869078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496503", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39875116": {"recommendationid": "39875116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416920650", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 767, "last_played": 1521378569}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u044b\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0434 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f,\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u043e ,\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f .\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u0432 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b. \u0421\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u043e M&B ? \u0427\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f.\u0420\u0415\u041a\u041e\u041c\u0415\u041d\u0414\u0423\u042e! \np.s \u0416\u0434\u0451\u043c \u0420\u0443-\u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a", "timestamp_created": 1517866409, "timestamp_updated": 1517866409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39875029": {"recommendationid": "39875029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043502758", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517865698}, "language": "english", "review": "well what to say.

my first on steam but I had to for this game.\n\nThis is a really, really good early access launch. Pros/Cons\n\nPros\n- FPS with RPG, the idea of it being guerrilla warfare you are fighting is excellent. You are not starting off with a standing army of thousands with combined arms and a massive checkbook to spend\n\n- The FPS fights are interesting with the allowance to command troops in battle with the map\n\n- Firearms are pretty decent, it takes skill and patience to drop someone at a distance Muzzle flash keeps you from spraying and praying. Accuracy deminishes proper at long distance shots for small arms and long barrel rifles\n\n- The AI on the country map seem pretty solid. They will attack you if they sense they can defeat you\n\n-Controls, Information and directions on how to play are well thought out and easy\n\nCons/well not really since it is early acess\n\n-No compass, sometimes hard to orientate yourself in combat\n\n-AI seems to be laser accurate at times\n\n-FPS maps for fighting outside the town are all the same style of foilage and terrain\n\n-No vehicles, some will be useful and make sense. I'm not talking a Abrams but some SUV's and Technicals would be fine\n\n-No starting village of your own, you will need to grind a bit fighting soft enemies to make enough to build a army ready to fight for a city\n\n-No quests yet\n\n-Not sure how my army resupplies after a fight\n\nI could go on and on for both pro and con but nobody will read it I'd bet.

There are some negitives however but hopefully they will soon be fixed its early access afterall. \n\nIf I had to reccomend this game to somebody I would tell them this;\n\nWhats good about it? \n-well lets start with the developers, I just recently joined their discord and what I found surprised me there is actually a pretty cool small community of people working togther to help improve this game I even voiced some of my own suggestions which the devs then replied and asked me some questions about it like for example \"SO you mean like that mechanic from in this game?\" Really liking the dev team and I'm pretty confident they won't let the community down.\n\n-The gunplay in this game is also really enjoyable to different weapons having different spray patterns to recoil and overall movement (running animations etc) this game feels good to play. \n\n-The game feels just like mount and blade in the world map portion of the game, which in my opinion is a good thing.\n\n- This game is a great mix of the games Arma and top down stratagy which is very addictive you're always wanting the next best gun or next squad there is already so much to do in the game in its current state which makes me happy knowing it will only get better over time. \n\nCons\n\n-As it is right now the game is rough and there are a number of bugs that need fixing (Like when your troups all die

You level up your character with a good number of different skills some allowing you to bring in more troops to the battle. You also have the ability to level up your troops into different classes as well. \n\nThe gunplay mechanics in this game are good, no hitscan here...it's projectile based bullet drop and they did a wonderful job on it.  That's one of the goodies about this gem is having to lead off and elevate your shots from a distance to hit your target. They ai seemed to counter alot of my moves as well on the battlefield, they seem to react very well to your actions. They seem to be flanking me, and falling back and also repositioning.  \n\nIf you don't mind supporting early access games and can handle bugs and are a fan of this type of play style I highly recommend supporting this game.

Drew $1000 cash from bank account and depart immediately. Enrico's not so tough looking bald milita helping me after my arrival. I know these guys all are noobs!!! How could i retake the whole country with these ridiculous 10 armies. So i decide to go nearest friendly town and find a mercenary agency and i look on the mercenaries mug found that more profesional affordable guys on the list so i took them on the squad for 800 bucks.\n\nWell now i have 10 balds guys, 5 look strong balaclavas guys and $200 left. Thinking how i can pay them for tommorrow, i decide to work for money.  Theres a guys in the town told me that they will buy a canteen of water with high price. So with my 15 armies, i moving out from town to find group of small bandits to rob what they rob from others. After a few walking, i saw a large group armored bandits around 30, i thought they will overwhelm my armies and i ran away.\n\nAfter walking and spending time around halfday, i found a group of around 15 looters. They look not tough, same with my bald armies. So i decide to attack them. I told my armies to put our supply box on the floor and prepare for everything but damn why im the only one holding a makarov gun!! Even my baldies group holding an sks each and they wont lend to me. Oh nevermind, i decide to play as general commander!!! Open my map, order them to make formation and move forward to hunt and rob the bad guys!!! \n\nWhen we move forward, theres one guy name chuck. He wont come with us, instead just standing on the rock. I ask him why he wont come, this weird chuck said \" sorry boss, i cant move. theres invicible wall around the rock so i couldnt get out!\". Wth! Screw you, i still have my 14 mans to fight without you chuck. So after 1 minutes walking, larry the guys with balaclavas shout he saw the enemies lurking around and suddenly calm situation become intense. Loud gunshot, shout everywhere, bullet ricochet hit the trees and ground. I saw a group of enemies running, so i shot them with my makarov!! After spending entirely magazine and none of the bullets hit the enemies, so i relied on larry and jim squad to fight the rest while i pretend to be a commanding officer!\n\n\"Jim!!, go and try to flank the enemies from right!!!\", but jim still busy shooting the enemies. So i shout to them \"Charge jim!! charge!\" and Jim go right away running and storming into the enemies position. Larry maintain the position and suppressing the enemies, and chuck squad helping larry too. I wont joining them!! Coward, but at least im better than chuck!! Its Because my brand new boots, my foot steps sound louder than gunshot!! I wont go forward!! Enemies will knew my position from my footsteps sound!\n\nAfter around 3 minutes, the fights over! No casualties and all enemies wiped out. Hmm not bad! Jim,squad handle the situation very effective! My $800 investment worthed! So after the battle, i told my armies to search enemy corpses to find loot. We dont find water canteen, but we found some 9mm ammo for my makarov to reload, junk, rocket and food!! After came back to town, i sold everything that i cant use, and now i have around $2000. Wow. 20x killing these bad guys will made me rich!! And i decided to give chuck's squad a reward and buying upgrade equipment for them for $120, they got an AK, balaclava and body armor, and even chuck who stayed behind got promotion too, im nice right? $120, 5 AK. This damn weapon shop town is racist, they sold me AK for $4000!!! Argh. got to stay with makarov for a while.\n\nAfter my first experienced, this game is definetely mount and blade with gun and grenade. Its still early access, has lot of bug and missing features.

I could only get 25 max FPS and I meet the min requirments. This is an issue that must be addressed. The game should not be as demanding as it is on hardware.\n\nThe lighting is to bright, it makes it hard to see units from afar, coupled with the low FPS makes for a generally clunky expeirence.\n\nThe UI is super primitive, and the orders on the overview map in battles is unintuitive and is akward to control, I generally just used the \"follow me\" command whenever I got in an engagement.\n\nThe campaign map feels akward to read, the camera is always locked around your party, and again, the lighting feels to bright which makes it uncomfortable to look at. \n\nMusic is poor.\n\nMap variety is lacking, the maps that are in the game all feel the same right now.\n\n\nIn its current state I cannot recomend this game to anyone, it is lacking in to many core gameplay features to warrent the price tag. If the preformance was better, or if you have a good computer, I would say go for it, but currently the game is way to taxing on my system and the poor preformance I recieved made my expeirence unplayable.\n\nI would also like to see the lore and backstory of the world and RPG elements fleshed out a little more, currently you are just dropped into the game with no backstory whatsoever with the only direction being to \"take over the world.\"\n\nStick to playing warband for now, this game needs a lot of work in its current state.", "timestamp_created": 1517797498, "timestamp_updated": 1517797498, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451983", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39857590": {"recommendationid": "39857590", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965346608", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518502883}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, I have to admit...this is the most fun I had buying a $12 game in a long time.

The way the map works, how you talk to other groups etc. Quite honestly, its fantastic. Now my only gripe with the game is performance. No matter what settings you use not much difference is made and the graphical options have little, or no, difference at all. Im on a Ryzen 1500x and a 1060 so it should run fairly well. I know with these games the main hardware puller is the AI. \n\nThe gun play is very good, weapon models are as well. Its a very unique spin on the sandbox rts series. It's a game we definitely needed. If you like mount and blade, arma or anything strategy this isa definite game for you. \n\nAfterall the game is early access, I got it at a good price and after all its only been out for around 4 days so im sure there shall be lots of updates. I would definitely reccomend getting this game, especially right now. Dont worry about the system requirements, as they are quite wrong\n\nEdit: As of the most recent update the game is very playable now.

The gameplay is very good but can improve, especially in relation to artificial intelligence, since enemies considered \"inferior\" and \"Untrained\", hit the player with impressive accuracy, regardless of weapon or distance. Regarding the tactics used, they even try to flank, which is sensational and respond quickly to orders. I liked the variety of equipment, lacking only greater customization of the weapons. The graphics are good but not impressive, only being a little exaggerated when the projectiles hit the ground, completely capping the player's vision, making it difficult for already tense battles against larger numbers of enemies. As commented earlier, the game has a gigantic potential and a small but very focused developer team. I ended up asking for a refund because I still prefer the situations I can create in the game \"ARMA 3\", but I intend to buy in the future when it is more advanced and / or complete. Still, I recommend the game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517752958, "timestamp_updated": 1517752958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

However, none of the pointless one-liner reviews really go into why; so I'll tell you why.\n\nJust like in Mount and Blade you;\n[list]\n [*] Command an army\n [*] Grow the army through Leadership (and Commanding) skills\n [*] Have Morale\n [*] Have daily payments to make to the troops\n [*] Upgrade said troops when enough experience is gained\n [*] Has troop trees - some of which can branch off into other trees\n [*] Have a world map made of towns\n [*] Units show as a single unit with a number representing total unit count (World map)\n [*] First line of dialog when approaching a unit is \"Prepare to die!\"\n [*] Have trade commodities to buy low/sell high in other towns\n [*] Battle scenes are very similar (hills + trees)\n [*] Many skills are direct copies (First Aid, Looting, Inventory, Trading, Training (Called Instructor in this)\n [*] Build new structures in your town\n [*] Receive taxes from the town\n [*] Hire new units from the towns\n [*] Get chased across the map by forces larger than yours\n [*] Have multiple factions\n [*] Requires food for the army/morale\n[/list]\n\nThe game is played in pretty much the exact same way as Mount & Blade would be with some very minor exceptions. You'll find yourself taking your first few recruits out to kill a few bandits for some basic loot, money and experience. Sell the goods, upgrade your weapon, buy some armor, upgrade your troops, rinse, repeat several times, etc etc. Alternatively, purchase goods from a trader and sell to another. Items in demand in that particular store have green \"Demand\" text over them.\n\n[h1]Freeman as an FPS[/h1]\nFreeman as an FPS is pretty solid. The firefights mostly take place over a distance. Guns have their inaccuracies, meaning you'll see plenty of dust kicking up around you from enemy fire and likewise looking down range at the enemy. It creates a pretty good feeling of a drawn out firefight.\nThere are the usual three stances you would expect in a shooter;\n[olist]\n [*] Standing\n [*] Kneeling\n [*] Prone\n[/olist]\nand the guns can switch firemodes with the V key.\n\n[h1]Freeman as a tactical game[/h1]\nThe game is bland as a tactical game. Not really in a bad way, just the tactical features are somewhat limited.\nA battle map can be opened during combat with the M key, which allows you to move your units to other locations by simply clicking the unit you want to move and double clicking the location to move them to. Double clicking multiple locations will queue up movements allowing you to move a unit around a known enemy location for flanking and any waypoint can be dragged and moved to alter the route at any time.\nWhen moving, you can use either Charge to run, or Proceed with caution to traverse the waypoints whilst engaging where possible or taking cover upon receiving fire.\nThere are also Fire at will, Cease fire and Follow me commands.\nPressing P on the overworld map will allow you to Pause for tactical thinking.\n\n[h1]Game aspects[/h1]\n[b]Visual[/b]\nGraphically the game is acceptable. The overworld map, much like M&B is much lower quality than the actual 3D scenes. This is no big deal though as the 3D scenes are where the details count. \nThere are currently no real graphical settings except the basics. These are broken down into;\n[list]\n [*] Screen Resolution\n [*]Graphical Quality\n [*] Shadow Quality\n [*] Grass distance\n [*] Fullscreen\n[/list]\nThere are no custom graphics options that allow individual tweaking of features such as AA, Depth of Field etc.\nThe graphics I'd say are slightly better than M&B but remain similar to it.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nAudio needs some tweaking in places. The combat sounds are acceptable. Snipers even giving a decent crack over distance. My biggest gripe with the audio is it can be very hollow and has too much reverb. Footsteps for instance sound like they were recorded in an empty hallway, as do your Squads radio activity.\nThe game could use a little atmospheric sound also, such as wind blowing through the trees and a few chirpy birds. Right now the only sounds are Footsteps, gun fire and radio activity.\n\n[b]Enemy A.I[/b]\nThe titles store page boasts that \"You will be challenged by highly intelligent AI that is capable of advanced tactical maneuvers such as flanking, surrounding and even fake retreating\" and I admit to being very skeptical of the statement.\nActually though, it delivers. \nThe enemy I have faced thus far (Bandits) have shown the following maneuvers in action;\n[list]\n [*] Flanking - I have seen multiple times a squad heading off to try and a flank whilst my squads have been occupied surpressing the main force. You really need to be observant to catch these guys as most of the time I only spotted them because they were on the a hill and the blue sky behind them made the movement catch my eye.\n [*] Sorrounding - I have taken fire from three directions. This happens less if you spread out your sqauds a bit to prevent any enemy getting behind you.\n [*] Taking cover - The enemies will use trees and rocks for cover.... a lot.\n [*] Accurate firing - The enemy rarely fire from standing position. They will almost always crouch or go prone where possible making them even harder to hit.\n [*] React - When spotting an enemy squad moving in the distance I'll often fire off a few shots for fun. They reacted instantly, dropping to prone and breaking for cover.\n[/list]\nI've not yet witnessed fake retreating but the A.I for an early access title is impressive and probably one of the titles best strengths thus far.\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\n[strike]Fortunately I have only encountered one bug thus far. But it is quite the serious one.\nDuring two battles my gun has simply stopped working. The mag is full, but pulling the trigger does nothing. This leaves you completely useless and at the mercy of your Sqaud to do the dirty work. This started happening when I bought the AR, which is now the gun I've used the most so I am unsure as to whether the problem is with the AR, 5.56 ammo or I just didn't use the AKS (7.62) long enough to notice is what a global issue.[/strike] - [b]Developer fixed in 0.11[/b]\n\n[h1]Annoyances[/h1]\nThere are a couple of annoyances with this title.  For instance; \n[list]\n[*] [strike]There is no graphical indicator for which firemode your weapon is. A simple one bullet, three bullet and five bullet hud icon would do nicely here[/strike] - [b]Implemented[/b]\n[*] Your chosen firemode isn't persistent. I prefer to use single fire mode for more accurate firing. Particularly as ammo is a concern. However this seems to reset to full auto with every battle.\n[*] When the last squad flees the battle instantly ends, even if the very last man is close and you're about to cap his ass. Nope. This is especially annoying if more than one unit is left because you will re-engage the routed squad on the world map, only to kill another single unit for the remaining squad to once again insta-flee.\n[*] The game can be a little janky on the world map when holding space (time speed up) in that it can jitty, or on the odd occasion your unit will stop moving, but keep playing the movement animation. You'll have to click to move again if this happens.\n[*] [strike]There is no indicator of a gun having a scope or not. I am using the AR, which the graphic shows as not having a Scope on it, but actually does[/strike] - [b]Weapon customization implemented, scopes are now seperate and have their own slot[/b]\n[/list]\n\n\n\n[b]I will flesh out this review as I play more and experience more of the game.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1517722077, "timestamp_updated": 1518304533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 177, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930624", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39834269": {"recommendationid": "39834269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180632353", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519398176}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5468\u672b\u90fd\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u6b21   \u8fd9\u4e2a\u90fd\u503c\u5f97\u7ed9\u597d\u8bc4\n\n\u89c9\u7740\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u6709\u6f5c\u529b \u8bf4\u4e0b \u4f53\u4f1a \n1 \u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u53cb\u597d \u867d\u7136\u5546\u54c1\u4e0d\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5230\u5e95\u4ec0\u4e48\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7b49\u6218\u672f\u9053\u5177\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u9014 \u3002\n2 \u5bfb\u627e\u654c\u65b9\u82b1\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u57cb\u4f0f\uff0c\u6253\u4f0f\u51fb\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u53ea\u80fd\u9760\u8fd0\u6c14\u4e0e\u654c\u65b9\u4ea4\u6218\uff0c\u6218\u672f\u90e8\u5206\u4e0d\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u654c\u65b9AI\u4e0d\u806a\u660e\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u63d0\u9ad8 \uff08\u671f\u5f85\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\uff09\u6218\u7565\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u654c\u65b9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u6211\u3002\n3\u5175\u79cd\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u66f4\u591a\u5347\u7ea7\u6811\u3002\n4\u5730\u56fe\u592a\u5c0f \u671f\u5f85\u66f4\u591a\u80fd\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e0e\u6e38\u620f\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u4e92\u52a8\u4f53\u68c0\u3002\n5\u5728\u6218\u7565\u5730\u56fe\u6307\u6325\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u540c\u65f6\u770b\u5230\u6218\u6597\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6539\u5584\n6\u5230\u540e\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u5019 \u6307\u6325\u90e8\u961f\u5f88\u9ebb\u70e6\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b5\u4eba\u5c0f\u90e8\u961f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5408\u5e76 \u7ec4\u6210\u5927\u5175\u56e2 \n\uff5bMachine Translation\uff5d\nIt's been updated a couple of times over the weekend and it's all worth praising\nThink this game has potential\nThe game's commercial system is not very friendly although there are many commodities, but do not know exactly what use, such as binoculars and other tactical props have a practical use.\n2 find enemy time, no ambush, ambush opportunities can only rely on luck to fight the enemy, tactical part is not prominent, enemy ai is not smart, should be raised(expected official edition) strategic map on the enemy will not attack me.\nThere are not many soldiers and look forward to more tree upgrades.\n4 The map is too small to expect more.

Flanquea al enemigo, escondete en los arbustos, sufre cada ca\u00edda de un aliado como si fuese un hermano en la vida real, el juego tiene sus fallas, pero las mejoras y actualizaciones diarias son basadas en el feedback de los usuarios, gran comunidad (el juego es solo para UN JUGADOR), desarrolladores incre\u00edbles y comprometidos.\n\nEl manejo de recursos es casi id\u00e9ntico a los M&B, lo cual resulta algo genial para mi, pues ya estoy acostumbrado a la mayor\u00eda de mec\u00e1nicas en el juego, el comercio, conseguir tropas nuevas, subir de nivel al personaje y mejorar sus estadisticas, son todas id\u00e9nticas a Mount & Blade, lo cual es sencillo para los viejos, y facil\u00edsimo de aprender para aquellso nuevos en Freeman.\n\nEst\u00e1 en Early Access, as\u00ed que los errores y pifias t\u00e9cnicas son de esperarse, pero el developer est\u00e1 siempre anuente a escuchar, y los updates diarios (hasta 2 por d\u00eda -peque\u00f1os) arreglan muchas de las cosas que la comunidad comenta.\n\nEl juego de armas se siente bien, aunque muchos rifles tienen poco recoil, los enemigos si me parecen muy f\u00e1ciles. Pero seguramente le meten m\u00e1s dificultad, no me gusta que al inicio te tiran con una sola pistola, mientras que los comandos del bando contrario llevan rifles de alto calibre (ALV la vida), pero para eso llevas a tus compa\u00f1eros de armas.\n\nDe momento hay limitaciones de comandos para indicar a tus aliados a donde ir; solo puedes indicarles donde dirigirse mediante la activacion del mapa (que te quira visualizacion de primera persona), pero yo espero que le agreguen alguna manera de indicar a los soldados que se muevan en alguna direcci\u00f3n (como en los primeros Rainbow Six).\n\nEl juego anda bien t\u00e9cnicamente, nunca me ha crasheado, solamente tuve un error, que ahorr\u00e9 dinero para un rifle, y cuando lo fui a arrastrar para equiparlo en mi personaje, el rifle se fue a la verga, y desapareci\u00f3 de mi inventario. Ni modo, es algo que puede pasar tambi\u00e9n en la vida real no?\n\nEl juego est\u00e1 muy bien de momento, no est\u00e1 caro para las horas de diversi\u00f3n que ofrece, recomendado. Pronto venimos con un an\u00e1lisis completo, esto es meramente las primeras impresiones tras casi 2 horas de juego.

To be honest, I think they should have waited a few more months before realising, they could have gained more hype, and cranked out some of the super lame bugs. (One of the worst glitches I've seen is getting in a fight with an enemy unit of 30 men, defeating 10 of them and losing, loading the save, and even though my men are replenished because I've loaded my save, they for some reason have only 20 men as if the battle still happened yet only affected them). \n\nThe gameplay could use polishing and it feels a bit empty to only have infantry in a game where you're attempting to take over entire areas. Things like airpower, artillery, larger units that are comprised of multiple squads so controling more troops is easier, and a more intuitive UI system would all help the game greatly.

The AI on your team has something i wish you guys could fix, whenever you are waiting your men just stand out and dont find cover when the are just waiting. They wait until the enemies come and then try to find cover but by then they already took a few bullets. Also when ever they are in a gun fight i notice the stand up and down frequently between shots also they hide so far behind cover they shoot the cover instead of the enemies. The hit boxes on the enemies sometimes go out of wack and they matrix every bullet. Lastly something i wish you guys could add is whenever you fall in combat you get the choice to have your troops fight without you. And i would click that and we would win but i dont get any loot items or money. It would be great if you guys could add that. Now this is a great game the day after they released it they already fixed major bugs and added a few things to make the game more enjoyable so i highly recommend this game to people who enjoyed the mount and blade games or arma or just fps games in general.

Then buy a yacht, mansions, all the luxury life.\n-Have contacts with the local mafia or the police of the state and help them for interest and lust of power.\n-Train soldiers from all around the world, recruit them from retired SAS, S13, Navy Seals... \n\nIf going further :\nA multiplayer where there is a real economy system between the players on a big map.

The combination of mount and blade and arma feels to me as like it could become great one day.\n\nBut I cannot recommend it at its current status. It is just to buggy, in the 90 minutes I played (I dont want to play any longer because of refund) I lost 2 savefiles because savegame somehow does not really work yet. In addition the auto-battle-calculations after you get downed are totally stupid, 10 on my side vs 2 or 3 low tier enemies and my side looses without killing even one. This happened to me several times as well.\n\nOne big no go to me is, that my antivirus-program is raging like hell since I started playing Freeman, telling me that Freeman is a virus and acts like malware. I would not go so far to assume that the mistake is on Kaspersky's side here...\n\nThese are just examples of why you should not buy this game now. I dont want to totally destroy it and concern every detail that got me, as this game is still in EA and might become great (one day, in the far future. Maybe when bannerlord is released in 2076)\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517672305, "timestamp_updated": 1517672305, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39818357": {"recommendationid": "39818357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301400155", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518803208}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0432\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u044b\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0431\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0443 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0439\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1517671827, "timestamp_updated": 1517671827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39818305": {"recommendationid": "39818305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150111261", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517769999}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyunun mant\u0131\u011f\u0131 M&B ile neredeyse ayn\u0131.

Buy another copy and install in on your computer at work, then buy a third and install it on your Macbook you use to write poems sometimes. This game is amazingly brutal, the gun play is fantastic, the AI is intuitive and responsive to the world around it. It is quite literally the entire package, please help support these wonderful devs further improve this masterpiece by buying as many copies as you can feasibly afford. \n\nHowever let it be known that there are still several annoying bugs/in development features, such as some guns have a wierd problem with the iron sights; when you sight in on enemies at close range the rounds will fly over them even though you have them zeroed. \n\nThe Game is brutal in every way, you will be crushed and spit on and chewed up and shot a thousand times before you even get close to your first real city siege. You will spend hours cultivating a small profeesional army, only to be outflanked and ambushed by Uman terrorists and subsequently leave your entire force dead on the field. You will become frustrated by the lack of battle continuation after death/ ridiculously one sided dice rolls for the battle sim. You will get flanked, pincered, ambushed, blown up, shot, and cornered by the enemy. As of right now the character customization is lacking, trade is abyssmal, and your options in gameplay revolve entirely around open field battles and city sieges, however let it be noted that this game is still in Beta and more content is surely on its way.\n\nLet it also be known that while you're fighitng in the fields and in the streets, you'll be involved in intense and gratifying gunbattles, and you'll truly be the leader of a small army. The AI will test your ability to both A) Fight in first person, use cover and concealment effectively, and manage your ammunition and weapons efficiently as well as B) Utilize your Squads of soldiers to the best of their ability, read terrain and interpret enemy movements and feints and respond accordingly, and react to the ever changing situation that is a modern battlefield\n\nThis game does not let up, a single squad in the right location at the right time can change the course of the battle even in the face of a superior force. Snipers will routinely ruin your day, and MG's will shred your defensive positions. Every battle is different and challenging, and at no point in the game are you ever equipped to fight alone or without support. \n\nThis game is definetly one of my top 10's already, keep up the good work devs!", "timestamp_created": 1517667642, "timestamp_updated": 1517667642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39816569": {"recommendationid": "39816569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346912582", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518790195}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d76\u7d27\u51fa\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u5427    \u6211\u5b66\u6e23\u73a9\u4e0d\u61c2\u554a", "timestamp_created": 1517667426, "timestamp_updated": 1517667426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39816180": {"recommendationid": "39816180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069652908", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1521671435}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome, it's a mount and blade FPS, I bought this and played for 4 and a half hours straight.

I would consider this game to be in Alpha state and not beta, went in comparing this as if it was a warband mount and blade with gun, only to be dissapointed by the many and many bugs and cannot customize weapon.\n\n1- they allow you to leave the map during a battle, if you dont retreat your squad before leaving and engage in the same fight again afterward your squad will be left floating somewhere on the map without being able to give order to.\n\n2- sometime you kill ennemy on the battlefield and thier dead body model stands with guns in thier hand freezed acting as if they were alive. really annoying as you don't know what is alive and what is not.\n\n3- Grenade doesn't even apply damage to the thrower.\n\n4- Trading is completely static, the game starts and it's basicaly randomized which town wants what ressource for extra cash, but some high value ressources might not even be wanted at all in the map as there is not enough town to cover all the ressource. 1 ressource wanted per town pretty much limit the trading system. ( You can start a game and basicly it will be a shit game for trading).\n\n5- Grenade feels so clunky to use, you throw them and they slide on the ground so far, its basicly impossible to throw a grenade 20 meter off of you. You would have to look at your feet to throw it at that distance and would slide up to the area you want it to explode.\n\n6- AI on the map stands and do notting, there are no trader to intercept or highjack.\n\n7- Lack of purpose.\n\n8- the battle scenery is the same everywhere.\n\n9- Starting the game off with a pistol ironsight against ennemy that has AK give me aids.\n\n10- F the police, I just did thier QA bug testing for like 8 hours and pretty sure I wont get paid.\n\nI would wait before buying. I have no idea why the review are like 90% + positive but the game in this state right now is a big *You should wait*, because of all the things they need to fix and change to make this even a beta.\n\n2/10.

And yes, I know I have only played 1.2 Hours before reviewing this game.\n\nSTATEMENT:\n*     Tazou here from Earthbound Gamers.  This is a Neutral Review of KK Game Studio's EA Release Title \"Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare\".  By no means was this an paid review and it will be strictly a fair review.\n\nOVERALL:\n*     I would say that even for Freeman being out within 48 Hours, this game is GREAT!  These guys took a risk by incorporating ARMA Style Combat and feel with the game mechanics of Mount & Blade and made it work.  I would be lying to say that it is perfect at this point but for just having only its' \"Core\" features only, it is standing on its' own as being a very popular Indie Dev. Title.  Starting out with only two squads, a pistol and low ammo and supplies, you are forced to roam around a world style map in which you can encounter many different faction groups, towns to trade, loot or attack as well as to garrison structures afterwards.  As you progress, you can apply points into both your squads to upgrade their skills, armor and weapons as well as yourself with a huge variety of skills to benefit both yourself AND your squads.  Currently, there are no vehicles or task so you have to roam and engage camps, towns/cities and patrolling troops on the go to earn your Loot and Money.  Did I mention that you had to pay your troops and keep them well fed?  Well, I did now!  There are many aspects of the game currently implimented with a wide range more on the way or planned for the future!  Now, for the points:\n\nPOSITIVE:\n* Surprisingly Challanging\n* Simple Battle Map Overview\n* Well Optimized (Will run on just about any System) despite requirements\n* Simple UI (In/Out of Battle)\n* Need to actually plan where your troops go.  They can die quite easily if you don't plan well!\n\nNEGATIVES:\n* World Map seems quite small despite its actual size\n* Waypoint System is quite clunky (I know, in EARLY EA)\n* Earned Currency seems to be quite low (It WILL take you a while to buy a basic Main Slot Gun)\n* Only start with a Pistol, 2x Granades and 2x Squads (Which can be useful and sometimes are not!)\n* Several known game breaking bugs have been reported (Save/Load Bug) to wipe troops and inventory\n\nAll-in-all, this game seems to be pretty solid despite some of the odd bugs or lack of content at this point but again, it is only under 48 hours old.  Many more features are soon to be planned and released soon but for now, give them a rest and let them rejoice for releasing such a great EA Title!", "timestamp_created": 1517639431, "timestamp_updated": 1517639431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39808070": {"recommendationid": "39808070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177431501", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1521122598}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pretty good game , love the concept and being a M&B fan i would like if the devs could introduce a feature of recruiting companions aside from standard troops..that would be pretty awesome!!", "timestamp_created": 1517638800, "timestamp_updated": 1517638800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39807620": {"recommendationid": "39807620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258717963", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "last_played": 1521392210}, "language": "schinese", "review": "very good\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u6211\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u96c4\u5fc3\u58ee\u5fd7\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u996d\u8981\u4e00\u70b9\u4e00\u70b9\u5403\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u80fd\u591f\u575a\u6301\u628a\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u505a\u4e0b\u53bb\u3002\n\n\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u4ee5\u4e3a\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u6050\u6015\u8fd8\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u7684mod\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u73a9\u5bb6\u4eec\u7684\u5236\u4f5c\u6c34\u5e73\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4e0a\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u6709\u4e9b\u5c0f\u7684\u201c\u7f1d\u7f1d\u8865\u8865\u201d\u80fd\u591f\u4ea4\u7ed9\u73a9\u5bb6\u6765\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u660e\u663e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6d89\u53ca\u653f\u6cbb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd8\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u4e0d\u8981\u8fc7\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5f71\u5c04\u73b0\u5b9e\u2014\u2014\u6211\u53ef\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u53c8\u51fa\u73b0\u201c\u56fd\u670d\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u8f7d\u201d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1517636630, "timestamp_updated": 1517636630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39807564": {"recommendationid": "39807564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283075773", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519971530}, "language": "schinese", "review": "This is a good game but we need chinese!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1517636412, "timestamp_updated": 1517636412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810949", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1517645688, "developer_response": "Thanks!

Even if i dont fight personaly to much. \nThe fact that you have to have to pay your troops everyday was a bit *Urgh*. But dont worry. The days are long. How long Idk. And you can chose when to pay the troops. (you can skip a day or to..To a higher price)  Which brings us to the first issue...\n\nTime!  I can see what day it is. And thus when its a new day.  However.. I cant see what time of day it is. (Minor issue but still placing in out there)\n\nSecond issue: FOOD !  How much can some people eat! (!!) I havent been in military service. (Been in a youth org for a few weeks then other stuff happed) But im very sure that you aint given food every hour to eat. But a days ration (Morning midday evening).  Drains econom at times but not to major ether.\n \nI love that towns keep to their \"Hey! This item we need!\" (I mean that). Although sometimes i notice that loading a save (more on that later) that they change the requested item/resorce. So check before you go on your usual trade rout... (saves cash) \n\nMore on the save...\nSo I launched an attack on a settlement for fun. (Lost ofc) And then i reloaded... Aaand I saw that I only had 26 solders (I had 40 when i popt the save) So sometimes (Sometimes not allways). Another time I did the same thing but because i though i acually had it (i didnt) And when i reloaded  I relize... I relize that although i got all my troops back.. I still owed my solders 4000 in wages that i didnt pay them before reloading. XD -(Oi ! Davaris, we didnt get payed before you loaded game)-\n\nAnd sometimes if you have 2000 and spend some of it.. You get the cash that you had left over (but not the items)\n\nSo yea.. The saving and loading needs a bit of... Work...\n\nOtherwise... OH yea!  I only got attacked once. Once! The AI is quite passive towards everyone (despite beeing at war ( I like that i get left alone though. Makes trade easier)) One time ( XD ) one time I had a Uman Terorist army following me where ever i went. (I mean it) Ther followed me and wanted to attack me. But i guess their coding was broken. Quite fun though.      Also about that time i got attacked. I still felt like the attacker. (Or i was just impacient) so ya.\n\nTalking about battles...  Whats the point about the red Cirkle if the enemy dont spawn in it at times?  Oh about that! It makes for some fun moments and quick repositioning of your troops.  I remember one time sending all my troops That what way up a hill, Only to hear a lot of bullets whisteling about. So i though \"Hmm...\" And open my map...  Turns out the enemy was deployed In the other direktion so i was just to reorder my troops back to spawn and make a mad dash for cover XD.  Funny time..\n\nOh yeah that \"press delete to canscel order\" Ye, doent work..\n\nOn the \"campaign map\" I saw a few abbandond outposts (I say that because noone owned them) And i couldnt take them over for myself (Would be nice you know, HQ and that stuff, train soldiers.)\nAlso about the map it feels bland.. Sure lots of  Groups walking aroud (JK most of them just stands around) No caravans no civilians* (*wtf would civilians move around in this time of crysis?)\nBut you know some minor villages that villagers goes to and from trying to make a living. (aswell as caravans).\n\nAnyway I think thats all  Not to serious (Appart from the loading a save) (Also would be nice to join a factions, then again its about you taking over).\n\nAgain sweet game I like it and i hope to see some patches that (fixes the loading issues) adds things and fetures soon. Like making your base in one of those abandond outposts.\n\nP.S. if you think you will get a better gun then the markarov by fighting.. Forget it.  I found 2 glocks and 1 other makarov pistol.  And that was far and few between...\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517619194, "timestamp_updated": 1517619194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39803725": {"recommendationid": "39803725", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966920407", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520384793}, "language": "english", "review": "A game with potential.

I however have a couple of ideas on how the game could change in the future.\n\nUI\nThe game's graphics are pretty good, but the UI itself can be tinkered with to suit the game more properly\n\nCombat \nThe combat itself starts to feel repetitive afterwards. Mainly because it doesn't feel like too many factors determine whether you win the fight or not. If you have the most expensive squads or the most men, you'll win. Guerilla warfare is based on much more than that. Timing, having the high ground, AI being able to hide and wait, and thereby more effective flanking and ambushes would be cool to see in the future. Also I would like modifiers like having cover compared to not having cover really making a difference. Being able to catch an enemy squad running across a field would be priceless. I want every battle to feel different, and be able to do cool maneuvers and gaining the upper hand by using wit and tactics!\n\nAlliances\nI really don't know if this feature is implemented in the game, but if it isn't, i would really like to see it. \n\nCustom Squads\nBeing able to create own squads, and specialize units would be so cool. You could create different squads with different amounts of men, either armed for close combat battle or long distance battle, or anything in between; equipped with gear that suits your own playstyle. Being able to customize the soldiers' looks or even change their names and watch their battle stats would also be cool.\n\nMore opportunities\nLastly I want to generally see more opportunities in the game.

But there are some very big problems before I actually recommend it.\n\n1. It crashes easily\n2. Loading takes forever and half the time acts like it is going to break\n3. The sound is broken\n4. Trying to change settings lags the game to nearly crashing\n5. Interacting with anything lags the game horribly\n6. You can't tell if the game is trying to load or is breaking cause there is no loading screen\n7. The organization of merchants is horrible. Items and recruits should be ordered most expensive to least\n8. Giving orders is a pain\n9. Relationships work awkwardly\n10. You cant tell if troops are chasing you or patrolling\n11. Guns are weirdly priced. (since when is an Ak47 so expensive)\n12. Combat seems to be mostly far ranged (if you want your troops to live)\n13. Standard mode is the only existing mode and its essentially world domination\n14 the world map is awkward and you have to follow your unit instead of being able to view the world freely with the camera.\n14. Use of items is unclear\n15. Menus are gross to look at\n16. The tactical map in comabt doesn't give you a good eye for elevation\n17. No gun custimization\n18. Stats for equipment/recruits should have a more player friendly display such as bar graphs.\n19. You can't see how your character looks (for those fashionistas out there)\n20. When you're shot there is WAY too much blood that shows up on the screen that it is impossible to see\n21. But my biggest problem is really jus the lag. I never know whether or not it is loading or crashing. The game slows my whole computer down.\n22. You start off with too high of a prestige. Like you just started and you already have a faction\n\nBut we do have to remember that the game literally just came out to the public and I was expecting quite a few bugs.

Que \u00e7a soit au niveau des comp\u00e9tences, inventaire, marchands, carte du monde..Cependant, l'\u00e9poque n'est pas du tout la m\u00e9me puisqu'on se situe ici dans un monde moderne, les combats ne se font pas donc pas \u00e0 coup de haches et d'\u00e9p\u00e9es, mais \u00e0 l'AK, fusil sniper..Et bien que je trouve \u00e7a g\u00e9nial ! C'est un peu d\u00e9routant, difficile puisqu'on se retrouve avec un simple pistolet au d\u00e9but !

Mais c'est bien sur subjectif\n\n-Prix : Il coute actuellement que 12e ! Et franchement il vaut largement son prix !\n\n-Prise en main : C'est simple, sobre et efficace. Les ordres donn\u00e9s aux squads sont tr\u00e9s basiques, simples par exemple.\n\n-La difficult\u00e9 : Bien que le jeu soit difficile au d\u00e9but, je trouve la difficult\u00e9 bien jaug\u00e9e. Pour r\u00e9ussir il  faut tout simplement pas foncer t\u00e9te baiss\u00e9e sur les enemies mais adopter des tactiques et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir un minimum.\n\n\n\nPoints n\u00e9gatifs : \n\n-Bugs : Forc\u00e9ment, on est en alpha donc on peut en rencontrer certains (Arbre sans physique, on s'abrite derri\u00e8re mais les balles passent \u00e0 travers..Lorsqu'on est touch\u00e9 par une balle, l'\u00e9cran peut rester rouge..). Cependant j'ai pas rencontr\u00e9 de gros bug du genre crash ou autres.\n\n-Contenu : Il y a a pour l'instant peu de contenu cependant on peut tout de m\u00e9me s'amuser de nombreuses heures.\n\n-IA : C'est un gros point noir pour moi, l'ia est compl\u00e9tement stupide, elle tire un peu n'importe o\u00f9, se d\u00e9place bizarrement..\n\nPour fnir, ceux qui craignent que le jeu soit r\u00e9p\u00e9titif, il l'est, comme mount and blade l'est et pleins d'autres jeux tout aussi g\u00e9niaux.

(was playing against bandit 1 maruader squad and 2 looter squad, all 3 of my veterans merc  got wiped out cosidering that my soldiers had cover while the enemies are on the open. Fairly matched 15 vs 15)\n- Headshot damage modifier on higher tier enemies is ridiculous, it takes 4 bullets or more to kill them using rifles (experienced it having rifle expert at lv 17).\n- Enemy squads deployed are much more than your current squad limit.

Sandbags)\n > Special Factory Buildings - in a territory, there are special resources that can be produced. \n > Walls/Fences - might consider adding these or maybe not.\n > Landmines - Allows you to put landmines on the field in defense battles.\n\n\nThings to do when game is stable:\n- Add vehicles like light APC or technicals or humvee\n- Multiplayer\n- Mod support like warband\n- Make the map bigger\n- More Factions\n- Night Battle\n- Zombie/Dinosaurs?***\n\nKeep it up devs!

The only aim of the game is so far to capture and control 10 cities. \nEach city has traders that you can get weapons ammo, more units and food as you need to feed your troops.\nThat\u2019s the game basically\n\nThis game is early access so yes, it is \"rough\" as I would explain it\n-Graphics need a lot of work, very clunky and UI isn't the best\n-AI this is a big area that needs work\n-Very grindy to start, rifles are pretty expensive, you just start with a pistol\n-Some sort of tutorial or maybe starting off as a grunt working for someone and working way up.\n-A home base would be excellent so you could manage troops and defend it, make money etc.\n-You can\u2019t pick up loot until the end, I would like to see the ability to pick up weapons on the go.\n-This game has ALOT of potential, this could be great.\n-A minimap is badly needed!\n\nAdd in mod support with like new armies, user missions etc and they will be on to a winner.\n\nIs it worth getting and playing now, well I've enjoyed it but I can see why many wouldn't\n\nHowever, if you are undecided check out my video below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biMHIMEzVw8", "timestamp_created": 1517596400,

Vai direttamente al fondo, dai pro e i contro e le conclusioni (pigrone! )*\n\nSono venuto a conoscenza di questo gioco in un video su youtube, e appena finito questo sono corso a prenotarlo. Perch\u00e8? Perch\u00e8 trovo che sia un'idea assolutamente geniale: unire un gameplay sandbox alla Mount&Blade a sessioni di scontri in prima persona alla \"sparatutto tattico\". Il gioco \u00e8 ancora in accesso anticipanto e quindi molte cose sono provvisiorie, ed altre verranno modificate o aggiunte. Cercher\u00f2 di aggiornare la recensione ogni voltra che qualcosa di grosso cambier\u00e0 :D.\n\nTRAMA\nEssendo un open-world non \u00e8 presente una vera e propria trama (per adesso), avremo solo uno scopo: eliminare le fazioni che ci sono avverse e conquistare le loro citt\u00e0. Per il resto sta al giocatore crearsi una propria trama.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIl gameplay si pu\u00f2 definire come un incrocio tra Mount&Blade ed ArmA. Per chi non fosse familiare con questi giochi: noi saremo il comandante di una banda di merceneri e ci potremo muovere liberamente per la mappa. Il gioco si divide in due sequenze: la mappa e gli scontri. Nella prima ci potremo muovere liberamente con una visuale dall'alto  per il territorio, incontrando gruppi di soldati nemici e visitando citt\u00e0 per rifornirci, reclutare o per assediarle. Nella parte degli scontri invece la visuale passer\u00e0 in prima persona e potremo combattere di persona i nostri nemici, ed assegnare ordini di movimento alle nostre squadre. Il combattimento \u00e8 un giusto misto di tattica e di azione. Non sar\u00e0 punitivo come quello di Arma, ma nemmeno alla Rambo stile CoD. Negli scontri contro gruppi di nemici dovremo riuscire ad eliminarli con astuzia senza perdere troppe truppe, o la propria vita, mentre negli assedi alle citt\u00e0 dovremo impadronirci di alcune zone tattiche difese dai nemici. I primi scontri che affronterete saranno blandi e noiosi, ma se avrete la pazienza di reclutare molti soldati e di procurarvi le armi adatte, essi si trasformeranno in combattimenti molto divertenti e tattici.\nSono presenti varie armature ed armi, ognuna di esse con le proprie munizioni (che dovremmo gestire saggiamente per evitare di rimanere a secco nel bel mezzo di uno scontro) e con i propri accessori. Il gunplay \u00e8 abbastanza realistico, con l'oscillazione del mirino, il rinculo ed il bullet-drop, ognuno di essi pu\u00f2 poi essere migliorato salendo di livello ed potenziando le appropriate skill. Quest'ultime vi permetteranno di avere pi\u00f9 vita, poter gestire pi\u00f9 squadre, viaggiare pi\u00f9 in fretta ecc...\nPotremo poi gestire i nostri uomini, migliorandoli o dandogli soldi per aumentare il loro morale. Essi saranno molto efficienti in battaglia e seguiranno molto bene i nostri ordini. Alcuni di loro potranno essere personalizzati (in quanto aspetto e skill) e avranno abilit\u00e0 particolari (come il richiedere il supporto aereo).\nOltre ai nostri compagni potremo poi gestire le citt\u00e0 che conquisteremo, scegliendo cosa costruirci in modo da sfruttarle appieno.\nGli sviluppatori stanno progettando di aggiungere molte altre cose quali missioni secondarie che influiranno sulle fazioni, veicoli, nuovi oggetti e molto altro.\nSi stanno anche dando da fare per risolvere i bug presenti ,pochi per ora, ma che possono a volte infastidire. (tipo i gruppi di nemici sulla mappa che a volte smetteranno di muoversi oppure il fatto che a volte membri del nostro party scompaiano).\n\nGRAFICA\nLa grafica non \u00e8 malaccio da come potete vedere negli screenshoot ed il gioco mi va molto fluido con tutti i settaggi al massimo (anche se non posseggo i requisiti consigliati). L'unica pecca \u00e8 che per ora non \u00e8 possibile settare le singole opzioni grafiche, potremo solo decidere tra vari preset (lower-low-medium ecc...).\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nNon sono presenti molte tracce nel gioco, ma quelle durante gli scontri saranno dinamiche, ovvero cambieranno fluidamente a seconda della situazione in cui ci troveremo. Ad esempio durante gli schieramenti la musica sar\u00e0 calma e piena di tensione, ma appena inizieremo uno scontro a fuoco con un nemico passer\u00e0 ad un tono molto pi\u00f9 dinamico. Questa feature \u00e8 molto interessante e spero che gli sviluppatori la sfrutteranno appieno in futuro e che aggiungano pi\u00f9 musiche.\n\nIn definitiva:\n\nPRO\n-Gameplay dinamico e divertente\n-Gli scontri, se i soldati sono numerosi, possono diventare estremamente divertenti e tattici\n-Difficolt\u00e0 regolabile, da a prova di fesso a realismo intensivo \n-Gli sviluppatori  stanno continuando a supportarlo e sono previste molte aggiunte future\n-Inoltre il gioco viene aggiornato con molta frequenza!\n\nCONTRO\n-Attualmente non c'\u00e8 molto oltre a quello che vedete da video e screenshot\n-Qualche bug, a volte fastidioso\n\n\nQuindi, Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare promette molto bene al momento, ma come sempre, la scelta finale \u00e8 la vostra. Quando un gioco \u00e8 in early access tutto pu\u00f2 succedere. Potremo vederlo tra un paio d'anni tra le vette dei giochi pi\u00f9 acquistati di Steam oppure abbandonato completamente come molti (troppi) altri. Personalmente ho fiducia negli sviluppatori e sono certo che sapranno sfruttare al meglio il tutto. Se siete proprio molto indecisi prendetelo quando \u00e8 in saldo, o al massimo giocateci ma non superate le 2 ore per il rimborso ; )\n\nQui tutto da Quazar", "timestamp_created": 1517593520, "timestamp_updated": 1521044892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560293", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39795596": {"recommendationid": "39795596", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992338172", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519132791}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff01\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u9a91\u780d\u521a\u51fa\u6765\u65f6\u5019\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u80fd\u575a\u6301\u4e0b\u53bb\uff0c\u5047\u4ee5\u65f6\u65e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5fc5\u6210\u5927\u5668~~~", "timestamp_created": 1517593031, "timestamp_updated": 1517593031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39795327": {"recommendationid": "39795327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017270242", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1520984660}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great early access game, with a lot of potential. 100% Recommed", "timestamp_created": 1517592289, "timestamp_updated": 1517592289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39795189": {"recommendationid": "39795189", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989389925", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "last_played": 1521154950}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cheap, it's fun, and it's off to a great start.\n\nThink, Mount and Blade (very basic version for now) with better graphics with guns.\n\nIt's EA but it has a price to match the level of development.", "timestamp_created": 1517591952, "timestamp_updated": 1517591952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39794770": {"recommendationid": "39794770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028255519", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518134122}, "language": "english", "review": "played for about 3 hours, its a fun game, but it is unforgiving. I like it quite a bit so far, but word to the wise, let your troops do the fighting. if you're about to be overrun, thats one thing, but don't try any \"ooo im a player character i can do the sneaky sneaky around them and flank!\" you will die. your army will die. you will be very angry because your last save was thirty minutes ago and that Volunteer squad became a Merc Rifle squad, and the rifle squads became MG sections and veteran mercs. I've had to start over twice to trial and error it. surprisingly the makarov does decent damage even at range, but bullet drop is a pain if they're any farther than 35 yards. also, pick your battles wisely. sure, you may have 4 fully upgraded merc squads/mg teams, but those twenty men could get stomped by 40 basic bandits flanking ya. Highly recommend this game, even in early access. for 12 bucks, its a steal.\n\n\nUPDATE! I've gotten quite a bit better since my initial review, and also managed to capture my first town. Overall my view of the game is positive. The combat is fun, the command system is easy to use, and pretty simple to master. the gun variety is still relatively narrow, but thats a non-issue for me, especially because the Dev's have said weapon attachments are going to be implemented in one of the first major patches. one big thing and really only real downside to the game right now is it just feels repititive. Get into a dozen battles with bandits, upgrade your army, level up, buy new equipment, repeat. they haven't been able to implement any type of missions yet for other factions, so the gameplay is limited to a field battle in hilly semi-forested grasslands, or town assaults to expand your little fiefdom. I anticipate that this game will become excellent given time to grow, and fairly soon I expect it will be much more fleshed out, I still standby my recommendation, however if you are expecting a game with meat on its bones, I would hold off on purchasing for the meantime, as its only a skeleton, albeit a well made one right now.", "timestamp_created": 1517590739, "timestamp_updated": 1517768672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39794373": {"recommendationid": "39794373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030656386", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517873196}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly thought this game wouldn\u2019t be half as good as it is.

SO COOL!!\n\n\npros:\n1. Guns! mount and blade mods always tried this and didnt really work well.\nThis game gets it right with bullet drop and some inaccuracy for small arms fire\nalthough, being able to save a half used mag is not a feature and kinda sucks.\n\n2.Weapon variety. There seems to be nice few guns to choose from.\njust to name a few are ak a m16 like weapon and vss which most games dont have. \nthe vector.some form of a mpx and 2 shottys. 357 magnum. A belt fed gun\nand the glock and makrov pistol.(they are adding weapon modding as there\nnext big update)\n\n3. Sqaud based units. Now some people dont like this but i enjoy it. It makes getting ur guys \nback to full strength eaiser since u can pay to refill ur units as long as one member of\nthe sqaud is still alive\n\n4.PATCHES COME OUT DAILY. wow thats crazy for a such a small dev team!\n\n5. A road map that seems do-able. Most small teems make these awsome huge\nimpossable road maps that will take them years. Not this team. They plan on leaving\nearly access buy the end of the year. Few other fetures are gun modding more battle\nmaps,some quest, and last but not least bigger map!\n\n6.Weapon modding. Now its only scopes as of now but supressors and other cool\nstuff is coming in the future\n\nNow the cons\n1.not as optimized as it could be.\n\n2.paying units buy the day. Now the day cycle is very long but there \nwas a reason mount and bladedid it in 2 week chunks(or month cant remember).\n you are always to nervous to buy more units\ncause they are REALLY expensive and there are no industry's to help u make\n money only fighting(which then chrushes your units morale)\n\n3.Some bugs. One of the main ones was weapons you buy disapearing.\nbut they patched it a day later WOW very nice to see that they are working hard.\nSo if u find a bug they will prob get to it very fast.\n\nAll in all worth the 15$ and will prob be a nice competitor\n to mount and blade if they stay on this path.\nFew cool things they could add would be cars, MORE guns,faction quest aka being a vassal,and maybe tweeking the price of units and making morale go down slower.", "timestamp_created": 1517584479, "timestamp_updated": 1518284431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39792279": {"recommendationid": "39792279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040491172", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1520698899}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub9c8\uc6b4\ud2b8 \uc5d4 \ube14\ub798\uc774\ub4dc \uc88b\uc544\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc800\ub294 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc0ac\uc138\uc5ec \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 \ub9c8\ube14 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ud329\uc744 \uc798\uc885\ud569\ud574\uc11c \ucd1d\uae30 \ud654\uc2b9\ucd1d\ubaa8\ub4dc \uc788\ub294\uac78 \ud558\uc2dc\ub4e0\uc9c0 \uc774\uac9c\uc740 \ucd1d\uc740 \ub458\uc9f8\uce58\uace0 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uac00 \uc544\ubb34\ub9ac \uac15\ud574\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uad74\uc5d0\ub294 \ud138\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1517583810, "timestamp_updated": 1517583810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39792115": {"recommendationid": "39792115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385555470", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517583319}, "language": "schinese", "review": "chinese", "timestamp_created": 1517583343, "timestamp_updated": 1517583343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39792033": {"recommendationid": "39792033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002224455", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1521306543}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr den Preis kriegt man ein wundervolles Spiel, das einen mehrere Stunden fesseln kann.

Picked it up on a whim because I had cash in my account and it seemed to be right up my alley. As other reviewers have said it's like Mount and Blade with guns and, so far, pretty watered down in comparison. I could see it getting extremely repetative as it stands but I'm still really enjoying it and hoping with additional features added it can become something great. Gun play is better than I expected it to be but could also still use some work. \n\nMy one complaint thus far is that while some items are pretty self explanatory as to their use, especially if you have some experience with M&B, others I'm a little confused about and would appreciate the addition of a small blurb of info on whether or not it actually has a use.\n\nHope they'll add ways to command your squads from the first person view because sometimes it's a little difficult to get your positions right with only the map to give orders.\n\nI'm going to give it a thumbs up for now because the price is right for what you get, it's fun and I haven't run into any major issues so far.

Add more battle maps including rivers,houses, roads, forests and land form with more complexities.\n2.Add a simple 'command wheel' like the form of \"operation flashpoint dragon rising\", it will simplify the command procedures and create more time for players to concentrate on battle instead of adding waypoints on the map. To me it is more like the real-time battle if you select your squads and give orders to them directly but not switch to a map interface. \n3.Add more modify selections for guns and merchandises. I cannot find the uses of a bino or beer on my squads or myself if I preserve them instead of selling them. It makes the merch useless and redundant. And i hope i can buy a scope and turn my ak into a marksman weapon.\n4.Add a confirm option before I quit the game without saving. It might be a catastrophy if I wrong clicked the button without saving the game proceedings. And it real happened.\n5.More mission branches and more cities.\nI hope it will be useful to you guys. And the version 1.02 has updated a lot.It will be a great game and dont give up on updatings since so many Indie game developers quitted thier games.

In concise words, this is the love child of ARMA and Mount & Blade. Combining the tactical combat of the ARMA seires and the grand map and RPG gameplay of Mount and Blade. The gunplay is actually very solid. So solid it actually surpasses ARMA for me, and I am a longtime ARMA player. It is smooth and for the most part, precise. It almost reminds me of Battlefield when it comes to weapon handling. Now the animations aren't the greatest but they are fairly good and the audio is about the same quality of a COD title. Commanding your troops in battle is a bit rudimentary at the moment, having to stop mid firefight to pull up a map and issue flanking and movement orders to your men, but if you can ass a radial command system, something akin to OpFP: Red River, the you could have a very smooth and tactically satisfying command system, utilizing the map for massive maneuvers and utilizing the radial command for instant on the spot commands for your men. As for the grand map gameplay, it is a very shallow experience. Commanders don't give quests, you cannot roam around the towns, and the trading is very face value. Be that as it may, for something that is early access, we have a quite playable and strong foundation for what could be a fantastic game. The only thing I pray is that the dev's make this game mod friendly. Much of Moutn & Blades success can be largely attributed to it's modability, allowing the communtiy to create entirely new experiences. Flesh out the grand campaign, fien tune your command UI, work on AI cover detection, add depth to the map and towns, and give this game a modding communtiy and you got yourself one hell of an experience ahead of us.

It makes me wish they had held off on doing early access. \n\nThe other reviews are correct. It's Mount and Blade with guns and without the role playing mechanics. Also you can't auto skip battles without a high chance of losing. \n\nThe reason why I gave the game a thumbs down is because I'm unsure of how devoted the developers are to finishing the game. Are they going to make it more like Mount and Blade or are they going to treat it like Blood and Gold: Carribean! Which is essentially an unfinished game because sales were not sustaining development of the game and the developers eventually just claimed the game was finished.\n\nImprovements I'd want to see.\n\nA skip battle option - my current experience has only allowed me to skip battle when I die.\n\nInstead of instant buildings, have it be based over time - The developers have stated that putting a day/night cycle into the game is part of their development goal however I don't recall reading how that would affect the game beyond it being either day or night.\n\nA tutorial - There are currently picture tutorials however you may be left guessing what they meant by some of the instructions. I hope that when they finally input a story mode that the tutorial will flow seamlessly.\n\nMake the compass, walkie talkie, canteen, map, binoculars useful - currently those are just scrap items that you can sell. Also instead of a canteen, use a camelback. \n\nMake the FLC jacket be an overlay to body armor - I was super excited when I first saw an FLC in the game because it reminded me of my days in the army. However I was super disappointed when I saw that you could only wear either a FLC or armor. Typically you wear the FLC over the armor in order to carry grenades, ammo and medical supplies.\n\nChange weapons of your individual soldier units - I have a feeling it's currently not like this because that would be hard and tedious and buggy every time a new patch would be made.\n\nIndividual weapon upgrades - I was really disappointed that I couldn't change scopes with the sniper rifle or add a forward grip to my weapons.\n\nThe skills system - I have mixed feelings over you put 10 points in aiming so now you can aim better. I feel like Casey Hudson (Mass Effect 1, 2, 3, creative director) was partially right when he said your skills should not be based on how many points you put into that skill. Your skill should be based on your skill. It feels extremely unreleastic when you're able to use a MG as a sniper rifle. However for this type of game, maybe that's for the best, because MG's are really supposed to  be used as suppressive weapons that tear through buildings and vehicles. This game doesn't have destructible environments so what use is a MG then?", "timestamp_created": 1517551929, "timestamp_updated": 1520538459, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485822", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1517605109, "developer_response": "Hi. Thanks for the review. We are fully devoted to the development of the game and we are aiming at the similar path that M&B initially went through. We have a very clear plan on how to make the game better over time, which is based on our vision and community input. We are totally indie, free from publishers and investors and we are in total control of our development situation. The community shows great interests in this game and we are developing a game which we see great potential so we have 100% passion and devotion to this project."}, "39784161": {"recommendationid": "39784161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145576652", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1521621031}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub9c8\uc6b4\ud2b8\ube14\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc990\uaca8\ud588\ub358 \uc720\uc800\ub77c\uba74 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc88b\uc544\ud560\ub4ef \uc2f6\ub2e4.\n12400\uc6d0 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uac12\uc5b4\uce58\ub97c \ucda9\ubd80\ud788 \ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784. \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud0c0\uc784\uc740 \uc9e7\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5bc\ub9ac\uc5d1\uc138\uc2a4\uc774\uba70, \uc81c\uc791\uc790\uc758 \ucee8\ud150\uce20 \ucd94\uac00 \uc57d\uc18d\uc744 \ubcf4\uba70 \uac00\ub054\uc529 \uc990\uae34\ub9cc\ud558\ub2e4.

est\u00e1 em Acesso Antecipado, os pontos contra s\u00e3o mais sugest\u00f5es de pontos a serem melhorados do que propriamente defeitos do jogo.\n\nPr\u00f3s:\n-Sistema de tiro e movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 s\u00e3o bem s\u00f3lidos, ainda mais por estar em fase inicial;\n-Utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de estilo de mapa e sistemas semelhantes a Mount & Blade(Como f\u00e3 de Mount & Blade isso me agradou muito);\n-Pitadas de RPG e estrat\u00e9gia tem um real motivo para estarem ali, diferente de muitos jogos que simplesmente adicionam funcionalidades tentando parecer mais complexos e falham miseravelmente.\n\nContras:\n-Ter de entrar no mapa para dar as ordens;\n-Ao sair de batalhas e retornar ao mapa o jogo come\u00e7ou a sofrer de quedas de FPS;\n-Ainda n\u00e3o tem muito o que se fazer pelo mapa al\u00e9m de lutar e buscar melhoria para sua fac\u00e7\u00e3o.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnglish\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat game, it is in inicial developement phase but shows a great potential.\nNote: As the game it's at Early Access, the cons are more suggestions than defects of the game.\n\nPros:\n-Shooting system and movement system are really solid;\n-Map and systems with Mount & Blade style;\n-RPG and RTS system has a reason to be there, it's not like games that uses just to say \"Look i have RPG mechanics\";\n\nCons:\n-The need to open the map to give orders;\n-After a battle i got FPS issues in the world map;\n-Few things to do(This will change in the future);\n---------------------------------------------------------------------", "timestamp_created": 1517550649, "timestamp_updated": 1517550784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0,

It's mount and blade meets arma, and I can't wait to see how great this game becomes.\n\nThanks KK Studios For this work of art!", "timestamp_created": 1517538997, "timestamp_updated": 1517538997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39781644": {"recommendationid": "39781644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074421389", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520241878}, "language": "schinese", "review": "0.101 \u7248\u672c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff1a\n\u5982\u7b80\u4ecb\u6240\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e2a\u9a91\u9a6c\u4e0e\u780d\u6740\u7248\u7684arma3\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9a91\u780d\u7684\u67d0\u4e8c\u6218mod\uff0c\u53ea\u662fAI\u4eec\u7684\u5c04\u51fb\u8ddd\u79bb\u90fd\u5f88\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u771f\u60f3\u81ea\u5df1\u4e0a\u573a\u6218\u6597\u6015\u4e0d\u662f\u8981\u8fdb\u5165\u201c\u6211\u662f\u8c01\u6211\u5728\u54ea\u6211\u600e\u4e48\u88ab\u6253\u4e86\u201d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u529f\u80fd\u8fd8\u4e0d\u592a\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u548c\u9a91\u780d\u91cc\u7684\u5f13\u7bad\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u64cd\u7eb5\u89d2\u8272\u81ea\u5e26\u7684\u5f39\u836f\u5728\u6218\u6597\u540e\u4e0d\u4f1a\u88ab\u56de\u590d\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u4e0b\u7684\u5f39\u836f\u65e0\u9650\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u5c0f\u961f\u8fd8\u5269\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7acb\u523b\u82b1\u94b1\u51ed\u7a7a\u8865\u5458\u3002\u754c\u9762\u4e5f\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u964b\uff0c\u4e0d\u5efa\u8bae\u4e00\u822c\u73a9\u5bb6\u7acb\u523b\u5165\u624b\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u975e\u5e38\u671f\u5f85\u671f\u5f85\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u653emod\u4ee5\u540e\u7684\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1517538838, "timestamp_updated": 1517538838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39781503": {"recommendationid": "39781503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051864913", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1521255418}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of potential, I hope this doesn't flop.", "timestamp_created": 1517538202, "timestamp_updated": 1517538202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39781319": {"recommendationid": "39781319", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971040782", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 1078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "last_played": 1521316030}, "language": "english", "review": "I had over 120 hours in this game and I can tell you this is one of the best FPS, Squad based games ive played.

If you like mount & blade you will definitely like this as well (unless you don't like the modern warfare thing of course).\n\nI've only played a couple of hours as of yet and I will probably update this review when I've gotten further into the game.\n\n[b] Setting [/b]\nThe setting is nice, it feels good and the music compliments it nicely.\n\n[b] Map [/b]\nThe map looks cool, in later stages i hope to see more biomes, but for now this will do very well. It's off to a good start.\n\n[b] Battles [/b]\nBattles are good, the shooting is nice and the Ai of your squads and the enemies is done pretty well for the stage of the game. Some movement issues here and there which could be nicely resolved with a button to order the squad to get back in there original formation.\nMoving your units around is easy (now and then a bit clunky but very smooth for the stage of the game) and changing their course is just as easy as well. Battles can be quite challenging too, if you're caught slipping it's going to cost you some money which can be devastating in the early moments of the campaign.\nThe map for the battles is designed very well and gives room for flanking and such which is really usefull in this game. Love it!\n\n[b] Guns [/b]\nThe SMGs in this game are so far my favorites for multiple reasons. They shoot nice, you can see your bullit properly and it's really nice for sneaking up on enemies and wiping an enemy squad by yourself in a quick well aimed bursts. Really satisfying to do.\nThe rifles look really nice and the damages on most of them are good, but you can barely to not at all see where your bullet is going. This is really annoying because most of the time you can't see the impact of the bullet either because there is 10 other people shooting at your target as well. It ends up costing me way to much ammo to kill one guy when i can also just use an SMG and kill a guy in 5-6 shots at ranges at which you should be having an advantage with rifles. \nSnipers are nice but they need some getting used to, less hard to get used too than the rifles though.\nThe pistols are honestly the most acurate guns in the game right now and they do a nice amount of damage as well. I honestly would prefer almost any of the pistols above some of the rifles in this game simply because they shoot so much better and the damage difference is neglectable because you can actually hit shots with the pistols.\n\n[b] Sound [/b]\nThe sound is very lacking sadly, almost all the guns have the same sound. Also there are not enough individual sliders for sounds and this is very annoying as they feel unbalanced and a lot of them to loud like the things squads tell you in combat. Another thing with the sound is the gunshots in battles are sort of half done. You can hear pretty acurately which direction the gunshot is coming from, but the distance of the shot is a mess. You can be standing 10-20 meters away from an enemy and it sounds like you're a 100 meters away from him. Also a big problem when trying to locate where your enemy is because you just can't pin-point where the enemy is at. Your just looking around hoping to see a gun's flash and looking at your map all the time hoping your squads will soon spot them so you can attempt to take a shot after taking shots for 1,5 minutes, giving the enemy a lot of time to kill you and your guys.\n\n[b] Bugs, glitches, crashes [/b]\nThere are some bugs in it, but it is to be expected with early acces at launch. It's nothing that can't be worked around though and I'm happy to say that I have not yet experienced a game crash. \nSome bugs (which have ocured to me and a friend of mine once in 6 hours of gameplay) require you to restart the game to be fixed, others bugs and glitches are so minor it's just goofy and you can just laugh at them and continue playing. \n\nAll with all I think this game is really nice, there is 100% sure something here that can be made into an amazing game. \nIf the devs keep up the great work this will definetely be my main singleplayer game until mount & blade 2 comes out.\n\nFor now i think this game deserves a 6,8/10", "timestamp_created": 1517526848, "timestamp_updated": 1517534722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39778911": {"recommendationid": "39778911", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998284680", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517525178}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a rock.  You can tell it's a rock because of all the jagged edges.  However, you chip those edges away long enough and maybe it'll turn into a gem.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a decent rock.  Pre-alpha, even.  And I have A LOT to complain about.  For example, I don't like how 5.45mm rounds aren't a part of the game, but that's a petty complaint (thought the 7.62 general purpose machine gun is a .50 caliber, so maybe caliber accuracy isn't top on the priority list).  Another petty complaint is that there are a lot of spelling errors and the way things are worded are just... meh.  Some of the stats basically have the same name while using a different word which is just confusing, the UI is HORRIBLE, and if you leave your skirmish to random chance then your badass mercenary companions will end up getting creamed by some low tier brigands.\n\nWhat this really needs right now is for a bit more... guidance.  Really, they drop you off in an unnamed Slavic civil war with multiple factions.  If you want a story, there is none.  Just be a freedom fighter and fight for the freedoms you choose.  Not that you can implement any of these freedoms, mind you.  Doubt they'd implement the ability to grant freedom of speech, state markets, or sharia law in a pre-alpha release.\n\nAs of the first day of release, the game crashed once with me and threatened to crash again at the end of every battle.  The save game/load game feature is a mysterious function where you lose ALL your shit despite loading.  Not necessarily your shit, mind you, but I saved before recruiting someone.  Got creamed by bandits, reloaded and discovered I couldn't recruit who I wanted to recruit anymore.  Mysterious function indeed.\n\nYou're going to be stuck with your starter pistol for a while because not-rubles (called credits) are kind of a hassle to farm.  For a pair of airsoft gloves (called Tactical Gloves but is definitely Condor Syncro Tactical Gloves; can't fool me) it's over 600 credits.  Assuming they sell at the same price you can get them online, it's 50 USD.  Let's say they are 60, for math's sake.  So, one USD would be worth ten credits.  Admittedly, that's not so bad because there are worse currencies out there, but you have to get into battle after battle JUST to get an AKM.  Of course, your enemies who you farm won't drop their guns because... reasons.\n\nApart from the grind, lack of story/guidance, clunkiness, lack of user-friendliness, grammatical mistakes, having to pay your troops daily rather than weekly, STRANGE caliber selections, and LOADS of other inconveniences... it's not that bad.  Just needs A LOT of work and could use more influence from Mount and Blade's world map as well as Arma's inventory system (ie where you can add a sight or grenade launch to your rifle).  I'm looking forward to seeing what this game will become, but for now?

What I have noticed is a nice map, but a bit small. Some things that I have noticed are that this game has a unique ideas of combining Arma and Mount & Blade, it combines the map movement and market system of Mount and blade and a similar combat system of arma. \n\nThings I reccomend fixing:\n1.The Overpowered bandits:  I personally am no stranger to a FPS game but this one is cutthroat, my first engagement I lost 3 squads to 11 bandits who had some serious accuracy. \n2. The Market system: The ingame trading with cities is a bit basic, simply drag an item and get paid or pay for an item this area I would like to see improved. \n3. Villages: So far villages can be captured, and improved, but from what I have saw is that there is no way to actually look at your village unless attacking or defending it. Perhaps some sort of \"roam the streets\" would be a good fit.\n4. Diplomacy: Instead of just attacking everyone, why not have some agreements, alliance, vassal, etc.\n5. A more fluid AI. The game has a decent AI with some really basic orders of charge, fire, or hold fire, adding more tactics and formations would really spruce combat up. \n\n\nOverall This game is by far worth a buy in it`s curent stage.", "timestamp_created": 1517525901, "timestamp_updated": 1517525901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39778658": {"recommendationid": "39778658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095543949", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1520784645}, "language": "english", "review": "Constant updates,Amazing game Its mount and blade mixed with arma its just GREAT", "timestamp_created": 1517525710, "timestamp_updated": 1519333630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39778511": {"recommendationid": "39778511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039435569", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "last_played": 1521218702}, "language": "english", "review": "I am (EDIT: MORE) flashed about this game! (EDIT: after first patch, late at launchday)\n\nFirst i would recommend to wait a few days since there are some bugs/exploits inside right now, but nevertheless keep it in your mind - it will be a great game (imho it is right now - i dont care about some bugs in EA)\n\nGameplay:\nwho would like a game just for FPS would be disapointed - you start with a pistol and have no chance to win a fight with just FPS (at moment, think they change \"starter kit\" soon).\nWho would like a pure strategic command game would be also disapointed because there are lots of other (deeper) games with more and more detailed command options (but they work for more options to be released within few days)\nThe fascinating part in this game is the combination between theese 2 parts - to command your sqadrons and take part within their fights by shoting also.\nPure \"rambos\" and \"one-men-armys\" have no chance - you can only be sucessful if you take use of your sqads, use them wisely, take advantage of terrain and stay a little bit behind them for not to be oneshot by someone. No need to be a hero in first line to be sucessful in this game ;) Mostly its better to take cover and wait for the others to run into your fire line.

It might even be really good. I don't \"review\" early access games especially ones this early but M&B being my most played on steam and being an FPS fan I just couldn't resist nabbing this one.\n\nTL;DR: If you like fps games and If you like the M&B design of it's world map navigation. I have a hard time seeing anyone not liking this game, even in such an early stage. \n\n The game has solid gunplay and movement. I am an Escape from Tarkov player so that is my standard and EFT has arguably movement and gunplay second to none else on the market. So that is quite a compliment to this game. The game also has bullet physics.\n\nNow back to the M&B part. So yeah, if you are a Blader you will feel a little more than just right at home. The world map navigation and RPG leveling system both available to the player and his troops (squads) is almost a 1:1 ratio to M&B. So it's quite clear the devs have played M&B.\n\nThe strategic map while in the battle map is currently pretty unintuitive right now. However you CAN get used to it. Pro tip, remap the M key to something much more accessible. You will be constantly opening and closing the map to command your toops whilst trying to fight at the same time.  This is probably the most glaring issue at the moment. The game is going to have to have direct commands at some point VIA command keys like M&B (Or other shooter titles like Brothers in Arms). Simply put, we are going to eventually need a much more accessible way to command our troops while being hot in the fight. \n\n****EDIT**** - Two days after posting this review, a patch was uploaded that implemented two commands and designated squad keys. \n\nI could nit-pick the game all day long but it does more right then wrong at this point other than that main criticism, in my opinion.\n\nI will end this here with a thanks to the devs and the 2 suggestions we are all already thinking (After Singleplayer is polished)\n\n----- MULTIPLAYER & MODS-----", "timestamp_created": 1517508526, "timestamp_updated": 1517668676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647409", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39772718": {"recommendationid": "39772718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340468180", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517582342}, "language": "english", "review": "Way too buggy, had enemies spawn inside of buildings which made them unkillable. theres currently nothing to do except kill people with guns.

Here's the thing, however, unlike M&B (Remember used Quivers fill up?), when you use your magazines, they go away for good, not refilled after battle. Which means, make your shots count. Learn to aim and be steady. This is essentially important in the first steps.\n\n You have to be a foot soldier and a tactician. You're still deadly with Makarov, except you'll run out of ammo fairly quickly. So, be the distraction for a few battles. Flank your enemies and let the AI finish them off but DO try to get them. You need the experience.\n\n There is A LOT of cover and LEANING. Health Regeneration middle of battle, which definitely helps.

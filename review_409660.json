There are five worlds, plus a final world. Each world consists of a few short levels and a final boss stage. The final boss has it`s own stage, meaning we don`t have to worry about getting a game over and having to get all the way back to the boss to try again. The Nostalgia Crititic is in the game, which is awesome, but dissapointingly, he doesn`t really do anything for the story, all he does is make a bunch of jokes.", "timestamp_created": 1520714572, "timestamp_updated": 1520714572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40619729": {"recommendationid": "40619729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060444475", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1520912281}, "language": "english", "review": "Immediately, I can say with confidence that this is better than the first game. The first one in my mind was great, and this one is even better. It feels like the same game, but refined and expanded upon. The characters look great, the general style looks much better. Much more detail and better shading, and it's very pleasing to look at.\n\nThe gameplay feels pretty great. They took out the other characters, opting instead for secretive gear unlocks. I quite like this. The gear can come in handy, but it's mostly used for finding other secrets. As an example; you can get a [spoiler]power glove, that gives you a melee attack. It can hurt enemies, and also punch through some walls. The range is really low and it doesn't seem to do much damage, so you'll only really use it to punch through walls to get secrets.[/spoiler]\n\nThe powerups in this game are muuuch better. The rocks are back, but they're actually kinda useful. They bounce around, meaning they can hit enemies multiple times and kill them pretty quickly. There's also a star, which levels up your gun and lets you shoot a spread, which lasts until you get hit. You can get multiple stars if you don't get hit, and the spread gets bigger; which is pretty rewarding to people that are good at the game. \n\nThere are many more levels, making it feel longer than the first one. There isn't a boss at the end of each level anymore, with there being specific boss stages instead. I think this works a lot better. You can choose which path you want to go down, with the level selection being a nod to Mario 3 on the NES. It's good for getting all the gear you need to unlock, if you already know where it is. Some stages are muuuch more difficult than others, and there isn't really a way to tell. Luckily, your lives go back up every time you try a new level, so experimenting isn't much of an issue.\n\nThe game runs pretty smoothly, but there were a few cases where my frames DIPPED for a second or two. I dunno if this is because of my laptop or just poor optimization, but it never happened to me during the first game. Either way, it never happened too often.\n\nI really like how distinct the levels feel. They change the look of everything in the level for aesthetic. The background, tiles, death blocks, enemies, etc. They all feel like they correspond to the theme of each chapter, and it works wonderfully. \n\nYes, there are still death blocks. They don't pop up as frequently though, and most of the really hard sections with them are in the optional secret sections. Except the final level, that one was a s s.\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/inv06n And this part. Screw this part. I hate it. \n\nI think this game has a better sense of humour. There isn't the same death screen as the first game. He doesn't spout randomly generated text each time. You simply die, and respawn. It's smooth. Also, when a boss spouts dialogue and you die, they don't repeat it. The boss simply starts. It's small stuff like that, that really makes your experience feel a little less aggrivating. \n\nIt's better than the original, and worth a buy in my book.", "timestamp_created": 1520384593, "timestamp_updated": 1520384925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40536116": {"recommendationid": "40536116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281834191", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515934552}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as difficult as I.

It's kinda fun, but there are a lot of parts where it's a not buy and where it might be for you.\n\n\n\nPros:\n1. Controls are so much better from the original, now we have more fluid control with the Nerd character.\n2. Can now wall jump which can save your ass if your about to fall to doom-gloom.\n3. Upgrades, you don't get them after every boss, but it's still a nice addition to the game.\n4. You can use pretty much any controller you want, even a SNES controller like me, not just a Playstation or Xbox 360 controller.\n5. Graphics are better than the original in my opinion, that's subjective for some.\n6. There are pretty cool mechanics such as the colour switching on the 2nd level of the Ghost n' goblin level, from Black & White to colour for platforms to appear, that's pretty cool.\n\nCons:\n1. Lag. Some parts in the game where lag makes it unplayable like the Ninja Gaiden levels for example.\n2. Unfair deaths, example, the ghost n' goblin levels with the thwomps, sometimes they crush you out of no where after a stress inducing part of the level.\n3. The writing got worse, the original game had pretty good writing, but now there are stuff in the game that the Nerd never mentioned in his AVGN reviews such as Sexforce, maybe I'm missing something, but the Nerd never said anything about that in his videos.\n4. Some enemies from repeated from the original game, wish they made more new enemies.\n5. I get sick of toilet humour after some time, but pretty the whole game is toilet humour. It just annoys me, but now I'm just being nit-picky.\n6. The music sounds like a drunk DJ it playing around with the record, music is subjective, you might think it's the best music in the world, but I like music with a little more substance. sorry if I sound \"hipsterish\".\n\n\n\nIf you still want this game, I would wait for it to go on sale which I did, and yes, I do realize they're referencing the nerd's experence with bad nes games, but horrible game mechanics don't make a game fun or even funny. I feel like they're nudging their elbow at me thinking I would get it, I do get it, but it's not funny when a game is purposly bad just to be a joke, I would expect it from a 16 year old making a bad game for the \"lol's\".

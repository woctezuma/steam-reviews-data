Here you control Princess Remedy, a healer, who is out into this world to heal all the people. It has a nice ZX Spectrum style to it, graphically. Maybe audio, but I am not familar enough with that platform. None the less, in jRPG-like overworld you just walk around, discovering hidden passages, grabbing powerups from chests and interacting with NPCs to start the healing proccess.\n\nAnd healing process? Something new and smart? Naaaah, it's just your usual shooter. Think of Robotron 2084. Sorta. You run around arena, killing all enemies. Shooting non-stop where you are facing.

The game is short and can be completed in about an hour (or a little sooner, or longer depending on your skill level). Best of all it's free and a great time killer.\n\n[b]Story[/b] 7/10\n[b]Characters[/b] 8.5/10\nThe story of Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt isn't complex or deep (which is understandable for such a short game), but it does offer fun and witty dialogue from the various \"sick\" NPCs you'll come across that will make you crack a smile or offer up an unexpected giggle. It is worth reading the dialogue from each character you come across as this is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game that helps immerse yourself into Hurtworld.\n\n[b]Art[/b] 8/10\n\nThe game offers a nostalgic feeling with its unique twist on the pixel art genre, with familiarities to character looks of older Gameboy games like Pok\u00e9mon. It's interesting to look at and simple in style (also very cute). The game gives life and anthropomorphizes creatures such as flowers and chests which only increases its charm, making it feel whimsical.\n\nThere is one thing I can critique in terms of the art, is that some things can be hard to make out what they initially are, taking away a bit of the magic as you sit and try to guess what you're looking at. But this doesn't happen often and most things can be clearly understood.\n\n[b]Music and Sounds[/b] 5/10\n\nThe music and sounds in the game are average. Not bad, but not really impressive either. Only a couple sounds stick out in my memory since I've played. This isn't an important aspect of the game and doesn't take away from my rating, as most of the fun comes from the gameplay.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] 9/10\n\nThe gameplay is very fun and somewhat addicting, leaving you wanting more after you finish the game. As you heal people and come across chests you unlock hearts and power-ups to make Princess Remedy stronger and unlock various zones by doing so. It's a Bullet Hell genre and can be challenging, even on a normal difficulty for those unfamiliar with this style of combat, but it's also forgiving and a good intro to games of a similar style. One of the most interesting and fun parts of this game for me [i]personally[/i] is the secrets you can unlock and find along the way. A favorite game series of mine is The Legend of Zelda and finding those hidden chests and pathways always ignites a feeling of happiness from me. This game offers both of those aspects. There are multiple hidden chests, NPCs, and paths to search for while playing. The game also offers multiple endings and you can marry whoever (or whatever) you want!\n\n[b]Overall[/b] 8/10\n\nIn total I average the game a 8/10, not counting the music section as it neither added or took away from my experience.", "timestamp_created": 1501884061, "timestamp_updated": 1501884061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33978003": {"recommendationid": "33978003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205213527", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510602777}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c9 um jogo muuuuuuito bom, com uma trilha sonora \u00f3tima, cria um ambiente bem legal e voc\u00ea n\u00e3o quer mais parar de jogar.

Which is surprising since it\u2019s really short. Like less than an hour short. It\u2019s still going to be a short review but still.\n\nStory:\n\nYou are Princess Remedy and you must travel across Hurtland to heal the Prince who is suffering from something terrible. And along you can heal people suffering from illness, confusion, stubbed toes, questioning their identity, loneliness and death to name a few.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game is top down and you have to explore areas for people who are not well. Simply talk to one of them and you have to battle what\u2019s bothering them. You are constantly shooting you healing tool and heal when your not being hit.  In terms of the enemies, like any good game they are simple to identify and know what to do against. At first you fight simple boulders that chase you and breadcrumb mine but soon you fight bats who randomly at high speeds and slime balls that fire a volley in short burst. \nSince you only have the one attack, the only strategy is to know who can do what. One tip I can give is to explore every area you have access to before you talk to anyone as you can find chests which contain upgrades like Multi which increase the number of shots fired or Flasks which increases the number of grenades you can use per fight.\nI also think I should mention the hard setting, cause it\u2019s not just faster enemies. All of them are replaced with harder version of themselves like the breadcrumbs can charge up three shots at once and many foes that didn\u2019t fire bullets do now. And Master(Which I didn\u2019t do) is everything being fast.\n\nPresentation:\nThe music is pretty enjoyable. Nothing that can get into your head but its some nice 8-bit tracks. I also like the simple outline graphics but that\u2019s because I like cute stuff. I think the style they were going with was Gameboy cause it not NES and Atari graphic would be an insult to this game.\n\nVerdict:\nAlthough it\u2019s so short I beat the game twice in less than two hours, I see very little, or anything wrong with it.\n\n10/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1500739838, "timestamp_updated": 1500739838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33714492": {"recommendationid": "33714492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397477933", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500743198}, "language": "english", "review": "quero ganhar conquista", "timestamp_created": 1500708027, "timestamp_updated": 1500708027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33698223": {"recommendationid": "33698223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262678607", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500643297}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "PERFEITO", "timestamp_created": 1500648491, "timestamp_updated": 1500648491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33678063": {"recommendationid": "33678063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043623244", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500575560}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game!

As an avid fan of Ittle Dew, this was a lovely return to the childlike simplicity and challenge from Ludosity.\n\n[h1]How Very NESs[/h1]\n\nAs someone who grew up in the N64/GameCube era of videogames, it\u2019s rare for a game that harkens back to NES era graphical fidelity and gameplay simplicity to captivate me with so much nostalgia. Immediately as the game launches, the main theme puts you under its spell much like launching StarTropics with the feeling of wanting to go explore the world. What follows is a harmless adventure as you rid the land of its ills by blasting away all the suffering across the land with the healing magic of Princess Remedy. The kind of magic that involves shooting lasers, explosive flasks and dodging projectiles while your cure the ironic symptoms out of your patients. \n\nThe gameplay is sort of a mix-up of various classic NES games; it\u2019s a 2D shooter/bullet-hell adventure that uses the original Star Fox controls for combat of movement guiding your automated attacks with Dr. Mario\u2019s enemy designs in battle sequences and a simplified Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest/Star Tropics overworld to explore. Each encounter feels tailored to the situation plaguing the patient with a scaling level of challenge that gets only more complicated the higher you go on the difficulty scale to Master. Eventually, it ends in a gauntlet of a final boss with multiple forms that requires you to be at your very best to beat the game. (And then you can choose who to marry from anyone you\u2019ve met throughout the entire game to be your king/queen.)\n\nLike its roots, Princess Remedy is a rather short game that has NES-Level Difficulty if you raise the challenge up to Master Rating as a Normal run will probably last you over three-quarters of an hour of a quality time. Whether you crave something entertainingly simple, challenging or charming, there\u2019s something for everyone to enjoy within this offering to interest you in buying the prequel.\n\n[h1]No Negative Nancies? What Gives? Who Are You?[/h1]\n\nAs a free game any issues I have with the gameplay itself is something I feel is mitigated by how short and to the point is Princess Remedy, and I figured any complaints I would have would better be used in the prequel as that costs money to purchase as well as being a more full experience. \n\nHowever, there are a few technical/gameplay issues that are the result of Game Maker. For starters, the game has a weird one-button limitation with various buttons to choose that can bring up the menu when you want to run or interact with someone as everything is mapped to one button. The game also has a weird technical issue where if you launch it not in safe-mode the game takes a lot longer to close as it doesn\u2019t appear on the task manager, so you should try relaunching the game in safe-launch until it shows your Steam profile is not in a game. The screenshots are also bewilderingly screwed up to ruin any memento snapshots you\u2019d want to savor for later, which is fine as the Print Screen Button + Paste still works with nothing lost. All of these issues are addressed in the sequel, so I feel it\u2019s fine to mention them here in case they dissuade others from purchasing these gems.\n\n[h1]Tippsie Is My Waifu Potion-holic[/h1]\n\nLike the potions from Ittle Dew\u2019s companion, there\u2019s something magically addicting about Princess Remedy from its concoction of simplicity, goodwill and its kick that will have you hankering for more. And unlike reality, there are no hangovers from having too much of a good thing. \n\nOnce it\u2019s over and the magic vanishes from the realization that it\u2019s at the end you\u2019ll be discarded for someone else to supply his endless desire for more. Sadly, it\u2019s the natural order and no one can sate Tip\u2014I mean, Princess Remedy the game forever.", "timestamp_created": 1499779158, "timestamp_updated": 1499779170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574516", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33442979": {"recommendationid": "33442979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070900650", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499725737}, "language": "french", "review": "Honn\u00eatement je ne pensais pas retoucher ce jeu apr\u00e9s 18 minutes pass\u00e9 dedans.\n\nEt puis aujourd'hui j'ai fini le jeu en \u00e0 peine une heure.\nA ce stade j'aurais d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis un pouce rouge, le premier.\n\nMais comme vous pouvez vous en apercevoir , j'ai plut\u00f4t aim\u00e9 le jeu.\n\nLe gameplay est simple mais la difficult\u00e9 est croissante.\nLe design est sommaire mais il est adapt\u00e9 au contexte (\u00e0 savoir soigner les gens quelque soit leurs probl\u00e9mes)\nL'histoire est banale mais la combat final est symbolique\n\nEt puis zut \u00e0 la fin [spoiler] tu deviens reine et tu peux marier n'importe quel \u00eatre vivant que tu as gu\u00e9ri.

Somehow Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt could hold it's own against those $60 games.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nPrincess Remedy's gameplay is mainly found in the combat, which plays like a bullet-hell, with a bit of puzzles mixed into the mix.\n\nYou fight a cast of enemies who vary depending on the person you are healing, each with their own strategy and weakness.\n\nThe fights get more difficult as you get more powerful.\n\nIt's simple, but it works.\n\nWhat I liked the most was that losing meant nothing! Every time you fail to cure someone you can just try again! This doesn't work well for every game, but it works well here.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\n\nThe story in Princess Remedy is as generic as it gets and is basically all put out on the table for you before you even get to play.\n\nYou go on a quest to save a princess...\n\nExcept he's a prince...\n\nAnd you use the power of modern medicine...\n\nFabulous.\n\nAlong the way you unlock the next areas with \"hearts\". \"Hearts\" are earned by helping out people with their troubles, which is where the real story comes in.\n\nYou find people troubled by all sorts of ailments and most of them are hilarious.\n\nYou'll find a slime who only smells a little, a flower who needs confidence to tell a tree to get out of his way so he can get sunlight, and a man who's face melted after getting to close to the sun.\n\nThis game genuinely made me laugh, multiple times, which cannot be said of many games.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but it also leads to many hilarious moments.\n\nI will say though, the game's ending revealed how much of the game you beat. I was informed I had only completed 97% and, after wandering aimlessly for another 10 minutes, couldn't find any of the hearts I was missing... \n\nOther than that the only real problem I had with the story was the length! I finished this game in just over an hour!\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are charming. Everything about them screams \"old school\".\n\nAt one point in time I tried to learn how to create pixel art. I was told it was the art of creating beauty through limitations. This game takes it's limitations and makes it it's strength.\n\nFrom the enemies, to the overworld, to your attacks, everything is simplistic yet dazzling.\n\nMy favorite bit of pixel art are the attacks made by Princess Remedy. Her attacks start off as band-aids, then pills, shots, and eventually sparkles, each wonderfully animated. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack:[/h1]\n\nI played this game talking with a friend who was also playing Princess Remedy and one of our favorite parts was the music.\n\nFrom the moment you hit the title screen to the second you beat the game, you are in for a great time. The music is spot on and matches the theme of each level perfectly.\n\nYou can listen to the soundtrack [url=https://soundcloud.com/dothaku/sets/princess-remedy-in-a-world-of-hurt]here[/url]. My favorite track was [url=https://soundcloud.com/dothaku/rising-hero?in=dothaku/sets/princess-remedy-in-a-world-of-hurt]Rising Hero[/url], which will probably be my next ringtone. \n\n[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]\n\nThere are multiple different difficulty settings and easter eggs to find, which makes the replay value decent, but unless you feel like playing the game multiple times, which isn't a problem considering it can be beaten in about an hour, there isn't much to do.\n\n[h1]Other Recommendations:[/h1]\n\nThe obvious recommendation is Undertale.\n\nFrom the very begging you can see the signs. The art style, the bullet-hell gameplay, and the lovable, funny characters. Some say that this was full on copying, but I don't stand on that side of the argument.\n\nOther than that, not much comes to mind, but it does have a sequel, which might be worth a look.\n\n[h1]Pricing:[/h1]\n\nAh, yes. The icing on the cake.\n\nIt's free.\n\nNow, hold on. I will say that I don't like free games getting a pass because thy're free. I've played MANY terrible  free games, but thankfully this one does not fall into that category.\n\nThis game is a bit of a hidden gem, most likely because of the fact that it's free.

Your job as Princess Remedy, physician extraordinaire, is to cure afflictions by navigating screens full of baddies and auto-firing them into oblivion while tossing healing flasks and avoiding damage.\n\nThe gameplay is a turbo-drive romp through pixellated forests and towns with intentionally limited color depth; the music uses every one of its eight bits to rock out to the tune of your superstar curing prowess. Your projectiles transform and multiply as you become more efficient at healing, while your hearts and regeneration increase, allowing you to take more hits from nasty germs and carcinogens.\n\nSerious business goes out the window straight away: a jealous chest won't let you open it if you've opened other chests before it but will still accept your hand in marriage; NPCs are given colorful names such as \"Some Girl\" and \"Moonbunny\"; and years of estrangement can be righted in one fell swoop with a box of chocolates. Who need reality, anyways?\n\nA disproportionately high number of levels can be defeated by simply standing still which is offset by the moderate level of Bullet Heck present in some of the more challenging screens.

This obviously isn't the reason you play the game though.  It's for the very quirky humor it employs as you explore the land in RPG style and battle the infections in a mix of Bomber Man and arcade shooter style.  Each battle consists of a basic configuration of enemies and possibly breakable blocks designed for various challenge levels.  They are over quickly, which is good as you aren't really punished for failing and can retry quickly until you get it.  I didn't really care about the multiple ending aspect, but I will give credit where it's due, as that is a high degree of versatility and effort to put in when they certainly didn't need to.  It also allows for more humor for someone who might have a personal favorite NPC they want to check on this way.  All in all it's a very nice game that does what games are supposed to.

It takes around 1-2 hours to finish.\n\nPros:\n- Short, unusual story\n- Low system requirements and small download size\n- Over 50 different characters, each with unique illness, healing level and story about it\n- Customizable difficulty (Normal, Hard, Master)\n- Music is pretty nice\n- Secret rooms and collectible upgrades\n- 3 save files\n\nNeutral:\n- Graphics probably wont appeal to everyone, however they do give special charm to game, and it looks and sounds like something you would play on Gameboy\n- Short and simple, some people like diversity\n- No equipment nor money, only thing you collect are the keys for doors and upgrades from chests and cured characters instead of collecting money/equipment. Every upgrade is direct non customizable upgrade, that means you cant lower your stats if for some reason you want to (f.e if you want harder challenge at some parts of the game)\n\nCons:\n- 30 FPS cap\n- No achievements\n- It seems like some healing levels are either alot harder or alot easier for the part of the game (town) they are in, it starts somewhere in midgame\n- Alot of flashing lights, can cause headache if you play with Fullscreen\n- Maybe could use a little bit of customization for character, couple of outfits or something, but its not a big deal", "timestamp_created": 1476013733, "timestamp_updated": 1476013733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25939881": {"recommendationid": "25939881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334134341", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481170763}, "language": "english", "review": "Had a lot of fun playing this.

Whether it was the lack of significant meaningful choice in deckbuilding in Card City Nights or providing not quite enough information to the player in PsyCard* leading to a lot of feeling like success or failure came down to random chance. Luckily, Daniel Remar had his hand in this particular stew so I  dove right in.\n\nFirst off, I love the graphic style of this game. The 2-color 16x16 tiled canvas has some amazing pixel work to create a vibrant world where everything is nicely readable and with the sort of visual acuity that makes it easy to navigate. \n\nIn general, the gameplay is pretty good, you travel the land seeking out people who are suffering from various maladies and 'cure' them by taking part in a single-screen arena shooter match. It plays out sort of like a twin-stick shooter like Robotron or Smash TV, except for the part where there's a second stick, and that's where Princess Remedy sort of falls apart. It's not terrible, you only can shoot in the direction you're facing, but it adds a layer of challenge that's not really needed for this style of gameplay. And it's not that the various stages are really all that difficult outside of Master difficulty doing no-chests up to the secret chest, and then again at the last boss doing 101%.\n\nThe point is it just feels bad, even an old game like Robotron knew you needed to be able to control your gun independantly of your character! The hitbox on Remedy also feels off, which again for the vast majority of gameplay isn't really an issue, but she's a chunky sprite and there are times when it seems like she can squeeze between certain bullet patterns and other times when she gets hit. There not a good feeling of how many invincibility frames (if any) you get after being hit too, and sometimes bullets seem to do wildly different amounts of damage, though I suspect there's a bit of either overlapping bullets happening or some bullets are just allowed to hit the player more than once. Whichever it is, it's really too bad because it turns the game from feeling challenging to just feeling arbitrary.\n\nAgain, this is really only important at the highest difficulty the game provides. All in all, these issues don't completely spoil the game and I would certainly recommend Princess Remedy to anyone looking for a fun little game with tons of style. And I'm certainly looking forward to trying the sequel.\n\n*While I can't really recommend this game, there's a super fun dungeon crawer style minigame that comes with it that's really fun and it's almost baffling they didn't make that into a full fledged game experience.", "timestamp_created": 1475731980, "timestamp_updated": 1475731980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25878767": {"recommendationid": "25878767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119650302", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475720962}, "language": "english", "review": "Is good.", "timestamp_created": 1475722255, "timestamp_updated": 1475722255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25863216": {"recommendationid": "25863216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013488751", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475634117}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game worth your time, but not without its flaws.

Still enough to make me smile. You're healing people by destroying various representations of what's wrong with them, which takes the form of a bullet-helly sort of shooter. Ends with a bizarre multi-stage boss fight. \n\nOther than the very short length, the only real detractor is the control scheme. You can WASD or arrow key around, and escape is the \"cancel out of menu\" button, and literally every other button is the action button. Pressing these will enter a menu, select things within the menu, and pressing and holding it while pressing one of the directional keys will make you run. This means that often I'd be trying to run, but press the buttons out of sequence by a split second and end up nearly saving and quitting. It's a short game and not a huge deal, but it was a pain, and as feedback for the dev for future titles, I would advise against this hyper-simplified control scheme. My recommendation would be to have one rebindable button for action, one rebindable button for cancel, and one rebindable button for run.

While not as in depth as Undertale takes it's narrative, gameplay and morality system, it still feels as fun to play, boasts a great soundtrack and offers one heck of a good time! \n\n    Starting with three difficulty options, Princess Remedy leaps from Saturn(?) and safely lands in A World of Hurt. In this world almost everyone is ill and Princes Remedy is the only one who possesses the cure. Enter \u201cHealing Mode\u201d after talking to a disease stricken NPC and get ready for some action! Ms. Remedy only shoots forward, which happens automatically. She just shoots nonstop. It's kinda funny. She's also equipped with healing flasks that act as grenades when pressing the action button. Don't worry, the action button is every button on the controller.\n \n   The shoot-em up segments ramp up in difficulty at a smooth pace and the game never feels too difficult out of nowhere. When you find a segment to be too difficult, just try helping someone else. Each time you finish curing someone, you are granted more hearts, or health, to help you on your journey. In addition to completing healing modes, you can find chests throughout the game that give you other stat boosting goodies.\n \n    Remember, it's free. Totally free and clocking in just under two hours for me on normal difficulty, you're not going to loose much. The soundtrack pulled me right in and once the gameplay picked up I couldn't put the controller down. The challenge made me want to keep trying to continue, but never became too difficult to make me stop. I had such a good time I've started a second playthrough on a higher difficulty setting. I'm not bashful to say that I fell in love with this game. I want to recommend this to anybody, but maybe it will only appeal to hardcore players.

A lot of people have been comparing it to Undertale and I can see why. I can't think of a line that I didn't enjoy, the characters had really cute designs, and while the game has fights where it can be really difficult/annoying it never really gets to the point of the Undyne and Sans genocide fights where some people can just drop the game because they've been trying to beat it for so long and just can't. The story is as cute as the characters and it fits really well with how short the game is. A normal run takes about an hour to complete (at least for me, but I got adjusted to the always shooting mechanic really quickly) and only a little bit longer if you're going for the special normal run. I was listening to my own music for the most part but for the moments when I was listening to the music it really fit the aesthetic of the game. \n\nMisc. good things:\nA protagonist that isn't straight but it isn't like a huge deal or anything.\nSo many endings (none that really affect that much, it just gives certain characters a few extra lines. So no one should really feel that pressured to get every ending like someone that is playing a game like Undertale might be).\nHumor that can range from witty to really stupid but is lovable either way. \nThere was really only one fight that I found annoying but it was clear that it was one that was supposed to be difficult (and no it wasn't the final boss).\nI'm not a parent or anything but I can see this being a really good game to play with kids (as far as I can remember there isn't any dirty jokes or anything so if you're someone that worries about that kind of stuff this game is good to go). \n\nMisc. bad things:\nI can't really think of that much??\nI imagine some people won't enjoy the graphics or music.\nI can also see the colors getting a little straining if you're struggling with certain fights or trying to find something.\nSome people wouldn't find some things funny or cute or anything (the biggest one I can think of is the character sprite being on just like a black square that moves around. Personally I found it really cute/charming, but I know some people that found it irritating/annoying).\n\nBut yeah, overall I would recommend this game.

Fans of [i]Undertale[/i] will appreciate the game's sense of humor, and its gameplay is similar. For players familiar with the bullet hell genre, [i]Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt[/i] will be quite easy. A warm up exercise, maybe. But for the casual gamer, this is a fun hour or two. Your time with the game will go by fast regardless.\n\nDespite this, I don't wish the game was any longer. Hidden upgrades to look for and the multitude of short dialogues you can get for the game's ending were a nice addition that could take away some of the monotony from replays.\n\nIn addition, this game has more variety and complexity in its types of enemies than some triple-A titles I've played this year, with undoubtedly less code than said big budget titles. Another refreshing difference is that the game barely holds your hand. Only your controls are explained, involving a single button's functions, and the four directions. The player heads out into the world and just starts playing. Despite having not informed the player of what certain enemies do, he or she can figure out their behaviors and easily learn them all, without the game using a character like Megaman X's Alia to instruct the player on what to do. This element of [i]Remedy[/i] makes it a charming re-creation of the good side of games from the era of the Commodore vic-20 and 64 to the NES, with less repetition and punishing difficulty, and more variety.\n\nMy only problem was that the game was not resizeable, but simply zoomed in. Up close, it seemed less sharp. This was less of a problem and more of a slight annoyance, which disappeared when I sat back on my couch with a controller, further away from the screen.\n\n[i]Remedy[/i] is a great demonstration of the developer's understanding of game design, and a fine example of what they can do in a very short amount of time.\n\nOn my first run, I achieved a 92% completion rate in under an hour. Following this, I spent almost the same amount of time to write my review. If nothing else does, I hope the time I took to tell you to play this game can be an indicator that you should at least try it out.

In the whole game you have one big goal to complete. Also i like the little details the developer has put in the game, where your actions are a cause of something. I love games with those tiny matters. It really makes a difference in the gameplay.\n\nWhat i didn't like about the game, was that it was short!

Needless to say, this game was more than I ever could have expected.\n\nThe story is incredibly simple, but seeing as this game is only about an hour long, its still very satisfying and enjoyable. This game has a very large number of endings, each determined by whom you decide to marry at the end of the game, it's honestly astounding how many people you can marry, and its clear that a lot of effort and heart was put into the endings, as you can marry just about every NPC in the game, plus some stuff that isn't even NPC's! \n\nThe game itself is litered with fun secrets, hidden rooms, secret passages, etc. Plus a short sidequest near the end. The NPC diolouge is quirky and enterntaining, all of these help increase how immersive and captivating this game is.\n\nPR in a World of Hurt is home to some extremley addicting shoot-em-up gameplay. There are three levels of difficulty- Normal, Hard and Master. Normal mode is pretty easy, but the two higher levels provide a real challenge for fans of bullet-hell senarios or people just looking for an excuse to snap their keyboard over their knee. Attempting to get a 101% on master is seriously one of the most painful and frustrating things I've ever done, but it's still loads of fun doing so. Throughout the game, you can collect upgrades by opening chests, which make you more powerful in a variety of ways. This leads into yet another way the game excells, it is paced perfectly. Even though you get stronger as the game progresses, the enemies and situations you are put in still get progressively more difficult, starting at pushover in the begging and get to decently challenging towards the end. You never feel overpowered or that the game is rigged against you (Except in master).\n\nPrincess Remedy in a World of Hurt, while it may be very short, it's honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had on Steam, or PC gaming as a whole, and games like this are a shining beacon of the possibilities of Indie games. This game is only about 50MB, installs almost instantly, and best of all, it's absolutley free!

Cuenta con 40 a 60 minutos como maximo de juego, en el que encarnaremos una princesa que acaba de terminar su preparaci\u00f3n en las artes de la curaci\u00f3n, empezaremos en un poblado en el que acumularemos experiencias a base de sanar los habitantes, con lo que sumaremos suficientes puntos \"corazones\" como para poder pasar a una nueva zona.[/i]\n\n[*][b]Interfaz:[/b]\nEl videojuego cuenta con un conjunto simple y de facil entendimiento, acorde con su estilo retro. No obstante, la cantidad reducida de comandos in-game hace de que se generen ciertas incomodides sobretodo al abrir y cerrar el menu de juego y estadisticas.\n\n[*][b]Sonido:[/b]\nPara su estilo retro maneja una cantidad limitada de temas, no logrando as\u00ed una ambientaci\u00f3n acertada de los lugares en los cuales nos encontramos a lo largo de nuestro viaje. Despues de un tiempo vagando en algunas zonas, la musica de fondo empieza a irritar.\n\n[*][b]Graficos:[/b]\nEstilo retro, como se ha dicho, los graficos espectaculares no entran en esta categoria. Este videojuego esta orientado a usuarios que se sienten familiarizados con este tipo de graficas apelando a la nostalgia de los videojuegos de anta\u00f1o. Si hay algo que tocar es el brillo excesivo de los colores, siendo estos muy agresivos a la vista. Saturaci\u00f3n de colores muy lograda tipico de este estilo de videojuegos.\n\n[*][b]In-game:[/b]\nCuenta con un sistema de batalla al puro estilo arcade de naves espaciales, con enemigos variados representando los agentes patogenos que infectan a nuestros incautos pacientes. Los \"disparos\" de nuestra protagonista iran evolucionando a medida de que avancemos.\n\nLos habitantes de las distintas zonas son muy variados, desde humanos, flores y animales silvestres, hasta momias y seres extraterrestres.\n\nLa Princesa Remedios (Remedy) no esta explotada sexualmente, su atractivo es figurativo y te da la sensaci\u00f3n de ser una mujer entusiasta, calida y de buen coraz\u00f3n. Esto impulsa al jugador a llegar hasta el final del videojuego, a pesar de las molestias que puedan causar algunos temas repetitivos y colores agresivos de ciertas etapas.\n\nDebes encontrar todas las cajas con \"corazones\" en su interior para poder continuar, aunque algunas de estas cajas sean un \"secreto\" encontrarlas, dejando de ser algo meramente opcional.\n\nTiene un sistema de teletransporte con destino a todas las zonas del mundo, que iras desbloqueando a medida que avances en el juego. No muy util si tenemos en cuenta que la zona inicial una vez completada no se vuelve a tocar.\n\nJefe final con cuatro etapas, muy curioso y a pesar de que puede sonar bien, su complejidad no es mucho mayor que encuentros anteriores, no deja de ser un desafio de resistencia frente a un bombardeo constante de particulas.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]-RESUMEN-[/b][/h1]\n\n[list][b]Ventajas:[/b]\n[*]Free to play.\n[*]Apuesta original, concepto interesante.\n[*]Personajes y zonas variadas.\n[*]Dificultad decente, ofrece desaf\u00edos.\n[*]Mas de un final.\n[*]Buena optimizaci\u00f3n.\n[*]Soporte para gamepad.\n[*]Tres modos de dificultad.\n[*]Tres casillas de guardado.\n[/list]\n[list][b]Desventajas:[/b]\n[*]Banda sonora escaza y en ocasiones tediosa.\n[*]Elevado brillo en colores, en ocasiones irritante a la vista.\n[*]Comandos reducidos, limita la fluides entre el menu/inventario y el resumen del videojuego.\n[*]No hay secretos en concreto.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]Nota Final: 6,5 de 10.[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Recomendaci\u00f3n: [h1]Totalmente positiva[/h1][/b]\n[i]Un concepto original, fresco y nacido como propuesta para la[b] \"Games Against Ebola\"[/b] en el 2014.

played in a long time. It's one of those games that you play multiple times over to try and find everything. You'll rarely find such a well crafted game with so much charm. I personally love the retro stlye of gameplay and graphics, and thhis game makes me hopeful that people can still create great games that have a ton of love poured into them. Also... ITS FREE. You can finish the game in half an hour if you know it, and you can marry a flower, so why not give it a shot? (Did I mention that this is a free game? And all you need to run it is a potato computer. Like seriouslyit has one button.)", "timestamp_created": 1468053935, "timestamp_updated": 1468054175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24191643": {"recommendationid": "24191643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018555919", "num_games_owned": 1736, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468012256}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun free game.", "timestamp_created": 1468012173, "timestamp_updated": 1468012173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24190669": {"recommendationid": "24190669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053454082", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468008231}, "language": "english", "review": "It is not many a game that can ooze this much charm, look this GB-like, and get away with it.

After those ten minutes, my eyes adjusted, and the problem was no more. The bullet hell mini-games are pretty damn unique, as far as I can tell. There's a deep(ish) backstory between Remedy and Frallan(her friend from Medical School), and, minutes after being horrified at there being 64 possible endings, I could marry anyone I wanted, and could do so again, and again without having to play through the game 63 more times!

Your job is simply to heal everyone in the kingdom who has various illnesses and physical ailments.  The chests that you find will increase your hearts (your life force), shooting strength, number of shots fired at once, or the number of flasks you can throw during a single battle.  You'll also earn hearts after each battle.  Your battles consist of dodging enemies and their attacks while you auto-fire at them.  Press your lone action button to throw a flask; it takes some time to adjust to the distance they are thrown, but they are good in some encounters for clearing out multiple enemies.  Gates on the world map block your progress if you either haven't collected a certain key or enough life hearts.  Search everywhere for treasure chests!\n\nFor me, the game had sound and slowdown issues.  I received errors with DirectSound initialization, and music rarely ever played.  Also, the game would slow down dramatically during more intense battles, causing my inputs to be eaten and moves or flasks I was trying to execute simply not coming out.  This is my primary gripe; things like this shouldn't happen on a system with a 3.9 GHz hex-core processor with 12 GB of system RAM and a 2 GB video card (Windows 10, by the way).  Still, I was able to play through the entire game and beat it.  The final boss battle is very interesting and a nice test of your skills to that point.

Now, I won't say this game is perfect. It's not especially in depth and the combat system was maybe a little ~too~ simple, but for a game that was put together in four days (for charity, I might add), it's pretty freakin' good.\n\nBasically, imagine if a multi-directional shooter like Berzerk or Robotron 2084 was given an overworld. That's this game in a nutshell. The first thing you're going to notice is that this game looks like something released on the ZX Spectrum or the Amstrad CPC in the 80's, and considering you only have the directional keys and \"action button\" to work with, that's not a bad description of how it plays. In all honesty, the idea of that had me a bit wary at first, even in spite of the already mostly positive reviews it was getting. Don't get me wrong, I love retro and retro-styled games, but the simplicity of Princess Remedy put me off a little at first.\n\nBut of course the game was free, so I figured \"why not?\"\n\nI'm happy to say that the simplicity ends up working in its favor. While yes, I wish the combat system had a few more options, the game plays very smoothly even with a single button. And the graphics, while basic, are well-crafted and fun to look at (especially the titular character's portrait- she is just TOO cute).\n\nBasically, this is a game that could have gone very wrong, but exceeded my expectations.

But, in that 25 minutes of play time that I have sunk into it, I already have plenty of gripes with this game. First off, I am not a fam of the art style. I understand that they were going for something out of the normal pixel graphics indie game loop with something looking commorore/NES-esque graphical style, but it just does not work for me. Second, the difficulty spike in the beginning of the game is too much too fast. It doesn't take long to get used to, but it's so sudden I had a hard time getting used to it. But, with those problems, the game still has an unmatchable charm that is very difficult to find in most games nowadays. The music is some of the best I have heard in a long time, up there with games like Mega Man and NieR in my opinion. The gameplay is very enjoyable, combining a sort of action-rpg and bullet hell style that has plenty of problems, but is still a ton of fun to play with. The humour in this game is done very well, using plenty of references, puns, and portmanteaus to drive home the point that Ludosity wanted to make a funny game without being crude and offensive. Finally, the characters. Play for yourself to see what I mean by that.

And maybe fix up the rest of Hurtland along the way. \nGameplay is very simple, and only directional buttons and an action button are required. You simply enter various towns and caves from the overworld, and talk to sick-looking NPCs. To cure them, you must clear a small top-down shooter minigame, launching bandages at personifications of various ailments. (Unfortunately, you can only fire in the direction you are facing, but I suppose this can be attributed to style.)\nEach minigame you clear and person you heal will earn you another hit point, and various other upgrades like shot power and regeneration can be found in chests throughout the world. You'll need them, as the germs and creatures you fight will get progressively stronger. Don't worry, though- If you fail a heal-fight, you can try again with no penalty.\nThe game has some amusing visuals and a lot of funny dialogue- most of the people you heal are grappling with some sort of silly condition, like a ghost who's scared of himself and a centaur who is worried because he believes he is real. (This is reminiscient of other games from the same folks, such as Ittle Dew- the protagonists of which make a cameo in this game.)\nFinally, the heavily retro graphics may look off-putting at first, but I got used to them quickly and soon enjoyed the old-fashioned feel. I also found them to be much more colorful and identifiable than I was expecting- definitely more so than the majority of the old stuff they take inspiration from. \nOverall, Princess Remedy is a quick jaunt that is absolutely worth an hour or so of your time.

Word of advice, after you beat the boss the game goes into that marry mode people were talking about, all cured NPCs will just ask if you want to marry them (and ever single one has a little bit of added flavor text for the ending) so if you want to hear what a cured or health character says be sure to talk to them before that final boss battle.\n\nAll and all this is basically a Quality of Life update to a fun little 3-day game jam game. If you take it slow and talk to people you will likely get maybe around 3 hours. For free it is a good way to kill some time on a lazy weekend afternoon.

Vous r\u00e9coltez lors des combats ou dans des coffres des coeurs qui vous servent \u00e0 la fois de vie et de pr\u00e9requis pour ouvrir certaines portes de zones dans la grande carte. Esth\u00e9tiquement, le jeu est \u00e0 l'image de ce qui se faisait sur ZX Spectrum avec des personnages monochromes en gros pixels et une musique en chiptune. Tout est fait aux petits oignons avec beaucoup d'amour par un d\u00e9veloppeur ind\u00e9pendant seul. On encha\u00eene les combats et l'exploration en se disant toujours : \"Allez, encore un peu\", et le temps file.

Wie verzweifelt ich damals als Kind vor dem Nintendo (NES) sa\u00df ... die meisten Titel waren unbarmherzig und hart wie Dinosaurierkot. Was h\u00e4tte ich mir fr\u00fcher ein Spiel gew\u00fcnscht wie dieses! So genial simpel und zug\u00e4nglich. So witzig und motivierend. Wir spielen eine Heilerin, welche gerade ihre Ausbildung abschlie\u00dfen durfte und nun zu einer wichtigen Mission aufbrechen muss: Hurtland leidet und selbst der Prinz ist krank! Also ziehen wir los, sprechen mit putzigen NPCs, welche uns ihre skurillen Leiden schildern ... und dann geht es in den \"Kampf\": Remedy wechselt in eine Art Shooter-Modus, der an Space Invaders erinnert - dabei schie\u00dft sie automatisch Heil-Salven auf Bazillen, gebrochene Herzen und Depressionsgeister. Das einzige, was wir tun m\u00fcssen = ausweichen und gut positionieren. Dabei ist das Movement so unglaublich smooth und befriedend ... die Gegner so fair und gut balanciert ... dass es s\u00fcchtig macht. \n\nUnfassbar ... man k\u00f6nnte fast glauben, die Macher vom alten Super Mario Bros. zaubern zu sehen. Princess Remedy wirkt unheimlich professionell ... selten ein so rundes Spielerlebnis gehabt. Hier stimmt einfach alles. Dazu noch diese kurzen, knackigen Dialoge voller Charme und Witz und der absolut erstklassige Soundtrack (kann locker mit Klassikern der alten Zeit konkurrieren ... der erste Track schenkte mir einen sofortigen Ohrwurm).

But, at least the game is actually good, so it makes giving it a thumbs up easy for me.\n\nPrincess Remedy followed Princess Remedy as she goes to Hurtland and heals everyone living in it. The story is pretty repetitive, as you just walk around, talk to a monster, fight the virus, then talk to them again. There are plenty of exploration options though, as there are some pretty decently-laid secrets (but some are just flat-out obvious). The gameplay is honestly what kept me playing for so long. It's basically like the fight against Mettaton in Undertale, where in you dodge random sh**, while shooting said sh**. It does start out simple, but as you continue the viruses you fight get harder and harder... except for the boss. He was surpsingly easy. Really, really easy. But the gameplay is still enjoyable. For a game made by so few people, it sounds well and looks fine (almost like Link's Awakening if it were made for Atari).\n\nAgain, the graphics aren't perfect. There's very little actual animation in the world of Hurtland, the process of talking to people to find out a punch line after beating their virus gets old after a while.

Gave the game a shot and figured out all there is to the game in just a few minutes. Your task is to heal the king from his sadness, however on your way you encounter lots of people / otherwise that need helping - with sometimes funny comments. Once you choose to help you end up in a rather small environment with your character shooting \"vitality\" towards all the nasty enemies. \n\nThink of it as Binding of Isaac without having to fire, and without the ability to aim where you shoot. And that last is the part that didn't quite appeal to me at first. I got quite used to running around and simultaneously shoot in different directions altogether, that it felt quite frustrating at first. However ignoring this, it allowed me to enjoy the rest of the otherwise short game.\n\nConsidering it's cheap price tag - erhh, free I definitely recommend this game. Would have even bought it!\n\nTL;DR - Install it, play it for five minutes. If you like it, keep going through the journey - there isn't much else to it, and it's quite short anyway - if you didn't like the first few minutes then don't bother going through with it.

For a game made in a game jam (and then edited some afterwards) this is much more in-depth than I expected! True, the game only takes around an hour to complete, but then there's higher difficulties and the multitude of endings possible (each one is only different by like two sentences but still) and plenty of secrets. I only beat it once at time of writing but I plan on trying the other diffitulties and getting 100%, as I only got 97%.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple: heal people. You talk to them to see their problem(s) and shoot at them with your healing abilities in a 2D shooter/bullet hell format. It's kind of weird due to the fact that you always shoot in the direction you're facing and you can't change it, but I think it adds to the difficulty. Speaking of, this game's difficulty is strangely up-and-down. For the first couple of areas I was breezing through them like a Nascar driver on speed, but suddenly I had to try some healing again and again because of how much the difficulty increased suddenly. Then a bit later, it became easy street again. Then hard. It's all over the place, but it's not bad since losses don't have penalties. \n\nThe story is simple: heal everybody, and heal the Prince! There's not much of a story, but there doesn't need to be. Older games that this is mimicing generally had about this much of a story, if not less, so it emulates it well. All of the characters you speak to have some really funny lines, and I feel like the comedy was done well. Whenever I think \"that joke has kind of become slightly overused,\" the joke ends and another begins. That's key to good comedy. \n\nGet the game. It's 10mb, free, and fun. The only reason you wouldn't get this game is if you prefer story to gameplay or graphics to fun. I honestly feel like playing it for free was a steal, and I should have paid for this. Could there at least be a little DLC that's like $1 that includes artwork and a thank you note? I'd pay for it, even if it was more than $1. Would you believe me if I said it was made by (I think) 4 people! Crazy!\n\n(rant about how I like the graphics)\nI hear my friends sometimes complain about the graphics of older games with one phrase sticking out to me: \"it looks like it was made in the 70s,\" (what someone actually said about Fallout 3). This game actually looks like it was made in the 70s, but that doesn't hinder the game at all. It probably gives it a cute charm.

You explore a world in a 3rd person view similar to Breath Of Fire and Pokemon; in which you open chests to obtain objects that help advance your stats, and initiating \"battles\" passively when you encounter a sick NPC.The battles are known as \"Healing mode\" in which you face off enemy viruses by controlling the direction your princess moves and also where she fires \"medicine\". Another \"weapon\" you have are flasks which can be thrown as grenades. Enemies range from non-moving patches to gliding ghosts that shoot stuff at you, trying to cut down your health bar. In later levels, the amount of enemy fire thrown your way could easily pass for a bullet- hell game. \nThe dialogue is hillarious with NPCs giving various funny reasons for their sicknesses and the ending offers many, many possibilities.\nTotally would reccommend.

I got a huge nostalgia blast from playing this game. It reminded me of a few games I used to play when I was younger. The characters are interesting and cute, and I love that they each have their own little personality to them. First glances at this game may make you turn your head away, or just seem pessimistic about the game like I was. It wasn't until I started playing the game where I found it quite fun! The gameplay is mostly easy, with a few challenging moments mixed in. I loved the final boss. It was an interesting change to the other character's fights, but while keeping the same aspects of the regular fight.  I also love that the ending has a few different lines for every character. That made me want to travel back around the world to see all of the different endings. The music was quite entertaining as well! I do reccomend this game for anyone who's interested in short RPG games, or just something to pass the time. It's free too, which is a huge bonus! However, if you were to make a sequel to this game, I would suggest that you make it a paid game. I would've paid for this game if I had watched a few gameplay videos first.

It is crime that this game is free \u2014 I want to buy it.\n\nYou can call this game \u201cone-stick healer\u201d: you play as a princess wandering through the little world populated only with ill creatures. And you are healing them with magic in an one-stick shooter sequences. It\u2019s very short but nice, charming and a little nostalgic experience. Hell, I have spent more time writing this review than clearing the game (~1.0 hour), and you've probably spent more time reading reviews, when you can just play the damn game instead (it free).\n\nGameplay: You wander around a small world, open chests and heal different characters. Healing is simple: after a small dialog with an ill NPC, you will appear in the arena with enemies and obstacles. Objectives: do not die, dodge bullets and shoot every enemy. During healing sequences the princess is always shooting where she is directed at, making it a \"one stick shooter\". It's a little tricky and you should always keep it in mind. When everything (except you) is dead, NPC is healed.

Non sono esattamente la persona pi\u00f9 adatta per recensire questo gioco: \u00e8 infatti il secondo del genere che completo dopo Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Skies per Wii, e non mi sono mai definito particolarmente abile nel campo. Inoltre non conoscevo affatto Ludosity, ma dopo questa breve esperienza devo dire che mi \u00e8 venuta voglia di provare in futuro qualcos'altro di questo sviluppatore: cosa che gi\u00e0 di per s\u00e9 \u00e8 un risultato positivo. Non avendo capito molto bene fino in fondo il genere del gioco prima di iniziarlo (la grafica mi sapeva pi\u00f9 di action adventure) ho settato la difficolt\u00e0 a \"hard\", e questo ha pi\u00f9 o meno raddoppiato il tempo che ho impiegato a finirlo rispetto alla media. In ogni caso devo dire che la scala di apprendimento \u00e8 strutturata benissimo anche per un principiante assoluto come me, e le difficolt\u00e0 che si affrontano nelle parti finali risultano accattivanti ma mai frustranti. Il level design delle sessioni di bullet hell vero e proprio non \u00e8 mai ripetitivo e presenta sia variazioni sul tema della disposizione delle coperture e dei nemici, sia una vera e propria vasta gamma di avversari con abilit\u00e0 peculiari e diversi parametri di difesa/attacco. Ma non si pu\u00f2 negare che il vero fascino di Princess Remedy sia nell'immaginario e nelle logiche che reggono la sua particolare ambientazione. In particolar modo non mi capacito di come questo gioco sia potuto essere concepito in una campagna dedicata a quella che per un certo periodo di tempo era sotto gli occhi di tutti i media considerata come LA Malattia per eccellenza (l'ebola). PR \u00e8 infatti di un irriverente qualunquismo, in cui il concetto di \"cura\" che la principessa saturniana deve applicare ai \"malati\" di Hurtland \u00e8 cos\u00ec lato da far volutamente perdere i confini della patologia vera e propria, che si va a mescolare con ironia alla paturnia del momento. Raramente si incontreranno dei \"malati\" veri e propri, e l'effetto comico \u00e8 assicurato leggendo i commenti dei png accasciati nella pi\u00f9 completa costernazione: sar\u00e0 possibile curare una bambina depressa per avere solo cinque anni facendola crescere di un anno, una ragazza annoiata facendole vedere il metodo di cura, una sola con il potere dell'amicizia (?), una persona con tutti i difetti del mondo facendola diventare perfetta, un boss di un dungeon sconfitto da eroi per permettergli di conquistare il mondo, e cos\u00ec via. Senza considerare che i pazienti spesso saranno fiori, animali, o gli stessi morti, insomma: non esattamente malattie infettive, epidemie o ferite di guerra. Il finale (spoiler) a questo proposito \u00e8 veramente pazzesco, con una rappresentazione mastodontica dell'assommarsi di pi\u00f9 mali nel Principe Hingst, che ha come capo una constatazione esistenziale: possono le emozioni negative essere curate? Non sono esse dei sentori che ci garantiscono che siamo vivi? A queste domande puramente legittime il gioco mostra senza troppe storie il dito medio, con la morale che se qualcosa pu\u00f2 far star male in generale pu\u00f2 anche essere distrutta, importante o meno che sia. La scelta finale che ha colpito molti, quella del matrimonio, \u00e8 soltanto un'estensione accessoria di questo modo propagandato di vedere la realt\u00e0, in cui se qualcosa si determina in una certa maniera (in questo caso, se provoca amore), va affrontata con una modalit\u00e0 indipendente dalla configurazione della cosa in s\u00e9. In poche parole, come un dente cariato va curato come il disagio di avere un brutto nome, se amo un cane lo devo sposare come se amassi una donna. Ovviamente Ludosity gioca sull'effetto nonsense e non \u00e8 necessario esprimere un parere sul messaggio, ma, ripeto, il particolare contesto in cui questo gioco \u00e8 stato creato rende il tutto particolarmente straniante e, in un certo senso, unico.

(I have a thing for anything with a retro vibe.) I am not disappointed at all with the game.\n\nAt first, the game does seem a bit repeatitive. Basically, you've been sent down to hurtland to heal people and objects, then you hve to save your friend. First, you're thinking okay this has been done a thousands times. You start playing and then you say this game is rather easy. As you keep playing the levels get harder. When I say the levels get harder; I mean you may find some frustration with the difficulty. If playing on Normal the hard levels are hard, I can only imagine playing those same levels on Hard and Master; would be insane. \n\nThe controls using the keyboard are pretty simple. Your traditonal arrows keys and your action button which is enter, shift, control and a few other keys that I can't remember because it's simpler to use the enter key.\n\nI haven't tried this using a controller yet. When I do try it I will come back and update my review. I use a XBOX One Controller so as soon as I play it I will let you all know how it runs.\n\nI only had one issue with the game where I save and exited the game and then came back to play about 20 minutes later and it made me replay from the beginning. I tried it again the next morning because if I can't save my progress I wasn't going to replay it again for a third time from the beginning. The second time it saved. This may not have been an issue for everyone else, but it was an issue for me.\n\n Just in case you're hit with this issue I had making you restart from the beginning:\n* I had about 40 hearts when it accepted my save this time around.\n* There is also the chance that I started a new game and saved over my old one by mistake too, but since I'm not 100% sure, just thought I'd leave that tad bit of information.\n\nOverall, this game with a retro vibe is for all types of gamers who are looking for a casual game. If you need to take a break from a hardcore game you're playing this is a really good alternative to free your mind and is great for casual gamers as well.\n\nThe game is free but I would have gladly paid a few bucks for it as well.", "timestamp_created": 1452480432, "timestamp_updated": 1452519600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20461345": {"recommendationid": "20461345", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997877164", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452398872}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me an hour to 100% the game and i was satisfied.

The new features (controller support, more difficulty modes and options) are nice quality of life additions but as far as content goes it appears to be the same as the version I have sitting on my desktop. This game is still as cute and fun as I remember it to be.)\n\n-\n\nPrincess Remedy is one of the 6 or so games to come out of the recent Games Against Ebola game jam. The other games haven't been released to the public but fortunately for you and I, the fine folks at Ludosity have released it for free!\n\nThe game puts you in the role of the titular Princess Remedy, who has been sent on a mission from her home planet of Saturn to heal all the sick people in Hurtland! The various peoples of Hurtland have many ailments, ranging from sick burns to an actual lack of a body. What I'm getting at is that it's a Ludosity game. It's got their trademark playful writing and has some cameos from characters from a couple of their other games too.\n\nDespite being made in less than 4 days the game has some solid gameplay. When you heal people you go inside their bodies(?) and blast their troubles away with your Saturnian healing magic. You're constantly shooting, so you only need to focus on dodging enemies and their bullets. After you heal someone you get a heart, which increases your max health in healing mode and are also used to unlock doors to other areas. There are also other upgrades you can find in the overworld that increase your damage, the number of shots you shoot, health regen and the amount of flasks (bombs) you can carry.\n\nOh, and at the end of the game you are given the option to literally marry anyone you've healed over the course of the game. It comes straight out of left-field but it's still a neat addition since there are about 30+ characters to choose from. That's like 30 different endings! I love everything about this game and I kinda wish they would expand this game into something longer. I'm 1000% sure they probably won't but I can dream can't I?", "timestamp_created": 1452067342, "timestamp_updated": 1452067342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545298", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20343921": {"recommendationid": "20343921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053519269", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452068222}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a fun little game!

How?\n\nI played the 48 Hour jam version (which i believe didn't have the difficulty settings), and immediately, with my 5 hours in game maker pro went \"I'm going to port this.\"\nWelp, i'm sorry whoever was in charge that day, because i, of course, never came through (because porting from GM7, to GMS is the hardest thing you will ever do.) He did end up telling me they were thinking about putting it on Steam themselves, though.\n\nIn case you are wondering, i got to after the intro cutscene, before the game refused to work.\n\nAnyway, review time:\nStory: You play as princess remedy, helping cure diseases so you can become queen, and to find a suitable prince. Armed with magic bandaids and [strike] Death Grenades [/strike] healing flasks, you must heal everyone in the World of Hurt. Very simple plot, but it does the job.\n\nGameplay:  This is an Action RPG/Cute em up with no leveling or random encounters. Instead, you walk into the villiage or special area (Marked by a discolorment in the terrain), talk to people, animals, or random out of place stuff like flowers, and fight thier illnesses. after that, you get a permanent powerup. you can also find these permanent powerups in chests. The stat you need to progress is HP, as that opens gates to new areas. all fights are enjoyable with a fair enemy variety that never feels cheap, and if you die no loading screens or nothing, so you can just talk to the person/thing and get right back into the fray!  also, the final, unique boss, [spoiler] Not Kefka[/spoiler], really fits the charm of the game.\n\nMusic/Visuals: Do thier job, were intentionally simple so they could make a complete game in 48 hours. Menu music is incredible though.\n\nCureently thinking about making a youtube playthrough of this game on mastery mode. It's REALLY GOOD, could be seen as up there with Undertale, and is Free. I completed the game 5 times in the 48 hour version, and i'm one to only play a game once.\n\nGET THIS GAME/10.", "timestamp_created": 1452012801, "timestamp_updated": 1452012889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20325312": {"recommendationid": "20325312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132019463", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452021439}, "language": "english", "review": "I was surprised that a free game could be this good and charming.

It takes the old gameplay style of quake and unreal tournament and puts it into a singleplayer leaderboard based speedrunning setting. The level editor and steam workshop are added bonuses. This game really gets me \"in the zone\" and when you clear a difficult level on the 10'th try it is an absolute blast. There are various powerups distributed throughout the level that keep gameplay mechanics fresh as you go as well. The graphics are nostalgic, yet look good on modern resolutions and hardware. The music is fun and gets my heart beating.

Essentially Super Meatboy meets Metalocalypse, SEUM (briefly) tells the story of a Marty, a metal fan, who cut off Satan's hand, duct-taped it to his own arm, and descends into the depths of hell. \n\nThe game is just plain fun. That's what it is. It's fun. The game's description warns that you'll lean toward your screen as you play and its totally true. You'll tense up, feel the rush of hot air, and immerse yourself into the heavy metal landscape. \n\nSimilar to Super Meatboy, SEUM initially gives levels that show you the ropes before testing your skills. However, where Super Meatboy continued to introduce new concepts and challenges into the late game, SEUM has a comparatively limited toolbox.This makes the late game of SEUM into a puzzle platformer with an emphasis on speed. You solve the puzzles first, then come up with the fastest way to do it. While not especially unique (Quantum Conundrum did it), the game has a great simulated movement that puts you right in the moment. \n\nSpeaking of speed, I really appreciate how the game handles competitive speedrunning. Every run you make is logged into the system. Once you beat the \"Uber\" time, you can instantly see how the best people in the world run it. The great thing is that many levels have a second secertish way of solving puzzles, but the majority of levels can just barley be solved using the standard route if you have enough dexterity, training, and time. \n\nAs for art design, the soundtrack is complementary and makes the game seem faster than it really is. Satan and Marty talk to each other from level to level and have some fun quips. The devil hand looks awesome and has fingernails made of stone. The backgrounds of hell are kind of hit or miss. \nYou have 3 main regions: Generic lava landscape, dark green pit of bubbling acid with giant cheesy skeletons in cages hanging from the ceiling, and what I can only describe as Dethklok's wet dream. While the first and last areas are mostly fun to look at, the green pit isn't appealing to the eye and doesn't invoke images of hell. Additionally, there's really nothing to look at in the background. No tortured souls, no demons, etc. There's not a single full character model in the entire game. The last level in the story has you fighting Satan in one of the most anti-climactic ways possible. I really would have liked to see a Super Meatboy-esque race between Marty and Satan rather than another 90 second puzzle level. \n\nStill, that small gripe with art direction aside, I found SEUM to be an addictive and relaxing experience. An arcade game you can play for 5 minutes or 5 hours and hardly tell the difference.", "timestamp_created": 1504626608, "timestamp_updated": 1504626608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10,

And God knows why the whole bloody screen goes blurry every frickin' time you pick up a beer. Jesus Christ, have the devs even drank a beer before? You should really just be ported back to level select after getting a beer because there's no bloody point to do anything else in the level.\n\nOh, and they made the level select hotkey \"M\". Try hitting that real quick a thousand times in a row. Like I said, this game is low quality obnoxious crap for the kids who get off spending an entire weekend playing the same level over and over again to improve their time by a few milliseconds to get onto a leaderboard. All while Satan yells random sh@t at you for no reason.\n\nGames like Super Meat Boy at least have some charm. SEUM comes across like an eight year old Red Bull carpet stain.

sluggish, unresponsive controls, partly because in this game a mid-tier video card can't achieve 60 fps on anything but the lowest graphics settings; very generous target times, that require little skill and innovation to beat. \nThese things come together to severly hinder the mastery of control that is usually crucial in speedrunning, the ability to execute insanely precise tricks consistently to get a better time. Again, since the level design is so bland you will have a hard time finding any levels where such skills are needed, but it still feels frustrating while playing.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is well done, music and presentation fit together to create a fast paced, metal experience, the macho quips between the guy and Satan are funny, if you like that sort of stuff.\n\nOverall, it's a speedrunning game for casual players that's not very fun to actually speedrun.

SEUM is like a birthchild of Devil Daggers and Super Meat Boy where the controls are slick and tight and there is a huge sense of accomplishment after completing something.\n\nSEUM: Speedrunners from Hell has bite sized levels and a fast paced control scheme. You start off with simple stages which let you get acquainted with the game. Each level has a time limit within which it needs to be completed and a secondary time limit to beat for extra points. The game slowly introduces you to its different mechanics and gives you various powers like throwing fireballs, teleporting and anti gravity etc, all of which need to be used simultaneously whenever the game requires. \n\nThere are slight puzzle elements present inside some levels which require a bit of thinking but the game never leaves you entirely clueless as to what to do like the teleporting orbs which are present when the game requires you to teleport and you cannot teleport without acquiring one. The game requires you to have a very accurate sense of movement though and being a first person game it is slightly difficult to keep a lookout for everything. But just like Devil Daggers you need to rely on your instincts while learning from the previous errors you made. \n\nSEUM has an excellent method of keeping you invested in the loop of dying and repeating. If you die, you are immediately thrust back into the game without going through much hassle. If you win a game you are being shown your replay in the background while looking at the victory screen giving you an insight on the level and places where you could have gone faster.\n\n The game is quite difficult and while you die a good number of times, it never induces the feeling of rage quitting. The reason for that is the short amount of time you invested in that level till that point. There will be moments where you will pass on a difficult section only to feel overconfident and fall while trying to cross the simplest of platforms but that is all part of the process in Speedrunners from Hell.\n\nBut the game\u2019s greatest sense of achievement comes when you find a hidden way or discover an alternate path to cut the total time by some margin. While the total time will most probably be affected by only a couple of seconds, that can make you score much higher on the leaderboards. The game shows you the leaderboards right on the finish menu and it feels really good when you move up a few ranks to break the top ten. \n\nThe level designs are excellent and there are quite some levels where you don\u2019t land on the platforms at all. SEUM is all about beating your own time set while not trying to get impaled by the spikes or falling into the fiery depths of hell. It keeps things simple enough for the right time to let you feel comfortable to the game and still just be difficult enough to keep your adrenaline pumping.\n\n Its premise is silly enough and unlike some other games, it never takes itself too seriously which works in its favour. It is unlike anything I have played for quite some time and overall its gameplay is very solid.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nSEUM: Speedrunners from Hell has a pretty generic visual aesthetic when it comes to depicting hell. The fiery pits of lava, the tall cliffs standing beside you, dark buildings ripe with spikes and other stuff like that. But the game never feels too cheap or unpolished with the help of some neat little effects like the gesture of hands whenever your fireball activates a required puzzle lever.\n\n There are low res textures present everywhere but they don\u2019t bother much because of the breakneck pace of the game. Unless you stand and try to take a look at its environments, SEUM does not do much wrong visually.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nSome solid Heavy metal music leads an adrenaline pumping soundtrack which compliments the gameplay of SEUM perfectly. It gives you the rush required to jump over the difficulties and never lets go of the hold on you. It is one of those soundtracks which is incredibly repetitive and forces its way into your ears but never gets old to listen to. \n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nSEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is an incredibly fun title which gives you the everything you want from a game like this. Tight controls, solid level design, difficult but rewarding platforming and a badass heavy metal soundtrack to top it all off. It is completely worth the price of admission and easily worth a recommendation.\n\n[h1]Rating:85/100[/h1]\n\nThis review was brought to you by [url=www.gamephasis.com]GamePhasis[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1497455957, "timestamp_updated": 1497455984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32383838": {"recommendationid": "32383838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063443761", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508712917}, "language": "english", "review": "cool.\nignore those negative reviews if you dont have a toaster.\ngame could use some optimization however.", "timestamp_created": 1497343970, "timestamp_updated": 1497343970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32215548": {"recommendationid": "32215548", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996864320", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498714832}, "language": "english", "review": "Good, But all the #1 Players have some sort of aim bot because noone is that fast.", "timestamp_created": 1496735959, "timestamp_updated": 1496735959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32211879": {"recommendationid": "32211879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107075998", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494873816}, "language": "schinese", "review": "666\ud83e\udd18", "timestamp_created": 1496714927, "timestamp_updated": 1496714927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32154062": {"recommendationid": "32154062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253944968", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496500840}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430!", "timestamp_created": 1496500870, "timestamp_updated": 1496500870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32121124": {"recommendationid": "32121124", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981934486", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503448108}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Well, I'll give this level one more shot before I hit the sack...\"\n\n\"...oh my, what a lovely sunrise.\"\n\nWhat can I say? The controls are butter smooth, the game is optimized better than a German Motorsport racecar, the levels are challenging but never unfair. As someone who loves oldschool metal, the soundtrack and artstyle are both awesome. I love how this game doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest, it's a good way of presenting it.\n\nReplay value depends on whether or not you're the competitive/perfectionist type. Plenty of collectibles and achievements, I especially like the \"Beer\" collectible because it encourages you to explore the levels even though this is a speedrunning game. The collectibles/achievements alone are enough to squeeze out a decent amount of hours. If you're the kind to hope for getting a top 10 ranking on any of the maps, well, then... sky's the limit. I also hope they will release more \"Extended Play\" levels as time goes on, Seasons 1 and 2 were pretty damn good.\n\nI got it during a sale, but definitely worth full price.

It takes the concept behind platformers, puzzle games, and speedrunning then sends it to hell where you, Marty, have to retrieve your beer after Satan broke into your house, removed your hand, and stole all of your alcohol. You've vowed to avenge what you have lost and must run through the many of cirlces of hell with nothing but the hand of Satan and a kick a.ss metal soundtrack. \n\nMechanically this game is fantastic. The movement is incredibly well tuned and the level design is very creative and well designed. In addition to speedrunning through various traps and obstacles, you are also given powers. You can shoot fireballs, reverse gravity, teleport, spawn platforms, and reverse time. This adds another dimension to the complexity of the already intricate levels. It's a very satisfying game to play, especially after you spend hours perfecting one level and finally make a flawless run. You can also compare leaderboard rankings with others and friends. The top 10 on each course will go down into the \"Pit of Infamy\" at the end of the Season to concrete your success in SEUM's history. There are also various hidden collectibles, pathways, and QR Codes throughout the game as well as a level editor with workshop support.\n\n[b]Conclusion [/b]\n\nIf you are into speedrunning, skill games, puzzles and problem solving, are a completionist, level creator, or just love improving your skills I can't recommend this game enough. There's not many games like this, and much less so that executed it so well. The options menus are fairly in depth between graphics, controls, and various preferential options. It's very stable, lacks bugs or quirks almost entirely, and overall feels great to play. Performance is smooth and I have not ran into any FPS issues or stuttering. The level design is incredible and there's around 15 hours worth of courses, depending on how quick you're able to get through them, not including workshop maps and collectibles. There are also Extended play (pretty much free DLC), Speedrun mode, and a procedurally generated Endless mode. I paid full price for this game and I have loved every minute of it, even when bashing my keyboard in from frustration.

In less than one hour, I was completely convinced that this game had immense potential, so I added it to my wishlist and waited for a sale. Six months later, here I am writing a review for it.\n\nSEUM is a first person platformer where you have to complete each level as fast as possible. Featuring a leaderboard system, you can track your times, your friend's and the worldwide records for every level. The scores are reset on every season, to make sure the top scores are fair without fixed exploits. It is technically an incentive to come back to it once in a while in case being on top is something you love.\n\nRunning on the Unity engine, the game does not look spectacular or revolutionary but what matters is that it plays wonderfully. Controls are simple but tight, and movement feels perfect for the genre. All controls are rebindable in case you want to customize them. Graphical options are very limited which is disappointing, but you can adjust the FOV from about 60 to 140, which in my opinion is a crucial option in a game like this, despite the max value being a little too much!\n\nThe first levels are fairly simple which mostly serve to introduce you to the mechanics, but the difficulty surely starts to increase on the third floor. With an impressive variety in level design and level variety, every level feels completely different from the others. That said, repetition doesn't feel frustrating in this game, it is the only way to learn and progressively get better. In total, there's about 150 levels on this game to be beaten, about 25 of them added in expansion packs (labeled as Extended Plays), completely free of charge! If you even want more levels, SEUM features Steam Workshop support and has a level editor to create your own demonic creations with ease! Within every level there are 2 different times to beat, and a beer hidden in it. Obviously, to get 100% completion all of this criteria is required. These beers do get very challenging to find on later levels! I have to admit the Steam discussions and guides surely gave me a hand. There's just tons of content in this game to discover and play through. About 10 secret levels, 12 bonus levels and 10 rituals to complete, which unlock 10 more secret levels.\n\nThe music in this game despite being very short and limited, is great! The tracks are either rock or metal songs with no vocals, that will have you humming along while dying over and over again. At the time I did the Hardcore Speedrun, I had it turned off to listen to my own music, but bear in mind I had about 25 hours clocked in at this point. There's some great tunes in this title, definitely a game to NOT mute while playing!\n\nFive powerups may be present in the levels: Teleport, Anti-Gravity, Split, Spawn-Platform and the Booster. The last one is just a temporary speed boost so it's not like the others. You can have one powerup equipped at a time, and this means you have to plan your strategy on levels with various powerups. Bear in mind you spawn with no powerup, it must be picked up every time. There's definitely a learning curve in each of these powerups and it will take a while to master them.\n\nIf the clock ticking on each level isn't enough for you, there's also an Endless Mode that randomly generates an infinite hall with traps with a deadly machine right behind you to make sure the player doesn't slow down. Run, Marty, run! And if the Endless Mode is still not enough, you also have a Speedrun mode where you can speedrun entire floors at a time... or even the whole bloody game from start to finish! Not to mention that there is an option to enable the Hardcore Speedrun mode in which you have to complete the whole game without dying. It was a tough and lengthy challenge, but completing felt overwhelmingly satisfying. Still not enough content to convince you? Well then... just go find the secrets and Easter eggs scattered around!\n\nIt took me 35 hours to complete everything in the game, including the Hardcore Speedrun. Of those 35 hours, none of them were tedious, I cannot find a section of this game that I utterly hated or despised for being too hard, too frustrating or just boring... except Level 70 - Lamb of the Spit, of course. It is safe for me to say that SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is a formidably astonishing gem in the gaming industry. That said, it's completely worth getting it even at full price for it's excellent blend of platforming and fast paced action.", "timestamp_created": 1491962813, "timestamp_updated": 1491962863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748069", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31008168": {"recommendationid": "31008168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031799936", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511969316}, "language": "english", "review": "Like a 3D version of super meat boy but set in hell.\n\nOne of the most fun 3D platformers I have ever played.

There's a lot about it that's just \"fine\".\n\nThe aesthetic is okay at first but gets old quick and the texturing is pretty low res & kind of ugly. And the only variation is the background and color changing a bit. The music's all alright too, as an avid metal listener it's... well it's very video gamey for sure, kind of has an old school metal vibe to it but with a much more modern sound. I don't mind it but some of the tracks that get played the most can get tiresome after a while. The repeated voice clips also get tiresome really fast, and honestly the protagonist isn't particularly likeable. \n\nGameplay-wise then. I don't really care for the arcing fireball. I'd rather just have a straight shot. The levels are designed around it, sure, but still. Not a huge fan. And the teleport is kind of a cool mechanic but can be pretty wonky sometimes as well. The powerups in general are all pretty cool though, yeah, and they help with exploration. The secret hunting in this game actually takes up more time than playing the levels normally, or at least it did for me; there's one collectible in every level, a good number of secret levels as well, and some weird riddles that I honestly couldn't be bothered to figure out myself.\n\nAnd as for the main gameplay itself... yeah, it's alright. They keep the levels pretty diverse, though a few do go on too long and overstay their welcome. And the mines are a bit iffy, feel like they have a bit too big of a blast radius even when you blow them up yourself. The game keeps itself pretty fast paced for the most part, though there are times that the momentum in the game goes against the platforming they want you to do, and there's a bit too much tiny platforms & narrow walkways for my liking, it leads to level design that doesn't flow as well as it could. But on the whole I enjoy playing these levels, yeah.\n\nThat's just the thing. There's nothing outstanding about this game. It's just very \"fine\" all around. If you're really into speedrunning and precision games you'll probably get more replay value out of this one than I did but there's not much here that makes me really want to come back t it, but I can't say I didn't enjoy playing it either. It's a very fine game that kind of hides how vanilla its gameplay is with the over-the-top aesthetic.

Some level designs are really top-notch and deserve praise. The mood is more doomy than Doom 2016.\n\nThe game works in short, addictive loops, and is fun even at low level play. I am not a really good gamer. However, I can still manage scores good enough to keep playing. There are also different challenges, such as finding hidden beers, which are a welcome change of pace after spending 30mn perfecting 8 seconds.\nWhich is not to say that the game doesn't have much to offer for people who like a challenge. You can spend hours working at shaving off that little additional second or millisecond.\n\nTechnically, the game is responsive and I could detect no input lag, but there was some frame dropping despite my pc being quite decent. I had to set the resolution slightly lower than HD to get really fluid FPS; I personally don't care in the slightest, but some people might be bothered by that (To note, I didn't notice such drops on Linux, so maybe it has to do with my Windows setup).\n\nIn short, what you see in those videos is exactly what you're getting.

And in that sense, SEUM does its job wonderfully.\n\nYour character is capable of doing three things: running, jumping, and throwing infinite amounts of fireballs. And that's really all you need, since as the levels go on, the game throws more and more obstacles and unusual level designs at you, always requiring you to think fast and learn from your mistakes. Much like Super Meat Boy, you are going to die a lot and keep respawning again and again until you manage to nail a level, the only difference being that you have a keyboard shortcut with which you can respawn instantly.\n\nYou are going to have to deal with lots of spikes, swinging blades, rings to jump through, moving platforms, sawblades, and so on. On top of that, you eventually get ahold of four different powerups, each adding a new angle to the gameplay. The controls are very tight and everything is very tightly designed, making it a joy to perfectly nail some of the more risky maneuvers. Almost every time you fail, you can tell that it's your own fault, and you immediately take note of the things to improve on during your next attempt.\n\nThe game's humorous take on the theme of hell also works very well and sets up a lovely tongue-in-cheek atmosphere, where you feel that you are some beer-chugging badass who jumps across hell like it's nothing, all while bobbing his head to the awesome heavy-metal soundtrack. The surrounding hellish environments are really nice to look at and provide a nice backdrop for the action happening in front of you.\n\nReally, the only things I could complain about are largely nitpicks. For instance, the graphics seem a little dated - the game appears not to use normal maps or shadows, so everything is kinda flat and covered by global, uniform lighting. On top of that, the developers' idea of creating a wall seems to be taking a rectangle and slapping a wall texture onto it - and while they try to cover that up with some extra decorative bits, sometimes this graphical simplicity becomes rather apparent, to the point that there were times where I felt like I was playing a Gmod map or something. I realize that this is probably because they wanted the graphics to not get in the way of the gameplay, but still...\n\nOne other complaint I would have is that while the Level Editor is quite easy to learn and use, it's still missing some important features at the time of me writing this review - such as [i]drag select[/i]. I mean, really?!\n\nBut despite this, SEUM is an awesome game and easily one of the best games I bought myself this Christmas. If you like fast-paced platforming, then this is a game for you. Especially because it's far easier to master its controls than Super Meat Boy's.", "timestamp_created": 1483830185, "timestamp_updated": 1483843446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29100496": {"recommendationid": "29100496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172218949", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "last_played": 1513825984}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly an amazing 3d speedrun platformer.

Satan stole your beer, but you have his hand. Go through trials using different powers to get your beer back. Along with shooting fireballs, you can teleport, rewind, reverse gravity, and create platforms, depending on the level. And man some of these levels are hard as hell (pun sort of intended), so playing a level to try to beat it over and over, finding the secret beer or bacon (there is one in every single level), and optimizing your time to get into the top 10 best times is going to make you sink a lot of hours into this game (I've sunk about 12 hours as of writing this and I've almost done with the main campaign, but just started on the next episode). I also really love the metal-and-hell aesthetic, and the art style fits very nicely into that. \n\nIn a recent update, they've released a level editor for the community to create and share their levels, which was the final push for me to pick this up, because now there is virtually endless replay value, in playing over 200 community made levels and create your own masterpiece. \nEDIT: Linux version does allow you to use the level editor. \n\nThank you for putting this on Linux!!", "timestamp_created": 1483381825, "timestamp_updated": 1514343476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28943115": {"recommendationid": "28943115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094873761", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495872237}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty lit", "timestamp_created": 1483368835, "timestamp_updated": 1483368835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28904591": {"recommendationid": "28904591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103875243", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483801091}, "language": "russian", "review": "\"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430,\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0451\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043e\"\n\u041d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043b \u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 51 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\n", "timestamp_created": 1483281791, "timestamp_updated": 1483281791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508267", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28864405": {"recommendationid": "28864405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124910969", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506175998}, "language": "german", "review": "Jump.\n\nDie.\n\nRepeat.\n\nAgain.\n\nI would like to die again.", "timestamp_created": 1483182038, "timestamp_updated": 1483182038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28856377": {"recommendationid": "28856377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046895187", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486687152}, "language": "english", "review": "First-person platformer?

Com sede de vingan\u00e7a, o rapaz pega o bra\u00e7o do dem\u00f4nio decepado e o toma para s\u00ed, adentra no portal do Inferno para ca\u00e7ar o dem\u00f4nio.\n\nA trilha sonora do jogo \u00e9 bem fren\u00e9tica, apesar de os gr\u00e1ficos deixarem um pouco a desejar. Det\u00e9m uma mec\u00e2nica simples, afinal o objetivo do jogo \u00e9 atravessar o mapa at\u00e9 chegar ao final, passando por diversos puzzles realizando muitas manobras. Possui uma grande quantidade de mapas, e uma surpresa lhe aguarda em cada um. Como se j\u00e1 n\u00e3o bastasse o n\u00famero de mapas, o jogo cont\u00e9m Steam Workshop para edi\u00e7\u00e3o de n\u00edveis criados pela comunidade.\n\nNo come\u00e7o achei o jogo muito f\u00e1cil e pensei que era bom em jogos de Parkour, mas depois de jogar um pouco este inocente pensamento foi para baixo. O jogo come\u00e7ou a ficar muito dif\u00edcil e tive que tentar v\u00e1rias e v\u00e1rias vezes alguns mapas para poder completar a tempo. Gostei muito da soundtrack pois ela remete um estilo de Rock, e o protagonista pode fazer um gesto de rockeiro com as m\u00e3os durante o mapa, \u00e9 muito engra\u00e7ado. Algumas vezes eu ficava bem perdido na travessia do mapa, quando chegava ao final recebia uma mensagem bem grande \"VOC\u00ca N\u00c3O CHEGOU A TEMPO\" que me desanimava pois pensava fazer tudo certo.\n\n[h1]+Pros[/h1]\n\n+Gr\u00e1ficos\n+Soundtrack\n+Steam Achievements\n+Steam Trading Cards\n+Steam Workshop\n\n[h1]-Cons[/h1]\n\n-N\u00e3o h\u00e1 tradu\u00e7\u00e3o para Portugu\u00eas\n-N\u00e3o tem suporte para Controle de Console", "timestamp_created": 1481904281, "timestamp_updated": 1481904611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564056", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28400644": {"recommendationid": "28400644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119708536", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498100394}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game just don't have illusions of getting to the top of the leader boards on any maps cause of hacking, glitching, assholes.

character acts and talks, the environment and also the music collect together into a very enjoyable game and with the addition of workshop levels I have found myself having a new lease of creativity within the game, creating some levels of my own and publishing them.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a new platformer to play, or looking for a way into playing

I fell in love with it during the first half hour of gameplay. It's like Portal by way of Iron Maiden, combining spatial puzzle solving with break-neck speeds and fast-twitch reflexes. Every level is worthy of multiple attempts because they present two different challenges: one of planning, and another of execution. Each level is a puzzle, and as you attempt them over and over you notice places where entire milliseconds can be shaved off through the use of a different technique. It gives you the \"AHA!\" moment that the best puzzle games offer, but in a context where you're too busy having fun to feel like an idiot for not noticing the solution sooner.\n\nUnlike Portal, the difficulty ramp in SEUM is perfectly balanced. I was a couple of hours into the game before I really started to sweat the latest levels, but by then I had already gone back and repeated all my previous levels in order to get better times and move up the ranking system. If you find yourself getting stuck on a particular challenge then there's always a huge amount of other content waiting to be challenged.\n\nThe best part of the game is the sense of achievement you get when you perfectly execute a run and manage to increase your ranking on that particular level by shaving 200 milliseconds off your previous best time. There're so many great levels that I want to constantly revisit and practise in order to inch closer to the top 100 rankings. My favourite level so far is #36, Parachute. The moment at which I got the 71st fastest time on the leader board might be my gaming highlight of the year. I was so exhilarated by the sense of speed, tension and satisfaction that I could hardly drag myself away from the game.\n\nThe soundtrack is an original composition of heavy metal tracks that are all of a really high quality. They're all instrumental pieces with an emphasis on roaring guitar solos that keep up the tempo and push the player forwards, deeper into speedrunning hell.\n\nThe game has some flaws. The graphics are straight from 2010 and look like something I'd expect from a Source mod. Very few textures in the game hold up on close examination and the graphics settings are lacklustre. Humour abounds in SEUM but only half of it really hits for me, and when I've played the same level 300 times back to back, hearing Satan repeat his funny one-liner to taunt me starts to lose its charm. The powers the player uses during the game all have the potential to be frustrating to use, depending on the level. And that's about it; a few nit-picks but nothing worth crying over.\n\nThis game is advertised as being \"the first heavy metal speedrunning game\", which sounds like a joke until you play it and realise what an excellent idea a heavy metal speedrunning game truly is. For me, it's a real under-rated classic, a better tribute to heavy metal than Brutal Legend could ever be, and well worth the \u00a310 price tag.", "timestamp_created": 1480370346, "timestamp_updated": 1480370346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27992546": {"recommendationid": "27992546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107557115", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507843665}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn tasty 77/555/444 would laav again", "timestamp_created": 1480366457, "timestamp_updated": 1480366457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27983845": {"recommendationid": "27983845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111940061", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514378866}, "language": "french", "review": "SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell (SEUM) est un excellent jeu de plateforme 3D \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne.

"language": "english", "review": "I just saw the word \"speedrunners\" in the name, so I decided, why not? And then I bought it. And, you know...\n\n[i]I don't regret a single thing![/i]\n\nThis game combines what I like most in games, every major thing. First of all, it's a speedrunning game. You [b]have[/b] to be fast in order to progress, you have to find creative and unusual ways of completing a level, most of these ways being mostly [b]intended by developers[/b]. This game basically teaches you how to speedrun, which is, as for me, the greatest game idea ever.\nSecondly, Doom + Duke Nukem + references = the atmosphere of this game. I don'teven really kno how to describe it; the brutal protagonist Marty who seems to only care about his beer, Satan, hell... This atmosphere, in couple with the level design, is the greatest element combination I have ever seen. Huge thanks to developers for doing this in particular.\nThirdly, gameplay. Not only do you have to run fast, you also have to aim well and calculate... Everything. From physics to positions of moving objects. There are also a few power-ups you can collect in a level, which you have to be smart with, too.\nFourthly, secrets. Just running fast isn't enough to progress, you need to collect secrets in basically every single level, and the further down to hell you are, the harder it gets. I love both speedrunning and exploring, which depends on the game, so I always wondered if it was possible to somehow combine these two elements in one game. Well, I guess this is the game to accomplish that.\nFifthly, global leaderboards and replays. If you somehow manage to complete the level fast enough to beat the par time, you'll be granted an ability to see how others completed the level, which is an amazing learning opportunity for beginners and not-so-experienced players (AKA noobs), and an excellent competition for pros.\nSixthly, achievements. I can't say a lot about them because I haven't achieved a lot, but from what I've seen, they are hilarious and overall well-made. Unlike in most modern games, you don't get achievements for every step you make, you have to work hard to unlock most of them.\nSeventhly, the soundtrack. It's [b]awesome[/b]. I'd say, it's just the soundtrack I want in most FPS games, but it fits this one particularly well. If usually I start playing some YouTube video or some music from a social network, for this game, I actually close my browser and enjoy the game soundtrack. Just like in the older, classic games which are now legends.\n\nOverall, I can say that this game just brings back the nostalgia, still maintaining the drive and the speed. The gameplay is extremely entertaining, the level design is quite simple yet pleasing to the eye and bringing a feeling of overall brutality of what's happening. I don't know how to describe it, really, but need I? Try it out for yourself! I give this game 10/10 without hesitation, and I know for sure that this is what I'll be playing for the next month or so. Since Doom and Duke Nukem are now legends, I want SEUM to be a legend, too\nCheers and huge thanks to Pine Studio,\nkyoob", "timestamp_created": 1478104741, "timestamp_updated": 1478104741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572703", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26368513": {"recommendationid": "26368513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041676093", "num_games_owned": 1617, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478790956}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so brutal I can't even figure out a sentence to describe it...OH SHIT\n\nDisclosure: Was given to me free through a giveaway via groupees.com , but I had it wishlisted for months.

But then it started to be very repetitive and the soundtrack (only one song?) started being boring.\n\nExcept the fast-paced aspect of the game, the player have to search every level for... I think you know for what... The damned cans of beer.\n\nIf i only had to run fast through locations might I had not care even at all about the graphics. But searching for the cans made me to look closer at the environment - which appeared to be absolutely terrible. Hell is an empty void with some random walls and traps all set in one place. No devils, no condemned souls. All the 'enviroment' is made mostly with big simple textured cuboids and the rest with other coarse shapes. Honestly, the only one thing made nicely is the player's hand.\n\nI am happy I received this game for free, since it is overpriced as Hell on Steam.

Then came the time for the first level and I've dropped my smile. Having some background in original forms of parkour/speedruning/trickjumping (like q1-q3, promode, defrag) it isn't easy to accept that walking is faster than jumping. So far I've tried just 2 levels (will try more later) but being forced to walk from corner to corner (trying not to clip any) in straight, shortest possible, path without jumping is a bit painfull (also makes replays rather dull and bigger part of levels obsolete). Movement is simplified: air control involves +forward and steering with mouse (strafe keys do work but so far are useless). Nice thing is that you can control somehow the strength/height of jumps (and therefore time loss) plus double jumping is possible of some steps/rings etc (but again going high and loosing time). Ability to run replays from leaderboard w/o leaving given lvl is a great addition.\n So far i guess I could recommend it to peeps w/o knowledge of trickjumping mentioned earlier, especially if they're into rock/metal culture. If you have tasted more challenging, advanced forms then perhaps only if you're bored - demo's available. Bouncing is what Tiggers do best! For better or worse, I am one.\n\nEdit: In later levels \"puzzle\" element seems to play bigger role (including top players exploits), but rest stays the same.\n\n(No neutral button and overwhelming proportion of positive to negative reviews force me to choose negative)", "timestamp_created": 1476572731, "timestamp_updated": 1476580899, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494766", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26056880": {"recommendationid": "26056880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166071435", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476566213}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Prefiro assitir meu Show Da F\u00e9 e louvar o senhor!", "timestamp_created": 1476566263, "timestamp_updated": 1476566263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26028403": {"recommendationid": "26028403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056387449", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490879244}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0440 . \u0421\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043b\u043e , \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0442\u044b \u0432\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0435\u0448\u044c\u0441\u044f , \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0449\u0435 . \u0422\u044b \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c , \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f . \u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c , \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a , \u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0430\u0441 , \u0432\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 , \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b , \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 . \u041d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 , \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c , \u0442\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 . \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 .", "timestamp_created": 1476449585, "timestamp_updated": 1476449585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26008291": {"recommendationid": "26008291", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981365654", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510737704}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible experience.

One night he was drinking his beer, enjoying his time, when \u2013 long story short \u2013 a series of unfortunate events unfold, leaving him with the Devil\u2019s hand and no beer. This forces him to set on an epic journey to take back his beer from Satan. I\u2019m very good at explaining stories, aren\u2019t I? In SEUM you play as the man who has lost all he loves (his beer), and who will do anything to get it back \u2013 even if that means 1v1-ing the Devil himself, which is absolutely one hundred percent not a good idea. Unless you\u2019re redneck Devil hand beer guy, in that case you\u2019re good to go!\n\nAnyway, you progress through the depths of hell, ultimately attempting to beat all 100 levels and get your beer back, whilst keeping your soul. In each level there is a set time that you must finish the level in, giving you the silver medal for the map, with an optional, quicker time, that gives you the gold medal. There is also beer to grab on each level for completionists, and once you have collected all of the beer \u2013 or as many as it says \u2013 you gain access to a bonus level on each floor. After the main game is finished there are also a bunch of extra levels on floor -9, though I haven\u2019t been able to figure out how to get them yet.\n\nThe levels consist of lots of running, jumping and restarting. There are four powers that you can grab in the levels, one teleporting you to wherever you shoot, one reversing gravity, one making a checkpoint that you can use to go one way and activate something, then warp back to the checkpoint to save time, and one building platforms in the air for you to jump on.\n\nBeer, hell and heavy metal are the three key elements in SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell. That last part is especially important in the game for me, because the epic riffs and solos in the soundtrack fuel my vengeance to get the poor man\u2019s beer back, making me play ten times better. Sometimes the songs get a bit repetitive (the tracks play on a loop), but when you\u2019re focusing on beating the levels you don\u2019t really notice. I noticed, though, because I pick on the little things.\n\nBeing based in hell, SEUM features lots of saw blades, swinging axes on chains, and spikes, smeared with fresh blood. Creepy. In the bottom of each level there is a large pit with gigantic spikes that could impale a dinosaur. You know, the usual Satan stuff. The art style, as you can see in the images, isn\u2019t exactly realistic, but it isn\u2019t cartoon-like. The cutscenes, as you can also see, are comics \u2013 quite well done actually (they are animated, but you can\u2019t see that from still images).\n\nThe dialogue is comedic, with phrases including \u2018There\u2019s nothing like a good beer,\u2019 and \u2018Damn you Pine Studio!\u2019 Those are quotes from the playable character, but you will be saying them soon enough. The Devil also speaks, as a voice-in-your-head figure, with quotes such as \u2018Yes\u2026\u2019 and \u2018Fatality!\u2019 Be aware, though, the game does feature strong language. I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t really interested in the dialogue, but I thought I\u2019d cover it because not many people realise that good sound effects and voice acting plays a major role in whether a game seems cheesy or not. This game makes the cheesiness of the quotes on paper sound awesome in-game, especially with the guitars going in the background.\n\nIf you like to brag about your skill, you can do that with the game\u2019s leaderboards. It\u2019s not as easy as it looks though, some people out there are incredibly fast!\n\nThere are two other modes besides the main story mode, one being \u2018Speedrun\u2019 and the other, \u2018Endless\u2019. Speedrun is a mode where you are pit against other players\u2019 fastest times for a whole floor on the leaderboards, in an attempt to beat them \u2013 but as I said, it\u2019s not easy, some people are very quick. In Endless you compete against a massive spinning spike-riddled rolling pin in a randomly generated endless map where you must reach as far as you can. The rolling pin could move a bit slower, I mean, we\u2019re not all that fast!\n\nOne thing I would have loved is a custom level builder. The game is brilliant enough without it, but it would have been nice for the game to have just that little extra bit of community interaction.\n\nI've had a smashing time playing this gem so far. I almost threw a brick through my computer fifty times, but I have restrained myself\u2026 mostly. It\u2019s been a great experience, almost completely finishing a challenging game for once. I think you should all give SEUM a go, or at least try the free demo that is available to download on Steam. If you have $15 to drop for a good game that will keep you going for quite a few hours, you should definitely check out this one.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell IS worth the US $15 it is available for.", "timestamp_created": 1475307489, "timestamp_updated": 1475307489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25612558": {"recommendationid": "25612558", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967001646", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506572785}, "language": "english", "review": "This game does what it set out to do very, very well.

Would definitely reccomend to gamers who were fans of Counterstrike surfing, Quake 3/DeFRaG, Tribes, or any of the movement-centric games.", "timestamp_created": 1474423430, "timestamp_updated": 1474423430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25597358": {"recommendationid": "25597358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052891840", "num_games_owned": 3024, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474293411}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0436 \u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b-\u0434\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0439\u043d, \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435, \u043d\u0430\u0438\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b \u043c\u043d\u0435, \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b. \u041d\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044f, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043a, \u043d\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f, \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0430. \u0410 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f\u0445. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0435, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u044b \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043c\u0438. \u041e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0445\u0435\u0432\u0438-\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443.\n\n\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430: 10 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1474340033, "timestamp_updated": 1474340033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25564609": {"recommendationid": "25564609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103734846", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470211672}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is insanely fun and well done.

However, after playing 10+ hours of the game, i wish i hadn't. The first few floors of the game are VERY fun, but i found that after a while of playing the aesthetic became boring to look at. Even with very similar visuals on every level i was enjoying the game a lot up until ~floor 7, at this point the game started to feel very tedious, and the longer levels started getting very annoying. Levels 80 and 81 also felt very clunky and the feeling of being able to move through the level very smoothly wasn't there anymore. I have only done the hidden ritual levels 1-3 at this point, but the third one is horrible, it has three rings spinning around very fast, so not only are you spinning, but you are spinning while trying to jump to the next ring, then on the final ring witch is spinning so fast it was making me motion sick, you have to jump from that to a non-moving platform with the end portal on it, but when you jump off of a spinning platform it flings you in the direction it was spinning, so it's incredibly hard to land there. Overall the game has a lot of content in it, but in my opinion only about 2.5 4ths of it was fun and worth doing. I do plan to go back at some point and finsih all the hidden levels and such. My final reveiw of this game is a 2/5. If you see this game on sale for ~$8 and you really like speedrunning/platforming games i would recommend buying it, however i wouldnt pay any more than $10 for it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that there were multiple levels that were very glitchy, and i was even able to go through the ground and walls on some of them.\n\nTLDR, 2/5, dont buy for more than $10.", "timestamp_created": 1473605958, "timestamp_updated": 1473622900, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25459747": {"recommendationid": "25459747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280235088", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497979748}, "language": "russian", "review": "\n[h1] SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell [/h1]\n\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 SpeedRunner,\u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e,\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f,\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438,\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u043a\u0430 =)", "timestamp_created": 1473588881, "timestamp_updated": 1473588881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25430501": {"recommendationid": "25430501", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990947284", "num_games_owned": 3762, "num_reviews": 375, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491489780}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest additions to the Steam Store ever.

But they're good enough to satisfy any player,they're simple with 2 options which are resolution and graphics preset, the game doesn't include that FXAA blur effect but instead keeps it nice and clear so speedrunners can focus on the game rather than the graphics.\nIt also has that old doom feel, it's set in hell with a heavy metal feel around it which sounds bad but honestly works out perfectly for this.\n\n[h1] SOUNDTRACK [/h1]\nI usually don't talk about soundtracks in games as I mute them or turn them down, I always give them a try and none have satisfied me, but then SEUM came along with it's metal, I was ready to completely mute it before even giving it a chance, I'm happy I didn't though.\nMetal isn't a popular music genre, it isn't up there anymore like that cheeki breeki hardbass or pop, but should be.\nPine Studio made an amazing soundtrack not only because it sounds great, but it motivates you to keep trying to beat your records, makes you feel badass and accomplished if you succeed.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\nIt's a speedrunning game, you do need to be quick, the soundtrack like I said before goes well with gameplay, you need to be very focused on every single level and there's always alot of room for improvement making me always come back to this game, yes this is a speedrunning game so it may seem short, if you try to get 100% the game will possibly take 10-20 hours at max, but don't think of not buying it for being \"short\", this game has replayability to every aspect, getting better times for levels, new strategies, shortcuts!\n\n[h1] PLOT [/h1]\n[spoiler]You're chilling back as a ginger man named \"Marty\", have a beer in your hand, watching TV until Satan walks in and takes your beer, you're like \"fuck off m8 this is mine\" BUT THEN, OUT OF KNOWWHERE SATAN CUTS OFF YOUR WRIST, SO YOU CUT HIS OFF!

Enjoy :) [/quote]\n\nSEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is a game developed by Pine Studios and published by Headup Games\n\nSEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is exactly what it says in the title, it is a speedrunning game that takes place in hell. You play the stereotypical hillbilly known as Marty who loves shooting stuff and of course drinking beer. One time for no apparent reason, Satan decides to pay a visit and steals your lifetime supply of beer whilst also chopping off your arm in the process\n\nYou become angry with Satan and do the same thing with him which is chopping off his arm, which for some magical reason you manage to sow onto your right arm and you get the powers that the lovely Satan has and go kick some Satanic butt\n\nWith Satan's arm you get cool powers such as teleportation, gravitation, shooting fireballs, duplication and so on and so fourth. In the 80+ levels of speedrunning goodness you use these powers to your advantage\n\nThe game is challenging and can sometimes but very rarely lead to rage and breaking of keyboards and screens but what SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell has that some other hard challenging games of this sort don't have is that it offers some kind of fulfilment and addiction, each time you complete a level in the amount of time sepcified, you feel satisfied and want to continue\n\nThere are nine levels to go through in the wonderful world of hell, each floor has 10 or 11 levels each, the tenth level is a sort of bass level which although there is no boss, it is usually the hardest level on that specific floor. The game also houses many hidden secrets and beers that if collected, after a certain amount of beers, a secret level is unlocked however you don't have to play these secret levels to complete the game\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, they get the job done and are very pleasing, the little that I could look around the environemnts, they were well designed. The levels themselves are also well made and don't feel slopply made\n\nThe music too is nothing to write home about, it is the generic heavy metal style soundtrack that every game that takes place in hell does. The voice acting, although it is just two people; Satan and Marty, are voiced pretty well however I did notice sometimes the change in audio level especially with Marty, but nothing to complain aboout\n\nThe only thing I would complain about is that SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell does not offer a level editor yet (might be offered in a later update). This game could be perfect with user created levels and the Steam Workshop support. Hopefully, Pine Studios will add the ability of level editing in the coming future\n\nSEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is hard yet oddly satisfying. Beating a level in the specified time is both amazing and addiciting to just continue playing the game. Even if you don't intend on finishing the main bulk that the game has to offer, just playing a few hours of the game can offer both enjoyment and fulfilment that only a few of these challenging games offer\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1471455522, "timestamp_updated": 1471455522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481698", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24974619": {"recommendationid": "24974619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035332018", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513286785}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanto este juego 10/10 las graficas 8/10 jugabilidad 10/10 idea del juego 10/10 :DDDD", "timestamp_created": 1471444964, "timestamp_updated": 1471444964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24971323": {"recommendationid": "24971323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036431472", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506788350}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0443 surf \u0438 deathrun \u0432 \u043a\u0441, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u0443 \u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c.\n\n\u0418\u0437 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432:\n+\u041e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0445\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043a.\n+\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\n+\u0411\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439\n+\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0434\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0439\u043d\n\n\u0418\u0437 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432:\n-\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b (\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430 2 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0439).\n-\u041f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\n-\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1471431338, "timestamp_updated": 1471431338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24970341": {"recommendationid": "24970341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035014102", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472352247}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game", "timestamp_created": 1471427092, "timestamp_updated": 1471427092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24952635": {"recommendationid": "24952635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036057832", "num_games_owned": 979, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1514833374}, "language": "english", "review": "Super mature game design and overall high production value despite honoring a retro Doom/Quake style.

They don't have to be overly complex and expand beyond what the game is clearly capable, resulting in a giant, potentially confusing and empty mess. All you need is a fun premise, a silly storyline just for kicks, and above all, gameplay that will leave you want to play it over and over again.\n\nThis game delivers just that. You play as a redneck/metalhead who's out to get Satan, because for some reason Satan thought it was a good idea to steal your beer. So you descend into hell, armed (heh) with a demonic arm severed from Satan himself, which shoots fireballs and can grant you several powerups such as anti-gravity, teleportation, or rewinding yourself to your last known position since you used the powerup, in order to retrieve your precious beverages.\n\nGameplay is simple, yet challenging. It's basically a first person platformer, and your goal is to run like hell (puns are fun kids) from point A to point B while jumping, dodging, and using various powerups in order to not suffer a fiery death, and in the shortest time possible. You can also use your demonic arm to use powerups, and to shoot fireballs to clear out mines, or trigger switches. I say simple, because you really get the hang of it after only a couple minutes in, making the game really easy to get into. The challenge comes in timing your jumping and movements exactly right in order to arrive at the goal in the shortest time possible, to top a place among the leaderboards. There is a time limit, however you don't die immediately if it runs out. Rather, you can still explore the level as you wish, however when you do reach the goal you will have to start it over because you were too slow. This looks and plays reminiscent to something like Quake, or Doom, in regards to how fast-paced it is, which gives it extra points in my book. \nThe real fun comes in trying to beat your friends in the leaderboards/making a name for yourself among the top. Which is way harder than it looks.\n\nThe levels themselves start out simple, however you will have to learn to use combinations of powerups in conjunction in order to beat a level, and you will feel like a god once you successfully pull it off. There's also a wide variety of powerups, some of which can be combined in a very creative way which definitely spices up the gameplay.\n\nSo far, I am loving the atmosphere in the game. as I mentioned before, seems to take inspiration from Quake and Doom to make for a really satisfying aesthetic. The soundtrack is also absolutely great too. Nothing quite like fast-paced platforming while heavy metal plays in the background.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nOverall, would I reccomend it? Yes, I definitely would advise you to try it out. It's fun, is simple, and this is a shining example as to what indie games should be like. Smooth gameplay, and just letting you have a whale of a time.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1471127312, "timestamp_updated": 1471127465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24875853": {"recommendationid": "24875853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083512419", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489400399}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043d, \u0414\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e, \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b, 10 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043a \u043f\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 9", "timestamp_created": 1471071144, "timestamp_updated": 1471071144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24837402": {"recommendationid": "24837402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088678045", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483922377}, "language": "english", "review": "straight up metal, beer and truckers, what much is there else to say?", "timestamp_created": 1470981902, "timestamp_updated": 1470981902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24831543": {"recommendationid": "24831543", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994292761", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475788511}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed this game.

The speedrun mode lets you play each floor individually for the best overall speedrun time. There is also hardcore in speedrun, where if you die you must restart from the first level of the floor. \n\nDemo is available to see if you'll enjoy it, and I think there's things in the game everyone can enjoy.

I think the best way to describe the game would be as the developers themselves say, Super Meat boy combined with the crazy maneuverability of Quake games. Hell (no pun intended), even the logo of the game is a straight up reference to Doom. Many concepts in this are derived from the old FPS arena shooter games and that\u2019s a good thing. \n\n[u][h1]Graphics:[/h1][/u]\n\nThe game looks pretty nice to look at. Atmosphere is right on point and really feels like you\u2019re in the depths of the earth. The game still has that old Doom/Quake/Unreal Tournament vibe in the art department. While the graphics are much improved the whole art-style is reminiscing of these incredible games. As a huge fan of older Quake and other arena shooting games I enjoyed this look of the game in SEUM. The graphics menu doesn\u2019t have a lot of options. There\u2019s quality presets which go from low to ultra, v-sync, resolution adjustment etc. There is field of view adjustment available too which goes all the way up to 90. Overall the game ran very smooth for me and for such a game it\u2019s a requirement to have fast smooth action because every millisecond counts. I got over 60 FPS throughout the time I played the game.\n\n[u][h1]Sound:[/h1][/u]\n\nThe game has pretty neat sound. As expected you will find heavy metal sound track are pretty good. Not my cup of tea but it was quite nice the ones I heard. In addition to that Satan will continuously talk to you as well, saying some stuff which can be quite funny.\n\n[u][h1]Gameplay:[/h1][/u]\n\nGameplay is as simple as it can get. The level select screen starts off with you being able to select one of the 10 levels (you can choose in any order you want). You have to finish all these 10 levels in order to unlock the elevator which takes you 1 level below into the depths of hell.  When you finish the next 10 levels you get to go down another level of hell. This goes on for 100 total stages in 10 levels of hell. Naturally as you progress downwards, the levels get harder and downright brutal. Every 10th stage of a level is a boss fight. These usually require more platforming skills and are longer compared to your average stage. There are also hidden (or hard to reach) beer collectibles which you can collect as well.\n\nWhen starting a stage, you cannot move unless you click your left mouse button, again, just like the arena shooters spawn mechanic. Once clicked you\u2019re dropped in the map/arena and you have to reach your goal which is a blue colored portal. There is a timer which you have to beat in order to actually beat the stage. Although when the timer runs out, nothing happens you\u2019re free to stay in the map and do whatever you want but when you actually get to the finishing portal it\u2019ll say you\u2019re too slow and to retry again. This is good to explore the map and strategize your movements, in the later levels when things get complicated, you\u2019d need this. There\u2019s also a sort of a 3 stars\u2019 system, except in this you have 3 versions of Satan. Normal, flaming and super flaming Satan. The quicker you finish a stage the better your ranking. You\u2019re also placed in the leaderboards and compare your times with your friends.\n\n\nTo get through the various traps, spikes, lava pits, pendulums and many other obstacles and objects your character can jump and depending on how long you hold the jump button the longer you can jump. If you want a very short jump you can just tap the button. The jump and in-air time really matters as you consistently have to use the longer or shorter jump to avoid obstacles or projectiles being thrown at you. \n\nYour character has a main fire ball attack. When you throw these fireballs they will travel in an arc sort of like a grenade launcher in many games. Your fire balls have many uses such as turn on fire switches which you simply shoot and they light up, these can open up gates. There are blocks which only appear when you shoot at them with your fireball later in the game. Other things such as mine bombs can also be destroyed with your fire attack. The power ups can also be picked up with your fireball.\n\nThere are many types of power ups you can pick which are required in the maps to be able to reach your goal. In the first levels you get the anti-gravity power pickup. This can make you fly so to speak. You can fly up in air by pressing the right mouse button and when you let go, you\u2019ll fall down. Another power up is the teleportation power pick up, which throws a teleportation ball in an arc and wherever it lands you\u2019ll get transported to that place. Right clicking again will immediately transport you to wherever the ball is in the air.\n\nAnother power up is the split ball. Upon picking up that you have the ability to split into 2 or sort of set a checkpoint of yourself and then right clicking again brings you back to the point you split off. This is used to power on switches and go back quickly or access places where you cannot go back from. E.G you have switches on the lower ground which you can jump to but cannot jump back up, so you have to rely on the split power up and set up a split point before you jump down there (an example of this can be found in the gameplay video below). Other power ups are also available such as a speed boost etc.\n\nThere are a couple of other modes as well. There\u2019s the speed run mode which can be unlocked for each 10 levels. These are basically the same levels as the story levels but you get to speed run them. Other mode is the endless mode which is sort of like those endless runner games such as Temple Run except this is way too hard. You have a wall of spikes chasing you and you have to keep running, your score is measured in terms of the distance you travel. This mode randomly generates obstacles and throws different obstacles, spikes, pendulums and other things at you. This mode is pretty hard.\n\nA short gameplay can be found below, please excuse the terrible aim. I played the game with in-home streaming with a regular mouse, different DPI from my main gaming mouse so things were a bit off.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=740580771\n\n[u][b]Graphics: 8/10[/b][/u]\n[u][b]Sound: 7/10[/b][/u]\n[u][b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b][/u]\n[u][b]Overall: 9/10[/b][/u]\n\n[u][h1]Conclusion:[/h1][/u]\n\nVery fun game for fans of platformer games, who like a challenge. This is basically a 3d version of Super meat boy with some elements similar to 10 Seconds Ninja X, while some puzzle elements thrown in there too which are similar to Portal or other first person puzzler games. The game is pretty good to look at and if you\u2019re also a fan of the old Quake movements, you will like this game. It\u2019s an homage to games such as Quake, Doom, Unreal Tournament and it does justice to them. Even though this is more of a puzzler/platformer game, it reminded me of those good old arena shooter days. Plenty of content and achievements.

I'm not including the bonus levels on this review since I didn't collect the hidden goodies. This will be my first steam review too.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe object of the game is simply to make it to the end of each level by making contact through these blue portals that act as a finish line. If I am not wrong there are hidden beers and among other stuff on each level that you can find if you want to look around, these will unlock bonus levels especially the ones around Floor 9. Platforming for the most part is solid, the only annoying thing I found is that jumping up through a platform section feels a bit slippery since you slide around a bit while climbing. Other than that there isn't much else to note, I am clearly not an expert on platform speedrunning but I did have a good time trying to make it through each level. You can try to achieve the best time to complete each level if your into that sort of thing, with some levels you'd be at first baffled to figure out how it was done so quickly. In conclusion about the gameplay, it's solid even if I'm not a fan of this genre.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1] \n\nThe music this game has to offer can get a bit repetitive even if each song is interesting and helps you keep going on each level. It's possibly something I cannot play outside of this game but the songs are good for what they are. Or maybe  I only like certain types of metal music. \n\n[h1]Art Design[/h1]\n\nThe environments look interesting when you spend the time looking at it. I can't go into detail because I'm not an art person but long story short the art and the look of the game does its job and I didn't notice anything bad about it.\n\n[h1]Voice Acting[/h1]\n\nThere isn't a lot of it in this game when I went through the regular levels but some lines are heard over and over depending on the circumstances, the lines are there just to be there pretty much. It's not a very story driven game so you don't have to listen to a lot of voice acting.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nOverall it is a solid platformer if you are into repetitive gameplay similar to other games you have played just like Geometry Dash, Portal or any other game that requires you to do memorization. The fact that this game has its own look and design prevents it from being a complete copycat and it turned out to be fun when you give it a chance. I covered the entire regular levels this game has to offer and I have gameplay videos on my playthrough of it when I livestreamed it if you want to know what the experience was like.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZOoOwcoHd4\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87yfnUz_6OE\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCR4b6nQlEE\n\n[b]6.5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1470418148, "timestamp_updated": 1470418394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24722511": {"recommendationid": "24722511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159728475", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482002799}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Pros [/b]\nAwesome Speed System\nEpic Jump Lengths\nCool powers\nDifficult Scenarios\nCool different paths\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\nVoices\nVery difficult\nInstant Death when you just tap a spike.\n\n[b] Improvements [/b]\nMaybe add both hands with animations?\nMultiplayer Races\n\n10/10 SS", "timestamp_created": 1470391086, "timestamp_updated": 1470391086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24717466": {"recommendationid": "24717466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964702528", "num_games_owned": 1762, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500221407}, "language": "english", "review": "\u201cWoah, what a rush\u2026\u201d\n\nThat's usually how I'm feeling after each session of SEUM: An addictive, fast-paced quake/unreal style 3D platforming non-parkour adventure.\n\nI've been following this game's development for some time and was very interested in this project fully intending to buy it at the very generous offering of $15. However, I was offered a review copy of this game and I really want to do the developers justice for their kindness and hard work.\n\nThere are a large number of games that have clearly inspired SEUM which in turn honors and borrows from. The most obvious will be Quake/Doom/Unreal based on the speed, camera, power-ups, and overall theme. There are also elements from 2D platformers such as the Jumper series and Super Meat Boy re-imagined in 3D. Finally, you can\u2019t help but feel games like Mirror\u2019s Edge and Counter-Strike Surfing have also shaped this experience. \n\nThe story is here for half filler and half theme. I\u2019m not going to elaborate on it too much because I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s important. Just imagine you\u2019re just a cool, nerdy, broski who really likes beer who can run faster than he realistically is able to.\n\nEach level is expertly crafted to slowly teach you the rules of the game gradually over time. I never found myself struggling on any particular level, except my own desire to beat a level as fast as I possibly could and score some killer top times and trying to beat my own personal bests, or my friend\u2019s.\n\nTo elaborate further, the game handles and performs like a dream which is crucial to the experience. Framerates are high, and controls are tight and accurate. The game NEVER feels unfair or cheats you out of anything. Everything is orchestrated and based on patterns. In order to achieve a higher time, you may need to wait to start the level after a few seconds and try different approaches to your problem solving and skills.\n\nIf you ever get tired from the rush of running really, really fast, the game has the perfect opportunity to allow you to slow down and relax and hunt down the hidden beer cans on each stage. This is a really great escaped, especially when you\u2019re stressed because you can\u2019t shed .300 of a time on that one level to make it to the top 10.\n\nThe audio is great, not much to say there. I think the soundtrack is OK, nothing amazing here, but it sets the mood and gets you into the groove.\n\nAs far as bugs and glitches are concerned, there have been a few instances where I noticed that when I scored a best time locally, the time was .011 or so faster than it was on my local time; not sure why this happened. \n\nI see myself coming back to play SEUM time and time again for fun and maybe beating some of my PBs when I feel the itch. I\u2019m really hoping for either a sequel or DLC because I\u2019ve tasted lava, spikes, acid, and fire baby, and I want more, more, more!\n", "timestamp_created": 1470359429, "timestamp_updated": 1470359429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24717437": {"recommendationid": "24717437", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994368591", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472562174}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is spectacular.

He than quickly reacts and cuts the Devils own arm off in return before the Devil slips back into Hell. The Redneck attaches the devils arm to his own and chases after the devil through Hell to get his beer back, wihle getting the oppurtonity to weild awesome devil powers to navigate through the different levels of hell as quickly as possible.\n\nThat is the plot behind this game, how can you not get exited to play this game. It is a steal paying 15 dollars for this game. I have already put over 4 hours into it, and am only about half way through the game. The controls are smooth, the levels are challenging and daverse. There are different modes to play through, and some wicked powers to help over come challenges as quick as possilbe. There is a running leaderboard on each level, to show where you rank up against the world for time. It is addictive and so much fun.\n\nThe only reason this isnt a perfect 10 is because there are some slight flaws with the game. The big one is that later through the game, the hidden beer cans are insanly hard to find unless you stumble across them by accident. The second  time objective is usally understanbly hard to get, but its fair, except for a choosen few levels, to where you have to be near perfect to grab the time needed for the medal. Usally when you run into those issues there are shortcuts you just havnt found yet, but there are a few levels where there are no shortcuts and you just have to be that good which is a bit unfair in my opinion.\n\nOutside of that, this game is amazing and everyone who enjoys first person shooters or games like Portal, should play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1470186267, "timestamp_updated": 1470186267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24680629": {"recommendationid": "24680629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027127980", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470413286}, "language": "english", "review": "SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is fast. Deaths are fast, levels are fast, the story is fast. One moment, Satan's stolen your \nbeer, the next, you're using his severed hand to traverse hellish platforms. \n\nIn this game, you jump, teleport and bounce across well crafted maps in an attempt to return your stolen beer. Of course, thanks to often brutal time limits in each map, you have to complete 'em fast, making the platform heavy gameplay frantic and fast. Thankfully, the controls are smooth like butter, so jumping about hell feels excellent, and levels are crafted in a way that makes them both difficult and fun to complete.\n\nBut if the platforming is a bit to difficult, and you find yourself getting frustrated, the game has your back. Not only is the game funny, with the dialogue of the protagonist, A beer drinking metalhead, as well as the cruel jabs from Satan when you inevitably fail, keeping you cheerful as you go through. It also helps that the music is damn fine, with a pumping metal soundtrack to keep you moving at a fast pace.\n\nIt's smooth, it's addicting as hell (Pun intended), and for it's price, there's a damn good amount of content on show with so many levels to complete.\n\nI heartily recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1470184348, "timestamp_updated": 1470184348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24680020": {"recommendationid": "24680020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315915093", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470357972}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, I really love the interface!", "timestamp_created": 1470181298, "timestamp_updated": 1470181298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24677675": {"recommendationid": "24677675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065265743", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470172045}, "language": "english", "review": "you cant b hop", "timestamp_created": 1470172079, "timestamp_updated": 1470172079, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.173428", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24676221": {"recommendationid": "24676221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213092276", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "last_played": 1514561429}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love speedrunning you will love this game.\n\nGood graphics\nVery addictive\nSo far ive got around 4hrs which is 36% of the game complete.\n  So your def getting your moneys worth.

There are a few games like this that I've played, but the controls are usually a little too messy or there are too many things going on (wall jumping/running, climbing, etc.).\n\nThe controls are really tight most of the time and I haven't come across any failures that weren't just user error. As for the music and the voice acting.. Eh. It can get annoying when you're on your 50th retry and you're grabbing a power up and the main character says \"I HAVE THE POWER\"... again. Luckily you can just turn down the voices.\n\nMusic also not really your style? too repetitive? Turn that down as well and blast Meshugguh or Taylor Swift if that's your thing.\n\nI'd probably give this game a 7.5/10; it's a good time killer for only $10-15", "timestamp_created": 1470086538, "timestamp_updated": 1470086538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24658262": {"recommendationid": "24658262", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996797029", "num_games_owned": 833, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470167212}, "language": "english", "review": "PC gaming needs more metal.

I\u2019ve seen my share of crazy plots in video games but SEUM takes the cake and eats it in one bite. You literally go to Hell and back, to recover a stolen case of beer. If that isn\u2019t a fresh start for this genre, then I don\u2019t know what else might be.\n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nApparently Hell is like a Japanese Game Show minus the gratuitous nudity. Nicely detailed obstacle courses mixed with intuitive and responsive controls, make trial & error less of a certainty once you become accustomed to the game\u2019s first few levels. It encourages a fast paced gameplay even if you\u2019re not forced down this road and you can settle for a more relaxed approach (as if sightseeing the Infernal domains has any resemblance to a relaxing activity). If constant running and jumping through portals seemed like \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d you can also swing fireballs at certain obstacles/objects and it is precisely this break from traditional 3D platforming, that helps SEUM truly stand out. Its ludicrous storyline is the cherry on top, at this point.\n \nThe game looks and sounds exactly as you\u2019d expect from a beer-recovery trip to Hell. Well textured deadly traps and a lot of quality Heavy Metal tracks, to constantly reinforce the game\u2019s high strung rhythm. That being said, with over 100 levels to choose along with several game modes, the sights do become repetitive (and especially so if you\u2019re an achievement collector) but that is not enough to mark it as a con.\n \n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Beautiful graphics and soundtrack\n+ Challenging and diversified gameplay\n+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n \n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Minor lag issues on later levels\n \n[h1]Result / Final thoughts[/h1]\nSEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is indeed a well deserved breath of fresh (as far as fire and brimstone allow it) air for any fan of modern platformers. This isn\u2019t just another fast-paced parkour game with an infernal skin all over. It features a novel story and has you hunting for beer cans and achievements alike. It even provides the Cards necessary for a Steam Badge and has an in-game bonus section. I\u2019m certain that even the rare lag issues I had on some levels, will be sorted out in future updates. The game as it is now, it needs little improvement and can provide countless hours of fun. Don\u2019t let Satan drink up your beer.\n \n[b]Rating 8/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives]Elite Giveaways[/url], check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1470036704, "timestamp_updated": 1470042077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745334", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24644661": {"recommendationid": "24644661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030163339", "num_games_owned": 1184, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470028793}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh, it can be a bit frustrating to achieve fast enough times to make the next level each time, and there is a very quick 'restart' to help one forget how badly we just did on each failed attempt....but all the frustration is forgiven by awesome graphics reminicent of 'Painkiller', \"Saints Row Gat' and other games painting hell in vivid colors; great metal music throughout, tough yet fair challenge, really responsive controls and an announcer that ridicules in a truly funny manner.

However, today it\u2019s a late morning for Marty; after a struggle to find the edge of his bed and make his breakfast, it\u2019s nearly midday! What a dreadful start to the day. It didn\u2019t take long for our friend to rediscover his smile as soon as he sat down on his favourite sofa. Then a knock on the door . . . \u201cWho the hell is knocking on my door so early this morning,\u201d thought Marty? Before reaching the knob, the door violently pulverised itself, and a Demon appeared in front of him. The Demon is after Marty\u2019s beer reserves and a mighty brawl ensues between them. Marty loses his right arm in the fight but manages to inflict a major blow to the Demon, who in turn loses an arm too!  After stitching the demon\u2019s arm to his own body, it is time to retrieve his beer reserves. . . Time to go to \u201cHELL\u201d\n\nSeum: Speedrunners from Hell is a FPS/Platformer/Parkour where you play Marty, an easy-going person who has been robbed of his beer reserve by a demon from Hell! \n\nAfter a cartoon-style introduction, you will arrive in Hell\u2019s main menu. From here, you will be able to choose between 3 modes of play. The first one is single player; this mode consists of one hundred levels divided into nines floors.  The main objective in each of the levels is to go as fast as you can to the round blue portal without dying, and to find the hidden beer can, too. When you reach the 10 levels in each floor, you will unlock the boss level and upon clearing this level, you will be able to jump on the elevator to go down deeper into hell!\n\nThe second mode is a speedrun parkour where you will need to clear all the levels from one floor as fast as you can, and the time will be added to the end of each level.\n\nThe last one is the endless level. In this mode, you will need to accumulate meters without dying - a Hell of a mode.\n\nI really enjoy the gameplay; the levels are fast and short and they become ever more challenging as you travel down to hell. As I mentioned above, you have to go as fast as you can to the blue portal with a time limit. If you manage to do half way through the time limit you will score a \u201cHELL YEAH\u201d demon symbol on that level. Then you will need to restart the level to find the hidden beer can. You must have a specific number of beer cans and demon symbols on each floor to unlock the boss level and the elevator. Marty has the ability to shoot fireballs with his new arm (a Hell of an arm) but will also find on certain parkours a teleporting or a gravity ability to be able to reach the portal. And yes, you will have plenty of obstacles to avoid. You also have a leader board, so if you fancy seeing your name at the top, you will need to be superfast. This game is really fun!\n\nGreat graphics accompanied with a hard rock soundtrack. The controls are fine and responsive and the game is very addictive. \n\nPositive:\n~~~~~~ \n\n-\tGreat graphics\n-\tHell has 100 levels\n-\t3 different modes of play\n-\tWell-designed levels\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~    \n\n-\tFrustrating at times\n-\tSome of the beer cans are really hard to spot\n\n8.5/10\n\nA little bit of Hell in your games library will not hurt!\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

SEUM has that special something. Here's why: \n\nThe basic maneuverability is an element in all speedrunner games, but SEUM offers special powerups that completely change the way you have to move and position yourself across the map. \n\nThe levels start out very straight forward, but soon you'll notice your best time is a lot slower than other people's. That's because the level design allows for different paths to be taken! The obvious choice is usually not the best compared to that hidden path you find after a dozen tries, and it's very satisfying to see your time decrease with each shortcut.\n\nThat's another thing, you often HAVE to find the hidden paths to even come close to the target times!

Well you were enjoying them until the big mac daddy devil himself shows up through a portal takes them away from you and when you try to stop him, you lose an arm and so does the dark prince.\n\nUsing his own flrey flesh covered appendage, you rock the joint and run through the portal after him to get back your six pack of sweet, savory, ice cold beer.  And boy does he shoot off his mouth too. Especially when you die or run out of time. Yep you are racing the clock in this one to get to the next level and let me tell you folks. It is smokin, sizzling, broiling down there in the depths of hell when you are running for the next level.  Those obstacles will keep you guesing and learning and trying to find the quickest possible route.  But there's more.  Beer is hidden and sometimes it's downright difficult to find faster than you can swing a broom at the top of the dark prince. \n\nThis game was created by pine studio and the level challenges are plenty and speaking of plenty there are plenty of achievements to unlock too. 51 minutes later i was starting to feel a little hot under the collar myself. Sometimes cursing my own luck at having to restart a level over when i'd almost reached the end of the level.  This game gives a new meaning to run like hell!  [h1]Score[/h1]8.4 out of 10\n\n[h1]Sound and music[/h1] By the time you hear the kicking music track while running for victory and the next portal, You start to get a little bit tired of your main character's constant death cries. I would have also liked a few more quips from the dark prince besides just what those you do hear when you die. But the sounds are decent. I would have rocked on with a couple more party pack cruisin and brusin musical beats but what's there is enough to get your groove on while you.   You want well done?  That's what the sounds are like. [h1]Score[/h1] 7.2 out of 10.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1] The scenery is broiling hot.  There are rooms, there are portals with chains, there are extra crispy looking pools of firey lava that make you just want to go Woah mama!  The visuals in this game are awesome to look at. Though i sort of get tired of seeing firey lava all over, but at the same time i appreciate the details in every portion of the runs. I like the fact that the place resembles something similar to the Doom genre in terms of outward appearance, even in doom the appearance of hell was staggeringly detailed.  You can expect the same from this game. Giving it that good crisp, clean feel like it was hot out of the oven.  I believe it achieved a good level of success. [h1]Score[/h1]7.9 out of 10.\n\n[h1]Game Mechanics and Controls[/h1] Now here's where things got dicey.  The controls for the keyboard while set in the WASD fashion, are a tiny bit clunky because sometimes as you are running, you try to press space and the game doesn't quite respond with an immediate jump.  Or you might accidentally go a little too far off the path and it's \"char broil city baby.\" I'm calling it right now, better to use a gaming controller with this.  While you can use the keyboard setup with a decent amount of ease, there does remain that minor issue of jump recognition.  There's also a slight problem with the mouse itself staying locked in.  For example in my run through, there was always a secondary cursor on my screen when there should only have been just the hand.  At one point during the game's run through i ended up having to quit because the game sort of froze as i was making a turn.  This game can be run on both a mac and a windows computer, I was using my mac when playing it so maybe that had something to do with it.  But overally the control scheme is fairly decent with the minor exceptions i had towards the jumping. [h1]Score[/h1] 8 out of 10.\n\n[h1]Final thoughts and Overall Gameplay fun[/h1] I'll certainly recommend this game to my friends and family. It's a lot of fun though i sometimes want to pull my hair out at some of the level challenges. But that's another fun factor all it's own, the game is tough. I like a good challenge and this game gives that experience.  I feel all warm and toasty inside when I achieve success, and I feel the frustration build a little bit when I screw up a jump or mis-time a move.  The game is tough and probably better off for older gamers with more patience.  But the game provides so much fun that it's like charbroiled brisket pipping hot right out of the furnace.  I was thinking i might see enemies attacking me at the stage progression but i haven't seen that yet.  I'll keep playing and if something new comes to mind, I'll plug it in here. My final thoughts are as follows.  1. I would like to have a little better on the jumping mechanic, otherwise the game plays very nicely.  2. Some of those beers are locked away in spots that i can't yet figure out how to open, but i'm sure i can figure it out.  3. Take a break here and there. It's a speedrun yes, but it's a speed run with quality.  So those are my thoughts, please do try the game for yourself.  My final fun factor [h1]Score[/h1]8.5 out of 10.\n\n[quote] This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gaming_until_end]Gaming Until End[/url], through the generous contribution of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellCowON]HellCow.[/url] [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1516081925, "timestamp_updated": 1516081925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39322508": {"recommendationid": "39322508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289207953", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496072387}, "language": "english", "review": "speedrun game every level has hacked #1 time", "timestamp_created": 1515883090, "timestamp_updated": 1515883090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39322223": {"recommendationid": "39322223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055587462", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1515364372}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1515882343, "timestamp_updated": 1515882343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39296179": {"recommendationid": "39296179", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988726315", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1194, "last_played": 1516204632}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Dry b\u2665tt tabasco secks in hell simulator 2018 [/h1]\n\nQuake/Unreal gameplay meets Super Meat Boy!\n\nYou gotta move fast, be smart, aim right, drink a gallon of salt... and of course headbang HELLYEAH !\nEach map is a puzzle which will drink your soul and cut some of your life expectancy.\n\nBe aware, great game, but not for everyone !\n\nMMMMH BARBECUE !!!", "timestamp_created": 1515808608, "timestamp_updated": 1515808636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39258227": {"recommendationid": "39258227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129062079", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "last_played": 1515690590}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would contamplate suicide again", "timestamp_created": 1515684192, "timestamp_updated": 1515684192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39238678": {"recommendationid": "39238678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128632258", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508416104}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok game.", "timestamp_created": 1515612002, "timestamp_updated": 1515612002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39210546": {"recommendationid": "39210546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341875009", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514036514}, "language": "english", "review": "Run...run...ruuuun.

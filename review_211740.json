I've played countless hours into this game. \n\nDue to this game being an old one a few might be put off by it's graphics the fanbase is quite active over on TTLG where patches and mods etc are constantly being worked on. However I would really suggest you play it vanilla first just to really get that retro feel if graphics don't bother you. \n\nIf you're looking for the literal grandfather of the stealth genre you've found it. Not to be fooled by that modern reboot crap made by Eidos Montreal. \n\nA game where you the player are thrown into huge multiple levels and left to your own devices after a short training mission, there's no handholding here no big pointy arrows or minimaps or ability to take on multipe guards at once you are a thief not a fighter and this is really emphasised through your character's physical weakness. So if you're a fan of hardcore stealth where any moment's detection could mean your last this is for you. See Thief as a trilogy allows the player to live this power fantasy usually gotten from video games in this case by allowing the player to be somewhere they're not supposed to be and doing something they shouldn't which by not getting caught in the process allows them to feel so much more powerful over their enemies.\n\nThief 2: The Metal Age basically improves upon many of the flaws found within Thief: The Dark Project. If you like me were first put off by The Dark Project's focus upon the supernatural and magic, then Thief 2 is for you. This game retracts back from The Dark Project's more labyrinthine level design but mind you that does not mean the scale of the levels within this product have been reduced in fact some of the missions I've come across in this game really make me wonder what the hell has gone wrong with the industry nowadays. For a game released back in the good old year 2000 I would never have expected to be breaking into three-floor banks with a whole network of tunnels to be found underneath, to buildings which are roughly 6-7 floors in scale as well as to have a whole sequence beforehand set on the rooftops of a steampunk dsytopian city in which I the player can eavesdrop and break into these buildings, hear guards argue across the streets to one another as well as witness another group of thieves taking goods from another house which yes being the master thief that I am I pilfer their goods without them noticing. Which may I add is all completely optional, the sheer volume of methods in which you can tackle your objectives as well as explore the world is quite astonishing and in retrospect a player can really see how Looking Glass studios as a company was well ahead of its time.\n\nCutscenes are the most beautiful and original concept I've seen and I've yet still to this day to find a game that hits the same level of atmosphere through design as found within the works produced by the team at Looking Glass in which through the style of rotoscoping some of their cutscenes where others are just narration over still images allows the artstyle of this game to really blend with the physical game itself through both shape and tone intertwining the overall Gothic/steampunk direction the sequel took. \n\nSoundtrack which is done by Eric Brosius is really something else which words cannot describe, the game is worth buying for it's soundtrack and sound design alone which still to this day not one single stealth game has for some reason nailed one of the most simplisitic sound design choices that Thief introduced to gaming; the ability to listen and hear your enemy approaching the same way in which Thief conveys.\n\nIt's a game you've got to at least try for a few missions to get into its very unforgiving and this can put some people off but stick through it and I guarantee you this will be one of the top games you've played.", "timestamp_created": 1515123483, "timestamp_updated": 1515124635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39061320": {"recommendationid": "39061320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149980067", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 372, "last_played": 1516308655}, "language": "french", "review": "Une version am\u00e9lior\u00e9e de Thief Gold :\nCe second opus de Thief est litt\u00e9ralement meilleur que le premier pour plusieurs raisons :\n  - Les ennemis m\u00e9caniques, beaucoup plus intelligent que les gardes normaux et difficile \u00e0 s'en d\u00e9barasser, apportant donc \n    plus de difficult\u00e9s .\n  - Parmis ces ennemis m\u00e9caniques, de nouveaux \"syst\u00e8mes\" de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 donnant du fil \u00e0 retordre pour ceux qui rushent.\n  - Des niveaux bien plus complets et simplistes, avec des objectifs certes simples mais qui obligent \u00e0 explorer la carte et \n    \u00e0 bien r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les loots tels que l'or ou des secrets.\n  - De nouveaux objets pratiques comme L'oeil m\u00e9canique ou la potion d'invisibilit\u00e9.\n\nJe pourrais en citer encore pas mal, mais je pense que c'est assez pour qualifier ce jeu de \"g\u00e9nial\".\n", "timestamp_created": 1515097150, "timestamp_updated": 1515097150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38979056": {"recommendationid": "38979056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030622430", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424793681}, "language": "english", "review": "best stealth game", "timestamp_created": 1514910351, "timestamp_updated": 1514910351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38958921": {"recommendationid": "38958921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313318960", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "last_played": 1516045445}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente jogo, queria conhecer a trilogia original de Thief, pois gosto muito de outros trabalhos dos criadores no mesmo ou em outros est\u00fadios, como Dishonored, Deus Ex e System Shock 2.

Apart from some minor tweeks, The Metal Age is not that different from it's predecessor: it's basically the same thing, only with robots instead of zombies (which are equally as terrifying, don't get me wrong). \nNow, Karras' machines are quite dumb, easy to kill and easier to sneak past but if they spot you, you are good as dead, babe. This means that the game focuses much more on ghosting this time around, going as far as giving your a couple of missions in which sneaking past every enemy without interacting with them is one of the objectives required to beat the level.\n\nIn Thief 2 there are many more enemies, more convoluted puzzles, more branching paths and it is overal more criptic and harder than the first game but you also have more gadgets to help you along the way: Invisibility potions, slow-fall potions, Noisemaker arrows that actually work, exploding frog eggs that I've never used once and my absolute favourite: water arrows. I know they're not new to the series by any means but if you start a level and you buy anything but water arrows you're an idiot OR a masochist. Also I feel like they should have used Garrett's fancy mechanic eye a bit more. It smells like wasted opportunity right there, even because it was Karras himself, the main antagonist, to design it. It could have been a strong plot point and a great way to renovate the old game mechanics but instead it's just kind of there.\n\nThe graphics are improved a bit, still not that great but, I mean, for the time they were decent. Again the maps are incredibly large, labyrinthic and detaled so that's understandable but what I find inexcusable though is how repetitive the level design is. In the first game every level was memorable and unforgetable but here they are all kind of mhe, a part from a couple of exceptions (\"Life of the party\" is just fantastic). \nI feel that the problem here is that they went for a more geometric and specular design. Every corridor looks the same, every room has the same props in the same places so yes, you get lost easily, which is good in a thief game, but it's just not fun in this one in particular. Maybe this is the reason why they decided to include a marker on the in-game map that tells you where you are, I don't know but I'm really glad they did. It totally makes the \"notes\" feature useless but at least the game is playable like that.\n\nThe plot is, well, good? It's quite an intricate story and I think it needed a bit more breathing space: it starts too late into the game, so it gets rushed near the end. The plot itself is not bad at all, it's probably even better than the original's, I just feel it could have been told better. \n\nIn conclusion, Thief II: The Metal Age is not as good as the original but it's still worth playing! The subtlety, the creepy atmosphere, the ingenious puzzling, the great voice acting, the amazing sound design, it's all still there, it's just a bit lazier this time. I know that you shouldn't fix what's not broken in the first place but still, this game could have been so much more!\nIf you like the original Thief you'll like this one too, that's for sure and if you're into modding as well, then you may want to explore the modding community that this game has: it's huge.", "timestamp_created": 1514642092, "timestamp_updated": 1515188067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38807966": {"recommendationid": "38807966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156321680", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513656720}, "language": "english", "review": "there's metal in this here age", "timestamp_created": 1514527742, "timestamp_updated": 1514527742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38732391": {"recommendationid": "38732391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079376161", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514369852}, "language": "english", "review": "Together with the original Thief it reminds The Peak of the Stealth Genre.

Die Serie habe ich fr\u00fcher abseits von Steam gespielt.\n\nZur Orientierung: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063825413/recommended/211600/]Teil 1[/url] hei\u00dft im Original Thief: The Dark Project, im Deutschen Dark Project: Der Meisterdieb, wird - wohl \u00fcberarbeitet - nun als Thief Gold vermarktet, und ist technisch \u00e4hnlich dem Teil 2 hier, der im Deutschen Dark Project 2: The Metal Age hei\u00dft. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063825413/recommended/6980/]Teil 3[/url], der einheitlich Thief: Deadly Shadows hei\u00dft, ist technisch merklich ver\u00e4ndert. Thief (2014) ist ein sp\u00e4ter Reboot der Serie. Seitdem kam nichts mehr.\n\nIn diesem Klassiker des Stealth spielen wir (wieder) den Meisterdieb Garrett (meist in First Person). Garrett ist ein zynischer und mysteri\u00f6ser Antiheld, der in der Computerspielgeschichte einen hohen Rang einnimmt.\n\nGarret agiert diesmal in der durch Steampunk gepr\u00e4gten mittelalterlich-viktorianischen Stadt, die schlicht City hei\u00dft. Er deckt eine Verschw\u00f6rung auf, die die Bewohner in geistlose Sklaven (\"Servants\") verwandeln soll. Daneben bet\u00e4tigt er sich eifrig als Meisterdieb.\n\nDas Spiel ist deutlich umfangreicher als Teil 1 mit gro\u00dfen und detailreicheren Leveln.\n\nDas Gameplay fand ich beim ersten Mal, als ich es gespielt habe, sehr spannend. Es ist ein typisches Stealth-Spiel. Vorzugsweise versucht man, seine Ziele zu erreichen, ohne viel Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Daher schleicht man gerne, l\u00f6scht Lichter und bleibt im Schatten. Man kann an den Wachen oft vorbeischleichen, manchmal ist es aber auch Teil der Mission, sie auszuknocken.\n\nDie Ziele sind zu Beginn eines jeden der 15 Levels angegeben, k\u00f6nnen sich aber aus aktuellem Anlass auch mal \u00e4ndern, was immer mitgeteilt wird. Man kann jederzeit nachschauen, was noch zu tun ist.\n\nEin offener Kampf mit einem Gegner ist entsprechend dem Stealth-Charakter des Spieles schwer und sollte vermieden werden. Man sollte immer vorsichtig zu Werke gehen. Dazu hat Garrett auch moderne Hilfsmittel wie die einer werfbaren Kamera, um die Gegend zu beobachten.\n\nMit ansteigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad ist es zudem gar nicht erlaubt, Gegner zu t\u00f6ten. Ausknocken geht aber, dazu hat er einen Schlagstock. Pfeile diene dazu, Lichter zu l\u00f6schen, Wachen abzulenken oder durch Moos die Schritte zu d\u00e4mpfen.\n\nDie Vielfalt an M\u00f6glichkeiten, ans Ziel zu kommen, hat mir sehr gut gefallen.\n\nEs gibt viele Objekte als Beute, Teils sehr gut als Secret versteckt, so dass man je nach Ehrgeiz ziemlich besch\u00e4ftigt sein kann.\n\nEs gibt drei verschiedene Schwierigkeitsgrade, die man zu Beginn jedes Levels einstellen kann. Dadurch werden die Gegner hell-/schwerh\u00f6riger und die Missionsziele werden erschwert/erleichtert.\n\nViel Speichern sollte und kann man, denn manchmal wird man auch mal von einer Wache hinter einer T\u00fcr oder \u00e4hnliches einfach \u00fcberrascht oder man wird entdeckt, obwohl man sich doch so sch\u00f6n versteckt hat.\n\nDie Grafik ist f\u00fcr das Erscheinungsjahr 2000, ganz in Ordnung. Dem Gameplay tut es nur wenig Abbruch. Interaktive Objekte werden (etwas \u00fcbertrieben) erhellt dargestellt, was das Gameplay vereinfacht.\n\nDer Sound ist auch passabel. Manchmal erz\u00e4hlt Garrett in einem inneren Monolog. Oft gibt es stimmungsvolle Hintergrundmusik. Die Ger\u00e4usche sind auch OK.\n\nDie Steuerung ist mit Tastatur/Maus ist in Ordnung.

But not before they do a different type of game which was \"System Shock 2\" a sci-fi, horror, sort of rpg type game. It was good in it's own right, but during that process it seems they may have forgotten some of what made the first Thief game good. Also to clarify this is more or less the same time period as the first game. \n\nFirst of all the simple stuff, in the 2nd game we still have the great drawn art style for most of the cutscenes and we still have the store and briefing intros, we also still got Garrets great voice and personality. However the level design, atmosphere, and enemies (for the most part have changed). In the first game you had a mysterious, sometimes horror, sometimes just cold and lonely, sometimes funny atmosphere all at the sametime. The pagan factions and their creatures really brought a unique feel to the game. However in this one, it will feel much more generic where you only have normal guards and robots. The fantasy element and mysterious part of the world is almost completely gone. Now it feels much more like System Shock 2 rather than Thief. In fact many of the new enemies are just re-used and re-skinned assets from System Shock, which is just lazy. Another change to the gameplay is that the levels are GIGANTIC, some levels easily overstay their, welcome, either having their best parts at first or at the end, but some will easily feel like a slog, even if you are liking it, you will find yourself saying is it over yet? This gets worse in a game series that already was balanced perfectly now has random robots all over the place and cameras! So now you have to worry about that while there is so many more guards than there should be walking around. Because it's not just the size, it's the amount of stuff in it. So many more enemies that it begins to force you to play a certain way rather than thinking things out. Not too mention instead of using a great mixture of how the sound works with different floors, so many areas and levels have nothing but marble floors which are so loud that you end up having to either waste money on so many moss arrows or you have to cheat and do the thing where you barely tap the keys to move in half animation to make no sound. Big levels are great but not so big they feel bloated. They even admitted to wanting to make it bigger and tougher but this isnt how they should've. They honestly should have made their AI better, but this is something all companies do even now, make the game artificially harder rather than fixing their braindead and limited AI. However i will say the levels still have the great art style and look from the first game and thankfully they did find a way to push the engine to be able to allow them to correctly furnish the rooms, house and banks look like real ones from the time period, no longer do you just have a random table with a chair or two in the rooms like the first. So that's one good thing, otherwise the gameplay is mostly the same, just boring cuz of the mostly poor level design, enemy types, and enemy placements. Also considering how the engine works, they are certain parts that will make you really pissed, without spoiling, it's a part later on that requires \"some masks\". Another positive, the music and sound quality is still great. At certain points you do get great brilliance with how this is used but is often ruined by everything else i mentioned. The dialogue for voice acting is also still great and funny. \n\nNow i already mentioned the robotic minions of the great enemy...or not so great enemy. The new big bad guy, has no real precense in the game and once again will remind you of system shock. Think  Atlas from Bioshock but even worse. This guy has a terrible voice that just makes him annoying to listen to, he isn't intimidating at all unlike the spooky pagan god from the the first game. And there is just not real rising action, or climatic event like the first game. The last mission is easily the worst in the game and series. I'll just tell you, that you spend the last mission to \"defeat\" the bad guy by crafting..... CRAFTING. No portals, no real race to the clock, not spooky atmosphere. Just mundane running around crafting. \n\nIt's so sad but it's obvious it was either made by different people or they did forget the brilliance of the first game. It's sad too cuz still has traces of first, has pretty and somewhat interesting levels, has mostly the same ideas and feel but gets ruined by their changes and lack of imagination. It's the sophmore slump, the lets return to what game was great and praised and try to do everything bigger and better rather than fix things. In the end i wish steam (once again) had the maybe option but im gonna give this one a NOT recommended. If you loved the first and wanted the 2nd, get it cheap and realize it's gonna be different and will only have a few moments of great feeling like the first while the rest of the time you slog through, just keep that in mind. There are great fan missions for it, 100s of them, so that might be the only real good reason to get this one. People often say deadly shadows went the wrong way, but this game was the start of that. So keep all this in mind.

As my name entitles, this is probably THE best stealth game ever made! I will go in depth why it is and why YOU should be playing it:\n\n  Let's start off with a list. What makes a stealth game one of the greats? In my own personal opinion it is: Have engaging and functional stealth mechanics. Provide the player with alternate routes and methods of completing an objective. have interesting, unique levels. Have said levels progressively provide challenges to overcome. NO FORCED combat! And most of all, have an engaging story and setting that makes the player WANT to progress. Every stealth game I have ever played usually doesn't have all of these things checked marked on the list. MGS has forced combat and has a questionable story that tries to be over the top yet subtle at the same time. The first two Splinter Cell games were far too linear and also forced combat at times. Not to mention the sub par stories. Conviction tries way too hard to uncheck every thing on this list. Dishonored's story is cliche and is WAY to easy any way you play it (Yes, even the non lethal no powers run is too easy). Death to Spies has barely any atmosphere or story. The list goes on. That's why everyone's favorite stealth games usually are Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the Hitman series, and other games that manage to check the checklist. What about Thief 2?\n\n This game checks every single thing on the list and for some parts, even goes BEYOND the criteria. Every level is HIGHLY unique, replayable, massive, and intrigueing all at the same time. From a shipping warehouse to a bank to a police station and more, no two missions are ever the same(except two that uses the same map). Not only are the locations unique, the objectives are as well. You are sneaking into the warehouse to get enough money for your RENT. You are sneaking into a bank to get evidence on the sheriff. You are going into a police station to frame a guy by placing evidence in the VAULT. Almost every level is VASTLY open and there are not two, or three, but usually FIVE ways to get into the building and there are always two ways into every room. Is there a guard in your way to the staircase to get upstairs? Go take the other two stairs and your good. Although not all missions are quite heavy hitters.( Tracing the Courier in paticular) Not to mention, Only TWO out of FIFTEEN missions in this game require you to knockout people. That means you have THIRTEEN ghostable missions. This makes this game one of the stealthiest stealth game I have ever played ( Say that 5 times fast). This game is so stealthly, the community has made terms like \"supreme ghost\", where you have to put back items you USED. Compare this to MGS, where they force you into combat every so often.\n\n Now, I wouldn't give this game the huge praise it deserves if the world and story were crap. NOPE! it is one of THE BEST settings to play in. An industrial, steam punk, fantasy world. An interesting story about how the industry is taking over the town. And interesting characters. The protaganist, Garret, is a smart mouth, no shits given guy that you WANT to play as. He has a personality that makes you want to check every nook and cranny just to see what he has to say. The factions in this game are also unique and interesting and you can probably remember their names instantly. They have their own weapons, armor, and even the way they talk. The Mechanists worship metal and technology and so they use enhanced armor and talk like a Shakespear character.(\" Who art thou?\") The main villian has a good purpose and is highly threatening in his own way.  The City guards are bumbling idiots who talk slow and usually get agitated easily. It just goes on and on.\n\n Speaking of the Mechanists, their inclusion in the game provide a great big help to the checklist. Their technology creates challenges to overcome. First you'll start off by seeing their version of \"security cameras\". Later, you'll see little robots of sorts that set off the alarm when spotted. There is some more, but if you have played the game you know what I mean. The levels get more massive and require more from you each time. Each gadget has it's purpose and yet is almost completely optional to help you in most levels. Using the light and shadow stealth is robust. But more importantly, the SOUND is what shines here. Different floor types have different noise levels. You can sprint on carpet, but once you get on a metal grate, expect trouble. It truly is a inspiring sound system not only to stealth games, but to game design in general. \n\n The ONLY problem I have with this is not even with the game itself. It's getting this thing to work on modern PC's. If you do decide to get this game, be prepared. Get the Taffer Patch and Tf2Tool patch or else this game will probably not work for you. There are also some HD packs to help make the game more beautiful. Do I even need to say it?

While I enjoyed it a lot as a stealthy game with an interesting setting, I was bothered by how so many people said that it wasn\u2019t a true Thief game.  Unconvinced, I was told to play the originals and see for myself how different they are.  So when I saw that the series was on sale, I bought it and have been playing Thief 2 for quite some time now.  And my initial thoughts after finishing the game, is wow.  Wow, this IS an amazing game and it puts the new game to shame.   With that said, lets get into the review.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\n\nYou play as a thief named Garret.  Your goal is to perform various tasks that typically involve stealing valuables or performing sabotage.   While not all jobs require you to steal, it is a profitable activity to do.   As the story progresses, you are told about a man named Karras who is using machine-men (Robots) to do all sorts of things.  He is a worshiper of some unusual faith and thinks that making these robots will help him win favor and help the world.   Simple plot, but it's enough to make each job related and important.\n\n[h1]Sounds[/h1]\n\nNo music, only sound effects and ambience.  For a stealth game, this is perfect because you need to focus on sounds, not music.  The sound effects used are pretty simple and hardly have any variation but it IS an old game so it was good for its time.  The voicing is pretty clich\u00e9 and not that good but once again, its dated.  I believe that this was the first Thief game that had female guards whom had unique voice lines.   Footstep sounds are distinct enough to know if you are loud or not, and it varies based off what you are walking on.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nLet's be honest, its dated, period.  For back then, it wasn\u2019t that bad, and even when using a mod that enhances the various textures, it still isnt the best.   However, the mod does make a lot of the textures look better.  On a [i]light[/i]er note, the lighting is very important in knowing if you are visible or not.  Some spots had issues where you appear to be in the light but are hidden while other times you are in the shadows but the game thinks you are visible.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis is going to be fairly lengthy since this is the MOST important feature of Thief 2, which is why I saved this for last.   What Thief 2 gets right, are all of the mechanics for a stealth game.  The only issue right off the bat, is the enemy AI which can be exploited if you choose to.  Outside of that, the game forces you to focus on a variety of factors when playing.  Sound levels are important in knowing how loud you are.  If you walk or run on tiles, you will be heard.  If you walk or run on carpet, then you won't be heard.  If you run on a wooden floor that is above guards who are in the floor below, then they will hear you and eventually run upstairs to see who is causing all those noises.  This also has an effect on the robots in the game.  There are big robots that can hear and see you, but there are small robots that won't see you unless you make noise.   This leads you into making sure to walk carefully around the tiny bots as they wont see you and thus you can evade them, no sweat.  The game even gives you tools that assist you with these noise issues, and its in the form of an Arrow that spreads moss all over the floor, making it possible to walk, run, jump without being heard.\n\nAnother aspect to the game, are lights.  Like with any stealth game, lights are important to have and to be cautious of.  There are plenty of light sources in the game.  Some can be turned off, some can be put out by a Water Arrow, and some cannot be put out.   When many of these lights are out, they are out period, but one type can be relight so you have to be careful of guards who want to light it up. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the enemy AI can be wonky or unfair for human AI, but the enemies themselves are interesting.  The Human enemies typically function the same.  They respond to loud noises, dead bodies, etc.  But it\u2019s the robot enemies that are worth mentioning.  In the game, there are about 5 or 6 robot enemies.  First type is a camera that moves back and forth and will lock onto a target if they are not hidden.  Stay visible for too long and the silent/non-silent alarms will go off and you're basically screwed.   The second type are large robots that react to sound and sightings.  They are deadly if cornered but are predictable.  The third type are the 'mini me' versions of large robots.  These type are blind but react to sound a lot faster.  Once they hear something, they will open up their eyes and look for the source.  If spotted, they immediately run to the nearest large robot or guard to alert them.  The other bots are far and few in terms of use but they have their own unique abilities like one is a child robot who cannot be stopped or destroyed, and another is a spider shaped robot.\n\nThe last basic mechanic is the archery.  I won't sugar coat it, the aiming with the bow, is pretty bad.  Some arrows have trajectory while others shoot straight.  There is no crosshair to use and often times its trial-and-error inorder to figure out how to aim.  Also, some of the hit-boxes for torches can be off too if hit at the wrong angle.  In the game, there are various types of arrows and useable items.  The arrows range from basic arrows that damage, to fire that explode, to vine arrows that allow you to create a hanging vine to use to climb places.  As for the items, they mostly consist of mines you can place to set a trap, and throwables that can help you see around corners or flash bang an enemy.\n\nAnd finally, I wanted to talk about the last design aspect for the game, and that is level designing.   The maps themselves are usually fairly large in size and feature a lot of ways to approach a situation.  Just like with most games, there are your path meant for non-stealth, true stealth, and opportunists stealthers.   Its amazing how well designed the levels are because it feels like there are so many routes to take and after playing each mission for so long, you start to realize how often these paths converge into each other and that\u2019s when it all makes sense.  Speaking of this,  secret pathways are used throughout the whole game as well as secret rooms.  Some can be obvious due to massive switches and handles, while others require some more, out of the box thinking to find.   The tricky ones are the places where the switch used is very tiny and blends in well with the background or is tiny and well hidden behind flags and posters.  For a game that was this old, it's simply amazing to see how detailed and well thought out the map creators were when designing the places.\n\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\n\nAfter playing this, I still enjoyed the modern Thief game but now I can agree with others who say that Thief (2014) is a good game but NOT a good Thief game.  I won't go into details about that game, but what I can say about this one, is that it definitely set the foundation for what a true stealth game should be about.  Few games can come into comparison to it and while yes it has dated graphics and an exploitable AI thing, it\u2019s a really damn good classic game that all stealth fans should play.  If anything it will give them a better appreciation for stealth games in general.  However, my final bit of advice is to make sure to install the Mod that patches the game and enhances the textures.  The patch itself will help prevent certain levels from being incompletable while making sure to fix issues that can cause players to escape the map or get stuck", "timestamp_created": 1512587915, "timestamp_updated": 1512588229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37904862": {"recommendationid": "37904862", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961523389", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410410497}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the all time greatest Stealth game.

Thief II keeps the wonderful stealth and exploratory elements of Thief 1, but improves on them by making levels large, sprawling, and fun to explore.  Stealth is more than crouching around, its keeping to shadows, avoiding noise, distracting people.  BUT, more importantly, it is very very fun.\n\nThis game has multiple difficulty levels, so if your looking for a challenge, or just want to experience an age old classic, it is all fun.\n\nIf your looking for story, this game will fill your needs.  Thief II builds upon Thief I's lore, but you don't need to have beaten that game, though I also suggest it, in order to enjoy Thief II's story.  Plenty of wonderful fantasy as well as intrigue, all delivered by the wonderful voice of Garret, master Thief.\n\nThief II is an old game, and rigid polygons, show it.  But while the graphics might have aged like milk, the rest has remained a goldplated master piece.\n\nIf you are looking at Thief II you have probably already heard about it, as it is a cult classic stealth game that modern stealth games often get compared to.  If you've ever wondered why every one says this game is benchmark for Great Stealth Based Gaming, I highly suggest picking it up and finding out.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511821299, "timestamp_updated": 1511821299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37819556": {"recommendationid": "37819556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410022453", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506184740}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game on my old steam account I played this alot probably 200 hours it is an amazing game, alot better than the newer ones!

Yes the gameplay can be kind of clunky at times-let's face it, they were breaking new ground at the time. But the bones of the game-the story, characters, voice acting, and basic gameplay-are all fantastic and really enjoyable. The games are so cheap rn I'd recommend buying them all and playing them in order, but that's not a requirement. Individually:\nGold: best level design. Really cool areas that shine despite the terrible graphics. Also the glitchiest\nMetal Age: my personal favorite. Best characters, best story. Also the best in terms of female charcters, if you're looking for that\nDeadly Shadows: best gameplay, by far.

The stealth aspect of the game is paramount to your success, if you are playing on the harder difficulties especially, as if you get caught, you do not stand a chance in combat, although a well-timed flashbomb, blackjack, and sprint to the shadows can help.

It's like this game doesn't age (and probably won't many years into the future).\n\n-The graphics may seem bad at first, but it only takes about one or two mission(s) for you to realize how good this game is. The amount of paths you can take in each area or level is just uncountable. You can try different approaches everywhere and the arsenal of items given to you makes it extremely fun to experiment. (Just save the game often because trust me, by doing some reckless things or trying them for the first time you might die or fail the mission, and you there are NO checkpoints, so you need to load the saved game to be able to play from the right moment.).\n\n-The Sound is. Absolutely. Perfect. This is the only game I know that concentrates on you paying attention to your surrounding at all time. You listen, trying to figure out where the guards are in the area or if there are any sorts of machines working, like cameras. Also each surface is either loud or quiet, forcing you to think through your actions before you walk in some direction. Guards can hear you if you're not patient enough and it's probably going to end ugly for you. (Also remember to stay in the shadows, Trust me, game rewards you for being slow and quiet.)\n\n-The movement in this game is much better than in the first one. Now you don't have to turn(camera) to be able to make turns, instead Garrett is able to walk right or left, which really makes the game more fun to play.  At least for me it was a bit of an issue, so I was relieved to know this was fixed in Metal Age.\n\n-The Main character is extremely memorable. You can't get enough of him and some of his lines. The jokes he makes at some moment of the game are just hilarious. He's extremely likeable and his voice actor is well picked. The Great Master Thief Garrett leaves a great impression throughout the entire game.\n\n-The Story is well written and contains a lot of plot twists and locations you're going to visit. Not all missions are simply about stealing something without being noticed or dying, there is a huge variation to each and it's circumstances. You're going to be visiting old building, some which are filled with extra high security, giant open areas, as if they came from some sort of a fairy tale or fantasy story, or even the big city at night where the entire action takes place.\n\nOverall this game is addicting as hell and I still can't cope with the thought of the idea that there are no more games with such brilliance and so much effort put into creating a perfect stealth environment. Maybe I'm way too blinded by its 'greatness' but Even though I can't give it anything less than 10/10.\n\nAlso, this is the first game that made me make such a long review. lol. It deserves a 10/10, Get it as soon as possible. YOU. WON'T. REGRET. IT. --- Unless you're a taffer.

Starting everything at 10 points. Points are only docked through negatives.\n\n\nVisuals: N/A\n=========\nGame was released ~17 years ago upon me playing this game and writing this review. It has not aged well. Graphics will not be accounted for in the final score for this game. That being said...\n\nThey hold up in that they play well. I do like how difficult it is at times it is to distinguish what could be a lever for a hidden room or just another background prop. Not much more to say. Check out the Steam pictures for a good idea.\n\n\n\nSound/Music: Starting at +10\n====================\nSound effects and music are overall weak but they serve their purpose. Not much detail needed here.\n\n- Some areas have a complete lack of sound effects behind him. This appears to be a bug. -1\n\n- A bit inconsistent as far as how well enemies can hear you. Marble tiles let enemies hear you miles away while a wooden tile will make you completely invisible to the ear. This was supposed to be a form of realism in what surfaces you should and should not avoid, but the the change between each surface is extremely drastic and exponential. -1\n\n- Terrible voice acting, and I deduct points because other games that came out a year before this one had splendid voice work done (e.g. The Longest Journey). -1\n\n10 - 3 = 7\n\nFinal score: 7/10\n\n\n\nPerformance: +10\n=============\n+ Game never crashed once\n+ Easy 60 FPS\n\nExcellent. Even in this day and age, this means alot.\n\nFinal score: 10/10\n\n\n\nStory: +10\n========\nYou are Garrett, a professional career thief out to steal things for your own benefit and livelihood. Overall story revolves around a Machinist Cult and what they have planned for the world around them. You are but a lowly thief caught in this plan (almost unintentionally), and it may just become your goal to stop them...maybe... who knows, you'll have to play the game to find out :)\n\n+ Returning characters from the first game. \n\n- Some returning characters get the weakest amount of screentime. Should've been utilized further. -1\n\n- Overall story in and of itself is bland and uninteresting. This may be due to the horrible voice acting. I certainly didn't care. -2\n\n10 - 3 = 7\n\nFinal Score: 7/10\n\n\n\nGameplay: +10\n===========\nAs stated in the opener, this is a glorified game of collectibles. Most levels will have random loot scattered across levels and it's your job, if you're OCD inclined, to collect everything, all while avoiding the guardians of said loot.\n\n+ Trying to find loot in and of itself is a lot of fun. It's a great feeling to find a huge stash behind a hidden door that you almost overlooked, or discovered while backtracking. The game's name holds up.\n\n+ Stealth mechanics, for how they're designed, work great. Stay in the shadows to avoid the guards; if you enter the light and they see you, they'll attack. Simple.\n\n+ A nice supply of items to help you \"thief your way around\" each and every level. The Rope/Vine Arrow was my favorite.\n\n+ For a game that is extremely repetitive in it's nature, I was pleasantly surprised as to how happy I was to dive into the next level after finishing a previous one. This game does repetition correctly, and I can't even fully understand why. I just had a lot of fun.\n\n+ Some exciting missions.\n\n- Inconsistent Lighting and Shadow regions based on the textures of the environment. E.g. Some tiles will be as bright as the sun, but your \"light/darkness\" meter will tell you that you are in complete shadow. The opposite is also true. Some tiles have no lighting whatsoever but your light/darkness meter will tell you that you're in a wide open brightly lit field of flowers wearing the most complimentary clothes possible. This is big deal for a stealth game. -2\n\n10 - 2 = 8\n\nFinal Score: 8/10\n\n\n\nOverall: 8/10 (32/40 = 0.8)\n======================\nI played this in 2017, and it was extremely fun. A nice addition and change up to the mostly dull formula in my backlog. Highly recommended for stealth game lovers.

Mas esse jogo remonta h\u00e1 muitos anos antes, j\u00e1 que foi lan\u00e7ado em 2000. A grande quest\u00e3o que eu fiz foi: \"Ainda vale a pena jogar um jogo t\u00e3o datado?\".\n\nResponderei nas pr\u00f3ximas linhas. Antes \u00e9 importante que eu explique. Esse jogo foi lan\u00e7ado no tempo do Windows 98. Rod\u00e1-lo n\u00e3o \u00e9 simplesmente clicar em play. Eu baixei o Taffer Patcher (TMA 218 beta). Com isso, consegui rodar e terminar o jogo, sem glitches nem bugs, num Windows 10 com hardware moderno, inclusive em 1920x1080.\n\nVamos ent\u00e3o ao review. Eu joguei o primeiro Thief h\u00e1 muito tempo. Olhando nos meus alfarr\u00e1bios (sim, eu tenho anotados os meus jogos terminados nos \u00faltimos 15 anos), terminei ele em 2003. E depois desse tempo todo, eu ainda tenho boas lembran\u00e7as da mec\u00e2nica daquele jogo. E essa mec\u00e2nica ainda se mostra s\u00f3lida depois de 17 anos. E \u00e9 por ela que eu ainda recomendo esse jogo. Esque\u00e7a a hist\u00f3ria. Sem mais a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de Ken Levine, que idealizou o primeiro game, ela \u00e9 apenas um adere\u00e7o. A mec\u00e2nica no entanto, permanece inalterada. \u00c9 a mesma experi\u00eancia do primeiro Thief.\n\nSe voc\u00ea fizer como eu e jogar no modo Expert, vai ter aquele desafio raiz, ainda reflexo dos anos 90, onde tive 36 horas de gameplay, pra 19 horas computadas no jogo (ou seja - morri praticamente metade do que joguei). No Expert ainda voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode matar ningu\u00e9m, exceto na \u00faltima fase. Isso dificulta um bocado as coisas. Falando de fases, s\u00e3o 15 ao todo, algumas bem longas e desafiadoras. O maior desafio, pra mim, se encontra nas fases que n\u00e3o tem apenas um objetivo claro do tipo \"Ir at\u00e9 tais lugares, fazer tais coisas e sair\". S\u00e3o as fases que exigem um m\u00ednimo x de loot, ou encontrar x itens ou x segredos. Essas s\u00e3o as que tomam mais tempo, pois exigem explorar todos os cantos do cen\u00e1rio, nocautear cada inimigo e desabilitar todas as defesas. Pode ser mais sacal do que o esperado. Dito isso, algumas dessas fases foram um bocado irritantes, mas a maioria em geral foi divertida, ainda mais que os cen\u00e1rios variam bastante. Muitas das miss\u00f5es acabam sendo envolventes pelo desafio imposto. Foi um sentimento bem parecido com o que tive ao terminar o primeiro game.\n\nTecnicamente o jogo, como eu disse, \u00e9 de 2000, o que significa prim\u00f3rdios das placas 3D e tudo mais. Os personagens s\u00e3o pobres em pol\u00edgonos. As texturas e os cen\u00e1rios ainda s\u00e3o agrad\u00e1veis, visto que o jogo suporta anti-aliasing, ent\u00e3o, em Full HD, n\u00e3o \u00e9 a coisa mais feia que existe por a\u00ed. As cutscenes s\u00e3o bem tosquinhas, com resolu\u00e7\u00e3o bem baixa (provavelmente 800x600 ou menos).\n\nO veredito \u00e9: Tem jogos mais modernos. [i]Dishonored[/i] \u00e9 um bom exemplo de jogo que, se jogado \u00e0 moda stealth, lembra bastante Thief. No entanto, esse aqui vale a pena se voc\u00ea:\n- quer um verdadeiro desafio \u00e0 moda antiga;\n- n\u00e3o se importa com gr\u00e1ficos datados;\n- ou ainda, se voc\u00ea tem um PC velhinho, que n\u00e3o roda o estado da arte mais atual.\n\nNOTA 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1508424125, "timestamp_updated": 1508425543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35783011": {"recommendationid": "35783011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109598973", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503786123}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is basically what I do most Friday nights.", "timestamp_created": 1508196366, "timestamp_updated": 1508196366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35767764": {"recommendationid": "35767764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380506501", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504756375}, "language": "english", "review": "Thief 2 improved considerably over the first one.

I may be in the minority in saying that I prefer both the original and Deadly Shadows more,\nbut goddamn if this isn't a worthy successor in every way, continuing the series and building upon the world that you helped shape by the end of the last game.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++The sound design in this game is phenomenal. The propogation engine, the voice acting, how it effects gameplay, everything is just at the highest standard possible which is to say totally unmatched.\n++The cutscenes in this game are, again, and I'll be repeating this a few times, totally unmatched within video games as a whole\n++The atmosphere is extraordinary, even if it isn't as strong as Dark Project or Deadly Shadows\n++Levels can take an hour or more to complete and are totally rewarding the whole way through\n++The sneaking is just plain fun\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Graphics are a noticable improvement over the Dark Project more so in consistency and art style then technical acheivement.\n+Using Tafferpatcher, I couldn't ask for smoother performance on modern systems\n+Levels are huge, but not for the sake of being huge\n+The addition of officially marked secrets is awesome\n+A lot of the new equipment is really cool\n+I've always liked the animations in these games, but some people seem to think they've aged really badly\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-The soundtrack by Eric Brosius was made to be more musical than ambiant and it doesn't work nearly as well. It's in no way bad though.\n-+The Life of the Party is just disappointing, but I guess it's not its fault it got hyped so much. Plus, it's not bad by any stretch of the imagination.\n+-What the hell are the point in vine arrows? I used them like once for metal surfaces the whole game.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-One level is turned into two which is utterly lazy and unenjoyable considering how the level wasn't even that good the first time\n-Movement seems to glitch on surfaces more than the first game which is quite frustrating\n-Physics tied to framerate (60FPS)\n-Mantling works 40% of the time and is 90% the reason I get caught. I don't know what happened from Gold to 2 to have it be so frustrating.\n-If you're crouching in pitch black, not moving and an enemy isn't already alerted to you they can walk into you without getting alerted. I've had multiple occurences of that happening and them getting stuck on me for a couple of minutes. It's just silly.\n-Bit of a glitch fest\n-The storyline is only half as good as Thief the Dark Project or Deadly Shadows\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--The last 3 missions are beyond disappointing. After 3+ playthroughs I still have never once had the will power to finish the final level no matter how hard I try. The two before it are the worst in the game besides it and it really doesn't help that both levels are exactly the same in layout with terrible level design.\n---I honestly find the level design to be a large step back from the original. There's a reason the entirety of Follow the Courier's concept was only a tiny section of Assassin's back in Gold. A lot of levels are tedious, repetitive and not great in the replayability department. This being said, it's not terrible, it's just very disappointing.\n\nSound: 10/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nContent/Replayability: 7.5/10\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nAwards:\nRunner-Up Game of the Year - 2000\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nOn my first playthrough, I found it hard to decide whether I liked Gold or 2 more. Honestly, this game and this series mean a lot to me. Everyone\nshould give this series a shot, starting right from the beginning and working through in order. My experience when doing that was utterly unmatched.\n\nAfter all this time though, I find Thief 2 to be overrated and to be a thoroughly disappointing sequel. The level design doesn't hold a candle to the other games in the series, what could have been amazing ideas are executed poorly, the AI is shoddy and there are zero gameplay innovations.

I have the game on CD but bought the Steam version because my CDs no longer play the end mission videos.  Those videos push the story along and the plot is much better with them.  The game is similar to a first person shooter but the best way to play is on the hardest difficulty level in which you aren't allowed to kill any humans--you have to play by stealth.  I have to say, knocking out a guard with a blackjack is much more satisfying even than killing a boss in many other FPS games.  At the same time, it's still a lot of fun to kill a guard from a distance with an arrow at lower difficulty levels.  I never did succeed at killing guards with a sword--I just take too much damage.\n\nEvery mission is different--reconnaissance, rob a mansion, escape an ambush, blackmail someone, follow someone undetected and more.  Weapons are varied and most are useful for things other than killing enemies--a rope arrow to climb, water arrow to put out torches, moss arrow to dampen sound on hard flooring etc.   Don't worry, you still get to kill nonhuman critters (and humans in lower difficulty levels).  While all of these elements make for excellent game play, Thief II's plot is wonderful.  One of my only critiques is that the plot should be advanced farther within the missions than through the end of mission vidos.\n\nThe look and feel is not outdated even though the game is almost 20 years old; in fact, I hope there's a 20th anniversary edition--I'd buy that in a heartbeat!\n\n9.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1504839155, "timestamp_updated": 1511541950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34790475": {"recommendationid": "34790475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196886859", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507839627}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Ehk\u00e4 paras stealth peli mit\u00e4 oon pelannu. 5/5 suosittelen", "timestamp_created": 1504773447, "timestamp_updated": 1504773447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34726219": {"recommendationid": "34726219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030574635", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497829157}, "language": "english", "review": "I know this is sacreligious to say, but the game is a relic of the golden age of PC gaming and does not hold up to todays standards.

I could even see someone finding some good in this game that never liked old pc games. Its like an old car without power sterring, airbags, seat belts, air conditioning, power windows, radio, or comfortable seats. The exterior isnt sexy and theres not alot of horsies underneath the hood either, its more of a jalopy. It's def worth a try when it goes down to 2 bucks though. \n\nHope you enjoyed this review.

Seriously, at first sight you might think \"ugh, looks kinda ugly\" but as you take your time to invesigate and explore the world that Looking Glass Studios has made, you begin realise the level of thought and detail that they have put into making each level that completely outweighs the graphical negatives.\n\nAs someone who has played the likes of Dishonered and Deus Ex Human Revolution, you can really see the similarities and influences between them which makes you realise what an important franchise Thief has been to the Stealth genre.\n\nConclusion:\nI heavly recommend this to all stealth fans or anyone looking for a classic to play.\n\nA BIG thank you to Saleck who made a guide to help you get Thief 2 running on modern computers while also helping you add mods to improve it visually.

less about combat and more about stealth.\nThe most interesting part I found in this game, like in thief 1, the increase in difficulty gives you more objectives to do and restriction on killing or being detected in a few missions which will test your skills.\nAnd although the graphic didn\u2019t age well, this can be remedied somehow with the fan made patch for better textures and compatibility with modern systems (check the PCGAMINGWIKI site for more info).\nIn addition, you can add the Shadows of the metal age mod which will add great fan made levels.\nThe only problems I had with the game is the final level design which in my taste was too long, too labyrinthian and had too many highly religious steam powered killer robots.\nAlso, the controls for jumping and climbing stuff are not OK but dodgy \u2013 when you think you should be able to grab a ledge while jumping or try to go down ropes or ladder, it will not always register as such and you would likely fall to your death or loss some life.\nBut other than those things, it's an excellent game, an excellent thief game (where you can jump) and I really suggest to those who like proper stealth games with good story to try to get past the graphics and play thief gold and its sequel thief 2 the metal age.", "timestamp_created": 1503800633, "timestamp_updated": 1503802660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0,

"Improves on the first one mechnically in every way, lots of refinement on a solid foundation. Character models and textures still not great, but world building and design still top notch. Stylistically is a departure from first, less fantasy elements and is in some ways less medieval and more victorian aesthetically. Still is very spooky, but in a different and more subdued way, pure thieving for the most part. \n\nAdds new features and gimmicks but doesn't drastically change much, very easy to jump right into and enjoy after playing the first. Levels are massive and incredibly unique, multiple storied buildings and towers with complex but believable world design. Not all levels great though, a couple are forgettable and the last one takes far too long and drags out, having to consult a walkthrough is bad for the final mission, but that's my fault for being dumb, you may have an easier time. \n\nStory contrasts with the first, villain is memorable for his goofy voice and how absurdly evil he is. Hippies will appreciate this games pro environmental message tbh. Lots of twists and turns.

Its sequel surpassed it masterfully. (Some spoilers ahead.)\n\nIn 2000, at the turn of the century, Looking Glass Studios were not looking hot. Despite their massive successes with Thief: The Dark Project and, one year later, System Shock 2, the studio was nearing bankruptcy. They were only kept afloat by Eidos as part of their contract, but their sacrifices, and eventual closure almost immediately following Thief 2's launch, were worth it, as this game can be called their swan song.\n\nThe idea behind the game is simple. Instead of killing the enemies you encounter, you're mostly supposed to sneak by them instead, pilfer whatever they're guarding, and make your getaway. The gameplay is almost exactly the same as Thief 1, with some changes I will write about in a few paragraphs.\n\nAt the end of the first game, Garrett is warned about the dawn of the Metal Age by the Keepers. As the second game starts, The City is seen in a full industrial revolution, spearheaded by a breakaway faction of the Hammerites, known as the Mechanists. Their leader, Karras, is a gifted inventor, and directs his Friends, as they call each other, to work on new technology to benefit all. At the same time, greenery in The City begins to fade as part of this wave of changes. Garrett will re-enter this world as usual, doing contracts for his 'pals' or just for himself, but becomes pursued by an emergent police force, possessors of Mechanist technology and a zero tolerance policy on crime.\n\nOne thing I should mention about Garrett is that he definitely comes across as more fleshed-out. His personality is mostly the same gruff, darkly-humoured realist-cynic, but he takes plenty of opportunities to display it, in the game itself and in cinematics. Speaking of cinematics, they, and really the entire game, are a lot more polished than its predecessor's. Together with a change in theme from darkness and abandoned places to more homely, cozy areas made colder by the sound of metal grinding on metal comes a facelift in texture work and art style, marking Thief 2 as a clear sequel.\n\nThis change of technology has brought about a few new toys to play with and plenty of obstacles that stand in Garrett's path to riches. Flares exist as items that can be activated, carried and thrown to help with pitch black areas. Additionally, Garrett's eye can now interface with another new item called a Scouting Orb, which can be thrown like any other item, allowing the player to see through it. Scouting Orbs can even be picked up and re-used!\n\nHowever, with new toys come new enemies they must be used against, all of them mechanical in nature, ranging from rudimentary cameras called Watchers to patrolling automatons armed with cannons, impervious to simple swords and arrows, and requiring Garrett to think of some other way to eliminate them or sneak by them.\n\nOn the graphical front, the game uses the same Dark engine used for Thief 1 and System Shock 2 before it, albeit made to look pretty for the times. Otherwise, it's exactly the same as Thief 1 on all fronts. What Thief 2 has instead of innovation is a gripping story, with some unexpected twists and turns, more human locales to be visited, conversations to be overheard, and mysteries to be discovered. Even the enemy AI has improved visibly from the first game.\n\nTo sum up, if you liked Thief 1, you'll love Thief 2. The developers' experience shows, as the game has been improved on all fronts. And if you finish the game and want more, check out Thief 2X, a fan-made expansion released in 2005, or any number of other fan-made maps.", "timestamp_created": 1500768163, "timestamp_updated": 1500769411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33510102": {"recommendationid": "33510102", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961067330", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499901359}, "language": "english", "review": "A gem for the past , and a worthy successor to the first game of the serie.\n\nStill one of the best stealth games around, less centered around esoteric stuff than the first game but very similar in everything else.\n\nCan't really go wrong with these 2 games.", "timestamp_created": 1499973917, "timestamp_updated": 1499973917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33494061": {"recommendationid": "33494061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338398954", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505002924}, "language": "english", "review": "Thief II obiously falls short on the technical side (animations, graphics, options) compared to newer games like Dishonored, but the story is subtly told, the lead character is interesting and nuanced as a person, the levels are complex but easy to navigate, and stealth gameplay is unbelievably real and immersive.

The stealth is very well done, every type of terrain emits a different level of loudness whenever you step on it and allows you to think more strategically for every level. You different types of equipment each with their own uses. For example, you have moss arrows that when shot on the ground it creates a soft surface for you to walk on (very useful for marble floors), water arrows to put out torches and provide more darkness, flash bombs to disorient your enemies and knock them out, and so forth. If you are spotted by guards you'll die in three to four hits, so your best chance of survival is staying behind the shadows. Once you get the hang of everything, you will feel like a master thief. \n\nThief 2 has aged like wine, I can even say it's a masterpiece.

I have never played a Thief game before, this was my first encounter with it.

Its atmosphere is absolutely incredible. This is mostly thanks to exceptional level design. Not a single level felt like it was borrowing from the previous one. For a game with over 35-50 hours of gameplay, that's pretty exceptional. Especially regarding that the levels are filled to the brim with secrets, loot, characters, passageways, etcetera... Remarkable. Garrett is an excellent protagonist, and the game really gives everyone a solid backstory, be it through excellent dialogue or in books/scrolls you find lying around. \n\nThe game is not without its negative points though: some parts of the story feel a bit overly weird or convoluted, and the graphics are, even with the HD mod pack, a bit of a hurdle to get over. \n\nBut don't let that stop you from playing, what is as I now know, rightfully called a \"classic gaming experience\".

Man findet immer wieder etwas neues oder erschrickt immer wieder, wenn man entdeckt wird.\n\nEs ist eines der besten Spiele der Looking Glass Studios.\nDas Spiel setzt unmittelbar die Handlung von \"Thief - The Dark Project\" fort, wenngleich es sich mehr auf das Stehlen konzentriert und Horror- bzw. Gruselelemente im Ggs. zu Thief etwas reduziert worden sind. Ich pers\u00f6nlich mag \"Thief - The Dark Project\" etwas mehr als Thief II, aber das ist Geschmackssache.\n\nGraphisch hatte sich schon etwas getan. Es gibt farbige Lichter, leicht h\u00f6heren Polygoncount, bessere Texturen und gr\u00f6\u00dfere Maps, dennoch ist die Graphik damals schon, wie bei Thief, veraltet gewesen. Ein \"Unreal\" sah eben besser aus.\nSpielerisch, klanglich und storym\u00e4\u00dfig ist Thief II jedoch absolute Spitzenklasse. Es macht immer wieder Spa\u00df, die Mechanisten, eine Splittergruppe der Hammeriten aus Teil 1, zu belauschen, auszutricksen und plattzumachen.\n\nDas Spiel oder eben die Reihe (Thief , Thief II und Thief III - das misratene Etwas von 2014 wird nicht gez\u00e4hlt) bergen extremes Suchtpotential und laden immer wieder zu einem Streifzug ein.\n\nF\u00fcr Thief II gibts Unmengen von Fanmissionen und sogar ein inoffizielles Addon namens \"T2X - Shadows Of The Metal Age\". Eine bis heute aktive Community bringt immer wieder etwas neues.\n\nDas gr\u00f6\u00dfte Gl\u00fcck f\u00fcr Thief und System Shock 2 war die (unbeabsichtigte) Weitergabe des Quellcodes der Dark Engine, womit es m\u00f6glich wurde, das Spiel zu patchen, zu erweitern und mit modernen Rechnern kompatibler zu machen (u.a. Breitbild-Unterst\u00fctzung). Ein Programm namens \"Tafferpatcher\" installiert den Patch 1,24, diverse Bugfixes und, wenn gewollt, neue, verbesserte Texturen und ist somit sehr zu empfehlen. Ein \u00e4hnliches Tool gibt es auch f\u00fcr System Shock 2, welches auch auf NewDark aktualisiert wurde.\n\nF\u00fcr mich ist Thief II eines der besten Spiele \u00fcberhaupt.

As a sneaky boy who likes to hit fleshy people with blackjacks, these robots and cameras will present a large problem to you.  Funnily enough, if you beat the absolute shit out of a robot with your blackjack for long enough, it will break, but it is easier to incapacitate them first with one of your water arrows (which are in limited supply) to their engines.\n\nLevel design is fantastic, better than the first game's.  Each level is nonlinear and massive in size.  The enemy AI is good, and does not fall apart when they start to look for Garrett (unlike this game's predecessor in which they simply moved toward Garrett while they looked for him).  Just like the last game, you have an arsenal of gadgets at your disposal that allow for unparalleled creativity in how you can approach an objective, including the iconic rope arrow (which allows for tons of creativity just on its own).  Enemies are diverse and challenging, and the levels often require you to find hidden areas or encourage you to find secrets.\nSword combat returns almost unchanged, which is good for the most part,

The situation calls again for the master thief as he gradually involves himself in the unfolding of the master plan behind this new faction and its leader.\n\nAgain, like in the previous game, [i]Thief I[/i], I chose to install a mod for some minor fixes I've read that this game needs, although from my experience, at least, with these two games I have never encountered a single crash or any major inconvenience (excepting here the fact that Garrett is totally lacking basic ladder climbing skills). I chose a simple and light mod, without graphical enchantments called New Dark (Unofficial patch), which, as the name suggests, is a patch, namely a community patch. Regarding the game itself, as a whole, I can say that it is largely similar with its predecessor, with a few improvements, of course. The difference is seen when we look at the story, the first game focusing more on the old ways, nature and the world beyond while this game centers its story inside The City and its altering under the Mechanists.\n\nAltogether this game didn't disappoint, as expected, and it is, for me at least, as good as the first game.

No game since has done anything like this, which is why Thief 2: The Metal Age remains at the top of any list of games with stealth focus even today.\n\nAside from the fantastic stealth gameplay, it is the atmosphere created by the interplay of level, sound and lighting design that serves to fully immerse the player into Thief's steampunk setting after the initial shock of the dated graphics has worn off. The textures might look blurry, the particle effects on streetlights like something out of an 80's arcade game, and the polygon count in single digits, but none of it matters once you have sneaked past the first guard, relieving him of his purse in the process.\n\nThe horror elements of the first Thief are a bit more subdued in the sequel, and more emphasis is placed on the pure stealth and thievery aspects, which is something I personally prefer. However, the story is just as gripping as in Thief 1, with old aquaintances making an appearance and old feuds buried for the sake of new make-shift alliances. I would definitely recommend you play Thief 1 first, and then return to play Thief 2, if only to be able to fully appreciate the story of Thief 2.\n\nI must have played through this game at least 10 times if not more over the years, and even though I could probably find my way through most of the levels without looking at the screen, it has not lost any of its appeal.", "timestamp_created": 1480069426, "timestamp_updated": 1511412590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505515", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27330866": {"recommendationid": "27330866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044193622", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438283290}, "language": "english", "review": "Great stealth game.

Looking for stuff should be a key aspect of a game where the core principle is stealing and that is something you really have to do in this game. There's no objective marker, the map only shows where you've mapped out, and you actually have to listen to people and read things to find clues. The world building in this game is also really good.

While Looking Glass Studios may have invented the modern stealth genre with Thief: The Dark Project, they perfected it with The Metal Age. This game\u2019s innovative use of sound, sprawling level design, and impressive amount of player agency, create an experience that still immerses me to this day.\n \nMetal Age\u2019s missions consist of sprawling sandboxes that allow the player to pursue objectives in whatever way they see fit. Along with the wide variety of tools spread throughout these missions (arrows, mines, bombs, etc.), there are practically infinite ways to traverse any given level. The levels themselves are set in a wide range of pseudo-medieval locations. As master thief Garrett, you\u2019ll be robbing banks, breaking into manors, trailing people through city streets, and so much more. What's really incredible about The Metal Age is that in all of its vastness and player choice, it always manages to feel organic. During my time with Thief II, I never felt like a guy in his computer chair, I really felt like a master thief. This feeling of total immersion is greatly aided by Looking Glass\u2018 creative and dynamic use of sound. Your footsteps make different noises at different volumes depending on what surface you walk on. You can lean against doors to hear a muffled conversation between two guards. Every coin, key, chest, door, and ladder, makes appropriate jingles, creaks, and thumps. Eric Brosius\u2019 composition work deserves special mention here. While not traditionally musical, Thief II\u2018s soundtrack expertly creates a nocturnal and ominous ambiance that never really comes to the forefront, but is always present.\n\nWhile it should be clear by this point that I consider Thief II to be a classic, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a perfect game. The Metal Age\u2018s most glaring flaw is in its visual fidelity. As a 3D game that's over a decade-and-a-half old, the graphics have aged somewhat unfavorably. Models are low-poly, with rigid animations and less than great texture work. While the dated graphics didn\u2019t break my own personal immersion while playing, if you\u2019re the kind of player who finds low-poly graphics to be distractingly jarring, this game may not pull you in as much as it has others. While not as much of a sticking point as the visuals, Thief II has one more notable flaw. The two missions prior to the final mission are practically identical, down to reusing the same map and having dangerously similar objectives. Neither mission is particularly bad, but the needless redundancy so close to the game\u2019s conclusion may be frustrating for some players.\n\nThat being said, these two flaws are relatively minor tarnishes on what I consider to be a nearly perfect game in terms of player choice, level design, and use of audio. Some classic games are recognized for their influence on the medium of games as a whole, whether it be a innovative mechanic, or even inventing an entire genre. However, we often return to these games and find them to be dated or unentertaining. Thief II: The Metal Age serves as a welcome exception to this trend, and has stood the test of time to become one of the greatest stealth games ever made.            \n\n\nOverall Score: 9/10\n\n+ Huge Levels\n+ Multiple Paths / Choices Through Missions\n+ Great Setting Variety\n+ Good use of Sound\n+ Highly Immersive\n\n- Dated Graphics\n- One Redundant Mission", "timestamp_created": 1479963196, "timestamp_updated": 1479963196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686176", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27019011": {"recommendationid": "27019011", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966905899", "num_games_owned": 574, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400971073}, "language": "english", "review": "The quintessential stealth game.

The world is unique, the characters are interesting, and this game has a lot to offer. I enjoy nearly all genres of games, but stealth games are especially close to my heart. The Thief series is one of the crowning achievements from that genre.\n\nThe game doesn't pester you with petty morality or some insane story arc, Garrett (You) is not some chosen savior or defender of the world. Garrett is a thief, who's only worry is the coin in his pocket. This doesn't mean that Garrett is a bad man. He has saved people, been called a hero, and tasted some of the glory that came from it. However, after that glory has faded, it's time to pay the rent. A new mansion to hit, a new rumor spreading, and new allies and enemies to face. Garrett is a simple man who finds himself in odd and dangerous situations.\n\nThis time, the world has changed from what anyone knew before. With the invention of technology and crude robotics, being a thief just got much more difficult. Cameras, Special Locks, and Soldiers of Clockwork roam the high-end homes of the upper class. What these people think protect them may just be their downfall, this new technology does not discriminate, with your new tools, patience, and skill, you can show them who no door holds back, you can show them that you, are a master thief.\n\n(Side Note: I recommend the TafferPatcher and the HD Mod for this game, TP will improve your performance, and fix practically all the bugs, while the HD Mod does what the name implies, makes the game gorgeous.)

Thief 2: The Metal Age improves upon Thief: The Dark Project (or in our case, Thief: Gold) in every way imaginable. With a greater focus on grand medieval heists and a more focused story along with more polished gameplay this game is by far the best entry in the series.\n\nThief 2 begins some time after the events of Thief: TDP. What makes Thief great in terms of story telling is how fluid and well-paced it is. Starting the game by helping out a friend, then stealing enough loot just to pay your rent until eventually Garrett stumbles on a great threat and then an even greater threat pulling the strings from higher up.\n\nEach mission can take you an hour or more to complete. The level design is superb: many rooms boast different types of surfaces which make varying amounts of noise with carpet and grass being the most quiet and tile and metal being the loudest. This game takes advantage of verticality with rope arrows and eventually vine arrows. You can really feel like a Thief when you set up a rope arrows on the roof of a building and lower yourself down to steal a highly valued item and them shimmy back up just before a guard shows up. Levels range from a bank, to a police station to a huge 6 story mansion to an underground base that houses a submarine. There's a lot of variety to be had when it comes to level setting in this game which is greatly appreciated.\n\nGameplay has largely stayed the same but with the addition of a few new gadgets and enemy types. After the events of Thief: TDP Garrett now has a mechanical eye he can make use of, he can use scanning orbs to make sure places are safe before continuing which is a welcome addition. The game also boasts many new enemies such a robots, security cameras and even more varied guard types. For example there are guards wearing thick helmets who cannot be knocked out with the black jack. The best you can do is stun them and when you hit them their helmet will make a loud noise and draw the attention of other guards, luckily these helmet-toting guards are easy to identify. If you disturb guards enough they will be on 24/7 alert. If guards see a pool of blood from you murdering someone they will search the area thoroughly and continue to do so until you are either caught or if you knock them out or kill them. The AI can vary to being absolutely brain-dead (hiding in the shadows and one gets close enough to smell Garrett's breath but doesn't notice him) to being way too sensitive (one step into a dimly lit room and they're already chasing you).Luckily this doesn't happen too often for it to be a serious problem but it does happen.\n\nLastly the sound design is superb. You can hear foot steps of enemies just as well as they can hear yours, you can hear them whistling and talking in a realistic manner. The ambient sounds bring atmosphere to the missions. Whether it be the whistling of the wind, the moans of undead, music at a party or people writing while doing paper work. Thief 2 has amazing sound direction.\n\nThis game is old and the graphics are dated with a few problems here and there. But the gameplay and atmosphere outshine all of that. I have never had a stealth experience that comes anywhere close to this game or its predecessor. The game does benefit from having a fan-made patch (brings modern widescreen resolutions to the setting, allows modding and playing of fan missions and fixes a few bugs) which can be found if you go to the guides section of the community page. It goes on sale often for less than 2 dollars, this game is worth every penny.

This was something that happened in Thief:TDP, but in that game, it wasn't a problem. Not only were there breathers were I could sprint across open grass, or swim in relative safety, but also I was immersed and excited by the locations and the many many hidden secrets and background I was constantly happening across.  \n   \"I wandered around lost and unsure a lot, but there was nothing that was unenjoyable about doing that.

I know the thrilling feeling of mastery from T:TDP would come from this game's mechanics as well. It is a well balanced game with a story and setting that is unique and palpable. There are many routes, tactics, and styles of facing obstacles.

Being the least known of those 3 (at least from my point of view), Thief, for me,  is the most advanced on how a sneaking game should be, and that\u2019s coming from someone who don\u2019t have nostalgia glasses attached at all.\n\n[h1]Dawn of The Metal Age [/h1]\n\nYou take the role of Garrett, the cynical, sarcastic, and somewhat selfish master thief, with his only goal is to steal enough goods to pay his rent. A pretty interesting hero (or antihero) in the get go isn\u2019t he? That very attitude, skill, and notoriety is the source of the problem on both games. You start off by having a couple of disconnected missions, before the real problem takes off. Thief Gold (I\u2019ll just call the first one Thief Gold from now on)  has a pacing issues in the first couple of missions, because they\u2019re kind of a long \u201dintroductory\u201d missions. Setting up the Thief universe, Garrett as a character, and it\u2019s gameplay mechanics, and then it becomes a bizarre and intense supernatural horror story. \n\nWith all the universe building stuffs is done by the first one, and all the supernatural mumbo-jumbo gone (not completely, but it put in bare minimum). Thief II doesn\u2019t have to suffer with all of these, it has a better pacing, more focused, more intricate dystopian-thriller story, set in an even more well realized steampunk setting. From a \u201cmodest\u201d manor to a high security, 6 story towers, from stealing lowly goods to ancient mask, Thief has a unique storytelling, we all are as clueless as Garrett is,  all the story elements dropped in the perfect time and place. Take example for Karass, the antagonist, the common people only know him as \u201cThe guy who leads The Mechanists Order\u201d, and so does Garrett, and us, the player view him, and he becomes a more threatening figure, and that\u2019s through texts and overall environmental storytelling only. \n\n[h1]Stealth At It\u2019s Purest Form [/h1]\n\nWhile Thief Gold is a thieving game turned-supernatural stealth-semi-platformer halfway, The Metal Age is a \u201cthieving simulator\u201d all the way to  the end. Thief II is simply a much more refined version of Thief I, minus the annoying zombies, and maze-like location, my biggest gripe with Thief I. Improved graphic, making a more beautiful contrast between light and dark, and improved sound design. All thanks to  the amazing \u201cDark Engine\u201d, an engine designed for Thief, and Thief alone, and yes, I know System Shock 2 use this engine too, but Dark Engine truly shows it\u2019s technical prowess here. It has a unique aesthetic and probably the best \u201cbuilt-in\u201d directional sound design ever. Even until now, I can\u2019t think of any game that has a directional sound so spot on even without the help of a software and hardware  \n\nThief is a stealth game at  it\u2019s purest, most immersive form. Your ear, eyes, patience, and common sense is your greatest strength. Thief is a slow, I mean, really slow stealth game, especially on expert where you can\u2019t kill any humans. Stay in the shadow, lean on every corner, creep your way around, and be patient and spatially aware, because once you\u2019re caught, well, you're one dead thief, especially if you play on expert\n\nThe interface is minimalistic, there\u2019s your health, your light gem, and inventory. No mini map and quest markers.  That help a lot with the immersion, you are lead to appreciate and respect the surrounding area, the unique art style and layout in each level, heightened your spatial awareness.\n\nThere's one flaw in this game and that's the AI, they are... inconsistent. Ranging from nearly blind/deaf (or both), to superhuman sense. You might think the AI gets smarter every time you advance to the next level, well.. to an extent yes, but for the most part, it's \"unpredictable\".\n\n[h1] The Art of Level Verticality [/h1]\n\nTwo defining characteristic of Thief, that Thief II managed to improved, as I said earlier are the sound design and level design. I won\u2019t delve deeper into sound design, because there\u2019s not much to write about. It\u2019s simply amazing, spot on, and overall has a defining \"exaggerated\" sound design. Let\u2019s focus on level design for now. It\u2019s FANTASTIC, it\u2019s huge, titanic huge, believable, follows architectural logic, and has an \"oppressive\" atmosphere throughout that fit with the theme very well. Unlike the second half of Thief Gold, when the level goes total mindfuck, in a good way, mostly. In term of level scenery, Thief Gold has more variation, from tomb, prison, cathedral, ruins, and mansions. Thief II levels are all worldly architecture. Only one level that goes to Thief Gold territory and that happens to be my least favorite level. As I said, it\u2019s huge, more complex, but logical complex, that what makes Thief II a more fun experience than Gold. It\u2019s harder to get lost, even if I do it\u2019s easy to get back on track, making the exploration much more enjoyable. \n\nThe level verticality is simply astounding, so many paths, some is more obvious than others, some require keen eyes and careful exploration, some requires you to hear conversations and reading notes. It\u2019s so rewarding every time you enter a room, and realize there are 3 or more ways to get in / across. There is a vent that connects that room to the basement, the celling that connects to the attic, there\u2019s always the so obvious ground hallway, or you can move through the interconnected rooms and picking up loots and notes, and oh! There\u2019s a secret passage if you put out that fire, saves my time from creeping out this place!  Every route is fun to take on, making every level looks larger than it is. Besides there\u2019s no better feeling when stumble across some loots on the way. \n\n[h1] Less Is More [/h1]\n\nOne major flaw in the gaming industry trend nowadays is the fact that a lot of today\u2019s games forget the phrase \u201cLess is more\u201d, the removal of an element hold the same importance, or even greater importance nowadays, as adding one. They take a shotgun approach, throwing everything that looks cool hoping it will sticks. It\u2019s not necessarily bad, but with that design philosophy in mind, a game will become a \u201cJack of all trades, master of none\u201d and directionless. That\u2019s a plague that need to put in moderation.\n\nThief in the other hand, is already set out to be a hardcore stealth game from the very start. It\u2019s simple and humble in presentation, and that\u2019s what makes it works in perfect harmony.  With a \u201crealistic stealth/thieving game\u201d in mind, Looking Glass can focus on what\u2019s important on  a stealth game. The combat is terrible, the gadgets are mostly stealth oriented, you are \u201cforced\u201d to do the stealthy way, but it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a stealth game after all. It\u2019s not about playstyles in Thief, it\u2019s about the route you take and they deliver.\n\n[h1] Through The Looking Glass [/h1]\n\nIf I have to pick what\u2019s the most underrated game developer for me, it\u2019ll be a tie between Looking Glass and Black Isle. Though I might choose Looking Glass, because Thief, System Shock, and Ultima Underworld are less known than Black Isle\u2019s Fallout series alone. Without them, there\u2019ll be no Ion Storm (Deus Ex), Irrational (BioShock), and Arkane (Dishonored), it\u2019s no coincidence that all of them are such  a hit. So short lived yet so influential, A timeless stealth game Thief II Is.

A third of the way through at 10 hours.\n- Different difficulties EXPAND mission objectives, not just making something harder, like less health.\n\nCons: \n- Because the levels are so open the game is old enough, the maps for the levels dont tell you where you (exactly) are. You have to orient yourself. This can make navigation harder than expected and for those used to hand-holding, it might be frustrating.\n\nNeutral:\n- There is minimal emphasis on combat.

The difficulty is challenging but not tedious. The graphics are dated, but more than makes up for it in incredible sound design and ambient music, wonderfully composed by Eric Brosius. Not only that, but the game is filled with character. The atmosphere is dark and the fantasy world presented here is creative and interesting, but the game also has a very dry sense of humor that keeps things from getting too grimdark. Fantastic voice work from Stephen Russell, who voices the memoriable recurring guard Benny, the very eccentric, Truman Capote-esque villian Karras, and the delightful bastard of a protagonist Garrett.\n\nAbsolutely fantastic game.

Throughout the game, you must sneak around in various missions and locations, all while uncovering a potentially much larger problem that goes beyond Garrett himself.\n In terms of gameplay, it plays similar to the first Thief game. You sneak around, completing various objectives, all while trying to remain unnoticed. While combat is an option, Garrett is rather unequipped when it comes to fighting enemies, and stands little chance against more than one foe at a time. Stealth is by far the best option, and Thief 2 still holds up as one of the best stealth games i\u2019ve played. Guards have long, unpredictable patrols they take, meaning they don\u2019t simply walk from one end of the room to the other making them easy targets, which keeps the game tense and forces the player to always be on their toes in case a guard shows up unexpectedly. Guards are always alert, and will investigate a noise they hear. If they catch a glimpse of you, they may decide to look around, forcing the player to keep moving so that they aren\u2019t found. Garrett\u2019s main means of hiding is darkness. By hiding in the shadows, guards won\u2019t be able to spot the player, allowing them to sneak around unnoticed. The mechanic of hiding in darkness and being exposed in the light works excellently in the game, and it was quite revolutionary for its time. Another interesting mechanic is how not all floors produce the same amount of noise when stepped on. Things like carpet and grass will produce little noise, while marble floors will produce more noise, potentially bringing guards over as well. As you progress through the game and begin stealing from richer people, more marble flooring will be found and more electric lights will be used, meaning it will get harder to keep quiet and stay in the dark.\n The level design is some of the best i\u2019ve seen, even an improvement on the excellent design of the first game. Levels are non-linear, large, and open, and can have many different sections, each with their own ways to sneak around undetected. The levels are also very varied. Some you may find yourself in a huge mansion, some in the streets of the city, and in many other locations as well. Garrett will have a large array of tools at his disposal to help him through the levels, including many different types of arrows such as water and vine arrows that will help in certain scenarios. \nThief 2 also wisely gets rid of the more paranormal settings and enemies that were common in the first game and replaces them with more stealth focused ones. In the first Thief, many of the levels revolved around ruins and caves filled with enemies such as zombies. These levels didn\u2019t offer much in terms of stealth, and for the most part involved simply running right by the enemies while avoiding their attacks. Enemies such as zombies are rarely seen in Thief 2, and luckily don\u2019t break the flow of the stealth gameplay. Thief 2 does use new enemies in the form of robots, but luckily they can be snuck around, making them similar to guards. They also offer a good challenge, because they cannot be knocked out, and throughout playing the game I never once destroyed one. I don\u2019t even know if it was possible to destroy one in the game at all.\nThe game and the people in it also have a lot of charm. Garrett isn\u2019t some lifeless protagonist; he\u2019s a man who can take a moment seriously, but isn\u2019t afraid to make a few cynical remarks about the people he\u2019s stealing from. He isn\u2019t some special hero who people shower with praise, he\u2019s just a guy trying to make enough money from stealing to pay his rent. The guards in the game also have excellent, sometimes quite funny dialogue, and the drunken tone of their voice is a great way to get across their character. \nThe story itself is also very good, and is often told in a non-direct fashion, meaning the player will learn more about the story and world by reading notes left on people's desks, listening to guards talking to each other, as well as other ways. This also gives players more of a reason to look around and explore the environments. While the story itself may seem simple at first, it slowly builds up and becomes something more. It\u2019s rarely a flashy story, but it\u2019s subtle, as well as intriguing and interesting at the same time.\nI can only really think of two complaints about the game, and they're both pretty minor. First, climbing in the game can be a bit difficult, and if you miss the ledge your trying to grab, the character may jump by accident and alert guards to your location. Second, it seems a bit unfair that taking one step on a marble floor brings every guard in the nearby area to your location, especially when guards are already walking over marble floors without anyone caring. Still, these are only small complaints and they didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the game.\nOverall, Thief 2 offers a great improvement over an already great game. It\u2019s one of the best stealth games around, and it has gameplay that still holds up today. The graphics will seem quite dated by today's standards, but if you\u2019re able to get around that, it shouldn\u2019t hinder your enjoyment.

You can very well skip the first game and just play this one. You will miss out on the first game, but this game is the superior one, and I don't think that you'll lose too much if you play this game before the first one, save for the lockpicks not being in the first game until much later in the game.\n\nThief 2 is a pretty old game. You'll have to re-bind controls right away (F is crouch, for example), movement is less smooth than today's games, and combat kind of sucks. Luckily, the movement is easy to get used to, and you're never supposed to engage in combat anyway.\nThere is a bit at the end where the same map is used for 2 levels, and I'm not a fan of the final level, but the rest of the game is so excellent that it outweighs all the negatives in my eyes. \n\nSeriously, this has to be the greatest stealth game in existence. Stealth is based on line-of-sight, whether you're in a shadow or not, how much noise you're making, and even if you have something reflective in your hands. \n\nThere are also a metric buttload of different entryways and routes that you can take. You could play this game over and over for years and never know about a certain ledge that you can jump on if you jump just right that gives you an entirely new perspective on a level. There are also a ton of secrets in the vein of Doom and Doom 2. The great thing about these secrets is that they're never hidden in a way that makes no sense. If there's a wall that slides away, then there's a button, or a movable torch-holder, or a bookshelf with a pullable book, or something else similar that's somewhere closeby.\n\nThis is all I have to say about the game\n\nIf you don't own it, start owning it.\nIf you've never played it, start playing it.\n\nUnless, of course, you don't want to give money to Eidos & Squeenix\nThe orignal developers aren't going to see your money if you buy this, and the Thief reboot already crashed and burned, so buying this game doesn't really do anything other than give a big publisher money.

Newer cars are better than old, that sort of thing. The stealth genre is the only thing where this doesn\\'t seem to be the case. Not to say that there aren\\'t good modern day stealth games, of course there are. However, as of right now, none of them have seemed to surpass Thief 2, just offer and equally good experience, despite Thief\\'s age. \n\nI won\\'t go crazy on this review, but here is an example. Hitman is a stealth game of sorts, and as most games do, it discourages you from killing bad guys. The less bodies the better. How does it do this? With points, a negative effect on your over all proformance review, just some numbers on the screen. And thats all fine and dandy. But what about Thief. \n\nThief is entirely organic, as it encourages you to be as stealthy as possible in a totally realistic way, that is much more planned out, while avoiding the whole issue of pulling you out of the experience, reminding you that \\\"this is just a game\\\".   If you encounter a guard, you could try to sneak around him. One small mistake could get you killed though, so why not knock him out? You could, but then you have to worry about the body, which if not well hiden enough, could ruin everything. Meanwhile, killing him would be even worse, since that would not only make a body, but also a blood stain, which would require a water arrow to clean. This natural progressing of actions and consequences encourages you to play with as little encounters as possible, instead guiding you to learn to sneak past guards without ever interacting with them in the first place, being the ultimate ninja. But this doesn\\'t feel gamey, and doesn\\'t feel arbitrary or tedious. \n\nThis is just one of the many reasons why Thief 2 still stands up as a great stealth game.

Even though a lot of the stealth mechanics don't make much sense, such as a guard not being able to see you should you be standing inches away from them if you're in a dark spot of a brightly lit room, everything about this game is FUN. You'll spend about 40-60 minutes in each level, and that's if you're ignoring picking up all of the loot that's scattered around.\n\nThe story, in comparison to the original Thief, is very well written and intriguing. The plot in the original had you fighting zombies and tomb raiding, while in this game, the focus is on the transition from a dark ages fantasy game to \"The Metal Age\". You don't feel so much like a spelunking knight with a sword and bow and arrow, but an actual thief, taking on bank heists and even sneaking through a medieval police station and stealing from the evidence vault. \n\nThe screenshots displayed on the Store Page really don't do the game justice. For a game from 2000 the graphics have aged tremendously, and the lighting and texture work look fantastic to this day. My favorite level is the bank, just because of how spectacular the green tiled floors, wooden walkways, and red carpeted offices look. \n\nNot only do the levels look incredible, but they have some pretty great layouts and the level design is ingenious, inventive and sprawling. After replaying the bank mission so many times I've found six different ways to enter the building, and there are so many different routes you can take to get to the vault without being spotted it's insane. From crawling through a vent and dropping down into the offices adjacent to the vault room, shutting down the mechanical faces (which act as cameras hanging from the ceiling and spinning around trying to spot you) by flipping a switch on the third floor and going through the teller gates, or going through the lions den and using a rope arrow attached to the ceiling to cross the Guard's Room and into the backdoor of the vault room. \n\nI also love that each section of the immensely huge levels has a little nugget of dialogue to be heard that are entertaining to listen to and informative. The voice acting isn't great, but I always ended up quicksaving each time I heard a guard speaking with another guard so I could hear the full thing and then quickload so I didn't lose any time. What is really well done however is Garret talking to himself, usually stating the obvious but it helps players stay on track when he explains something to himself the player might not already realize. His little quips and things he says never get old, even after you've played the same level three or four times.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an outstanding gem of a game that you would be doing yourself a disservice not to play.", "timestamp_created": 1460818189, "timestamp_updated": 1497318989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22442801": {"recommendationid": "22442801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219469521", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488653082}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever!", "timestamp_created": 1460775809, "timestamp_updated": 1460775809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22418686": {"recommendationid": "22418686", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997515390", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493669925}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my favorite stealth game.

At the core it uses same mechanics and even same techonology of engine as the original, so some might think of it as expansion pack. Yet it's upper level of design is different, being designed like a proper stealth game and having more steampunk setting.\n\nAlso, yea, you probably heard that this version doesn't have credits music. It's not a false statement, but it's not suppose to have one to begin with. It's just that localizator of German version decided to add some song from some German band. Doesn't sound Thief-like at all.\n\nTechnically, it's released as-is and thus has some problems. Like, it doesn't support widescreen resolution or anything more than 800x600.\nI think that just like with Thief 1 on Steam, to see cutscenes you have to run .exe file with admin rights. But I think it already does it?\nI also noticed that the gamma slider doesn't work either. And in this one I felt that the game is way too dark by default. Or maybe Thief 1 is the one which is too bright. Not sure.\nAlso, yea, enable fogging in options, it's art-improving graphic option, not \"hide things if far away\".\n\nThen again, you probably should use one of a community patches. Not sure how much do they change, I was there for Vanilla experience, but people love those, so.\n\nPlot once again follows our cynical thief by the name of Garrett in the mysterious City. In the first game he had to destroy the Trickster, god of Pagans house of nature, who wished to destroy everything man-build. This heroic deed shifted the balance of powers toward the path of progress, to a dawn of the twisted Metal Age. Pure fantasy elements and monsters are almost not seen, The City is being cleaned by the City Watch and a new Mechanists sect emerges out of Hammerite house to lead the age.\n\nAnd yea, the story continues, as everything here shifts to steampunk and Victorian setting. And Thief is focusing more on just being a thief, rather than adventurer. No more adventure, you now have big houses and mansion to rob and even your maps are always accurate and provide good description to let you. It even feels less linear due to this, albeit actual levels are less dragged due to less maze-like qualities and less of fetching and puzzles. But hey, this is what people expect Thief to be.\n\nAnd it futher embraces the fact that it's more focused on stealth. You got new tools of trade, like Invinsibility potions, slow-fall one. There is a scouting orb that you can throw anytime and see from it's point of view, which I always forget to use even though AI never notices this so there is no good reason not to. Remember kids - don't be like me, that's not smart choice.\nYou can now lean into door to eaversdrop. Guards pretty much always mumble something to themselves, futher giving you audio hints. Some rare guards even wear special helmets that you can't blackjack them. Althrough they are so rare that I don't remember any such encounter. There are even occasional patrol that have more than one person.\n\nAnd it's a Metal Age that we are talking about, with Mechanists bringing new toys to watch out. There are surveliance camera, security systems and robots, which can be divided into huge dangerous robot that can't hear and small robot that can only warn others, but only after first hearing you, activating their vision and seeing you. All mixed with humans, giving more stealth-focused variety instead of monsters. All while you are cracking the bank level with it's ceramic tiles and three floors of complexity.\n\nAlbeit, it does mean that it lost some of the charm. There isn't much of wonderful immersive mystery that made me fall in love for Thief. That, and I am not fan of this theme, it's just feels too Victorian. It mostly has to do that it actually lost some gameplay variety. There is only so much mansion that you can crack at before it gets a bit old. Which isn't to say that there is no rare mission which goes out of this style. And it also varies the stealth objective that you have, even having this single awesome police station mission where you actually supposed to ghost due to knockouts limit. And it has this awesome mission where you travel on rooftops of a city.\n\nBut I still can't help but to feel monotomy setting after the half of a game. After all, it still ends up too much with you blackjacking everybody you come across. Or maybe it's because of the plot. It starts nicely, with some conspiracy going on, but soon it's all same grey Mechanics, Mechanics, Mechanics, who lack some charm. Even though their leader is kinda awesome and robot carry it along, but the environment gets you after a while.\nThat, and I am still dissapoint that the plot didn't explore relationship between Hammerites and Mechanics. At least I never seen any actual conflict. Kinda hoped to see the clash of ideals ever since I overheard one of the very rare Hammerites complained in the second level. But oh well.\n\nThat, and in the last one third of a game it simply farts out. I don't know, it feels like the quality and excitement suddenly drops. Then again, Looking Glass studios was in deep financial trouble and was rushing out, I bet this is the impact to it. The Kidnap level is both boring looking and boring to play, in a cave with more mechanists, where you run all over the place to find the needed NPC. Not to mentioning that I had sudden framedrop because of some trouble with AI pathfinding, until I found the guard who was hogging game up.\n\nThen you have two levels in a row that take place in same mansion, in both cased you enter it and exit in. The thing is that the first level of it feels like an earlier development version of the level, while the second time around it doesn't differenate enough to hold interest. Like plot-wise you sneak in to find a secret stairway toward the third floor so you knew where it is to snack masks on next day. After that you are supposed to leave yet you can venture futher into the third floor where you find many glitchy things, with flying decorations, misaligned models and you can even steal the already-present masks, but no one will care. As if you aren't supposed to be there.\n\nFinal level isn't bad though, at least on second try when I learned how to exploit big robots into blowing up themselves. And when I knew to take it slowly. Kinda like a little nightmare of steel, albeit I can see how some may decide that it goes too long, as well as being a challenge course. It's actually is quite awesome. But then the ending feels dissapointnig. It leaves you with no satisfication of victory and doesn't hype you up for next title. Just ends immeditly, with no music. Unlike the perfect Thief 1 ending.\n\nBut hey, I don't think that the main point of the games lies in ending. I would say that the Thief 2 is more than worth beating, even if it leaves you a bit sour. It's a Thief game, the one with complex levels, no hand-holding and more focus on stealth. And even though stealth core gameplay is still a bit on simple side, knocking everybody out, despite having excellent audio design that futhers gameplay, it's still a greatly enjoyable game.", "timestamp_created": 1457395209, "timestamp_updated": 1457395209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21666716": {"recommendationid": "21666716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098329435", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451251400}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Rent Paying Simulator\n________________________\nThough a great game which I would use the steam version to play if not for the fact I have the original disc, but I doubt there are any problems with this version :D", "timestamp_created": 1457276390, "timestamp_updated": 1457276454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21665406": {"recommendationid": "21665406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107827317", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457271841}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430! \u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e - must have!", "timestamp_created": 1457271907, "timestamp_updated": 1457271907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21655399": {"recommendationid": "21655399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030795222", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421944846}, "language": "english", "review": "Good stealth game.

When all the cylinders in your brain are firing off at perfect formation you will honestly feel like no one can stop you from \"borrowing\" their precious goods. The game is a direct follow up to The Dark Project (Thief Gold) and continues pretty much right after the first game, give or take a month or two. One thing they really improved upon in this game is the level design. I didn't think they could make it any better but it's even more logical now rather than Maze-like. Thief Gold also had logical level design but some of the levels were more like Mazes than a real tangible place that you could believe existed. In this game it feels more grounded than the first and more tangible, you rob a Bank, Frame a City Watch guard, Tail an informant, Crash a party and rob the denizens of the City, and help a friend rescue his unrequited love. All of those things add up to an experience that permeates into something so immutably real that I almost forgot I was playing a damn game.\n\nAnother thing that really helps you get immersed is Garrett himself, he now talks and comments on things way more frequently and has more character depth overall. Which in turn makes him even more likeable than he already was. Without spoiling anything there is one part where you break into some ladies home and Garrett just calmly says \"Don't mind me ladies, just passing through\" it really makes you feel like he is more than just a cypher for the player. Another real huge improvement is the inclusion of proper secrets in every mission. Most missions can have up to 8 or more secrets for you to find and they can be as simple as a short-cut or something really nice like some loot for you to plunder.  \n\nCon's: Once again there is not very many faults with this game but if there is one thing I didn't like as much as the first game it is the villain. He has a voice that sounds like a mixture of Cartman and Meatwad. Hard to feel intimidated by someone like that when I have that image in my head. He isn't a terribly written character and I really dig his motives and behaviour I just think a better voice could have gone a long way to make him seem badass. Maybe another complaint I can say is the final 3 missions are kind of \"Meh\" overall and the ending as a whole isn't as awesome as the first game.  \n\nOverall Feelings & Score: I feel like this game is not only just a worthy sequel to the first game but it is also a damn fine game in its own right.

On doit toujours jouer avec l'oreille tendue pour \u00e9couter les d\u00e9placements des ennemis ou leurs dialogues souvent dr\u00f4les.

You could carefully sneak through the dark and bypass them, you could use an arrow to make a sound, drawing them away, or find a hidden passage in the wall to sneak behind them.  This is what makes the game so great, you have options you can use and not keep things so linear.\nThe difficulty also makes the game great.  There is no indicater of any kind to tell you there is a guard on the other side of the wall.  You have to use your ears to listen to footsteps, occasionally whistling, and eyes to see if that guard is carrying a key to unlock a door with.\nOne of the cons I can say about the game is the controls at times can be a little frustrating to deal with.  Sometimes you want to climb up a short wall, quietly, only to have Garrett not only miss grabbing the wall, he may make some noise too, alerting the guards.  I had a similar problem with ladders, with him not dismounting from the well.\nThe cut scenes are kept short and in between each mission.  Most of the story is told from reading parchments, books, and listening to game characters talk amongst themselves.\n\nIf you're looking for a stealth game that IS superior to most other stealth games, like Metal Gear, I would highly recommend this game ot", "timestamp_created": 1452820752, "timestamp_updated": 1452820752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20524053": {"recommendationid": "20524053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238935460", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448852435}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f, \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043d\u043e. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430 10 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432.", "timestamp_created": 1452787602, "timestamp_updated": 1452787602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20518133": {"recommendationid": "20518133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067906668", "num_games_owned": 851, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506201782}, "language": "english", "review": "Of the Thief games this is my favorite.

It's set in a city, aptly named The City, with a steampunk aesthetic. You play as Garrett, a thief with a wide assortment of tools, weapons, and gadgets to assist him. [/b]\n\nThe minute you get in the first thing you'll probably do is change the controls. The default controls in this game are set up fairly differently than the average first-person game, but you'll have little-to-no trouble after setting them up. The graphics are pretty dated, even as far as 2000 is concerned.\n\nThe stealth mechanics of Thief are much more interesting than the average stealth system, based more around light and sound as opposed to the cone of vision that other stealth games tend to employ. Garrett decides to wear his clogs on every mission, so stepping on stone makes you much more obvious than stepping on something like a rug, while stepping on tile is a death sentence. The light gem at the bottom of the screen lights up to tell you if you're being lit up by the light around you, or is dark to show that you're completely in the shadows. Very rarely do games use lighting and sound as effectively as Thief does here.\n\nThe missions in the second Thief, as opposed to the original Thief, focus more around simple thievery instead of supernatural missions involving zombies and cultists. This is pretty subjective as to whether or not it's a pro or con, but I prefer the thievery. The original Thief is more of the same, but with more of the aforementioned zombies and cultists.\n\n[list]\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[*]Lighting and sound are both fantastic, easily some of the best, even today.\n[*]Interesting stealth system, only game to use anything comparable is Mark of the Ninja.\n[*]The atmosphere is so thick it could give you lung cancer.\n[*]More focus on thievery\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[*]Graphics are pretty bad, even going back to 2000.\n[*]Less than friendly to newer players, but not impossible to get into\n[*]Less focus on supernatural elements [/list]\n\n[u][b]Final Thoughts[/b]:[/u]\nIt's easily one of the best stealth games to date. The original is preferable if you want more of the zombies and similar stuff, and Deadly Shadows is a little more forgiving. Overall, I'd reccomend it to anyone looking for an extremely fun and unique stealth system that's rarely contested, even to this day.\n\n[b]Rating:[/b] 9.5/10\n\n[quote]This review was written for and is published on the [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/24515397] Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

Truly though, this game is what helped me discover my love for games and the stealth genre. Despite old school graphics, the game holds up extremely well.

But I can safely say that these games honestly do still hold up today.\n\nPros:\n- Light/Dark system is a great mechanic and leads to the player paying more attention to their environment.\n- Static map, some areas are missing and without an all encompassing minimap you are forced to be more cautious, unsure of what lies around each corner and this adds to the game's  tense atmosphere. \n- Your footsteps become louder when walking on harder floors such as marble, adds depth and makes you more observant of your surroundings.\n- No zombies or supernatural elements (preference).\n- Excellent level design, navigating is not a problem despite not having a full map or quest markers. This is because the levels are designed logically (as though they were not designed just for a game but to serve the purpose of the building e.g a mansion)  and loot is distibuted accordingly, e.g you can safely assume that there will be little to no loot in the servants quarters, but there will more than certainly be something valuable in the nobles quarters.\n- Tells the story through level design and gameplay instead of directly through a cutscene or text.\n- You can't choose to go in all guns blazing, you die quickly (2 sword hits) and thus feel more vunerable and this creates tension. You aren't invincible, their is no second option to just fight your way in. Only through the patience and intelligence of the player can Garrett succeed, as you play you become a better thief- not through \"levelling up\"- you are never given any notification of your progress by the game (this is a good thing), Garrett stays his same vunerable self throughout the whole game, but you the player learn how to handle yourself: which areas are low/high risk, when to blackjack guards, where to hide etc ... This is extremely rewarding as by the end of the game you (the player) have gone from an amateur burglar to a masterthief, this progression of the player instead of the character is extremely rewarding and makes you feel like you are truly getting more skillful- this progression is expressed not through a number or a level and Garrett doesn't become more powerful as you play, your growth is shown in the way you play the game.\n- Amazing soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n- May be too dark and hard too see for some.\n- Not the greatest voice acting.\n- Graphics whilst not awful do not compare with those of newer titles.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to experience this masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1451517231, "timestamp_updated": 1466072103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20082659": {"recommendationid": "20082659", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989810264", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481144363}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is legendary, and for a good reason.

If each of them gets 10 points (so a total of 40) and you break it up here's the ranking:\n\nTheif II: The Metal Age 50/10\nThief: The Dark Project (Gold) 10/10\nThief: Deadly Shadows 5/10\nThief -25/10\n\nBut that includes 3 stories for another time.\n\nI do have to mention Dark Project/Gold briefly since Thief II would not exist without it.  It really is a fine game in its own right, the best Stealth Game up to that point.  However, it still relies too much on combat (and those damnable undead). The story, however, is worth it.  Which leads to Thief II -- apparently Looking Glass Studios realized that the combat was the least favorite aspect of the game and made it so you can avoid it entirely in Thief II (if you choose).  You may get seen and want to fight your way out (or have to I suppose) and you are not entirely without resources.  However, you CAN get through it without ever swinging your blade.  That, in conjunction with the story, propelled Theif II to the top of the stealth charts for me.\n\nDo not look for visuals that have withstood the test of time.  They are dated, but they are sufficient if you aren't a snob, and the aesthetic works perfectly.  Do not look for this if you want to run and gun through levels putting arrows into the eye sockets of every guard you see while simultaneously slicing and dicing others who happen to get to close.\n\nDO look for an amazing stealth game with a solid story that builds from at first trying to scratch out a living to getting embroiled in events beyond your control.  DO look for secret rooms, safes, stashed of loot.  DO be patient and learn the guard's patterns.  But mostly -- DO PICK UP Thief II: The Metal Age (especially during this stealth game sale!).\n\nOne last thing -- DO NOT pick up Thief (the reboot) as it has in common with the true Thief games only the title and the name of the protagonist.

Though  it doesn't have the same 'horror' element that the first game had, it's still very atmospheric with an incredible ambience that will suck you in to its dark, treacherous world and it won't let go until Karras closes the doors to Soulforge, forever sealing his fate! (yeah, more on Soulforge later).\n\nAll of the original Thief gameplay mechanics are still in place w/ added features: the stealth is in full effect with deeply complex missions and large maps that allow for multiple routes to completing objectives, all the sexy arrow types you loved from the first game are back (now with vine arrows), all of your original gadgets are back (now with scouting orbs, and in rare cases explosive devices), there are new enemy types (most notably female soldiers) and of course a new antagonist (alas, Constantine is no more, but Karras is easily just as much of a douche as he was, so it's cool, and there's even a ghost pirate at one point if you can find him and his glorious pirate booty....um....let me rephrase that, I mean his treasure).  Oh, and I almost forgot one of the coolest upgrades, the cinematics between missions (some play out like storyboard drawings but others are actual cinematics and there's sorta one when you die too, but obviously that's not as cool as the others).\n\nNow back to the final mission, Sabotage at Soulforge, Karras' stronhold, his HQ, the locus of his nefarious activities, yeah you get the point.  Being a final mission you'd expect some level of challenge and complexity and Soulforge certainly doesn't disappoint. But seriously, this mission for me was so vast and complex that I spent nearly a quarter of my total game time wandering its darkened corridors with like negative 5 hitpoints at some points, all while trying to figure out where I should go next and how not to get killed by Karras' mechanoid creations. After finally beating this mission, I almost felt like I couldn't recall an earlier point in the game but Soulforge.  It was as though the entire game took place in this one hub-like area.  Mentally, I was nearly defeated by this final quest but I persevered in the end and so Karras can suck it!\n\nIf you like Thief you'll love this one just as much, if not more so.

With the Steam downloadable version, I was able to play it for the first time in about 10 years. I was so surprised that the graphics were pretty damn good. \n\nI love this game because it's a phenomenally made puzzle. Calculating the movements of many different guards and creating long-range stealth plans throughout these amazing and realistically dark levels. Some of the other reviewers may cry about how dark the game is, but they just are too dumb to play the game. It gives you all you need to get around the dark and you just need to figure it out: (SPOILER): you have a compass and you have a map that is very vague but gives you the layout of the rooms most of the time...you can use both the compass and the map during the times in which you cannot see to navigate rooms. \n\nThis game gets a 10/10 easily from me.

Personally, I liked the fantasy-looking themes of The Dark Project, compared to the industrial feeling of The Metal Age.\nMore space brings more to do, and while more challenges are welcome, the gameplay feels weak when the levels only allow one entrance to a particular location, and this will happen much more here than in its predecessor. As much as I hate hand-holding, I hate a lack of direction a tiny bit more. The Dark Project was good at giving the player direction through in-game literature and dialogue, and this sort of help is not as available here.\n\nI wouldn't have such a problem with confusing level design if I was given more freedom to explore, but enemies are quite plentiful in this entry, along with many types that are only susceptible to explosive weaponry, limiting possible approaches and damaging that appeal of the game. While human opponents are usually easily dealt with, the mechanical enemies frequently chew up inventory items, often resulting in death when there are just too many to either destory or avoid.\n\nThe inventory holds a larger variety of equipment, but due to the sheer volume it can be a pain to navigate when having to do so quickly. The usefulness of some items has changed. The game seems intent on giving me plenty of water arrows, even though most of the light sources are electric lamps, and there is very little blood to ever have to clean. Fire arrows are much more helpful, but now quite rare. Maps are a big improvement over the previous game. Rather than being given my general location, I am now told which room I am in, which is helpful in areas where the rooms look the same.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it, but due to its difficult-to-manage size, I felt like it lacked some of the cohesion present in The Dark Project.", "timestamp_created": 1431572394, "timestamp_updated": 1431572394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15743352": {"recommendationid": "15743352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023237811", "num_games_owned": 1148, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431158504}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u043a\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430!!!", "timestamp_created": 1431108459, "timestamp_updated": 1431108459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15714218": {"recommendationid": "15714218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054026665", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391351848}, "language": "english", "review": "Best stealth game to have ever been created.

Stealing everything, hiding bodies in dark corners of the house, and a cynical gaming motive just made the immersion into this game that much better at the time. When this game was on sale, I just couldn't help myself by trying it again in this current age. This game had great stealth mechanics and I believe it was revolutionary for its time. Now with updated graphical stealth games this old and dusty game has its pros and cons.\nThe Pros\n- Stealth game-play, with the higher difficulties not allowing to kill anyone. You play as a Thief not a Hitman\n- Open ended map. There are many ways to get your objective(s)\n- Secrets. The game has bonus secrets, either to benefit the mission or back-story on the game\n- For a completion-ist, hours of game-play\nThe Cons\n- The game's graphics is similar to Tomb Raider 1. \n- Player needs to be patient\n- The AI isn't the sharpest\n\nOverall the game is fun, 1st person, single player game. The game is old and dusty but can keep a player, like myself, lurking in the shadows pickpocketing a guard. Just remember that those water arrows are more helpful than ordinary arrows.

These include Noismaker arrows, moss arrows, water arrows, fire arrows (Which explode and defy the laws of physics), rope arrows, broadhead arrows, and many more other weapons or tools that are fun to experiment with. The last thing I will mention, for the sake of not making this a very lengthy review is that each level is really up to you on how to finish it.

Also, after you've finished the main game, be sure to play the unofficial expansion, Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age, as well as over 600 different fan missions to further immerse yourself in this incredible world, made by a still dedicated community (check ttlg forums or the thief wiki for them).

Anywhere I didn't see games devoted to theft with such bright plot where are bound paganism, a brotherhood award, the greedy nobility yet, to indulge and simple street guys who left the main hero of game - Garret. The most important quality in game, however I think and for other representatives of troublemakers too. As fine it is realized here: it is necessary to move slowly, on silent surfaces, for example a grass, boards or carpets, thus to look for places with a dense shadow and if it isn't present that to nestle on walls, or to squat round the corner.\n\nThe GUARDS are CLUMSY: The guard can't call the worthy opponent of the thief. These idlers are too careless, clumsy and silly. Even if they will hear you, first can think that it mice, either a fireplace, or a copper peep. In the dark they are blind at all so it is possible to make surely roundabout maneuvers for a back of the victim. In a situation when the policeman will notice you, he of course won't run to give the alarm, and will go to act heroically to punish the thief, in this case we will be able always to give it the worthy answer, behind Garret's shoulders always a huge arsenal from arrows (simple, water, with a rope, gas, fiery), a sword, a bludgeon, potions of life, water breath, a bomb and of course a compass.\n\nI absolutely accurately see an appeal of developers from Looking Glass Studios to decrease in violence in game and in life. Game encourages theft, not a robbery and murders. At the difficult levels of game, murder are forbidden at all and game overo'm are punished. Mirnyi, innocent inhabitants and servants, it is so easy to calm with one blow bludgeons, as well as guards. With the zombie conversation short, is evil spirits and the evil, and it is necessary to fight against it!\nWe will sum up the results: Theft it not such the big evil as within game and life, it was and will be always, only in that as it to call a question, and under what look a tax. A banal example it is possible to give the taxation. Let the state steal from us in a type of tax and we will steal gold candlesticks from rich lords of the game Thief.\n\nAll series of games is excellent is: Thief, Thief 2, Thief: Deadly Shadows.

I have never played any of the games of Thief, though I have always wanted to. I just finished the first game and wrote a review for it, and now have finished the second. The very first Thief disappointed me very much, but that was all due to the level design, which ruined the whole experience for me. However, I was still greatly interested in the world's atmosphere and story, so I was hopeful with this game and came in with a neutral outlook.\n\nThief II greatly increased my expectations through the first two-thirds of the game, but quickly disappointed me again with the last 5 missions and the ending. Firstly, just to brush through everything else, as I don't need to say much more here than I did with the first Thief:\n\n+ The story and the atmosphere given by it is just as engaging.\n+ The graphics were better than the first game's, and the world mostly looked like it was put together better in each level. The cinematics were pretty much the same in style, however.\n+ Garrett is still just as likable of a character!\n+ The sound effects are mostly similar, and the voice acting is still well done, except for Karras, which I will go into more detail later.\n+ The gameplay mechanics are mostly the same as well, not too much new, though I enjoyed things like the robotic cameras you can throw.\n\nIn the end, most of the above is rather the same, though slightly improved in one way or another. Nothing too drastically new in those areas... but the level design, now that was so much better! Based on the first two-thirds of the game, I have to say that the levels were (mostly) great, so much better than 90% of the levels in the first game.\n\nThe first level was an interesting start, especially neat for clearing a path for an NPC. The second, however, was pretty bad and generic again, scaring me that the game would be the same. The storage area was nothing special, and the design of having to repeatedly go to the office, punch in a code, and go back out so many times was just bad.\n\nBut afterwards, the game picked back up very well. I liked every mission up to and including Life of the Party, though the Eavesdropping/Bank missions were nothing too special. Ambush was actually a very good mission for me. I enjoyed running throughout the city, trying to weave my own path back to my place, creeping around. Life of the Party was my other favorite mission, sneaking around on the rooftops being my favorite part. Before that, Trail of Blood was interesting as well, mostly in the environment and the ghosts you kept encountering.\n\nNone of those levels were really that confusing as in the first game either. They were no longer wide open, empty areas. Instead, you could get a better grasp on where you were for the most part, and I could always keep track of what I was doing, never getting bored.\n\nThen came the last third of the game, back to terrible. From the first Cavador mission forward, I didn't enjoy the environments anymore, nor did the levels keep me entertained. Even worse, the Casing the Joint mission was a generic build for the most part. I mean, I was interested with the secret paths throughout the place at first, but to be honest, they wore out pretty quickly, as the mission was such a pain of trial-and-error, more so than any other mission. Then the immediately next mission throws you back into the same exact mansion with basically no difference! What a pain, and what a terrible design decision.\n\nAnd for the finale, Soulforge wasn't linear like in the original game, but it wasn't interesting either. The first room you start in looked cool, then everything else was just generic looking and full of robots. I understand that it fits the story (the Metal Age!) but it didn't make me want to keep going. And that ending cinematic, wow! The ending of the first game wasn't the greatest, but still much better than this one. It seems that Looking Glass really didn't know how to end games, between System Shock 2 and these two Thief games.\n\nAs a side note, mentioned above, Karras had the worst voice of the game. So terrible. He sounded like he just had this nasal jelly mass stuck in his throat. There is some weird, annoying cartoon character that it reminded me of, but I can't remember for the life of me, at the moment. I know that Stephen Russell did the voice and he also does many others, included Garrett's! But Karras is so different, and literally I had to mute my sound any time his voice was prominent throughout the game. I can't really say there have been many voices that have caused me to do that, and it was only slightly worse that all of the robots spout his voice too.\n\nIn the end, I was really impressed with about half of the game, neutral for a little piece, and then very disappointed with the last third. Do I recommend that people play the game? Sure. I enjoyed it for a good while, much more than I did the first game. I will never play the first game again, whereas I might play some of the missions here again.\n\nNow, I am onto the third game, Deadly Shadows.

To summarize, you play as master thief Garret (voiced by the great Stephen Russel) who is trying to unravel The City's new religious order, The Mechanists (the replacement of the first game's Hammerites, who believed in the Creator and that industrial construction was the way to keep evil influences, such as the Trickster (a Pan-esque God who worships chaos and nature) at bay. If you don't understand you should check out the first game, it's great!) and their leader, Father Karras, the likes of which are inventing new mechanical innovations in security and industry (robot guards, cameras,etc). \n\nThe core stealth gameplay is still here from Thief 1, with the ability to deal with guards either lethally or nonlethally (avoiding or blackjacking them) and either playstyles are sufficiently suitable for every mission. This is primarily because the level design in Thief 2 (like its predecessor) contains many hidden paths and secrets to find and explore to deal with mission objectives and secure the most amount of loot possible. Also with new items such as invisibility potions and old ones such as noisemaker arrows (used to distract guards and clear paths), as previously stated, both playstyles are equally supported in the game. \n\nThe stealth mechanics are still as great as the first game, with the \"light gem\" still in effect( flashing white if you are visible; dark if you are not), the ability to lean around corners to see guards/ cameras/etc. and the aforementioned items to facilitate being stealthy. One improvement I loved from Thief 2 is the change of setting for the missions, from looting ancient crypts and supernatural dimensions( still awesome but not very thief-like) to looting actual mansions and houses (especially the amount of loot in every level, with multiple areas to scour and explore). And whilst these houses and mansions may not look too good, i feel the art style has a certain charm to it.  \n\nAnother reason why i enjoy this game? Its story and atmosphere, Garret's tale and The City's backstory is thoroughly established in the pre mission cutscenes and books and texts found throughout levels. And the game's soundtrack is simply amazing, with chilling sweeping synths and general dark tones, the game's soundtrack gives the player a sense of always being watched, of potentially being hunted down, which gives the game's world such a distinctive feeling of ambience and general eerieness.

This is the triumph of technology, so a good part of the game is spent with human AI's if you enjoyed that. About half of the game is spent \"rubbing shoulders\" with the rich, going to various mansions of flexible level design, especially by the end when Looking Glass was close to bankruptcy.\n\n It's just that same, immersive game as always. I did find it to be a little disappointing to see fewer horror sequences, but it's all the same great. The story picks up right after Thief 1. Without saying too much I think everyone owes it to themselves to try the game for themselves, simply because this is as much of a breakthrough in the stealth genre as Half Life for shooters.\n\nYou can find the free demo of the game here: http://www.thief-thecircle.com/media/demos/", "timestamp_created": 1415132714, "timestamp_updated": 1415132714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12761205": {"recommendationid": "12761205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060137258", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502140825}, "language": "english", "review": "Its simply the best stealth-game in history. 10/10\n+Great mechanics\n+not so easy\n+best thief u can get\n+Cheap\n+mods\n+Speed Runner friendly.\n\n-Graphics are insanly ''old''\n\nOnly bad thing, it feels alot older today than it actually is, cause of mechanics and ofc the graphics.\nMod support is crazy good and will help you to make it look way better and play better.\n\nThere are also insane amounts of rly good fan missions out there and a ok working co-op patch, wich can be fun while beeing buggy sometimes.

Bar none.  No game before or since can compare to the immersiveness of this game and it's fine-tuned mechanics.  It manages to mix the fantasy, strategy and adventure aspects of the first with a more prescient storyline than the first Thief game.  The first game was an excellent stealth game that occasionally drifted too far into Tomb Raider territory with it's platformy style missions, devious traps and creature threats.  The fact that Eidos was the publisher of both Thief and Tomb Raider, and that one of the missions had you raiding an underground tomb frought with booby traps and monsters, ought to tell you something.  Thief 2 , thankfully, focuses on the strengths of the stealth system and makes that the core of the game and not just an aspect of it.  That's not to say you won't be jumping across ravines and encountering creatures, but the heist-pulling, pick-pocketing and blackjacking really comes into thier own in Thief 2.  I've read that the developers created the missions of the first game to suit the plot, while the missions of the second were produced first with the plot retrofitted.  In any case, the levels are larger and more complex than the first.\n\nThe graphics had gotten a slight bump from the first game with higher poly models, better texturing and weather effects.  They even added dithering to the hardware renderer, which was a nice addition.  It did have the effect of dampening the deep shadows that were such a part of the first game, but it generally made the game more pleasing to the eye. \n\nThe sound design is, again, excellent.  Sound propagation is one of the core facets of gameplay.  Listening to footsteps draw near or fade into the distance allow you to judge from your hiding place in the shadows whether or not you can risk stepping into lit areas.  Leaning against doors to listen to conversations or the presence of sounds in the next room allow you to determine if opening a door is wise or not.  Sound is fundamental to this game.  You will not be able to play this game successfully while blasting Megadeth or Slayer.  Just not happening.  And that's one of the things that makes this game so damn immersive.  You are literally concerned with the environment both visually and aurally at all times.  It sucks you in.  \n\nThere are some new gadgets in this game.  Garrett lost an eye in the first game, and that has been replaced by a mechanical eye that can zoom in and out like a telescope.  A new object called the Scouting Orb allows you to take a peak over walls or around corners without exposing yourself.  There are also new potions and a new arrow:  the vine arrow.  Similar to the rope arrow, but it can \"stick\" to things rope arrows can't, like metal gratings.\n\nThe design went from a predominantly dark age style steampunk in Thief 1 to a predominantly Victorian era style steampunk in Thief 2, in much of it's architecture.  Actually, art deco also makes an appearance as part of the design of buildings operated by a faction that's new to Thief 2, the Mechanists.   The European old world oozes in these games.  In fact, many of the textures from Thief 1 and Thief 2 were from photos of architecture taken by the developers while vacationing in Europe.   The overall design is pretty immaculate.  \n\nThe first two Thief games share a cult status, along with System Shock2 (uses the same game engine and made by some of the same people), as games of remarkable vision and quality.  They are all lauded as excellent games by the gaming press and continue to make the top # lists.  The gameplay transcends gaming.  To play this game is to embark on an existential and  metaphysical experience.  This game seems to attract a higher-brow gaming audience.

I just deided to play Thief 2 again after buying it on Steam. WOW is it different than \"THIEF\" (the newest one, not part of the original trilogy). It's in a league of its own. Strategy, timing, and pure stealth are key in the Thief trilogy. The graphics are very much outdated, but it is still a ridiculously immersive game, partly because the creators put a LOT of time into sounds. This was also true in the first one, Thief: The Dark Project. When you're getting your bearings and trying to find a safe time to move (which is a constant throughout the game), listening is key. If you have a busy or otherwise noisy household, you're gonna have a hard time playing this game. It is absolutely reliant upon being able to listen closely to the movements of nearby NPCs, and sometimes the spoken hints as you're listening to their conversations.\n\nTo make Thief 2 even better, it not only has zombies sometimes like Thief 1, but it also has \"metal beasts\" -- creations of the Mechanists (a splinter of the Hammerite cult), which are creepy in their own way, but also very hard to kill if you find yourself in that position.\n\nI miss games back in the day. In the bank level, the first time I played it, it took me just over 4 hours to beat. That's just one of many levels. What made so many older games awesome was that some games had absolutely gargantuan levels, and in the Thief trilogy they had a dozen ways of being completed, increasing replayability, whereas games today tend to be so linear, with the exception of a rare few.\n\nEnjoy it!", "timestamp_created": 1410052555, "timestamp_updated": 1413101446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539108", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11990213": {"recommendationid": "11990213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146573564", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476489512}, "language": "english", "review": "Thief 2 is a game an old game thats amazing, numerous ways of achieving objectives, great stealth mechanics, lots of secrets , the game trusts that your not a moron can be a bad thing especialy for me i have got lost inumerous times.

This is without loading screens, and there are millions of hidden nooks and crannies where you can find various goodies to steal. Another level has you travel through a ruined Aztec city, and another a jungle filled with treehouses.

The characters are interesting, looting everything that isn't nailed down and working to get every last scrap of loot and secret adds some nice replayability, the stealth relies on both line of sight, shadows, and sound, and you will probably want to punch the main villain in the face by the end of the game, along with his love of marbel and metal flooring.

I wish I had the same experience as the other players who write, \"this was one of the best games I've ever played\", but I didn't and I can't fake that I did. It had some shining moments, but were vastly overshadowed (literally) by certain other gameplay characteristics. \n\nI feel like I could gripe forever about it but I'll keep it short (I'll try). I did play Thief Gold and enjoyed it a lot. While there were some things I wasn't a fan of, I was able to get over them and still really enjoy the game. Hoping for the same experience in Thief II, I was let down. My biggest gripe of the game, which sounds silly until you play it, is the game is SO. MOTHER. EFFING. DARK. This alone, ruined the game for me. There are 3 or 4 missions I know off the top of my head that I played for 4-5 hours EACH and still couldn't complete the level, only to consult a guide, and only to find out there is a door or ladder or key or something that would advance me in the level. And what held me back from finding it was that it was hidden in the darkest, most pitch black area of a random room. I can't harp on it enough, no matter how much I adjusted the gamma option, or my brightness on my monitor, it never improved. Again sounds silly, but I was physically incapable of finding these things because of it being so dark. The first game was dark too, but not to the extent to where you actually can't see what's ahead of you. There are flares added to the game, but they really don't offer much help. It brightens things up about 1 foot around you, and then disappears after 10 seconds or so.\n\nThere are other things that bother me about this game, but that is the main one. I almost feel like that if that one thing didn't affect me so much, I'd be able to look past the other things like I did in the first game. I was so determined to beat this game and just completely remove it from my computer. To be stuck in a level for 4-5 hours only to find out that you need to walk through a door in a room you've been in several times already, is something I never want in a game again.

In comparison to the prequel it's only a slight improvement, but I think they could've made it a little bit better than they actually did. Like the prequel they managed to create an awesome atmosphere with the \"poor\" graphics and effects. One reason I just gave 6/10 is that most of the game looks 1:1 exactly the same like\nThief Gold.\n\nSound:     6/10\n\nThe sounds are quite good and the voice actors are doing a great job. Some sounds are really annoying (robots for example). Like in Thief Gold there is nearly no music. I know it's not necessary, but I still miss it.\n\nLevel design:     7/10\n\nThe level design is just as good as in the prequel. You can search for secrets and have more than one way to reach your goal. The atmosphere is fitting and the levels are well structured.\nExcept for one level, namely the last one. The last level is so frustrating. If you want to sneak the whole way through then you get detected the slow way. If you want to rush through you get detected fast. That is the only difference and the reason why I skipped the last level. And this last level degrades the Level design by 2 points: 9/10 => 7/10.\n\nGameplay/Handling/Equipment:     8/10\n\nThe good points: Like in the prequel you have a really nice arsenal for a thief. Plenty of arrowtypes, the flashbomb for your escape and so on. You still must get used to the controls but when you know how to play it you will like it. The playstyle remains pretty much like it was in the prequel. You sneak around, steal stuff, knock out enemies, etc..\nThe bad point: No improvements at all.\n\nEnemies/AI:     6/10\n\nWell the guards search for you if you are too loud and act really authentic. But robots act totally random and I don't get the point why they made them so annoying. Sure it's no problem to disable them but still I don't like the idea of them. They didn't improve the AI from Thief Gold to Thief 2 so I just give 6/10.\n\nStory:     4/10\n\nMaybe it's just me but I don't like the story. It's boring and I miss the \"magical\" part of it. The target is a guy who wants to kill people with poison and created robots to protect himself. I don't even know how to make it sound better.\n\nCritic summary:     6,2/10\n\nPersonal fun rating:     7/10     [good game]\n\nAll in all a good game, but the developers didn't make real improvements. I recommend the game if you played Thief Gold, otherwise I don't.

Not to say that it's bad, the story and dialogue is actually one of the strong points. The weak points were in the controls and I suppose some of the stealth mechanics. Jumping was far more difficult than it should have been, as well as climbing. I'll give stealth mechanics a bit of slack though since even top developers today still can't get it right. It does make for some hilarious bugs at times though!\n\nNote: I never played any of the Thief series as a kid. I recall getting one of them with a video card I bought way back when though I had no interest in the game at the time. So I suppose you could say this review isn't biased by nostalgia.

There are many new toys for Garrett to play with in these huge mission areas and also some of the encounters are hilarious. The story was amazing; I will not dive in but it has great morals and a few familiar faces will be present.

Be smart, be observant, be quiet and become a master thief.\n\nThe game of course suffers of its old age.

Many people, including myself, have a hard time taking the patience to learn the controls, how to sneak, how to use given tools to help you stay undetected, and essentially spending a chunk of your play time just sitting in a shadowy corner. I can understand how a slow pace like that can seem unattractive. Still, give it a try. You will be amazed at how much fun it can be to observe a bunch of guards, overhearing conversations, just waiting for the perfect moment to make a run past them and into the next dark corner. This, combined with a highly immersive story and a never before seen setting makes Thief 2 an experience of its own.\n\nSure the graphics are not up to date at all, but if you can overlook that, a fantastic experience awaits you.

Thief II: The Metal Age (the sequel to the critically-praised Thief: The Dark Project) brings players back into the world of master thief Garrett, this time with a bunch of new missions and antagonist in the form of Karras, the leader of the Mechanists.\n\nThe one thing I loved most about this game was that the scale just felt bigger in (almost every way). While I still have an issue with the fact that roughly half the levels are strictly linear, the missions that open up to you (like \"Stonemarket First Bank\", \"Life of the Party\" and \"Masks\") offer a wide array of alternate routes and secret passages to accomplish your goals, as well as give a far grander sense of the City and the threat Karras poses to its inhabitants.\n\nLikewise, the variety of weapons and items you can acquire is great and allows for lots of experimentation, although (since I'm a purist) I still stuck to water arrows for the majority of the game.\n\nAdmittedly, I found much more joy in the levels where I could pick off guards at will with hit-and-run tactics. I think it's fair to say that the AI in this game alternates between hypersensitive and woefully inept. When the guards aren't aggro-ing on you from far distances, they're complete morons in combat. It is exceptionally easy to take advantage of the combat system. When a sword-wielding guard runs at you, walk backwards and swing like mad, or circle-strafe and hit his back. Bow-wielders are an automatic win - just mash the attack button if you get one cornered. The only real challenge came from the Mechanist robots and groups of enemies, which sometimes stacked up in doors and got stuck or ran around the mansion in the \"Masks\" mission chasing me (all that was missing was the Benny Hill music).\n\nLikewise, the voice acting is either really good (in the case of Garrett's voice actor and some of the minor antagonists) or near-laughable (the nobles, who sound like they're reading from a script). I couldn't take Karras seriously as a villain because of his nasally voice, which made me laugh more than get freaked out whenever I heard his voice.\n\nI vaguely remembered a lot of buzz and praise for \"Life of the Party\", which sees Garrett take to the rooftops to rob every building in sight and infiltrate Karras' tower, Angelwatch - and that mission did not disappoint. Easily the best in the game, it had everything I consider to be so great about the genre - lots of expansive areas and alternate routes to take, lots of secrets and hidden goodies to find, great level design, the works. I wish more of the missions had those kinds of additional areas or features to make them worth replaying, because I didn't feel much compulsion to go back and do much besides replay the missions that were either \"loot everything\" or \"steal and/or kill everything\".\n\nAll in all, though, Thief II is still a standout in the stealth genre.

There are 15 glorious levels--each of which can take anywhere between 30 minutes to three hours depending on your level of Kleptomania. Even in 2014, I am still amazed at how goddamn huge the levels are, and the sheer amount stuff hidden in every nook and cranny. Sure, on a graphical level the game hasn't aged well at all, but from a gameplay standpoint, this game was (and still is) WAY ahead of it's time. Dishonored pointed its pinky in the right direction, but still wasn't able to capture the sheer size and replayability of this game. There are levels within levels within levels. It blows my mind. \n\nAnyway, I'm surprised you made it this far in my review and haven't purchased this game yet.

I cannot sit still in one place for very long if there isn't something going on to entertain me, and I get really antsy waiting for even a short amount of time. I'm also very bad at sneaking around. I would often try and sneak up on family members just for fun to startle them, but they'd always notice me, and often they'd beat me to the punch. With that said, Thief II is my favorite game of all time. Yes. A game as slow-paced and patience-testing as this one, which relies on you being very good at stealthing around to pass the levels even on normal difficulty, is my favorite game of all time, and also the only one I began again immediately after finishing for the first time. That should say everything you need to know about how perfectly designed this game is. I could talk about the absolutely gargantuan levels that reward exploration, or the deep gameplay with a huge variety of tools and ways of approaching any situation, or the amazing story, featuring excellent, writing, voice acting, and one of gaming's best protagonists and most underrated antagonists, but really, what else do you need to know? Thief II had the misfortune of coming out the same year as Deus Ex, and was thereby overshadowed (no pun intended). While it still sold well in it's day, it's fallen under a lot of people's radars over the years. Fix that. Get this game. Be it Steam, GOG, or physical CD, there is no excuse for any gamer not to have this in their collection. Go. NOW.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention this game also has fantasic sound design.

This gameplay time is currently subject to change whenever I can get the time to beat this game again.[/spoiler]\n\nThief 2 is a good sequel to a stealth masterpiece. The map design is much more focused and much more clearly defined than in Thief Gold, which makes for some mildly streamlined but much more sensible map design than in the first; This also introduces entirely new gameplay mechanics (Literally) such as security cam operated sentry guns and robots which lore wise are explained rather well. \n\nDevelopers of the world, this is how you do difficulty modes right.\n\nEach difficulty can add new objectives and higher difficulties make the sword a detriment to your inventory as you will often auto-fail a mission for killing someone; You must instead use a blackjack that only works when an enemy is unaware of your presence, which admittedly is sort of broken when you learn how to lean in and blackjack effectively from the shadows. Personally I think it adds to the game to be able to lean in and blackjack, it's a fun abuse of gameplay mechanics, like Bunnyhopping. \n\nThe sound design is masterfully crafted and unrivalled [spoiler](for the most part)[/spoiler] even today; you're going to want to get a good sound card and some plugins to emulate EAX to really get the proper effect of it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E0sXdX-Bc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ng_bGozSo\n\n[spoiler]Both Thief Steam releases come with an outdated version of ddfix which allows a few graphical enhancements such as modern resolutions and bloom injection but since the version that comes with the steam release is outdated your game will likely crash immediately upon using a 16:9 resolution in cam.cfg. It's moderately difficult to find the latest version so I'm going to save you the trouble and directly link it. \n\nhttp://rapidlibrary.biz/source.php?file=ulzq8ez8qri89on&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjermi.dyndns.org%2F~jermi%2Fddfix%2Fddfix_1.5.12.zip&sec=893b4f3af5fae4c1\n\nJust drop this into your Thief directory where your .exe is and using notepad++ to modify that to whatever graphical improvements you desire, though personally I think bloom looks terrible in any game, let alone injected into one. So i'd just leave it alone and modify cam.cfg so that game_screen_size is 1920 1080 if you're using a 1080p monitor.

Looking Glass Studios closed shortly after the release of Thief II and the sequel wasn't produced until 2004. In that period of downtime, hundreds of new, fan-made, missions were created and distributed in online communities like the Circle of Stone and Shadow. Some were better than others. And just a few may have been better than the game itself. In fact, one of the fan missions was so good, the developer was hired by Eidos to work on Thief III. Moreover, some fan mission developers ended up joining forces to release their own, unofficial sequel named Thief2x. \n\nThe game itself had its own replay value, but the fans who made these missions and mods increased the value tenfold. \n\nThief II is a must play.

Thief II plays mostly the same as Thief Gold. Same graphics, same controls, same first-person view. What they did change, however, makes all the difference.\n\nThief Gold had a number of really fun missions featuring Garrett prowling around a house or opera hall or what-have-you, knocking out guards and discovering secret passages, and those were great. But it spent just as much time knee deep in zombies, apemen, giant bugs, bugmen, ghosts, confusing labyrinths, caves, and situations where you almost HAVE to fight your way out if you're not super-great at the game.\n\nFor Thief II, the devs looked at what players did and did not enjoy, and they made a game that is better in almost all respects. Save for a single Thief Gold-esque level with some apemen (which is rather forgiving compared to TG, and a fascinating level overall), there are only maybe a couple of any particular monster, and most of them are avoidable. The only new monster type I can recall gave me the biggest (and most enjoyable) fright of anything in either game. The majority of levels take place in sane man-made structures; homes, a bank, a surprisingly modern police station, and a few missions taking place across entire sections of The City. Thus the game now flows better, being less of a half-forced monster combat game, and more about sneaking around, bludgeoning unsuspecting jerks, and looting every last inch of each level.\n\nAs a result of the titular Metal Age, Thief II also now includes cameras, robots, turrets,  and a selection of new tools at your disposal, such as mines and flares - the latter of which you will absolutely need, as some parts of the game can be far too dark to move around in. It's possible this is an issue on my end, or it may just be part of the game. If it's the game itself, it is one of the very few problems introduced with this installment.\n\nAlso introduced, however, is a map. Though not always very helpful, it is often an invaluable tool, showing varied degrees of detail depending on the level and keeping track of where you've been and where you currently are.\n\nWhile the final level is complicated and confusing, most of the rest of the game is a blast. One particular element of note is the interesting play on the penultimate levels of Thief Gold. Where in TG, the three levels leading up to the final one were repeat visits to locations you had already been in previous levels, in T2 the fourth-to-last level is ALSO a repeat visit to a location you had already been in Thief Gold, now taken over by the Mechanists. The next-to-last mission is, in fact, the same location as the third-to-last mission, which somehow manages to stay fresh and fun through both levels.\n\nIn the end, I heavily recommend Thief II if you enjoy stealth games. If you played Thief Gold but only sometimes liked it, I ask that you give Thief II a try instead, as it has ironed out most of the kinks. The only other thing I would like to note is that, like TFix for TG, Thief II is at its best when Tafferpatcher (a fan-made patch which improves resolution, textures, compatibility, etc.) has been applied.\n\nNow get thieving, you dirty taffer.", "timestamp_created": 1373226239, "timestamp_updated": 1385407292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1894788": {"recommendationid": "1894788", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999413011", "num_games_owned": 906, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 21634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480105614}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest stealth games... nah, scratch that, THE GREATEST stealth game of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1373042343, "timestamp_updated": 1385408823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681449", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1712466": {"recommendationid": "1712466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996826746", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1365058800}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you like thief : the dark project (gold)? yes?\nThis one is (imo) even better so what are you waiting for", "timestamp_created": 1371921193, "timestamp_updated": 1371921193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "544232": {"recommendationid": "544232", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971920232", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475614251}, "language": "english", "review": "Thief 2 is one of the best games you can buy on Steam.\nVery atmospheric, it was way ahead of it's time.\nMake sure to get DarkLoader.

It would sadly be their last ever game as financial problems would see the studio close 2 months later.\n\nThief 2 is everything you could possibly ask for in a sequel; tighter and much larger level design, deeper exploration of the characters, a tighter and a more coherent atmosphere and an enthralling story of an unlikely alliance solving a twisting and evolving mystery that threatens to destroy The City and beyond.\n\nOnce again, Garrett is the unlikely hero of the tale. Stealing to survive and slinking through the shadows are a daily fact of life for him; Getting to the truth, whilst stopping to line his pockets along the way.\n\nYou'll be exploring nobleman's estates, police stations, banks, cathedrals and even The Thieves' Highway. All the while, the atmosphere and storytelling will keep you on your toes and keep your mind sharp. The environments in Thief 2 are much bigger and much more detailed than the first game and gone are the vast majority of undead, haunted crypts and tombs the first game contained. \n\nYou'll also have some new gear to play with in Thief 2; Slow-fall potions, expensive and rare invisibility potions, flash mines and 'The Eye', which I won't go into much detail about, as well as others.\n\nThief 2 is also more challenging than the first game. Higher difficulty levels will, in some cases, require you to leave very little or, in one case, zero trace of your presence behind in one or two levels. This will require you to think ahead even more about what to expect; a tense but rewarding experience.\n\nThis game the peak of the Thief series so far, the graphics are much improved over the first game and the story, whilst having a satisfying conclusion, left the door wide open for a Thief 3 that would never arrive from the studio that started it all.\n\nSo Adi\u00f3s Looking Glass. You created amazing experiences, stories and gameplay long before it was the norm in gaming as we know it today and even now, studios are still playing catchup to you.\n\nThe game is very mod friendly.

But somehow here's something you've never seen before.\n\nOn the gameplay side of things, Thief II is simply a lot more fair than most stealth games, which often seem deliberately designed to make you screw up, via twitchy paranoid guards, bottlenecking level design, or random arbitrary rule changes. Thief does none of that, and every time I get caught it genuinely feels like an error on my part and not because the AI randomly decided to spin around right as the blackjack was about to hit the back of their head. Hiding in shadows actually works, the levels are expansive enough that guard patrols take more than five seconds to loop back around, and there is very rarely only one way in.\n\nFans of stealth games and students of game design as an art form would both do well to give this game a look.", "timestamp_created": 1355377283, "timestamp_updated": 1511533839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4883811": {"recommendationid": "4883811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042848406", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477008514}, "language": "english", "review": "As excellent as Thief: The Dark Project is, Thief II improves on every (and I mean every) aspect of the original, making this sequel a near-perfect game in its own right.

Ai is better and doesn't always automatically know where you are. Sometimes the floor textures still make you automatically heard, but less often. The darkness works more like it should in this one and they don't automatically find you. The levels are better and aren't dumb supernatural like the first one. Same with the enemies. You don't sneak around zombies and devils which made no sense and somewhat ruined the last game. The developers did a good job in that regard listening to complaints. The levels are still basically the same. You get no help as where to go or what to do. From seeing walkthroughs I had to do things that are never explained and the game and I never would have thought to do. In one level you must find these random rubies laying on the ground and place them in these spaces to go through a portal to get further, only none of that was even mentioned. If I would have gotten to the place to put them without already having them I would have been screwed. You must find them hidden around a forest. It is poorly done. Also the levels are huge and have tons of ways to go and secrets but most of the space is meaningless and doesn't help the mission and seems only to increase playtime by having people wander around. The steam overlay still doesn't work but at least the cutscenes do. The story is convoluted and somewhat boring; overall ho-hum.

saying \"HEAR THE TAFFING WORDSH OF KARRASH YOU TAFFERSH...

This means that you have to be a taffing thief and use the taffing shadows to stay out of the guards taffing view, then bonk them on their taffing heads with a stick and hide them in some taffing corner and hope you've got enough taffing moss arrows to cover the taffing loud metal age metal grates so the taffing robots don't hear you and shoot their taffing bombs at you. But of taffing course you'll get taffing heard anyway so you try and leg it for some taffing cover but the taffing cameras catch you and then the guards crawl out of the taffing woodworks to get you so you shoot a taffing rope arrow at the taffing roof to climb away but the camera activated a taffing sentry so it shoots a taff load of spinny blades at you while you try to just taffing climb and so you decide water arrows are the best taffing course of action so you give the nearest robot a taffing free wash on his stupid taffing face and does he thank you? Taffing no he doesn't he just taffing shouts \"ALL MISHGUIDED TAFFERSH SHOULD HEAR THE WORDSH OF KARRASH\" and floors you while you do a little taffing scream and die.\n\nJust buy the game already, you taffer.", "timestamp_created": 1521223479, "timestamp_updated": 1521223479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40835434": {"recommendationid": "40835434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051452144", "num_games_owned": 970, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "last_played": 1521143116}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e.\n\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0435\u0440, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f: \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0432-\u043b\u043e\u0430\u0434.\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e.\n\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0443\u043d\u044b\u043b\u0430\u044f. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436 \u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442. \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435  \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0443\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435.\n\u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u043b \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0438\u0444\u0430, \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f, \u043a \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0443 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b.\n\u041d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1521143752, "timestamp_updated": 1521143752, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40805866": {"recommendationid": "40805866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206648267", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1521022582}, "language": "german", "review": "Betreff THIEF 2 \n\nAlso ganz Ehrlich gesagt, h\u00e4tte ich f\u00fcr diesen Teil  'Thief2 'gern mein Geld zur\u00fcck denn die Grafik ist ein Witz da kann ich mich ehrlich gesagt auch vors alte  Atari setzen das kommt aufs gleiche heraus ,was haben sich die entwickler denn hierbei gedacht ?!

It is without a friggin of a doubt the best stealth game ever. One of the key aspects of this game being better than thief the dark project is definitely the focus. I heard Thief 1 also had horror elements because Lookingglass expected stealth genre to fail. With the success of the first, this game is basically the better ideas put into a singular game. The story is basic but the way it progresses is phenomenal, the main reason I think this game is better than it's predecessor is the level design. While horror not being the theme, the game gives you more options to approach a level, tackle it at your own pace. The levels are bigger in a sense that is more open, as opposed to thief 1's more corridor filled maps. This allows the levels to be explored easier and the more you explore the more you learn the level, and the more you learn the level the more it makes sense. And you find other ways of tackling situations. So perhaps going to a safe directly might not be the best idea, fear not because there are a ton of secret paths scattered around everywhere which are explained by listening to doors, dialogues reading notes or just exploring more.  While it also excels compared to other stealth game simply thanks to it's still perfectly functioning sound system. You can get a basic of how many guards or robots there are behind a door before you open it. So it has a simple yet perfect solution for the trap most other stealth game falls. Trial and error. If you die in this game, It is because you took risks and failed to improvise well. The only complaint I have for this game is the lack of checkpoints which newer games have spoiled me to.

I can't praise this game enough. I honestly can't think of much more to say other than get to get it. There's no reason not to.\n\nAfter you're finished the original story, download Thief 2X.

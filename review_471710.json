I assure you there are plenty of adults who play Rec Room since I'm one of them and have a lot of friends my age that also play :)\n\nIf you'd like to find groups of people to hop in with check out or Discord server: https://discord.gg/recroom \n\nIf you run into players who you believe are clearly 12 or younger, please report them: https://www.againstgrav.com/reporting \n\nWe also have a ton of other comfort options like muting a player, muting all players, blocking players (this hides their avatar, tells matchmaking to avoid putting you into the same games together, and prevents them from ever joining one of your custom rooms). We also have the teleport bubble and space bubble to keep players out of your physical space, and more. \n\nIf you find all of these tools inadequate for customizing your experience please let us know what you would change or add at support@againstgrav.com \n\nThanks!"}, "40504547": {"recommendationid": "40504547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120187215", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494333106}, "language": "english", "review": "Typical and best Vr multi-game.\nThe graphic design and avatar's facial emotion makes this game more enjoyable.\nYou can communicate with various people!\nYou can also play not only communication, but also mini games!", "timestamp_created": 1519978898, "timestamp_updated": 1519978898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40501949": {"recommendationid": "40501949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001915038", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 403, "last_played": 1521676103}, "language": "english", "review": "Rec Room is a very entertaining and unique game, and I believe the creators are doing a wonderful job with it.", "timestamp_created": 1519966071, "timestamp_updated": 1519966071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40499665": {"recommendationid": "40499665", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962367469", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520120648}, "language": "english", "review": "RecRoom is pretty much the most consistently fun VR game available today; and you really can't beat the price.", "timestamp_created": 1519954543, "timestamp_updated": 1519954543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599150", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40482943": {"recommendationid": "40482943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093806079", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2130, "last_played": 1521495223}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite VR game.

squeaking and carrying on, but that is to be expected with the aesthetics and type of community this game has gone for.\nBeing a family friendly designed game if someone should be disruptive it is really easy to mute/block and or lodge a removal request if someone is interuptive to an activities progress or being a general douchbag.\n\nThere is a good number of things to do in this game the activities I play the most are:\nLaser Tag (Red vs Blue PvPvE match, enemy bots and players to win)\nQuests (PvE 4 person dungeon run type game mode.. wipe = reset progress)\nFrisbee Golf (Think golf... with a frisbee... fun and infuriating)\nOutside of these main games.. there are Daily's and Weekly goals which will encourage you to play the other games like VR Charades, Paddleball, Soccer, and Paintball plus more...\n\nTheres a basic progression via levels which is earned by just doing activities.\nAs you play there is also cosmetics you unlock/collect to change your appearance with unique rewards only obtainable by playing certain activities and in some cases getting above a certain score level.\n\nAll-in-all great fun game and well worth having a crack if have VR.",

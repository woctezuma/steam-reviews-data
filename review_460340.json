At the beginning of each turn, you have to swap the position of two of your heroes : the 3 on the front line attack, while the one in the back regenerates and prepares his special attack for the next time he'll go back to the front line. Once you defeat the boss in normal difficulty, you'll unlock the Nightmare mode ; then, if you manage to beat the game again, prepare yourself for the Hell difficulty. There are also quests to complete during the game for extra rewards.\n\nBut here is the thing : when one of your heroes dies, it's game over. You'll acquire some skill points and mithril to upgrade your heroes and buy items from the shop, depending on how many levels you finished. And then, select your heroes and inventory and start again - you'll have to go over and over again through the same levels until your heroes are strong enough to defeat the endboss.\n\nThat being said, despite the grind, the game is actually not bad at all. The graphics may well be simple, but I find it cute and original. The soundtrack is also a plus, it always puts me in a fighting mood. It even requires some tactics : team composition, hero upgrading, skill tree, choice of limited items you can pick per game, good moves during the fight and clever use of special abilities. Hell difficulty is in fact quite challenging. \n\nGuards is definitely a game to get on sales if you can and if you are into strategy / tower defense / turn-based combats. Even if it seems incomplete at first, it gets addictive and is a well-conceived game.", "timestamp_created": 1513887153, "timestamp_updated": 1514388807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576979", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38442223": {"recommendationid": "38442223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149985000", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513251140}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "expect a mobile game", "timestamp_created": 1513730850, "timestamp_updated": 1513730850, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38422186": {"recommendationid": "38422186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022966154", "num_games_owned": 1036, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513712439}, "language": "english", "review": "For it's price it's really something special.

Das Belohnungssystem wird leider zu massiv zur Streckung des Spiels genutzt. \n\nDie Grafik ist nett und Besitzer von Warstone TD werden die Einheiten wiedererkennen, denn dies ist eine Art Vorl\u00e4ufer. Die Entwickler beantworten auch immer noch Fragen im Steam-Forum.\n\nMan nimmt 4 Helden (von insgesamt 8) mit in eine Schlachtserie (Run).\nWie bei PvZ kommen einem die Gegner auf geraden Bahnen entgegen, auf jeder der 3  Bahnen steht ein k\u00e4mpfender Held und der 4.te Held ist dahinter auf der Ersatzbank.\nIn jeder Runde mu\u00df man 2 beliebige Helden miteinander vertauschen, wenn man dabei den Helden von der Ersatzbank ins Spiel bringt, wird dessen Sonderattacke aktiviert. Das ist etwas gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig, aber trotzdem interessant. \nLeider ist es etwas unbalanciert, denn man wird schnell merken, dass es am effektivisten ist, immer wieder die Heilerin ein- und auszuwechseln.\n Die 10 kleinen Missionen sind nicht frei w\u00e4hlbar, sondern m\u00fcssen immer in einer festen Reihenfolge ab der ersten Mission gespielt werden. Sobald ein Held stirbt oder man das Spiel unterbricht mu\u00df man beim n\u00e4chstenmal einen neuen Run ab Mission 1 starten.\n\nEs gibt keinen frei w\u00e4hlbaren Schwierigkeitsgrad, aber wenn man einmal in normal durch ist, gibt es 2 weitere. Der ansteigende Schwierigkeitsgrad und das Belohnungsystem/Grindingssystem sehen es nicht vor, dass Neulinge alle Missionen in 10 oder weniger Runs schaffen.\nEinheiten k\u00f6nnen auf 2 Wegen verbessert werden, mit Mithril oder mit Gold. Nach Missionen innerhalb eines Runs kann man mit Gold Einheitenverbesserungen kaufen, diese Verbesserungen werden einem nach dem Run wierder abgenommen.\nZwischen den Runs kann man mit Mithril seine Einheiten dauerhaft verbessern, aber in Wiederholungsruns gibt es weniger Mithril. Ich habe schpn in einigen TD Spielen wie auch dem Nachfolger Warstone TD gegrindet, aber in jedem Run wirklich alle Missionen wiederholen zu m\u00fcssen ist nervt\u00f6tend.\n\nMein bevorzugtes 4er Team f\u00fcr den ersten Schwierigkeitsgrad:\n[spoiler] 1) Heilerin, da nur sie mit ihrer Sonderf\u00e4higkeit heilt, wechselt man sie st\u00e4ndig zur Erstazbank und zur\u00fcck.\n2) Ritter, weil seine Sonderattacke ihn in den meisten F\u00e4llen zum bevorzugten Wechselpartner der Heilerin macht, beim Bosskampf ist er der Tank.\n3) Zwerg, seine zuf\u00e4llige Sonderattacke ist erst bei den K\u00e4mpfen mit dem Boss im letzten Level wichtig, da dort immer der Boss getroffen wird.\n4) Assasinin: Da ihre Attacke mehrere Gegner in ihrer Bahn treffen kann, ist sie die ideale Erg\u00e4nzung f\u00fcrs Team.[/spoiler]\n\n[u]Fazit[/u]\nWarum mu\u00df man ein gutes kleines Spiel durch diese k\u00fcnstliche Streckung so verschandeln?\nWegen dem langweiligem Grinding gibt es einen leicht nach unten gerichteten Daumen. \nIch habe f\u00fcr das Spiel 1,49\u20ac bezahlt, mehr sollte man nicht ausgeben.\n\nMehr Empfehlungen (haupts\u00e4chlich Tower Defense

hours to finish first campaign in 1/3(normal) difficulty, another 5-6 hours for 2/3 difficulty(nightmare). Uninstalled on 3/3(hell) difficulty cuz was too lazy(and it was hard).\n**Play it if you liked the following games - Blackguards / Braveland.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b] \nBrilliant TBS game I have to say. \nIt's one of those games that makes you maintain concentration by trying to\nfigure the best strategy to take advantage of your heroes, target specific enemies & kill them.\n- You begin with 4 heroes but have the option to unlock the rest.\n- You basically have 10 same levels to beat, different enemies each time. Sounds easy right? Think not.\nAs you progress you will find it harder to reach higher levels no matter how good you think you are.\n- You reach the end by constantly upgrading your heroes, buying helpful items & unlocking new skills.\n\nEnjoyment: (5/5) - Game keeps you busy and challenged at the same time.\nRepetetive: (2/5)\nReplayability (4/5) - 2 New difficulties (after the 1st playthrough) , New playthrough with different heroes / different\nstrategy.\nFrustraiton (2/5) - Leveling progress\nBoredom (0/5)\n\n[b]Overall Score: 8.5/10[/b]\n\n[b]*Game Tips*[/b]\nI have created a guide for beginners or people who need a working strategy so you can take a look by clicking on the link below.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=905402146\n\n[i][b]**Screenshots Section**[/b][/i] You're more than welcome to also check my screenshots for this game [link below] to see \nwhat this game has to offer.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/?appid=460340&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall\n\n[i]* Skip it.[/i]\n[i]** Not Recommended.[/i]\n[i]*** Give It A Try.[/i]\n[i]*** Recommended On Sale.[/i]\n[h1][i][b]******* Recommended On Full Price.[/b][/i][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1492204401, "timestamp_updated": 1492772174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745108", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31050362": {"recommendationid": "31050362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366717256", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492956268}, "language": "german", "review": "sch\u00f6nes rundenbasiertes Logikspiel.

The mechanic of having to swap two heroes to move was a novel idea and made for some tough choices at times. I liked the variety of heroes. I liked the look of the game. I didn't have any technical issues. There was some aspects of the game I would have appreciated more information, but it wasn't really a negative. However in the end, it just felt somewhat repetitive with not much in the way of a carrot to keep me going.

I enjoyed the seemingly simple combat system which encourages pacience and while it does involve some grinding eventually, I never felt bored or compelled to stop because of its increasing difficulty. I welcomed it with open arms, but perhaps for some newer players to this genre, this might represent a hindrance. The art style in Guards is reminiscent of cel shading and I enjoyed the ragdoll-like appearance of characters and units within the game. The presence of items and hero skills, does spice things up and offers plenty of strategic variety on its own. The soundtrack was pleasant enough, though nothing out of the ordinary. Still, the game looks and plays great for most strategy fans out there who don\u2019t mind some degree of repetitiveness. Guards received recently a hefty patch and I for one never encountered any glitches or bugs. Any recently released indie title which already gets patched to this level, deserves praise since we\u2019re getting more and more used today, seeing big-budget games fail miserably from a stable gameplay perspective. So Battlecruiser Games made a stallar job at providing and updating a very well polished game, their first project released on Steam.

Same rules as ever apply: Melee dudes are always stronger than ranged dudes, and the healer is a ranged dude. Yes, the healers do the same amount of damage as the dude with the bow. What is the healer firing? Healing bolts that heal you for negative damage? \nI love how that's literally what she's called. 'Healer'.

Jedoch hat jeder Character beim zur\u00fcckwechseln von hinten nach vorne eine Super Spezial Attacke die dann ausgef\u00fchrt wird.\nDa ist man oft am \u00fcberlegen wen man denn nun nach hinten nimmt, ob man den hinten noch wegen seiner Spezialattacke hinten l\u00e4sst weil diese jetzt gerade nicht sinnvoll ist usw.\n\nDer hintere Bereich ist auch der einzige in dem man (kleine Betr\u00e4ge ) heilt, angeschlagene Character sollten also auch nach hinten bevor diese sterben. Wenn ein Character stirbt hat man n\u00e4mlich verloren.\nAber es gibt auch eine Heilklasse, die Heilung kommt aber erst wenn diese selbst von hinten nach vorne wechselt. Dann werden je nach Ausbau der Klasse aber auch alle Charactere gleichzeitig um einen bestimmten Betrag geheilt.\n\nAuch die Aufwertungen die man bei seinen Characteren macht sind n\u00fctzlich.\n\nBeim spielen oder durch Quests erh\u00e4lt man Mithril mit der man seine Charactere permanent verbessern kann, dies ist aber vorgegeben, jedes \"Level\" bringt einen festen Bonus, der aber bei jeder Klasse unterschiedlich ist.\nVon mehr Schaden, mehr Leben bis hin zu einer komplett neuen F\u00e4higkeit.\n\nBeim spiel selbst kann man dann nach jedem Level auch seine Charactere verbessern, das Gold dazu bekommt man nach jedem Level, jedoch ist das dann nur f\u00fcr diesen Spieldurchgang, also tempor\u00e4r.\n\nZudem gibt es noch 10 verschiedene Verbrauchsgegenst\u00e4nde die teilweise sehr m\u00e4chtig sind, aber auch Mithril kosten. Besonders ab dem 2. Durchgang braucht man diese aber auch um \u00fcberhaupt eine Chance zu haben.\n\nZus\u00e4tzlich bekommt man f\u00fcr das meistern von Level auch noch Sterne mit denen man globale Skills kaufen kann. Mehr Gold nach jedem Level, mehr Taschenpl\u00e4tze, mehr Heilung in der hintersten Reihe usw.\n\nBeim ersten Durchgang haben die Gegner fast keine Spezialfertigkeiten, das \u00e4ndert sich im zweiten aber stark und im letzten ist es extrem taktisch.\n\nWer also Rundenstrategie sucht bei dem man wirklich nur mit viel nachdenken und Taktik weiterkommt sollte sich dieses Spiel nicht entgehen lassen.\n\nEdit: Die \u00dcbersetzung ist auch sehr gut.

Highly recommend.\nOverall rating: 90/100\n\nIn details:\n\nGame mechanic and gameplay:\n\nThe game is one of the worthy representatives of the genre of puzzles. In first view you think: Hey, it`s easy! Final boss is weak like gretchin, slow-passing player get his steam achievment for copleting game on normal in 2-4 hours.\nBut after this... Well it was named nightmare, and was named right. Enemies are tougher, get new abilities and you couldn`t win without serious brainwork. Yes, there are some random, and it influence on you runs, bringing another problems, and forcing you change your tactic and correct your heroes` improve plan every new stage.\nI think, that for this parts game definetly deserves 95/100\n\nGraphic and interface:\nSimple, pleasant graphic, which make your eyes happy. It is help you dive into game by being ideal bridge between player and this masterwork atmosphere.\nInterface is comfortable, intuitive simple. But from disadvantages - starting camp. It will be better, if it was something another than list of characters, but it is not so critical.\nSolid 90/100\n\nSounds and music\n\nSound in game was made great(exclude assasin hitsound for me), but music begins to pall after 7-8 runs. Yes, there is no enough variety in music, but nobody restrict you turn on your own and enjoy game with your favorite songs.\n85/100 for this part.", "timestamp_created": 1475080753,

Expect a game session to take 15-30 minutes or more once you've progressed.\n\n5+ hours of game play including leveling time for normal, plus 2 more challenging difficulties of nightmare, followed by hell. 10 rounds of play per difficulty, plus an endless survival option if you beat all ten. Each round takes a couple minutes, the later rounds generally taking more time. \n\nUnfortunately there is no save (arcade style) during these attemps to beat all ten levels, but you do keep rewards earned for how far you make it. The rewards you keep are mithral for leveling characters and buying items and stars for using skills. Once mithral is spent it is gone, but the stars can be reassigned at any time before starting combat for differnt skill choices. Mithral is earned for every round beaten and many quests (completed milestones of progress) while stars are based on your total progress across all difficulties and survival rounds, i.e. beating the same rounds you've beaten before don't add stars.\n\nA third reward type is used only during a specific playthough. Gold is used to level your characters total health, normal attack damage, and special attack damage for that playthrough only.\n\nGame play is simple, you choose your 4 characters you want to play with - you start with 4 and the other 4 can be unlocked with mithral - they will be randomly assigned to the front or back column. The three in front use their normal attack while the back row may heal, or be moved to the front performing a special/super move switching places with one other hero of your choice. The character moved to the back then heals some instead of attacking. Your turn plays as soon as you switch two characters then the enemies attack and advance. If you want to keep your current three in the front column, you may switch two of them and their normal attacks will fire in their new position. You never move outside these two ranks, the rest of the 3x7 grid is used for enemies. Each class has a different set of super and normal attacks. The healer for example has a ranged normal attack and a heal when moving forward. All the characters except the witcher have a ranged attack either in the super or normal attack. This is important since the ranged enemies don't seem to advance into melee range. As you advance through the game your enemies become both more numerous and diverse in the strategies necessary to defeat them. Luckily your team also gains new powers and potency as they level, and new skills and items become available to you.\n\nEvery level your characters gain is a different upgrade, subtly changing the challenge as you advance. You have character progression locked after a certain number of upgrades until you beat the current difficulty level, so you always have to put some thought into total victory for each of the 3 difficulties and not just grind your way there.\n\n8 character classes with unique strategies for each.\n\n6 special \"skills\" of three levels each to aid your heroes and their options, such as improved healing in the rear position, or extra inventory slots.\n\n12 expendable items to use, limited by your inventory spaces (2-6 depending on skills) and up to 2 of a type per inventory spot. these include items to revive a charcter (otherwise it's a loss on that round), extra attack damage for a number of rounds (3-4) or increased defense etc.\n\nModerate replay value, not quite diverse enough for high replability.\n\nI hope for those interested the game gains some traction for my own sake cause I'd like to see additional characters to be added. That will depend at least in part on the success, or lack thereof, of the game going forward. Even new development teams can't live on aspirations alone after all.\n\nI like it and I hope I've helped inform you whether or not you will.", "timestamp_created": 1474359520, "timestamp_updated": 1474532692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25593102": {"recommendationid": "25593102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129772270", "num_games_owned": 1457, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474395928}, "language": "russian", "review": "Guards -

simple  but interesting fantasy turn-based strategy, where you lead a group of four heroes in their way to defeat the main boss. Each hero has his own set of characteristics and ultimate ability.\n\n+ original turn-based combat system (in order to make a move you need to switch the positions of any two heroes, after moving hero from the front row in a back row he gains some health and when placed forward from the back row hero uses his ultimate ability)\n+ 8 upgradable unique heroes\n+ a variety of magical items to help your heroes survive longer\n+ extra difficulty levels\n+ nice soundtrack\n+ steam achievements and trading cards\n\nThe game is funny and simple but still addictive and in my opinion is a nice time-killer for a couple of evenings. I'd recommend this game to people who like casual strategies and turn-based tactical games.", "timestamp_created": 1474299986, "timestamp_updated": 1474299986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25585535": {"recommendationid": "25585535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028061940", "num_games_owned": 1905, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474391677}, "language": "russian", "review": "Guards - \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 20 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a. \u0421\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0448\u043b\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u044f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443, \u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0439\u0434\u044f \u0434\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0447\u044c\u044f \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u043c\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0438 \u044f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430. \u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b\u0448\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432, \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043c \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f, \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b.\n\u0421\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435, \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1474282496, "timestamp_updated": 1474282496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25584151": {"recommendationid": "25584151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061066803", "num_games_owned": 2644, "num_reviews": 251, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474393394}, "language": "russian", "review": "Guards - it is a game, with a very interesting mechanics.

bare-bones at the moment), it is developed by some of the laziest, uninterested und uncompetent developers i've ever seen, that are obviously not willing to listen to player's feedback and put some real work into their product, in order to improve the gaming experience for us players!\n\nTo be concrete, i asked for three things:\n\n1) Add complete hero information.\nThe answer: On the first turn, not possible, because they need the space for something else. Else, the descriptions are complete anyway.\n- Which is wrong! Neither the range, nor unit's (non-special) abilites, some of which you can buy as you progress, are shown in the information.\nNot even in the hero-selection screen, which is so annoying!\nAlso, the heroe's range is only displayed to the first enemy. Planning forward isnt possible, if you dont know the numbers by yourself.\n\n2) Change a certain hero's description for a special attack, which is completely wrong.\nThe answer: They asked me to write a new description myself, which they would then use.\n\n3) Add a fullscreen-option, so that we do not have to do it manually everytime we start the game.\nThe answer: Is it really so difficult to push a button?\n\n\nThere still is more stuff that needs improvement, and there are still things that are not working correctly. For example is it not possible to save progress within a level. You may just surrender and start anew when you return.\nEdit: Now, it does not save progress anymore! Will try to get a refund!\n\nBut, at this point, im stopping my support for-, and my time with this game.\n\n\nVery disappointing, and the last time i bought from these people!", "timestamp_created": 1473590288, "timestamp_updated": 1474709013, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586875", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25448504": {"recommendationid": "25448504", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999563599", "num_games_owned": 926, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473533034}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Simples, mas viciante.

From the beginning the game will set your mood right with an interesting fighting technique and with the offer of eight different classes. Naturally you have to progressively buy and upgrade new characters for obtained Mithrils (in-game currency). Before you start your adventure you have to choose a lucky team of four. Each hero has different abilities and can be deadly dangerous in combination with other team members. Every journey has 10 levels and 3 difficulty levels, which are progressively unlocked if you have vanquished the easier level.\n[h1]Off to battle[/h1]\nThe fight takes place on the chessboard of size 3x7. Each character has given field of activity and the number of possible targets. To play your move, it is always necessary to swap the positions of two of your characters. Your heroes are placed into 2 rows \u2013 3 in the first one and one in the second one. If you move a hero from the front to the back, he/she will be healed every turn that he/she stay there. But when you move a hero from the back to the front, you will activate their special abilities.\n[h1]Doping[/h1]\nIs it too hard for you? Is the final boss permanently kicking your ass? You can boost your heroes and turn the score! You can buy different boosts for Mithrils in the shop \u2013 potions, stone slabs of time etc. To be able to use more useful things on your road, you have to conquer as many levels as you can or complete as many quests as you can \u2013 in order to get stars. With those stars you can upgrade your passive skills (e.g. more inventory slots, better healing, more coins for upgrades).\n[h1]Upgrades[/h1]\nThere are 2 different types of upgrades in this game \u2013 permanent (for Mithrils) or temporary (for coins). After each successful level, you can temporarily upgrade your heroes (more hp, better attacks\u2026) for the collected coins and if you lose, the effect disappears. Usually you can\u2019t buy all the offered improvements, so you have to decide and tactically buy the best ones.\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nGuards was an interesting experience. I enjoyed the competition which this game caused in me, but at this moment I have vanquished all levels of difficulty and most of achievements. The game does not attract me further on and maybe I will come back to it after a larger update patch.", "timestamp_created": 1473267578, "timestamp_updated": 1473890329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25392659": {"recommendationid": "25392659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141729353", "num_games_owned": 1254, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473235424}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0438 \u044f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432. \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u044f\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0435\u0442. \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u044f \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439. 3 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u043e\u044f \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0443 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0441 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0443. \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043a \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0435. 10 \u0431\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1473234847, "timestamp_updated": 1473234847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25392352": {"recommendationid": "25392352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170772421", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473334335}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 -

I like graphics, it simply looks beautiful. Unique system of playing, very simple to understand but there is a lot of potential in it, player need to think how to get the best bonuses etc - i like it! Not too many options but game does not require them, only option i would like to see is a resolution changer, my laptop is not very powerful - slim type so on full HD i had 10 fps and even in window mode on level with fog i saw some lags but i am sure every normal pc can handle it with no problems, my old one that is like 1000 years old runs it fine :). Reassuming, it is very good little game and it has this factor X that takes you in and you want to go further and farther, you want to upgrade your heroes and beat the $#@ out of this cute monsters :). I hope in the future developers will add more heroes, more upgrades and more items to make this game even better. As a 34 years old gamer with 25 years of gaming experience i can definitely recommend Guards to everyone that likes good, small and friendly games just to kill some time and have fun. \n\nSorry for my bad english :)", "timestamp_created": 1472649707, "timestamp_updated": 1472649823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25267414": {"recommendationid": "25267414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005698659", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472381518}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u044f \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u044f \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \"\u0414\u041e\u0422\u0423\", \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435. \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0438 \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043b\u044b \"\u043c\u0438\u0444\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430\", \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u044f \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430 InApp Purchases. \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 4-\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435, \u044f \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438. \n\u0418 - \u044f \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0434\u044b. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \"\u0414\u041e\u0422\u0423\". \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \"Tower Defense\". \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043b\u044b \u043c\u0438\u0444\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u0418 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b. \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c (?) \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0438\u0437 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432, \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0425\u043e\u0434 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0438\u0437 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0418 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u044f \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044f 6 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432!

I enjoyed the seemingly simple combat system which encourages pacience and while it does involve some grinding eventually, I never felt bored or compelled to stop because of its increasing difficulty. I welcomed it with open arms, but perhaps for some newer players to this genre, this might represent a hindrance. The art style in Guards is reminiscent of cel shading and I enjoyed the ragdoll-like appearance of characters and units within the game. The presence of items and hero skills, does spice things up and offers plenty of strategic variety on its own. The soundtrack was pleasant enough, though nothing out of the ordinary. Still, the game looks and plays great for most strategy fans out there who don\u2019t  mind some degree of repetitiveness. Guards received recently a hefty patch and I for one never encountered any glitches or bugs. Any recently released indie title which already gets patched to this level, deserves praise since we\u2019re getting more and more used today, seeing  big-budget games fail miserably from a stable gameplay perspective. So Battlecruiser Games made a stallar job at providing and updating a very well polished game, their first project released on Steam.

Nice relaxing color palette.\n\n+Sound - Nice sound effects, music pretty average, nothing special.\n\n+Gameplay - 1st of all I have to mention that this game involves a lot of grind, you have pack of levels, you start from the 1st one every single time and try to advance as far as possible with current team, then you use reward to upgrade your units, buy some items and try again. That's it. You have 8 units to pick to create a team of 4, so the team build could be pretty variative.\n\n+Steam cards\n+Steam achievements (they are hard to get, pretty time consuming)\n-After hours of playing repeating from the very 1st level again and again can get pretty repetitive and boring, on the other hand, that's what all the games of that genre suffer from.", "timestamp_created": 1472125513, "timestamp_updated": 1489458644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25119554": {"recommendationid": "25119554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147352741", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472069121}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439,\u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0412\u0435\u0434\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d \u0441\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u043b \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0443 \u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e!", "timestamp_created": 1472069524, "timestamp_updated": 1472069524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495884", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25112245": {"recommendationid": "25112245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180866515", "num_games_owned": 786, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472106885}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f.\n\u0423 \u0432\u0430\u0441 4 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430, \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c.\n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438,\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b.\n\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0438)\n\u0418 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1472043838, "timestamp_updated": 1472043838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525692", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25112229": {"recommendationid": "25112229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147348908", "num_games_owned": 2385, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475589065}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1]Guards - \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f, \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430 Unity[/h1] \n\n\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432\u044b \u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \"\u0410 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e?

You pick 4 out of 8 classes to use. The game field is a 3x7 grid where your heroes are placed 1 in the back and 3 in front. When you are in the fight enemies spawn and move/attack every round and when it is your turn you attack by switching position with two of your heroes. This means you always move around the heroes and you have to look a turn ahead. I had a few times where im like \"This is the perfect position\" and then i had to move them. This is enhanced by the fact that every hero is either melee or range and that some heroes can attack through enemies. What really makes every hero special is that when you pull a hero from the back into the front they use a unique ability. Ranging from healing to damaging all enemies. The gameplay loop is set up with you starting with few heroes. then you go into battles that gets progressively harder. As soon as even a single heroes die you lose (unless you have items to prevent it) and the round is over. depending on how well you did you are rewarded with Miftril which can be spent to upgrade heroes and then you go again. There is also a quest system and a skill system. So go in. get as far as you can. get stronger. go back in. Its really compelling and quite satisfying. The downside is that i am not sure how much there is to keep you playing after you have upgraded everything and beaten the game on normal and nightmare and hell. This will however take several hours and I am not quite sure how challenging or welldone the two additional difficulties are\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n-Simple yet crisp graphics\n-Can be played in short bursts\n-Has an interesting game loop\n\nCons:\n-Quite heavily based around an upgrade based gameplay loop which is finite.\n\nTo see it in action you can watch my first stream of it\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPLleqePbVg", "timestamp_created": 1471987560, "timestamp_updated": 1471987988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

to attack the enemy monsters(trolls, bats etc.), and basically thats it, but dont let the this to fool you: While the game is simple, it is actually challenging, because the outcome of a fight depends only on the position of the heroes, for example placing a Witcher in a field where the enemy is 4-5 tiles away, can easily kill your Witcher, because he cant throw his sword at the monster, so it would be easier to put a crossbow hero on that tile field. \n\nSummed up: Guards is a fun, simple, challenging game, wich is a great time killer if you are bored!\n\nPros.:\n-Simple\n-Good timekiller\n-Fun to play\n-Challenging\n\nCons.:\n-Sometimes too challening\n-There is no level selection menu\n\nScore: 8\n\"A fun, simple, challenging game made by a small development

You choose 4 heroes to defend the lanes from the enemy waves. You take turns with the enemy to move or attack. Attack is done automatically and you can't move outside of your positions, but you can switch the position among the heroes to create a favorable matchup. Moreover, switching positions allow your heroes to heal and activate their special moves. The game is over if one of your heroes die, so be careful.\n\nOverall the gameplay is fun and easy to pick up. There is no story or cutscenes though, so you may get bored playing through the levels. I recommend this game because it's a good game, but it's too expensive at the full price ($9.99).

In battle you need to switch heroes in order them to take turn and attack foes. There are 3 front and 1 back places in hero formation and when you move hero back he start regenerating health. If you move hero from back to front he uses his ultimate ability (for example healer restores life of teammates, archer shoots valley of arrows to every enemy and so on). You can upgrade heroes by several means - permanently upgrade them by rune stones before adventure, upgrade their stats (only for the current adventure) between missions by gold and use potions in battles to gain some short advantage.\n\nThe game is smple, but very addictive.

I dont like casual games. Yeah, rules of games are really simple. Swap heroes to make a turn. Swap again to make another turn. Repeat this actions to complete the level. The first impression is always a mistake.\n\nWhen I reached the third level, I was forced to think about the turns. Enemies are getting bigger! Begin to cast a bad spells! The game starts to deliver incredible pleasure! You must kill 5 monsters to complete the level. Every hero has less then 20hp. One wrong move and you ll lose. You begin to plan moves ahead. If you move Witcher to the central cell and kill Armored Wolf then Poison Beetle will kill Archer at the top cell. So you move Archer back and Knight comes forward and stuns all enemies. So you get no damage. After you move Archer forward and she uses Arrow Rain and kills this Poison bettle and other 2 enemies. There are three more moves and level is completed. You spend gold for extra hero upgrades. New level starts.\n\nI tried different lineups, until I found the one that allowed me to reach the final boss. Yeah, final battle is immpressive. You should try this.\n\nIts really awesome. Its really strategy game.

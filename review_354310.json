The music is relaxing and non-intrusive which compliments the puzzle solving nature of the game.\n\nPlayers will have their hands full rescueing birds, dispensing with al capone kitties and cat burglers, finding keys to unlock cages, bombing walls and barriers, and trying to prevent the screen overpopulating from hatching eggs!  A few of the levels are time attack levels while most of the later levels have specific restrictive victory conditions.  The background and game board will change every few levels to fit a new themed area with rooftiles giving way to lawn and flowerbeds complete with mowers and garden gnomes.\n\nClaws & Feathers is a family friendly game which will appeal to players of all ages.  Add to this that the game is really fun to play.  The small download size means this game will be well suited to the casual gamer with limited disk space.\n\nThe menu is intuitive and the controls and interface are are easy to use.

Don't expect a physics game though. This is a straight puzzle game that plays closer to a match 3 though significantly different, and I would say more complex, than something like Bejeweled.\n\nThe staple of the gameplay is to remove birds of the same color from the playing field, a roof, by aligning three of the same color. You can do this in a row or in an L shaped corner. The trick is that a bird can only move where there's an open path, so no obstacles like another bird blocking it, and if you move a bird without making a 3 or more group match then more birds will show up on the playing field adding more obstacles. There are little eggs of different colors showing where the new birds will 'hatch' and sometimes you actually want to make a move that's not a match in order to get a bird of a particular color to appear so there's a bit of strategy to it all.\n\nOther additions are made to the gameplay such as this cats, the 'Claws' part of the game, who you must surround on either side to fly them off the playing field, birds who are chained up and need a match to be released and hidden keys.\n\nNote that some of the levels are timed as well but not all. Each level has different requirements so there's a lot of variety and you never quite know what to expect. I liked the unpredictability that you had other goals to meet besides simply rescuing the birds that varied with each level.\n\nI was a bit apprehensive of the timed levels at first since I prefer to play puzzle and casual strategy games at a slower pace where I have more time to think out my moves but after a few tries I was able to get through them without much problem. It forced me to play in a bit of a different way for those levels which again I found to be a nice variety.\n\nAs with most level based casual games this is one where you don't need to make a huge time commitment and can play a level or two here and there in short bursts.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the visuals were all done well, looked great in full screen. I experienced no bugs errors or technical issues.\n\nIf you're looking for a puzzle game that's a little bit different and more complex than a simple match 3 and you like variety I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Claws and Feathers.", "timestamp_created": 1427461989, "timestamp_updated": 1427461989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631776", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15073918": {"recommendationid": "15073918", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970329288", "num_games_owned": 1762, "num_reviews": 968, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427326399}, "language": "english", "review": "This game might have an angry birds vibe to it, but its a whole lot more.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgevgtr59Rw\nGet ready for the fur to fly in this wild and crazy matching game!

This can be tricky; you might need to unchain all chickens, remove walls and if you are lucky you may even have to beat the clock!

Bright, fluffy birdies and cute kitties feature in this game, which at first glance looks like a really easy and casual match-3 type game. A few levels in and the fur and feathers are flying (figuratively and sometimes literally) as you try to maneuver your pieces around the board while thinking multiple moves ahead like some master chess strategist.\n\nIn the game, your chicks are trapped in locked cages and you must free them. To accomplish this, you move birds around the game board, matching 3 of the same color in order to clear some of the birds off by letting them take flight. The idea is to clear paths on the game board between golden keys and the locked cages. Making all of this much more difficult is the fact that every move causes eggs to appear and more birds to hatch. Sometimes you might clear some part of the board just to block other parts on the same move, a bit like taking a step forward while also sliding backwards. This definitely forces you to think several moves ahead as you play. Additional game mechanics, like cats and bombs, can further hinder or help your progress as you try to clear obstacles blocking the way.\n\nDon't be fooled by the cute, Claws & Feathers gets hard fast. The timed missions are particularly difficult, and I found just completing those levels a challenge. Solving the conditions of each puzzle board is going to take multiple repeats, and I honestly found the game a little frustrating at times.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a challenging strategy puzzle game masquerading as a casual match-3 timespinner, you will find it in Claws & Feathers. \n\n[i]A review copy of this game was provided by the publisher.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1427405598, "timestamp_updated": 1427405676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813160", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15063402": {"recommendationid": "15063402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035054806", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430296450}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a Good game\n\nPros\n\nIt's a match 3 game with hard to easy to back to hard puzzels.

But no, this is another type of casual game - match 3 game.\nTo be honest I'm not a big fan of such games, especially on PC. In my opinion this is good game to play on smartphone. So I played it on my Win 8 tablet. And to be honest this is biggest advantage of this game, because on Steam there are not many games working well using touchscreen only. This game is one of them and in my opinion this is the best way to play it.\nBut to be honest I didn't enjoy it, so this is next time I wish there was neutral opinion here. But I prefer to give positive because it's solid piece of code. It works well, I didn't experience any bugs, graphics and music are nice and there are some fresh ideas in that genre.

A fusion of Match 3 and puzzle fair, the gameplay is pretty unique and fun.  And despite looking a bit like Angry Birds in the art department, it is anything but.\n  \nBirds are striking back after a gang of nasty cats stole their eggs, but rescuing their offspring may be trickier than they thought!  The gameplay is more complex than it first appears.  We're given a game board with birds and cats sprinkled about.  Matching 3 of the same colored bird will remove them from the board, and to remove the cats and reveal the keys they're hiding you need to surround them with birds of the same color.  This is easier said than done as any move that does not result in a match adds colored eggs to the board.  An additional non-match move and the eggs hatch into full birds which will quite often block your path.   Too many bad moves, and you run the risk of getting blocked in and not being able to complete the stage.  Planning your strategy and working out the best series of moves is required to get through the game.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=414264314\nEach stage has an objective that must be completed in order to earn a gold egg.  While failure doesn't prevent you from progressing on to the next stage (as long as you free the required number of chicks), the gold objective adds an extra layer of strategy to a lot of the game boards and helps bulk up play time as you'll often have to replay levels multiple times to earn gold.  This is something I really enjoy about a lot of these casual games; while you can certainly play them more casually, goals that encourage challenging yourself opens the game to even the not-so-casual crowd.   The difficulty ramps up pretty quickly too, so don't think it'll be easy sailing getting gold eggs on all stages, even the earlier ones will have you stumped and replaying multiple times. As you get further into the game, additional mechanics (bombs, chained birds, fireworks) introduce even more complexity to the level designs, mixing things up and keeping gameplay interesting and challenging.   Some stages are pretty dang clever, too.\n\nThe nice thing is that outside of a handful of stages with timed gold objectives, you can take as much time as you like to complete each.  So if you need to study the game board for a few minutes to plan out your moves, there's no ticking clock to worry about, it's just you and the birds.  This is great for those looking for less hectic \"casual\" gameplay  but also works well for the times you can't dedicate your full attention to a game.  My only complaint is that the timed levels can be rather hectic and stressful, the later ones taking dozens of tries to perfect, but this is only one small gripe for a game that is a ton of fun otherwise.\n\nThe presentation is top notch, as well.  I don't know why, but the sound effects are one of my favorite parts of the game; I just love the chirps the birds make as they fly off, it's so silly and cute.  The music is also great, reminding me of classic cartoons with their jazzy and lighthearted scores. Graphics aren't anything fancy, but cute and fitting for the type of game this is.  And really, who doesn't like a mustachioed bird?\n\nWith 56 levels and 30 achievements, there's quite a bit to play through.  Progress tracking on the achievements is a much appreciated addition, but they could definitely use Steam Integration.  At least it has trading cards to help sweeten the deal.  Although it took a bit to get the hang of the mechanics, I'm now squarely hooked on these birds.  There's just something about those trickier levels that makes you feel awesome once you finally snag gold.  Claws & Feathers is definitely worth a look if you're searching for a good puzzler without (for the most part) the craziness of time crunch games. \n\nBottom Line: Recommended for strategy game enthusiasts and anyone needing to scratch that puzzle game itch. \n\n[h1]Note - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1427382796, "timestamp_updated": 1431622571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799726", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 37, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 37}}

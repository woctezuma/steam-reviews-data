The game takes QIX mechanics and pits you against dragons and to win each level you have to capture the forts on the map. You can win by default by claiming enough of the map regardless. \n\nThe music isn't bad and doesn't get old too quickly, at least if you're not totally bad at it. Simple graphics are all this game needs and it does it well. \n\nIn terms of the Achievements, most of them are pretty standard things to get and won't make you work too hard. You'll get a lot of them just from playing and beating the game. Only three Achievements require any sort of skill. One of them is downright hard, but as I started playing yesterday and finally managed to get it, not too bad. \n\nIt's a good game to pick up and put down, however it may drag you in for an extended stay when you get so frustrated that the level is so easy and you made a silly mistake. \n\nThere are two control options for this game, mouse (casual) or keyboard (hard, but better for mastery.)\nOptions are pretty limited but there's not much to need.\n\nOne minor annoying thing I found, was no way to kill my profile and start over if I'd lost too many lives. You're stuck with whatever you've done unless you change difficulties. \n\nHowever, for what it is, it's a great fun time. Technically it could have a lot of replayabliity, if you really enjoy this style of game. \n\nI'd get it on sale or in a bundle. But regardless, it's good fun. \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1460511594, "timestamp_updated": 1460511594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617706",

There are turrets and dragons ready to kill you all around and you have a set amount of lives per stages.\n\nThe game is really stressful, because if you die in a set of levels, you will start over at the first one. Also in the later difficulties, with how hard it is to make pixel perfect squares, you will die to random 1x1 pixel bumps you have made while capturing terrain. This game could have been pretty good, I like the idea. There's even more bad things about the game...\n\nThis is a \"puzzle\" kind of game, but the enemies and bonuses doesn't spawn at the same place if you retry or start over. That makes it so you can win many levels just by re-trying until you get a \"Stop-time\" bonus in a convenient spot and clear the level in 20 seconds.\n\nThe game can be completed in less than 30 minutes (even on Impossible difficulty), but at least it's cheap...\n\nI do not think it is too bad, but I cannot recommend it, way too punishing, it's 1$ though... So if you want to try a new type of puzzle/strategy game, sure, try it. Personally, I found it too punishing and frustrating.

The basic premise is something akin to 'Join the Dots' meets basic geometry.  You take control of an intrepid knight that must be manoeuvred around and across various maps in order to capture the enemy castle.  The action is displayed in birds-eye view.\n\nThe knight must be moved out from a safezone which starts on the outer border of the map.  While in the safezone the knight is immune to any deadly enemy attacks.  Rectangles must be drawn from one part of the safezone to another to cut down the enemys control of the land (map).  This must be done with all manner of obstacles ready to kill the knight, while being up against the clock.\n\nOf course the further into the map the safezone encroaches the less space the knight has to avoid deadly obstacles.  These include: two types of cannon ball firing towers and, a multitude of dragons that swoop down or shoot fireballs in an attempt to kill your knight.  These must be avoided by ensuring that your knight is in the safezone when hit and not in the midst of drawning a rectangle.  If the knight is hit while drawning a polygon then a life is lost.  If this isnt enough of a challenge note that the map must be conquered against the clock.\n\nFear not for the knight has a few actions they can perform to help you win.  They can 'capture' triggers to destroy enemy towers, or trap dragons in a part of the safezone killing them instantly.  Special tokens can also be 'captured' that provide a number of neat abilities such as: temporary invincibility, stopping cannonballs, killing dragons, receiveing an extra life or stopping time.  To capture a trigger or token a polygon must be drawn around the item on the map.\n\nThere is one campaign which covers twelve maps.  It can be replayed through four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard and Impossible.  Difficulty affects time available, starting lives, the reaction speed amongst others.\n\nWith rudimentary controls the game is easy to pick-up.  While graphics are basic they are well rendered and provide a more than fitting medieval ambience that goes perfectly with the incredibly catchy music played in the background.  No bugs were encountered during twelve plus hours of play.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed playing and beating this game. It has that 'just one more go' addictive quality, which kept me playing.

The game offers standard option controls including windowed mode (always a plus) and the ability to mute the in-game music, which you will most likely be doing after it loops the third time.\nThe gameplay is difficult enough to match each mode of play from easiest to hardest, with the hardest being worthy of the title. The game offers bonuses to be roped-off and captured in order to gain short-lasting special abilities such as a temporary speed boost, temporary halting of cannon fire, or the killing off of one of the infuriating dragons. The level designs vary and offer up a challenge as you gain access to higher levels. Be careful not to lose all of your lives, though! In levels with multiple castles to capture you have to restart from the first castle in that level if you run out of chances.\nFor the price, I recommend picking up the game, for the trading cards and easier-than-usual achievements.

I have no complaints about the graphics, since the artwork is excellent, but the controls can mess you up a few times. Quick premise: You are a knight and you have to basically walk in straight lines while creating shapes to capture land and surround a castle while being chased by dragons that you need to capture. The castle also has cannons that shoot at you. The controls include either the mouse or the keyboard. I use the mouse and find myself missing a connection point and getting killed by dragons because I didn't encircle them completely. That's my only complaint. I made a guide to get all achievements, so need help? There is a guide by yours personally which can help you. Fortix is totally worth the dollar I paid for it.

You can trap dragons by boxing them in and the same with turrets.  Whatever is within that box is reclaimed or defeated.

It is outrageously fun! Indeed, I would say that it is worth more than a mere dollar.\n\nThere is also Fortix2 available on Steam, and although I should say that all of the level layouts in Fortix are also in Fortix2, I should also say that Fortix is a little bit more of a challenge than Fortix2.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYour objective is to capture the vast majority of territory of each level. This game is apparently based on an old game called \"Qix\" (before my time, so I can't tell you more than that). You capture territory by walking your knight off of his baseline and tracing out boxes, which once you go back to the baseline will then be claimed. Life is made a little more hazardous by towers that shoot at you, various creatures that want to eat you, and changes in ground type which slow you down.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nOne can use the mouse, but using the keyboard gives you much more precise control over your knight. I certainly found the keyboard more intuitive to use. You need fast fingers if you play in hard mode!\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nThere is one, but it isn't much of one. Very basic, there is a bad guy, you must complete all the levels and defeat the bad guy. I must say though, that really not every game needs a plot so I can't count it as a con.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nReally fun medieval jolly music. I also enjoyed listening to the little noises the dragons make.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nI enjoyed the artwork a great deal. There are plenty of different looking textures to help you tell ground types apart. So, functional and nice to look at. The dragons are really cute!\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]+ [/b]different difficulty settings making it simplistic or a bit of a challenge\n[b]+ [/b]different ways to control your knight\n[b]+ [/b]pleasant atmosphere\n[b]+ [/b]simple objective, but hurdles between you and victory\n[b]+ [/b]awfully cheap\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]- [/b]movement can be a bit awkward and sometimes not as responsive as you might like\n\n[h1]Help Me Help You[/h1]\n[b]If you did not find this review helpful,[/b] I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn\u2019t helpful for you. It\u2019s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.\n\n[h1]Rothana's Steam Review Archive[/h1]\nFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: [b]rothana dot weebly dot com[/b]\n\n[b]Footnotes[/b]\n*Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see. The primary price I list at the top is the price that I bought the game at.\n**I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise. Remember that these are external websites and I'm just trying to be helpful - I'm not responsible for the content on the other end.\n\n[b]Edit Log[/b]\n27/11/2014 formatting edits\n27/11/2014 added \"help me help you\" section\n18/02/2015 added \"rothana's archive\u201d section", "timestamp_created": 1398016351, "timestamp_updated": 1424317924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9874130": {"recommendationid": "9874130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104893554", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427075831}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Peque\u00f1o gran vicio remake de uno de los cl\u00e1sicos.

The story dictates that you are a knight trying to take back castles; however, this is just that \"capture a certain amount of the area by drawing lines with your character\" kind of game.

In the end, just capture the castle and forget the rest of the map, as this is the easiest path to victory.

A great, simple game, with fun, engaging, simple and tried-and-true gameplay mechanics. For less than a dollar you can get a game that is better than some $5+ games I own.\n\nSimple story, you are a knight who has returned to his homeland to reclaim his family's throne from an evil wizard. However, this isn't some strategy game where you build up resources or units, nor is this an in-depth RPG or hack-n-slash. No, this game is a thing of pure beauty. \n\nIt is simple. You control a knight (Sir Fortix), and you move around the map, cutting out swathes of land. The more land you get, the higher your score. However, there are enemy turrets that can hit you or your drawn line, and dragons that fly around the map and can kill you. There are also enemies that travel around the lines, trying to hunt you down. How do you defeat them? Simple, outline them. Simply run around them so that they are trapped in the piece of land you cut out. Capture catapult triggers to shoot catapults at the enemy turrets and destroy them. You have a set number of lives and a time limit, although each is more than enough I think. This isn't as easy as it sounds, as enemies can fill your screen and multiple turrets can send cannon balls flying everywhere, while you dodge through, vanquishing enemies, capturing triggers and power up, and slowly but surely conquer the map.\n\nMany levels, often with other levels within them, a great, simple, and cheap game that focuses on gameplay and fun. For $0.99? It is a steal and I highly reccomend it. Plus, it comes with trading cards, so you can get emoticons, backgrounds, and badges from this game, and for getting access to this, the price seems even better!\n\nIt is a little older, so the resolution is a little off, although setting it to full screen makes it more than playable imo.

I just spent the last 2 hours playing it with my daughter, and she was as excited as I used to be, 8 years old standing in the arcade, playing till they closed for the night. This is a great way to pass the time, and an incredible way to introduce your kids to games from the 80's / 90's era while not being bored yourself. Fortix brings more to the table than Qix ever had, and it executes it perfectly.. well maybe your character is a little small, but that is probably my old eyes catching up with me.

I also hate this game. But overall I like it. It does not necessarily take long to finish the levels. But if you want to spend more time you just go and beat the impossible difficulty. Achievements keep up the motivation.\n\nFortix may be described as a capture-the-map game in which the player has to capture certain areas of the map. This is done by venturing into the uncaptured map and basically fencing off a part of the terrain. Once both ends of the fence are connected to your baseline (initially surrounding the playing field) you claim the area inside. Movement is restricted to vertical and horizontal and fencing-off may be interrupted by a number of hazards of increasing difficulty (and annoyance ;) ).\n\nIf you, for whatever reason, remember the Game Boy game Qix you know the basic mechanics of Fortix. And if you enjoyed the former you will probably enjoy the latter, like I do.\n\nWhat really annoyed me on the harder difficulty was that I couldn't always clearly determine whether I had started fencing off. Since part of the fence to-be-build is hidden under the player I often stepped of the baselline and got attacked without ever realizing the danger I had put myself in. Keeping enemy reactions in sight is hard when you are concentrating on inching by some tower fearing you will miss the baseline again and die.\nI sort of like the way you are stopped when you run into a corner but I'd much rather prefer a more direct control over when to step off the baseline. Fortix 2 has running which incidentally keeps you on the baseline - both by holding CTRL - a technique similar to what I have in mind. I'd like to have a key like SHIFT that I have to hold to be able to step off the baseline, also canceling the stopping technique.\nI could also imagine releasing SHIFT would result in the player returning to the closest point on the baseline. Although I understand that not having that return mechanism may be a deliberate decision in order to keep the overall difficulty of the game at a decent level.\nAt times I thought it might be useful to have a key for making the player backtrack on the current fence - a move almost impossible to make after taking the first corner.\n\nAs I said before, I recommend this game as I do its sequel which I will continue to be furious with now.", "timestamp_created": 1389499874, "timestamp_updated": 1389499874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8648652": {"recommendationid": "8648652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055398984", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413057047}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e)", "timestamp_created": 1389372500, "timestamp_updated": 1389372500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8647749": {"recommendationid": "8647749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015044576", "num_games_owned": 607, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387638575}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic strategy game with great value for money.", "timestamp_created": 1389367991, "timestamp_updated": 1389367991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8644925": {"recommendationid": "8644925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017525580", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478887023}, "language": "polish", "review": "Nothing is better for lack of Internet connection.:)", "timestamp_created": 1389351115, "timestamp_updated": 1389351115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8642699": {"recommendationid": "8642699", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969546230", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439619117}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks simple but really a lot of fun.

You draw lines to divide up territory, making sure that neither yourself nor your line is hurt by the obstacles along the way, and when you've captured specific territory or a certain amount, you succeed.

The impossible difficulty will give you a run for your money as, try though I did, I could not get perfect on the last level on the impossible difficulty. This makes it an adequate choice whether you are looking for a brief distraction or a challenge.\n\nThe game is very sensitive and seems to expect extremely precise timing. I say this because often enough I tried to reconnect to a previous section only to be a sliver off, usually leading to my demise. This is compounded by the fact that anything and everything, including your own character and score callouts, seems to be in the way of being able to see where you are and whether you've started a new line, exposing yourselft to danger. Often, I would accidentally end up on a border that was a sliver off of the one I had come from only to find myself dead because I had unknowingly just exposed myself to a nearby danger. There are also many random elements like which tower will fire when, where pick-ups appear and which way dragons will go making it much harder to plan things out. When all of these things are so meaningful alone that they could determine success or failure, it becomes increasingly frustrating on the impossible difficulty because you fail due to many factors seemingly beyond your control.", "timestamp_created": 1385912159, "timestamp_updated": 1404558923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7853925": {"recommendationid": "7853925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002873182", "num_games_owned": 634, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1379230755}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, easy, casual, short.

Though it might seem trivial to complain when it only costs a dollar, the fact of the matter remains that with the release of Fortix 2 (which includes all of 1's levels) the original has been made completely obsolete and redundant.\n\nNot that it was particularly worthwhile to begin with. With only a dozen or so strongholds to defeat, most of which comprise but a single level, Fortix is over before it feels like it's even started. The different difficulty settings do nothing to create replay value, only increasing the speed of enemies and lowering the generous amount of extra lives you receive, as the game is very easy even set on impossible.\n\nIn short, even having gotten it for free, I feel cheated to have wasted my time playing Fortix. The level designs are terribly dull and the presentation so basic and repetitive that the it amounts to being little more than a glorified flash game or demo. Save your dollar, or better yet find it a friend and get Fortix 2 instead. It provides the better experience through and through, and although I think the core gameplay of Fortix is rather enjoyable itself, this is simply an extremely poor representation of it that serves no purpose but to take up space in your Steam library.", "timestamp_created": 1379271799, "timestamp_updated": 1385404889, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495949", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4301774": {"recommendationid": "4301774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035310310", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396123532}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game on Steam, only 99 cents go buy dis thing now", "timestamp_created": 1379199791, "timestamp_updated": 1379199791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2115089": {"recommendationid": "2115089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002518269", "num_games_owned": 1398, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1379119456}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little game.

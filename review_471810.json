Although the premise is simple, each puzzle requires careful coordination between all the players involved. One false move, and you\u2019re out! Be prepared to laugh, face-palm, scream, and/or cry. \n[b]NOTE:[/b] I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to try the 4 player mode yet, so this review refers mainly to the 2 player mode.\n\n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]This game is designed in such a way that anyone can start playing at any point. The controls are as basic as they get (essentially D-pad movement) and there are only a few concepts to learn. \n[*]Level/puzzle design is brilliant. They are designed with every player in mind \u2013 every member of the team must cooperate to beat a level. The puzzles also feel very fair. You have all the information you need to beat any given level, it just requires careful thought and a little trial and error.\n[*]I enjoyed the look of the characters. At a first glance, it is obvious that they have different colours and number of lenses (1-4). However, if you look carefully, you can see that they all have a unique design; little bits and pieces that are specific to each block. It\u2019s also nice that you can wear hats to further personalize your blocks. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Only local co-op in a co-op-centric game. This is probably a major downside for many players because you lose the ability to play with anyone outside your immediate vicinity. You could also play alone, but that defeats the purpose of this game. \n[*]I was quite surprised that there is no key remapping option. This is especially difficult for people who use a keyboard and want to play with 4 players. Just so you have an idea: player 1 (arrow keys), player 2 (wasd), player 3 (left shift + arrow keys), player 4 (right shift + wasd). Basically, not feasible. \n[*]In my experience, the multidirectional box can be difficult to push as it often latches on to corners. While not terribly annoying, it would be nice if this could be improved somehow. There are also some cases where your bot can be flung across the screen \u2013 although this is more entertaining than it is frustrating.\n[*]You are navigating on a 3D environment but the camera is fixed. As such, it can be difficult to judge depth, height, and position accurately. There were several instances where I had to focus intensely to figure out the layout of the map. It would be nice if the camera was semi adjustable (only movable within a small range and automatically bounces back to the default position) to address this issue. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Conslusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272c\u2606 Great for CO-OP [/h1]\n\nI played Death Squared with my SO. Despite not being proficient at games, she really enjoyed playing it. There is a brilliant balance between the playability and difficulty in this game. The controls and rules are simple enough that anyone can pick them up, while the challenge comes from clever level design and partner coordination. The puzzles never felt unfair, but often made us scratch our heads. \nI suspect that Death Squared is not as popular as it could be due to the local co-op limitation. Regardless, I find that video games are usually best enjoyed as a local co-op experience, since the emotions shared become exponentially more vivid. Like [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/ready2b/recommended/448510/]Overcooked[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/ready2b/recommended/323850/]Move or Die[/url], I find that Death Squared is a fantastic example of a game best experienced locally. If you enjoy co-op puzzle games, this game is a must.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

The reason I\u2019ve decided to not dive into any of the local multiplayer is because many people simply can\u2019t play local multiplayer games as such I\u2019ve decided to look at this game only from a singleplayer perspective.\n\n[b]What's the general gameplay like?[/b]\nIn this game you will control a red and blue cube that you will move by using the WASD and Arrow Keys, you have to navigate these cubes through levels with several obstacles ranging from deathly lasers to spikes and other moving objects. Then at the end you have to move both cubes onto a circular pad in order to complete the level.\n\n[b]What are some negatives?[/b]\nOften you will confuse which cube is moved by which keys on your keyboard, I've often failed a level because I instinctively moved with the wrong set of keys.\nThe game likes to throw random deaths your way by making spikes appear out of nowhere when you stand on a button, this would be fine if the game wasn't adamant about recording the amount of deaths it takes to beat the level, having cheap one-time deaths defeats that purpose.\nDue to the game having physics it's pretty easy to cheese some levels by glitching cubes into places or moving into places that don't feel intended.\nI had to play with the SFX Music muted because the cubes would make a horrendous noise when they are placed upon the circular pads (check my video for an example).\n\n[b]What are some positives?[/b]\nBackground Music is gorgeous and fits really well.\nLevels provide some real difficult challenges.\nFunny Dialogue between levels.\n\n[b]Closing Thoughts:[/b]\nI can't reccomend this game at full price if you are looking for a singleplayer puzzle game, I'd reccomend you wait for it to go on sale.\n\nWant to hear my full thoughts on this title?

It makes for a fun, rage-inducing puzzle game whereby a ton of shouting is involved . However, if you like puzzle games on thier own and you have a quieter friend to play with, the 1-2 player mode is a calmer, nicer distraction with added value through the mode-exclusive voice acting. The voice acting here is done by Mick Lauer AKA RIcePirate - an animator and voice actor on Youtube. The voice acting and writing itself isn't Portal level but it is solid. The music in this game is also great. Techno beats add tension to the game and make everythine come alive. This is all wrapped up in plenty of levels which range nicely in difficulty as you start with easy puzzles but move quickly to more and more challenging ones later on. What makes the game so rage inducing in co-op mode is getting everyone on the same page to move to the objective perfectly. Communication is required as some players cannot do everything on thier own. Overall it makes for a fun night.\n\n\nIf you enjoy puzzle games on their own and you also want a nice game to break out to incite hatred (the good kind) among your friends; this is worth the 20$. However, if you already have a stack of co-op local multiplayer games and don't care for the single player puzzle solving aspect; i'd wait for a price drop.\n\nIf you want more information I made a video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyMSIk4v5_U", "timestamp_created": 1494188413, "timestamp_updated": 1494188413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426978", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31384721": {"recommendationid": "31384721", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969364344", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503731813}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game designed for 2 or 4 players, but can also be played with 1 or 3.

Some of the puzzles aren't so bad to solve, but actually coordinating as a team can be tricky. I enjoy the challenge of having to control two myself (and they don't usually move at the same time), but that's not for everyone. I'd say most people would likely prefer even numbers of players.\n\nAnyway, this is, for me, the same kind of fun that Magicka is. Sorta slapsticky.

If you have a partner who doesn't know what they're doing, it could lead to some arguments.

It can be played solo or cooperatively with both methods of play working smoothly and satisfyingly. It stands well above the average when it comes to indie puzzle games and features a big chunk of content, challenging but not unfair difficulty, and even a surprisngly well voice-acted narration that injects humour and personality into the game.\n\nThe aim of the game is to coordinate and move both cubes safely to the end, but obstacles and tricky environments can make that a challenging task.\n\nThe game offers:\n\n80 x 'story levels' (can be played solo or local coop)\n40 x 'party levels' (intended for 2 to 4 players - but all content is possible solo, if you can coordinate)\n10 x '2-player experiments'\n10 x '4-player experiments'\n\nDeath Squared controls well, I plugged in a controller and controlled one cube using the left joystick and one with the right joystick. You could alternatively use 'wasd' and 'arrow keys' to control the cubes. I also played coop where I used the controller and my partner the keyboard, although you could share a keyboard if you like, every method works.\n\nThe puzzles are also satisfying, not so difficult they made me rage but definitely challenging. Death Squared tested the player not just in their wit and puzzle solving abilities, but also in their coordination, cooperation (if played with a partner) and memory. I will say that the puzzles will often be solved using trial-and-error which isn't inheriently a bad thing, but was sometimes less satisfying because of it.\n\nThe game also had a tonne of personality (think Portal) which helped to seperate it from its sometimes more clinical competition. One of the few criticisms I had of the game was the inability to access the options menu from the pause screen, needing to instead back out to the main menu. The options also didn't include subtitles which I would have liked to ensure I didn't mishear any of the dialogue, although there are potentially hearing impaired players out there who this will be an even bigger issue for - I'm hoping they patch that in.\n\nUlimately a fun experience though. If you like puzzle games you will like Death Squared. Coop always makes things more fun and only adds to this experience. It's the perfect entry game for a friend, partner, or family member who isn't usually into gaming to jump in with you.\n\n* For a more detailed review visit http://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2017/03/death-squared/", "timestamp_created": 1489488410, "timestamp_updated": 1489488410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560986", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30502023": {"recommendationid": "30502023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027512498", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489301114}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny puzzle game that anyone can pick up and play.

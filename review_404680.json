Oq deveria ser de entendimento geral passa ser um conte\u00fado enigm\u00e1tico, for\u00e7ando o player a elaborar diversas teorias sobre oq de fato aconteceu no mundo mecanizado\n- O Jogo tr\u00e1s diversas ame\u00e7as e inimigos bem diferentes, al\u00e9m disso o mapa \u00e9 bastante trai\u00e7oero. \u00c9 um ponto positivo, pois n deixa o game mon\u00f3tomo e clich\u00eb\n\nPontos negativos.\n- Achei o sistema de lutas um ponto fraco no jogo, \u00e9 bastante confuso e f\u00e1cilmente burlado caso voc\u00eb fique spamando rolamento. No \u00ednicio \u00e9 um pouco complicado, principalmente pra quem joga pelo teclado, mas posteriormente fica bem f\u00e1cil e pouco desafiador. \n- Outro ponto falho no jogo \u00e9 a posi\u00e7\u00e4o da c\u00e4mera, muitas vezes dificultando na gameplay. Voc\u00eb n tem controle nenhum sobre ela. Em alguns momentos, principalmente nas partes de explorar o mapa faz uma falta tremenda.\n\nRecomenda\u00e7\u00f6es\n- Se voc\u00eb possuir um controle recomendo vc usar, o jogo pelo teclado \u00e9 complicado. Em certos momentos o jogador precisa tirar a m\u00e4o do mouse para realizar comandos pelo teclado (Nada que prejudique a gameplay, mas \u00e9 uma dica v\u00e1lida)\n- Explore o mapa com calma, n\u00e4o se afobe em terminar logo o jogo, pois muito provavelmente voc\u00eb deixar\u00e1 passar locais que possuem cristais, fragmentos e habilidades que ir\u00e4o te ajudar no decorrer do game, principalmente no final dele. \n", "timestamp_created": 1521690822, "timestamp_updated": 1521690822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40963215": {"recommendationid": "40963215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113324672", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 106, "last_played": 1521668319}, "language": "german", "review": "Hob ist ein wirklich sehr sch\u00f6nes Singleplayer-Spiel. \nIch kann es nur jedem weiterempfehlen, der auf Atmosph\u00e4rische und gem\u00fctliche Puzzlegames steht.", "timestamp_created": 1521664835, "timestamp_updated": 1521664835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40937730": {"recommendationid": "40937730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043658142", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1521550047}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uae38\ucc3e\ub2e4 \uc878\uc558\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1521550646, "timestamp_updated": 1521550646, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40927778": {"recommendationid": "40927778", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972276575", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "last_played": 1521494177}, "language": "english", "review": "My first hour of this game consisted of the following:\n\n1.

Game freezing, looks like it wanted to play a cutscene and took away controls, didn't do anything and didn't give them back. Alt-F4 to quit, then continue from checkpoint.\n \n7. Getting stuck in scenery after jumping into what subsequently turned out to be a character switching pod thing that didn't trigger it's screen for some reason. Unable to get out. Restart from checkpoint.\n\n8. Running around aimlessly, backtracking, trying everything I can think of working out what to do.\n\n9. Eventually working out that there was some destructable scenery. Going down a few grass ladders. Progress at last!\n\n10. Again having no idea what to do. Character can sit on edge of mountain and admire scenery, so have obviously got somewhere important, but it seems to be a dead end. \n\n11.

The story is not told through dialogue but through exploration and discovery. \n\nThe performance was decent enough for me, although I have heard people saying that it crashes a lot, I did not have that experience but did have an occassional crash but nothing for me to get upset about.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1] I do not have a lot to say about the story, as it is best experienced as intended, you following metaphorical breadcrumbs from area to area, changing the landscape as you go, unlocking new powers and upgrades. Everything in this aspect is best done through your own exploration and discovery of the environment you find yourself in, so I shall say no more.\n\n[h1]Issues:[/h1] The biggest drawback of Hob for me, is that if you spend your time with the game in small parts, of maybe only an hour or so at a time, then can not play again for about a week, you forget where you were, what you were doing and where you have been.\nIn fact, that last point is my most negative issue of my experience with the game, I played for an hour or so once or if I have the time, twice per week and then when I make some time for it again, I have forgotten what I was doing when I went back in, then had to try to retrace my steps and try my best to recall what I was about to do.\n[i]However, I do realise that is mostly down to me, not the game itself. I just say this to suggest that when you play, you play for longer perioods of time than I did, if that is possible.[/i]\n\n[h1]Additional:[/h1] The more of the map you unlock, will eventually have you feeling like you are going the wrong way at times regardless of how long you have played. I think this is inevitable due to the nature of the game.\n\n[h1]Summary:[/h1] Hob is a really good game, it has so much going for it, cutesy characters, it is colourful, family friendly, interesting premise, endearing, charming and most importantly, it is [b]extremely satisfying,[/b] as you approach a newly discovered mechanism to then manipulate the world around you, changing the landscape by mostly unseen mechanisms underground, which leads to unlocking new areas, for you to continue to explore.\n\n[b]Gameplay: 7/10[/b]\n[b]Performance: 7/10[/b]\n[b]Engagement: 8/10[/b]\n[h1]Overall Score: 7/10, Buy It.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1521197023, "timestamp_updated": 1521197566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619892", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40827984": {"recommendationid": "40827984", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976784085", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 745, "last_played": 1521117224}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous grahics, beautiful soundtrack and a nice mixture of light combat and puzzle platformer gameplay. Possibly the closest thing to Zelda available on PC. Unfortunately, the tedious backtracking choked out all the fun for me in the end. I played it for about 14 hours, out of which I spent the last 3 hours zig-zagging across the map, backtracking and trying to find out what to do next.\n\nIn some cases, the level design even makes this problem worse. More than one time, I found myself swimming through some lake or river which had exactly two spots at which you could enter the shore, even though the rest of the shoreline was just as low. This can make for some serious frustration comined with the autosave function. You spend two minutes paddling through the lake, one more minute running around the rest of the lake, entering battle , being killed - and repeat the whole thing again to get back to where you were killed. Had some similar jump & run sections as well. Sou you better prepare yourself for a LOT of backtracking in this game.\n\nThe fact that there's no speech at all in the game really adds to the overall mysterious atmosphere. Unfortunately, combined with the open-world gameplay, it leaves you clueless what to do next a lot of the time. I definitely would NOT recommend playing this without keeping a walkthrough at hand, unless you're ready to be seriously frustrated. You may well find yourself cluelessly running around the (huge) map for hours simply because you overlooked a crack in a wall.\n\nAlso, the lack of speech in combination with a gameplay relying heavily on backtracking may make the world seem a tad lifeless after a while, even though there's quite a number of adorable creatures in it and the fauna is simply gorgeous to look at. Still, due to all the tracing your own steps back all the time, it feels quite a bit like a walking simulator after a while.\n\nSo, even though I fell in love with it's stunning looks and mysterious, fairy-tale atmosphere at first, it really grew stale after a while and I just couldn't bring myself to finish it, because I learned that that would mean hours and hours of more backtracking and revisiting places I had been to a dozen times before again. \n\nIt's a shame. Given a more balanced gameplay and mission-tracking or hint system and some kind of discernable back story, Hob could have been a cult classic on PC, because there's not too much like it in terms of atmosphere. But given it is the way it is now, it simply feels unfinished and dull.", "timestamp_created": 1521118323, "timestamp_updated": 1521118323, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40825996": {"recommendationid": "40825996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283244929", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520173678}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0443 \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a Torchlight I \u0438 II, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0438\u0445 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043b \u0432 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0443\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0438, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0432\u043e\u0442 -

The big kicker is that there is no talking in the game whatsoever; aside from a few button prompts to teach you how to use certain abilities, you must learn everything about the world through expressions, with a few characters talking unintelligibly to you. This is actually done really well, as much of the story is shown well enough to interpret who everybody is relative to each other, where they came from, and how they matter in the present, while leaving enough open to question if you're doing the right thing.\n\nGameplay revolves around exploring the environment through platforming, as well as smacking around some baddies with your proto sword thingee, along with a bag of tricks to give you an edge in both. Movement is very fluid and skill based, so if you screw something up, its 100% your fault. I did have a few issues with the platforming, as the Hob faced the wrong way when angling a jump, but if you pay attention and don't just rush your jumps, you'll be fine. As for fighting, the big problem is that the enemies don't seem to scale up to being terribly powerful. On a regular run trying to find everything including health pick ups, combat was rarely difficult and there are very few boss type battles to change it up, which is a bit of a shame, although doing a run of no health upgrades will definitely be a challenge as enemy damage seems to be scaled around the idea that you will use them to increase your health quickly.\n\nOverall, Hob is a good game that is beautiful to visit, with emphasis on exploring the beauties of nature and horrors of the plague-y menace corrupting the land, with both the story and combat taking a back seat (the former of which is a bit of a shame as the mechanics are solid, there just isn't enough big baddies to use them on).", "timestamp_created": 1520306156, "timestamp_updated": 1520306156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508140", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40596816": {"recommendationid": "40596816", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983819001", "num_games_owned": 1117, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520295447}, "language": "english", "review": "Hob was really fun to play.

I watched a single video on it and thought it would be up my alley.\n\nI think the art style is awesome and has a very nice aesthetic. One of my favourite things about the game was the art style and how the world all fit together like a big 3D jigsaw puzzle.\n\nThe story is pretty basic, but I think the protagonist and his mechanical friend have character and make you want to find out what's going on in the game world. Combat mechanics are responsive and don't feel cheap or flawed or anything like that I died a decent amount on hard difficulty but it was always completely my fault, not due to slow or clunky combat or anything like that.\n\nIt took me 10 hours to play through. I didn't get every little thing to upgrade everything possible but I think I was pretty close to doing so. So if you're one of those 100% kind of people then maybe it would be around 12-15 hours?\n\nI picked it up for I think just over $11 CAD and I think it is worth that price.

If you're a fan of puzzle platformers and generally can find your own way around (which is partially what this game makes you do, with some small direction) then you'll love this.\n\nKeyboard and Mouse is definitely not a good direction to go, controller as is suggested will get you everywhere. The graphics are nice, some odd texture glitches happen in places from time to time but nothing major. The game takes as many chances as possible to show you the nicely crafted elements and how pretty the world is (if you care about that sort of thing). Everything pretty much explains itself and does it well, for those who can catch on quickly. The game has a launcher on startup that lets you tweak settings before starting everything up instead of having to wait for the game to fully launch and then having to close it just to apply the updated settings, which is a nice change. \n\nFound out recently that the Devs- Runic games, went out of business a few months back (hey I don't pay attention to that so whatever) so the game won't recieve any further support unless they sell it to another company (would be nice, it is definitely a fun game). In the hours I've played I've experienced a fair few bugs and glitches since they were only able to pump the game out and then a month or so later PW kicked them to the curb because...???...P2P profit. However the game is completeable and none of the glitches or bugs I've seen have been game breaking. At most I've seen enemy character models with no collision in T-pose (once) and had the game crash 2 times, once 13 minutes in the first time I tried to play, and numerous odd gravity hitches when you jump to a spot you shouldn't be able to stand. Those kind of things could easily be fixed and hell, they even have (on crash) a bug report thing that pops up however, since they're dead in the water what good that'll do... yeah.\n\nSo I would recommend this game, though as it sits now and because as far as I know no one has yet to even mention picking this game up- wait on a sale pick it up and enjoy....unless you need direct guidance to every aspect in a game to complete it at which point I'll just say look elsewhere cause this is just distilled frustration for you.\n\nHoping this turns into one of those little hidden gems of a game that people sorely want a sequel to...as long as the sequel isn't some kickstarted crapchute that is.", "timestamp_created": 1519806413, "timestamp_updated": 1520073736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40450642": {"recommendationid": "40450642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075737198", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520046551}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a puzzle game alright, a very confusing but simple at that puzzle game, not so in your face on \"HOW TO PLAY\" stuff but nearly great on self learning, like an old school video game's tutorial (Nearly NON-Existent), and the story...

It does a fantastic job in steering where the player has to go and what comes next, just based on visual clues. Which is necessary as there is no real dialogue or text. The characters communicate more with gestures and sounds. If you played a Dark Souls, there will be some familiarity in terms of discovering and advancing in new areas and unlocking shortcuts that allow you to navigate the world faster. Exploring the world is awarded by unlocking new skills and weapon upgrades, which one can buy with orbs collected for example from defeating enemies. You also find new tools that allow you to access new areas and give you more options during combat, like in a metroid or a zelda, but not as deeply integrated. \n\nCons:\nUnfortunately  the game is not without fault. The fixed camera angles can become frustrating at times, especially during jumping passages or some enemy enconters. Also during some camera expositions when unlocking a new area the fps can drop signifcantly, but as far as I noticed it stays stable during normal gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1517748345,

1517683171}, "language": "english", "review": "Hob is an easy-going, colorful, stylish, 3D action-adventure platformer with mechanically strong roots from games released the mid 1990's to early 2000's. \n\nImmediately, the bright flat colors of the organic-mechanical design captures the eye. Trees look to be made of manufactured tubes, the ground rises high in sharp angular plateaus, and even the grass is squared off at the top. While the world has many artificial signs, it is this planet's nature nonetheless and brims with organic life that feeds, vocalizes, and populate the world. However it becomes clear that this artificial garden is under threat from a purple ooze-like substance that has colonized large swaths of the world. As the protagonist,  you are tasked early on in the game to rid it and aid in the world's completion, where much of it stowed underground. The game is also pleasantly seamless- there are no gates that lock you in a gauntlet or bosses that you must fight. You are fairly free to travel the place once you get the three pieces of equipment required to traverse the land. You also get to hug and pet animals. But remember; you can only pet certain animals. Otherwise you may find yourself slicing them down. (I learn this the hard way...)\n\nThe game's audio is clear and crisp, complete with ringing sword swings, grass rustling, animal bugling, and that satisfying \u201cclop\u201d sound when the protagonist falls and lands from a high cliff. It all fits together nicely. The music is atmospheric- playing in and out appropriately, but always sticks to the background.\n\nWhile the game is advertised as a \u201cwordless narrative\u201d this is false. While we can't understand the alien languages of the inhabitants, they do speak and gesture intelligently and the protagonist comprehends them. Its also clear that while you the player are in the dark concerning the particulars in the world, the protagonist is not and shows at least some awareness of what the world is about.\n\nThe game does have a bit of backstory not presented in the game or steam page and I found this to be a detriment to the presentation. There is a five page comic that can be found on the product's web page. This clears up a bit of the nature concerning the creature that finds the protagonist in the beginning. I wish this comic was either placed in the game or adapted to the game itself, as I didn't know of it until writing this review...after playing the game. You can find the comic here: https://www.runicgames.com/hob/comic/. There are narrative elements the development team thought were important to convey when advertising the product, but not in the product itself. Personally I only watched some footage on Youtube before purchasing- one with no text, so idea of  \u201cmake it home\u201d or how the robotic creature you first meet saw \u201cothers try and fail\u201d. As a marketer and developer, you shouldn't stash certain elements in adverts you hope the player watches before playing, as they can be swayed to buy via a friend's recommendation, an online video not produced by the team, or reading about it.\n\nMechanically Hob is solid with a few hiccups. First and foremost exploring can be a bit rough namely because of the locked camera. And I mention it first because exploration it is the number one thing you do in this game- more so than combat. Personally, there were a few times I just had to force myself to look up a walkthrough only to find I was in the area but passed the sticking path ten times because of how the camera was centered. But I could have easily seen it if I could rotate the viewing. Uhg. I'm all for discovering secrets, but players shouldn't have to scan the screen just to progress.\n\nThere is also the matter of upgrades, a lot are padded out in order to obtain them. First, you have to find an upgrade like more damage to your fist attacks or a better dodge. Then you have to have enough money to purchase (or craft as its referred to in game), and you can only purchase the upgrade at one spot at the south central area of the map. Much of the \u201csecrets\u201d you find are just money caches and many of the upgrades bounce between play style defining to faint improvements with nothing in between. The shield is great and game changing, but the \u201cbetter dodge\u201d, \u201cmore health packs\u201d and \u201cmore powerful fist\u201d didn't feel any different from the default. Sure you can use tubes scattered about to warp  to the shop, but I feel buying could have been done from the pause screen and saved in the numbing back tracking. But the whole \u201cfind than buy\u201d system also feels...odd. Like they had a crafting system with different materials, but it had to be scrapped late in development. The cloaks, the secretest of the secrets, are all underwhelming. The intent seems like they were made to be play style choices at the expense of other resources (health/energy) but the impact is minimal. I didn't feel much faster in the green one,  and I had enough health and energy by the time I found the others. They are also expensive to buy, and require a special currency tucked away in secret areas to purchase. Due to the laid back feeling of the game, they could have easily been a straight upgrade you choose without the \u201cgive and take\u201d mentality. Default for life.\n\nHowever the areas are fun to explore and the whole idea of land masses rising from the abyss is fantastic. Many of the puzzles are simple block pushing, \u201clock and key\u201d styled obstacles as well as lever pushing/button pressing to get the next area. Nothing too strenuous or brain wracking, which gives the game an auto pilot feel.\n\nCombat is second stage to exploring, but it is fluid and fun. Though there are few enemy types, but they come in several forms sporting various defenses in which you have to use your tools to defeat them. This helps keep combat fresh. You are also free to retreat as you please and never caged to fight a gauntlet of baddies. The major enemies do not respawn, making back tracking less painful. Combat is on the easy side and I recommend anyone who has played other 3D platformers to dial up the challenge to at least hard early in the game. The creatures don't get more health/damage (to my knowledge) but become more aggressive and their attacks have less lag in them. This is my favorite type of challenge setting as it requires a player to think on their toes rather than just hit the enemies more.\n\nIf you've been hankering to play another action-adventure like Brave Fencer Mushashi, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, or the Legend of Zelda series, Hob reaches for such goals, but never quite grasps it. It just doesn't have anything that makes it own and stand out. Behind the sleek coat of paint is a fairly bog standard game. If you're new to the whole 3D action adventure genre, Hob is an decent first game- its got the core of what makes an action-adventure game and it's easy to pick up and play. If you're looking for challenge, either in the puzzle department or in combat Hob won't sate your hunger for something difficult or brain teasing. It also has little replay value, lest you want to discover 100% of the caches and items. Not a terrible game, just nothing to get a player invested in it.", "timestamp_created": 1517692031, "timestamp_updated": 1517692031, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526003", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39820535": {"recommendationid": "39820535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212656739", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517699522}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519 PC\u6ca1\u6709\u585e\u5c14\u8fbe \u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51d1\u5408\u4e00\u4e0b  \u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u770b\u89c1\u5546\u5e97\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u97f3 \u8fd8\u633a\u9ad8\u5174 \u7ed3\u679cTM\u4e00\u5c40\u5bf9\u767d\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u6709 \u5341\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173 \u5dee\u70b9\u5168\u6536\u96c6 \u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519 \u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u96be", "timestamp_created": 1517677356, "timestamp_updated": 1517699683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39818613": {"recommendationid": "39818613", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985660408", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518361864}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really nice game.

We're not talking about a Triple A game for sure, but Hob does its job. What stood out for me was its simplicity: Hob doesn't have a complicated story, doesn't have super graphics, but kept me playin for several consecutive hours. It has a perfect balance between of hack-n-slash parts (not too many tbh) and platform parts, both mixed up with wonderful sounds and melodies. For what concerns the gameplay, Hob seemed quite fluent to me: i didn't encounter too many bugs or glitches (probably 2 or 3, one of which made me basically die inside a wall), and most of the time i was able to escape everytime i was about to somehow get stuck. It's not a challenging game at all: i played the whole game at the highest difficulty and foes didn't cause too much trouble, mostly because of Hob's dodging and especially for his \"stunning teleport\" skill (seemed quite OP to me), and also because they all have the same range of attack moves, so that they become quite predictable once u get used to them.\nEven if there are no dialogues at all between the characters, it's pretty easy to understand what to do, and even the map it's very accurate. Because of the complete absence of dialogues, i didn't understand at all what was the spider-lady saying, so that when it came to decide if join her or fight her i ended up choosing both things (first fight, then join) without any clue but just to get both achievements. I'll go for a 7/10.\n\nPROS\n- Addictive\n- Platform & Hack-n-Slash balanced\n- Background music & sounds\n\n\nCONS\n- Not challenging (even at high difficulty)\n- No dialogues\n\n\nIf you've got some extra money go get Hob, for its price i think it's worth.", "timestamp_created": 1517617831, "timestamp_updated": 1517617831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39802232": {"recommendationid": "39802232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405529936", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1521412167}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uae38\ucc3e\uae30 \uc694\ub839\ub9cc \uc54c\uba74 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1517613071, "timestamp_updated": 1519684450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39801241": {"recommendationid": "39801241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013136571", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517594080}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9019\u500b\u904a\u6232\u516c\u53f8\u7e3d\u662f\u80fd\u8b93\u73a9\u5bb6\u56de\u60f3\u8d77\u521d\u6b21\u63a5\u89f8\u8a72\u985e\u904a\u6232\u7684\u611f\u52d5\u3002\n\n\u5728\u9019\u500b\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c92\u6709\u6eff\u756b\u9762\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u6c92\u6709\u6eff\u756b\u9762\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u9023\u904a\u6232\u6559\u5b78\u90fd\u6c92\u6709\uff0c\u50c5\u50c5\u662f\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6c92\u4eba\u807d\u5f97\u61c2\u7684\u7c21\u55ae\u5c0d\u8a71\uff0c\u9084\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u76f8\u8f03\u65bc\u4e3b\u89d2\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b97\u5c0f\u7684\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u5f88\u96e3\u8aaa\u4ed6\u4e0d\u597d\u73a9\uff01\u9019\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u958b\u653e\u4e16\u754c + \u52d5\u4f5c + \u89e3\u8b0e\uff1b\u8f14\u4ee5\u512a\u79c0\u7684\u97f3\u6a02\u3001\u97f3\u6548\u3001\u904b\u93e1\u624b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c07\u4e00\u4efd\u5fc3\u610f\uff0c\u5448\u5230\u73a9\u5bb6\u773c\u524d\u3002\n\n2018 \u5e74\u7684\u73fe\u5728\uff0c\u9019\u9593\u516c\u53f8\u5f88\u53ef\u60dc\u5730\u6d88\u901d\u65bc\u5e02\u5834\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u672a\u4f86\u9084\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u770b\u5230\u9019\u6a23\u7528\u5fc3\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\n\n\u512a\u9ede\uff1a\n    \uff0e\u4e0d\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u4e0d\u50cf\u8a31\u591a\u4f5c\u54c1\u5728 n \u7a2e\u72c0\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u5404\u529f\u80fd\u9375\u5c0d\u61c9\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u90fd\u6709\u8b8a\u5316\n    \uff0e\u512a\u79c0\u7684\u904a\u6232\u7bc0\u594f\uff0c\u660e\u986f\u662f\u7d93\u904e\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u666f\u9ede\u8207\u97f3\u6a02\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8b93\u73a9\u5bb6\u653e\u9b06\u4e00\u6703\uff1b\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7bc0\u594f\u4e5f\u76f8\u7576\u4e0d\u932f\n    \uff0e\u9069\u4e2d\u7684\u96e3\u5ea6\uff0c\u8f15\u4e2d\u91cd\u578b\u73a9\u5bb6\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6240\u6eff\u8db3\uff0c\u5404\u5f0f\u7dda\u7d22\u4e5f\u4e0d\u81f3\u65bc\u904e\u5ea6\u5201\u96e3\n    \uff0e\u5834\u666f\u8a2d\u8a08\u6975\u70ba\u51fa\u8272\n\n\u7f3a\u9ede\uff1a\n    \uff0e\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5730\u9ede\uff0c\u8df3\u8e8d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u76f4\u89ba\n    \uff0e\u500b\u4eba\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u597d\u5947\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u8aaa\u4ec0\u9ebcXD\n", "timestamp_created": 1517609821, "timestamp_updated": 1517609821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39800742": {"recommendationid": "39800742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112167329", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517609403}, "language": "french", "review": "Sur les trailers, \u00e7a a l'air beau, mais finalement les graphismes sont trop peu d\u00e9taill\u00e9s m\u00eame en haute r\u00e9solution, et la cin\u00e9matique d'intro tourne \u00e0 2 fps m\u00eame en r\u00e9solution minimale.

"english", "review": "Before I write this I want to say I have never written a review on steam and likely won't do so again after this, but I simply feel that I have to turn others away from this game because it is a huge disappointment. And I really wanted to like this game too--going in I was sure I would. I love these types of zelda/metroidvania-type action games, the the beautiful looking (at the time) art direction was just icing on the cake. Honestly I feel this game could have been brilliant if not for: \n\n1. Some really, really stupid design desisions: the most annoying of which being that falling from any slight elevation instantly kills you with a out-of-place-in-this-game explosion of blood (I was at the point where I was often very unsure if it was actually safe to just drop down from any distance at all).  The game itself is also ludicrously linear, even though it had no real reason to be--you are forced to explore each area in a set order, I really don't know why they chose to make it that way as the sections of the map seem like they could have easily been more open to give a little bit of choice to the player, but what do I know.\n\nAND 2. The game is insanely pretentious and full of itself when it really has right to be. It says 'wordless narrative' in its description but honestly its just 'wordless' without the narrative. It's fine to have no text, dialogue, etc. (hyper light drifter did it great), but if you do that you have SHOW the story instead, which this game just doesn't do. It often feels like the character your controlling is just doing things, flipping switches, turning stuff on, putting stuff together, etc. with no real reason behind why or what doing those things even accomplish, even the direct consequences of some of the things you do in the game aren't very clear or apparent, which makes 'puzzle-solving' a real nightmare (and by 'puzzle-solving' I mean do this, go there, turn this knob, push this button, etc., etc. with no actual brainwork involved). \n\nHow far up its own ass is this game? It loves to give you contant wide angles to show off its environments for some reason, even though they aren't all that beautiful or impressive and all look extremely similar (so much so its very easy to get lost because everything looks the same). These wide shots happen so often, and camera sweeps over them so slowly you often can't see what the character is actually doing before they're already dead. The final pretentious straw though was that I thought I found an awesome secrete item, or treasure room or something based on this huge epic lead up it gave me. Turns out it was a 'Lore Room.' What's a 'Lore Room.' A room with a wall that has glowing shapes on it that is apparently supposed to tell some kind of story. Nothing else in that room either, no item, no currency, nothing. The game decided its 'lore' was such a great reward for the player's exploration all by itself they didn't need to anything else to be there. Yeah... all I have I'm a storyboard artist for a living, I know how to tell a story visually and what works and what doesn't. This game doesn't. It doesn't work on a gameplay level, and it doesn't work on narrative level. I feel it could have worked, but was held back by the designers feeling what they had was already so perfect and incredible they didn't need to change anything.

It's not without it's problems but I found the overall experience a pretty fun and engaging one. My first session with the game I ended up losing about 5hrs just exploring different parts of the world. The creatures and characters throughout the game are interesting enough. The fighting is pretty good enemies telegraph attacks mostly. You have different ways you can fight an enemy. You can also play the game by avoiding nearly all fights. \n\nHob rewards exploration as you find alternative paths that lead to bonuses. Most puzzles in the game are relatively easy to get through/understand. I enjoyed just being able to run around and explore some areas which defintely lengthened the game for me. It's relatively short however if you take your time to explore you find extra puzzles and see more of the world the developers have built.\n\n\nProblems with the game:\n\n- Sometimes your character doesn't land quite right. This might mean death or you fall into an unescapable spot. This is when you need to use the respawn feature. Platforming in general is alright it's just a few times it doesn't feelt quite right. This leads to more deaths than expected.\n- Camera angles can sometimes switch awkwardly. As they switch from one fixed angle to another as you run between them. Suddenly your characters moves differently to where you expect as the camera angle affects your movement. This caused me to run off to my death in a puzzle dungeon. This also suddenly had me respawn near the end of that dungeon.\n- Fighting can be finicky. The lock on feature seems to disable your ability to do a dash attack. Some enemies can be a slog to fight as there is no way to tell how close you are to defeating an enemy. Locking on is awful against group attacks most of the time. \n- Sound bugs sometimes appear with certain enemies. Killed in a certain way the bombers death sound is stuck on that spot on repeat. you'll even hear it trail off as you run away. You can reset that by transitioning to a new area. The flying bug swarm sound sometimes just hovers in a place. There's also a flying bug nest where the sound just bugs out and stays there even after you destroy it.\n- Check points don't always register your arrival. Some are stuck being up all the time. This affected me only a few times throughout the game. I would just die and then have to back track a little more than expected. Check points aren't exactly hard saves either. So sometimes you might need to back track to get anything that didn't register in the save.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good platformer to play on your PC. Some of these problems go away if you just take your time more with the game. Such as the camera angle transition.

There was so much more to this game than I was expecting. Beautiful character design, an open expanding world to explore, numerous enemies to defeat and different strategies for different play styles. The overal design and thought put into this world was phenomenal. The music is incredible and drastically improves the experience. I love all the different noises that the different creatures make. This game was really well though out down to the tiniest little details.This game has a plot that is up to you to interpret, with no text, no language, just some body positioning to show emotion and music. Its an original story that you get to explore through a breath of different enviroments. There really was no shortage of imagination in this game. \n\nWhat I did not like:\n- The fixed camera. Not being able to reposition this camera meant that some pathways with gaps you have to jump were unneccessarily difficult. Instead of enjoying the natural flow of the game you become stuck and endlessly frustrated. Being able to slighly turn the camera angle, even just slighly, wouldve drastically improved this experience. \n-The warp pads. I do like the warp pads. They have great design and add to quite a number of the puzzles. They are buggy though. Often id endup landing right off the landing pad over the edge and have to climb the path back to where ever it was. Holding down the warp button to long often ended up in double warping right back to where i started. This was a minor thing that I can easily overlook but it just made my play though experience that much more frustrating.\n\nEven with this two pretty minor things frustrating me at times I still loved this game. I will definelty be giving it a replay at some point in the future. I leave this game completley satisfied. It was fun to play and has an original story. I cannot highly reccomend this enough.

I really like the visuals and the progressive difficulty. Also most things have one or more uses, meaning that nothing is \"just a collectable.\"\n\n\nWhat the game does well:\n- The visuals\nThe game is very pretty, and the artstyle is amazing. Every area have a certain distinct feature to it and every enemy can be identified with ease.\n- Great puzzles\nThis should be a MUST for puzzle games, but sadly a lot seem to miss the point of a good puzzle. Hob doesn't do this. Every puzzle opens a number of new things to do. Get more currency, new gear or just progress in the story.\n- The story.\nWhile the story is made to be without words, making you interprit the story as you play through the game, it is quite taunting. Something happened and along the main questline it's your job to figure it out with your golem friend.\n\nWhat the game fails with:\n-The camera\nThis is my main concern with the game. The camera is locked in a certain angle, that changes depending on where your currently at. This means that you sometimes need to calculate which angle to jump at, or have faith that you are actually going toi make that jump that is kinda blending into the background. It's not impossible to play around, but very annoying.\n- The fighting.\nIt's a puzzle game, but a great deal of the time you're running around killing enemies. Whilst it isn't a bad combat system, it becomes annoying to have to fight more enemies right after the last group. Or having to handle 4-5 enemies before finishing the puzzle.\n- Perfect jumps amd stupid platforms.\nSome jumps needs you to stay at the absolute max of the edge or platform. This would be good, just not when the jump is diagonal to the camera, and you can't see how close to actually are the falling to your death.

People will probably site Zelda as the game's biggest inspiration, and this is probably. The puzzles, combat and general experience of the game all feel very much like a classic Zelda game. \n\nHowever, Hob isn't just an homage to a bygone era of gaming. It manages to establish it's own character, entirely separate from any inspirations the developers may have had. This is primarily achieved through top-notch level design that consistently astounds you as you progress through a world with familiar themes, (e.g. good vs. evil, life vs. corruption) but outstanding character that you're certain to be less accustomed to.\n\nAt first, it seems that Hob will be a game that relies almost entirely on its puzzles and environment to maintain its players' attention till the end. But as you progress, you uncover an intriguing and deliberately ambiguous story that spurs you on, as if both you and the protagonist are itching to know the next part of the plot. The game also has a surprisingly fleshed out and well developed combat system that offers players multiple styles of attacks to take down the various enemies they encounter. Monster variety is decent and hits on most of the typical archetypes you'd expect in a game like this whilst tying combat in neatly with some of the mechanics you progressively learn organically.\n\nOverall, Hob is a game I'd highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed games like Zelda in the past and has felt like contemporary gaming has left this genre behind. It's a fantastic showcase of the genres potential to provide enthralling experiences through traditional game design. And for the low price tag, it's definitely worth it for approximately 10-15hrs of quality gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1517142554, "timestamp_updated": 1517142554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39677616": {"recommendationid": "39677616", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965359651", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518166900}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the puzzle liked metroidvania styled environment that evolves as you play the game and how you interact with about everything in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1517133280, "timestamp_updated": 1517133280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39677314": {"recommendationid": "39677314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153367248", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516710000}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean im not fan of this kind of games that doesnt explain what am i doing or what should i do but even though this game doesnt do that you kind of understand it pretty well.And nope i didnt like the soundtracks after a while with soundtracks and all game gets more frustrating but i like the main character and all world make sure to check out ^^", "timestamp_created": 1517132406, "timestamp_updated": 1517132406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39669114": {"recommendationid": "39669114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073953167", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517098991}, "language": "english", "review": "This isn't a bad game, but I can't really recommend it.

And the mechanics on the grappling beam you get later are a bit wonky and killed me several times.\n\nIt is not an open world and is pretty linear.  It is about average for a metrovania.

Basic combat. Solid, yet shallow RPG elements. Plot is unfolded through non-verbal dialogue. The game is sentimental at times and and the environment \"appears\" complex. Solid 7/10.\n\nSubjective:\n\nGraphics and sounds are 10/10. Fluid and complex animations help tell the story and give the characters personality. The puzzles range from simplistic to annoying. At one point I spent 45 minutes looking for a place I hadn't been or a lever I hadn't pulled, only to remember that I could bash through the floor which opened and area that provided the solution to a puzzle- and then I never used that ability again for the rest of the game. This is an example of how obscure a couple of the solutions were. You can easily spend over an hour looking for a ladder that you missed. I was surprised and a little disappointed at how linear the game felt. You're presented with this incredible \"open world\". However, you're placed upon a path. Wonder off that path and you'll spend several minutes aimlessly flubbing about until you get back on the path and resolve the task at hand.\n\nThe Controls are solid and responsive. Combine this with the complex animations and your character feels \"alive\", much like Ori did in \"Ori and the Blind Forest\". One gripe that's synonymous with 3d platformers is the directional jumping and physics. The game will shift from manipulating your character from the player's perspective to the character's perspective totally on the fly. Run around on flat ground and the controls are intuitive. Grip a wall while viewing your character from a side perspective and you have to hold the controller left or right to get them to jump up to a ledge - hold up and jump and your character leaps to their side and falls to their death. It sucks and I died mostly from this. Also, Leaping from a spinning platform will send your character several degrees to the left or right causing you to miss your jump and fall to your death.\n\nGripes aside, the game is well worth the money. It's fun, intriguing, beautiful, creative and a little emotional at times. I love the world and all it's inhabitants.

I was surprised how good it was based on the early reviews, which made me put it off. Picked it up in a sale and could not be happier.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of Ico in places, in terms of there being a large, interconnected world where you often see other paths you've travelled, or yet to travel, in the background. The level design is superb, with how everything interconnects, and how the world connects and eventually opens up as you unlock abilities or modify the environment. Much of the game is about seeing a place and solving an environmental puzzle to get there. None of it is too hard, but some parts require some thought. I found it just right.\n\nCombat is pretty fun and gives you lots of moves to play with, more than you really need but you can try different things to keep things interesting.\n\nThe background music is great as well. I'm tempted to buy the soundtrack for once. It was great to have a nap to while the game was paused once!\n\nGraphics are really nice, unless you dislike the somewhat flat/cell-shaded style. I liked it, and the look of the game is nicely cohesive, while still giving different areas their own flavours.\n\nI ran it locked at 60 fps in 4k at ultra settings on a 1080ti, so if there were peformance problems, It seems they were fixed, or I got lucky. I played it quite a while after release. I think there was one area which had framerate issues for a few seconds, which wasn't a problem as you just walk through that spot. I had ONE crash, right at the start of the game after a cut-scene, and no problems otherwise, other than managing to jump through the world a couple of times while I was trying to find secrets. Not an issue as dying is not much of a setback in the game (unless going for the 5-deaths achievement).\n\nVery highly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1516592465, "timestamp_updated": 1516592465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39524986": {"recommendationid": "39524986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031001203", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516582531}, "language": "english", "review": "Games garbage, runic games needs to stick to rpg's because they cant make a proper, platforming adventure games, the controls are probably the worste aspect...

It illustrates this lesson forcefully just moments in, when the androgynous hero suffers an infection that quickly leads to an amputation, all for the crime of being distracted by a graceful giraffe-like creature and the stunning landscape surrounding them. A robotic golem comes to the rescue, gifting the hero its own arm, which includes a fist even Hellboy could appreciate.\n\nAnd does our hero sit around moping, having learned the world sometimes punishes the gentle-hearted? Not at all. They jump back into action almost immediately, using the new arm to punch, grapple, and warp the problems of the world into submission. That's kind of the story of my experience with Hob as a whole, as it kept drawing me back even though it occasionally treated me unfairly and left me confused.\n\nInteractions between characters are depicted with gestures rather than words.\n\nHob readily evokes the spirit of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, as its 10 or so hours involve solving a host of puzzles, whacking monsters with upgradeable swords, and finding health and energy upgrades stashed in the nooks and crannies of its beautiful world. But there's also a hint of Journey here, most obviously in the red hood with Batman ears worn by the protagonist. More importantly, though, Hob is a similarly voiceless adventure, depicting interactions between the few characters with emotion-laden gestures instead of words. Even the menus come off as puzzles in their own right, as they explain what items you've collected with symbols you must decipher on your own. The approach generally works so well that it's kind of jarring when text descriptions are used for the optional upgrades of the hero's rocky hand.\n\nTo be sure, the wordless approach allows for touching moments, as when your golem buddy releases a butterfly while our hero looks on in admiration. But it certainly doesn't work as well as it does in Journey, which is laser-focused on the clear goal of ascending a distant mountain. In Hob, it's never clear what you're doing or why. There's a vague sense that the purple, bulbous plague infecting the world must be stopped, but even that only seems to be the point of what you\u2019re doing some of the time. The lack of written objectives in this semi-open world also makes figuring where to go next a chore, especially in the early hours when your goals are merely pointed out with vague gestures from the charitable automaton.\n\nHob is more concerned with painting a picture than telling a story, and there's little doubt that it paints a lovely picture. Much of the joy of playing it comes from just admiring the brightly colored landscapes where nature and machinery intertwine so naturally that it's tough to tell where one ends and the other begins. Not content to merely give us pretty scenery, Hob serves up a land where the world itself is a puzzle so that, with the press of a button, the landscape alters itself in a way that rugged cliffs and plateaus leap up where there was only sky before. You'll find some of the most impressive sights above ground, but others hide under the surface in dungeons housing engines so massive they could probably serve as spare parts for the Death Star.\n\n\nPuzzles are never exactly complicated or even original.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are never exactly complicated or even original, being chiefly concerned with dragging and shuffling blocks or rotating gears. Even so, they're satisfying to complete, particularly when that final \"click\" triggers yet another reshuffling of the world, activating glowy turquoise lights and often creating new puzzles in the process. I found myself more fascinated by their elegant intricacy than their difficulty, admiring the ways I'd need to delve deep into the earth, rotate skyscraper-sized structures, and teleport like lightning over seemingly endless gaps all just to open a door.\n\nRespawn points are plentiful and loading screens are short.\n\nSometimes Hob tosses light platforming into the mix, too, but these are among its weakest moments. The artsy fixed-perspective camera often doesn't make it clear if the next jump is going to make you land safely or go hurtling off a ledge. Sometimes the camera will even get you killed, as it's a little overfond of not showing you what else is behind the ledge obscuring your character. Sometimes it's a thorny plant that slaps you to death; sometimes it's a big ogre with a club who paints the landscape red with your blood. It doesn't help that Hob suffers from substantial frame rate drops at times, which can cause trouble at the precise moment when you need clarity above all else. It's a good thing respawn points are plentiful and loading screens are short, as these moments threaten to ruin the whole experience.\n\nAnd yes, you'll do a little hacking and slashing. It's not a major part of Hob, though, and it's fun enough to make up for its relative simplicity. Armed with both the punchy arm and a sword that looks like a key, our hero faces off against everything from trolls who pelt you with explosive gas balls to nasty little minions who drop health-restoring apples after each kill. Combat itself is a fun mix of dodge rolling and slashing at the appropriate time or busting through shields with a meaty punch of the rocky hand. Sometimes, though, I found I had more fun when I didn't even attack the creatures directly, but rather fooled the reckless big guys into accidentally slaughtering their buddies in their drive to get to me.\n\nAll of these elements \u2013 the voiceless story, the satisfying if moderately challenging puzzles, the just-common-enough combat \u2013 combine to create a Zen-like experience that's wonderful so long as you stay focused on the moment and not on where it's heading or what it all means. Its beauty and composer Matt Uelmen's moving (if somewhat sparse) soundtrack help create that Journey-like feel, but it never achieves the same sense of purpose or \u2013 by extension \u2013emotional power. All the same, I won't soon forget my time with Hob. It ends with a choice that ties back to the earliest moments, at last answering some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the mysteries that popped up throughout. With a little more focus, this could have been one of the greats.\n\nHob is a beautiful Zelda-like puzzler with fun combat elements that takes place on an enchanting world where nature and machinery alter the landscape as easily as a twist of a Rubik's cube. The wordless approach to the story creates some confusion and the fix camera sometimes results in unnecessary deaths, but never does the time spent with Hob feel wasted.         7.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1516576541, "timestamp_updated": 1516576541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39523287": {"recommendationid": "39523287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102367062", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 152, "last_played": 1521397709}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought the game on Sale to kill some time with a new singleplayer game.

I haven't seen a game play like this ever. When a section completes -- the entire world and landscape before you changes, like a giant robotic rubix cube.\n\nThere's not a lot of story to go on, so wielding your imagination and understanding what exactly the non-verbal cues are telling you leaves a lot to be self-discovered throughout the story with hidden Lore Vaults, and just paying attention to the details of the landscape and what has actually taken place.\n\nGameplay is superb. Tumbling. Charging weapons and a huge robotic fist. What's not to love?!\nThe puzzles and memory games will have your head spinning in a tizzy and that-last-damn-sword-piece you missed because of a weird camera angle will have you scouring the world for an additional hour until you decide to look at a map or youtube, only to realize it's the one piece of twelve that's in a dungeon, not in the world. #bitter\nCollect heart pieces to increase your life counter and energy cores to increase your energy charges; think Zelda.\n\nI absolutely loved this game and the challenge and experience it brought me. Honest to God, I haven't had this much fun and enjoyment out of a game since I was in my teens, almost two decades ago.\n\nThe ONLY reason I gave it a 9/10 instead of 10/10 is development purposes.\n\nI feel like the game is 99% polished and completed, but the 1% is something someone like me would find and break. Lol. I'm accused of doing this from time to time, but I found at least a dozen broken map spots that lead me into nothingness and resulted in a death, most often -- squarely in the middle of the map, on land, but cutting a corner in search of an entrance to something and find that surprise-surprise, there's a section of unfinished map and you just fell to your death.\n\nOr where you find the sword piece inside the Tesla Dungeon and if you jump to the right of the end-door, into the nook, it'll teleport you out, as if you went into the door... lol. Weird things. Unfinished things.\n\nAbsolutely loved this game.

The game unfolds itself without any real direction, narrative, or story, other than the events that transpire between the chracters and in the environment on screen.\n\nThis seems like it would be lacking but trust me, it works, especially if you are an intuitive person who can read and feel characters based solely on action and appearance without the need for words.  It's almost like the brilliance of the movies in the days before sound, however the sound in this game is top notch, the music is amazing as are the graphics and mechanics.  \n\nControls are mostly sharp and responsive, and so far it's mostly perfect, but there are ocassional unpolished or areas where controls become akward due to camera angles or obstructions. \n\nEventually you will get some clear objectives blinking on a world map you can access, but even then your also free to explore at your own pace.  \n\nThe combat is fast and fun and involve intersting mechanics with various abilities as you progress.\n\nThe puzzles and strategy require intelligence, wisdom, strategy, timing, dexterity and a number of other cognitive abilities.   \n\nAs with most metroid vania platformer rpg style games, you start off with few abilities and gear, and as you progress through the puzzles and tasks and explore hidden areas [spoiler]( i.e. bonus health in this game is a giant flower with heart-shaped-health-block inside) [/spoiler]\n\nI try to go for $1 an hour for cost to gameplay time, and this was on sale for $15 while only $20 originally, and I am thinking there will we at least 15-20+ enjoyable hours, so worth the investment in the end.\n\nEven if it didn't fir the $1 per hour gameplay model, this is a title that everyone should at least give a go.  if they had a demo it would be amazing because people know within 30 minutes if they will love or hate it.\n\nLoved it so far, 4.5/5 stars\n*** *hint* [spoiler] try to be nice to nature & listen - make friends with the animals instead of killing them & most esecially FOLLOW THE BIRDS & THEIR SONGS [/spoiler] ***", "timestamp_created": 1516551595, "timestamp_updated": 1516551595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39514453": {"recommendationid": "39514453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021469750", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516581758}, "language": "czech", "review": "Vyborna hra, trochu som bludil po mape, ale to je moj problem, treba si vsimat aj najmensie detaily kadial ist, prostredie je nadherne hratelnost vyborna ,ako strvorene pre ovladac.. odporucam tuto oddychovku", "timestamp_created": 1516551404, "timestamp_updated": 1516551404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39513072": {"recommendationid": "39513072", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978221037", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516547965}, "language": "english", "review": "2 crashes in less than 10 minutes.

No real bugs, no real trouble.\nThe only bug I had was because of my fault, jumping somewhere where I shouldn't belong, or jumping behind objects \naccidentally. So everything was totaly fine. Sometimes, evern when I play oon Easy Mode, the puzzles are a little bit difficult, or I didn't know where to go next, but after time I figured out.\nThe graphic is stunning, the characters are so lovely. This game hasn't synchronisation or speaking language and text, but you still know what they trying to say and what they mean. It give the game a really good atmosphere and a really good feeling. The music changes, depending where you are and its not annoying, it's good, still Iam putting every music on every game on low.  \n\nThere are more difficult \"levels\" or areas after time, its a little bit linear, but I like it how it is. \nThe story is real good too.\nI really love this game, I hope they making an similar to this one the next time.\nI have buy this by it's full price, it's worthy for me and should be worthy for you, when you like steampunk, beautiful scenerys and a good graphic.\n\nSadly this is the last game of RunicGames. :(\nIf you like it on sale, buy it, its worthy.", "timestamp_created": 1516381082, "timestamp_updated": 1516381480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39462148": {"recommendationid": "39462148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063062133", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510355750}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a bad game, i played it through.

Being a \"Metroidvania\", each upgrade you acquire has a certain satisfaction to it, although some changes could be made to make it a bit more impactful.\n\nEnergy is upgraded once for every six generic energy upgrade pickups, which are uncommon, found hidden around the map. This is fine.\n\nHealth is upgraded once for every two generic health upgrade pickups, which are semi-rare, found hidden around the map. This is also fine. \n\nEvery time you fill a tank by picking a set of these, the only indication of upgrade is a sound cue and HUD change. I'd like to see some celebratory animations or cosmetic change on my guy's fist. Power fantasy stuff.\n\nYour sword is upgraded once for every three generic sword piece pickups which are found rarely around the map. Rather than occuring as you pick it up, the upgrade needs to be instigated by returning to the Workshop. Personally, I believe this happens rarely enough that:\n\n- each sword forging could have it's own unique forging crucible and animation (for maximum \"shit yeah!\" and power fantasy)\n- each sword piece pickup could be more flavourful - perhaps a bit of lore as to how the old warrior fought and passed, and a hint of information as to the properties of the next sword upgrade... The pickups themselves could be generic, and the lore and sword piece decided upon pickup dependent on the player's current progression to the next sword, so that the player doesn't have to go back searching the entire map for \"Sword 2, Hilt\".\n- each upgraded sword (and even energy/health tanks?) could be another avenue for upgrade-gated progression. The archives are cool to revisit and open once you nab that new sword, but i'd like to see more. Perhaps temples where you could visit and learn a cool charge move from a scroll or... something. If anyone has played the older game \"Prince Of Persia: Warrior Within\", something akin to the Scorpion Sword and how it lets you break through walls, or the Serpent Sword, and it's function as a key. \n\nUnfortunately this list would require no small change and almost entirely rework the progression system - I'm simply musing from a \"what if\" perspective. Runic is dissolved, and thus hopes for a sequel are low... I digress.\n\nThe QoL(Kinda?) issues rest with the camera and the controls. The analog stick method of control is undoubtedly superior for this game and this is mentioned to the player at the outset. Unfortunately, I do not have a controller handy, so was stuck with keyboard controls. This is fine for most scenarios, and Runic did a decentish job at making cardinal directions adequate for movement in their level designs. However, some scenarios contain platforms where you need to move at a 60 degree angle to the horizontal lest the endless abyss below take you, and therefore cannot pass with cardinal keys. The RTS-style mouse following movement helps with this, but it's still janky given the camera angle changes a lot - often instantaneously - and therefore so must your mouse lead angle.\n\nHow you circumvent this, I have no idea. But it is a little frustrating that you reaaaaally need a controller if you want the most seamless experience. My poor little hob dude has been led to too many a death by parallax error.\n\nOverall, I loved the game. The lack of dialogue, the music, the scene, the more-than-sum-of-parts aesthetic; it's lovely. I want more, and I regret to hear the studio has dissolved.

I absolutely loved this game.\n\nPros: \n-Fun, yet simple combat, that remains challenging, even on medium difficulty and is supplemented with upgradeable moves.\n-Puzzles often yield a sense of accomplishment and all feel interlocked.\n-A neat collectible system that ties into the story and collectibles well. None of the collectibles are required to proceed, but all feel like accmplishments within themselves.\n-Beautiful art style with charming animations. The bright colors make everything contrast well, and make the evil goop seem that much more deadly.\n-An enjoyable Metroid/Castlevania/Zelda-esque explore and return formula that is made simpler by the fast travel system, without making it too easy. \n-A complete lack of intelligible dialogue, simple gestures, and pictorals lend a very mysterious, unknown charm to the game. I often had no idea why I was doing something, until I accomplished it and was rewarded with a massive change. \n\nCons:\n-Combat can become very rinse and repeat, and there are only 10 or so enemy types. The extra moves and skills that are gained are purely superfluous, as you can defeat any of the enemies rinse and repeat style (this is offset by different environments, upgrades to enemies, and grouping of enemy types) but combat doesnt feel like a main part of the game with a lack of boss fights. The enemies just feel thrown in to take up space and give you more of the limited currency.\n-It's very easy to miss many collectibles, and a lot of the lore is locked behind finding certain ones.\n-With the lack of the dialogue, someone who doesn't find the same wonder and myystery in it that I do may quickly get confused and bored with the game, or simply feel lost.\n-I often found myself wishing there was a legend for the map icons.\n-The fixed camera perspective never really broke the game or lost me fights, but it was often very frustrating. \n-There was only once were I died by clipping through a surface, which was truly annoying, but there were a few times I got stuck in a platform or caught in a corner. \n\nOverall: I freaking loved this game. It may seem as though I complianed about it a lot, but its just so everyone knows what to expect going in. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves action/adventure/puzzle/platformers.

The graphics are stylish, artistic and colourful, which makes exploring the game fun. There's plenty of setpieces and impressive sights to see. Hob is also full of good puzzles that can get a bit repetitive after a while, but I was never bored. The combat is minimalistic, because the game really isn't about combat. I guess it can be compared to ICO and Ori and the Blind Forest, two other games that was more about exploring and puzzles and combat. Another thing that's excellent in the game is the atmosphere.

Well worth it, and then some.\n\nWe play games which involve a player and a back-seat driver.  Something pretty with a story, some real hook, and a need to play just one more hour!  This delivers on all of these fully.\n\nWe loved the graphics, the story, the emotion without needing text or speeches.  The gameplay is fun: casual enough that it only got really stressful runny-jumpy bits in one or two places, while the combat has styles which you learn to defeat.  Both movement and fighting are easy to adapt to, and make a well rounded offering.  Respawn is simple and not punishing, so even when I messed up, there was no sense of frustration or doom.\n\nNavigation can get a little tiring sometimes, especially when you get the third arm ability (trying to avoid spoilers) when you can go back and search for ages to find stuff.  Some additional icons on the minimap would have been a huge plus there - where the challenge would be 'how' to get there, rather than 'where' to go.  It put a somewhat 'dull' interlude in the middle of the game, which was unecessary but which the completionist in me would not allow to avoid.\n\nTotally kick-ass game.  I got it on sale, but honestly if I paid full I would still be a happy little camper.

Before you quit and go to bed, please check that your saves are actually saving.  You see, there is some strange circumstance under which the game shows you the save symbol, but the files just don't update.

But at the same time, there is so much rich puzzles, lore, collectibles, and beauty in this world that it would still take hours to discover everything.\nThe main \"story\" part of this game takes you wondering through every part of this world. Through about the first 3rd of the adventure gaining new tools (not entirely dissimilar to Zelda Breath of the Wild) that allow you to access the rest of the world. After that, you are left to wander more or less freely, though the corruption you found around the world may regularly block your path. You can however remove the corruption, though I won't go into much detail as to how.\n\nThe game seems to take inspiration from Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There's a lot of adventuring, parkour, and exploration.\n\nHowever, one of the main problems with this game is that a lot of the stuff you gain isn't really all that helpful. The combat itself is relatively easy, if you die the worst that can happen is that you'll spawn a few metres back at the last checkpoint (checkpoints are very common), most of the things you killed probably won't respawn, and there is very little increase in the difficulty of the monsters over time.\n\nMusic: 8/10,\nthe music itself fits the ambient feel of the game, though generally you might even struggle to notice it.\n\nCombat: 6/10,\nthe combat is fluid but too easy. There are probably about 15 different creatures to fight, but you'll only ever regularly come across about 5 of them. This means that once you learn how to deal with each one, the game becomes an awful lot less difficult.\n\nCollectibles: 7/10,\nI like the collectibles, they can be hidden in varying and cunning places, and I don't think there's any way to permanently miss a collectible ingame. But, as I mentioned before, the collectibles make combat easier. Seeing as it is already easy, the collectibles lose their purpose.\n\nLandscape: 9/10,\nI love the landscape in this game, it is stunning and interesting. The graphics them selves are very similar to torchlight, except there's a lot more animation and ambient noises that can make the game seem more alive than torchlight.\n\nMovement: 8/10,\nThis game has parkour systems that can be a little bit clunky for use on the computer, as if you are using your keyboard, you can struggle to get the accurate angles for jumps that aren't quite diagonal. Though it does incorporate mouse control and other things that can make this easier.\n\nStory: 7/10,\nThe game doesn't really explain much inside the story, nobody in the game ever says anything, but you can discover parts of the lore of the game by exploring the world.\n\nOverall: 8/10,\nIt's an excellent game worthy of playing if you enjoy exploring.\n\nThe story itself is a little short, and there isn't much to truly challenge the user. However, there are ways to make the game harder.

Even five years ago Hob would have been seriously impressive for a \u00a315 indie title \u2013 these days the amount of stellar games at that price point means you can essentially ignore the awful AAA space altogether and still run up a sizeable backlog.\n\nHob is an exploration focussed action adventure game with light puzzle and combat elements, with a sizeable overworld and discreet dungeons. So yeah, we're pretty much looking at Zelda here, but it\u2019s so well crafted and designed that it\u2019s hard to be offended by lack of originality, especially in a genre that isn\u2019t particularly well represented on the PC. It\u2019s a gentle game, happy to let you move at your own pace and the puzzles are just challenging enough that you won\u2019t feel insulted but not so taxing that you will ever get stuck for more than a few minutes.\n\nThis extends to the combat which feels a bit lightweight and seems to serve mostly to mix things up a bit. Admittedly here it does a solid job, and difficult combat would somewhat undermine the more gentle pacing and atmosphere, but I do wish the game gave you a little more variety. You're pretty much whacking the same three-four hit sword combo right until game end, interspersed with the odd punch to break enemy shields.\n\nHob is at it\u2019s best when you\u2019re just off exploring \u2013 going off the beaten path is nearly always rewarded. The world is small but well designed and dense with optional puzzles and secrets. The platforming is the only area that could use some work \u2013 the fixed camera and isometric viewpoint can make it difficult to judge jumps even with some generous auto aim, and the save points are sometimes poorly placed which can end up with a painful trek back after an untimely fall.\n\nAs well as the obvious inspiration Hob also bears more than a passing resemblance to PS3 critical darling Journey, at least visually. As well as the obvious visual similarities of the protagonists, Hob also goes for the same style of visual storytelling. Outside of the ability descriptions everything in Hob is represented by symbols, and the story is told entirely via body language and the environment. As arty as it is, I\u2019d say this is actually the game\u2019s biggest weakness. While Hob has excellent visual direction and sense of place, it\u2019s rather more vague on why you\u2019re doing the things you do \u2013 both in terms of its overall narrative and more immediate objectives. Essentially, you do things because that\u2019s where the waypoint directs you. The actual minute to minute gameplay is excellent \u2013 a puzzle turning on a water pipe will be engaging and well crafted, but it will not be clear exactly why the water needs turning on in the first place.\n\nDespite a few niggles the game itself is absolutely worthy of a recommendation \u2013 but the publisher, Perfect World is not. Runic, the developers of Hob were axed only a couple of months after Hob\u2019s release. While it would be a shame if less people got to play Hob, I can\u2019t in good faith recommend giving money to a publisher that showed their developers such contempt. While I would never endorse piracy, if you can play Hob without paying for it you could do so with a clear conscience.", "timestamp_created": 1515454872, "timestamp_updated": 1517102345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39193074": {"recommendationid": "39193074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100567171", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519312653}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game, but not that great I thought it would be.\n\nIt's a platformer.

The possibility to reshape the world is astonishnig even after all those hours I've played so far.\n\nA personal letdown is the non-complexity of game's puzzles. From trailers I got the impression of solving 3D shapeshifting mazes, but like I said, this game is primarily a platformer.

There's a fair amount of items to collect and upgrades/habilities to help you overcome obstacles. An interesting level design that changes because of your actions.\n\nAt first the objective is marked on your useful map, along with the POI you'd like to visit, but later in game, say near the end of it, somehow the markers are simply gone and you must guess and wander around until you stumble with the location or do what you must do in order to procede. Yes, it feels like you will wander aimlessly in the end not sure if it's intentional or a bug or maybe it was left unfinished; again, not sure if intentional or not. Thankfully once you figure it out (or cheat and watch a YT video!) you won't need another marker because you're right there, on the finish line.\n\nI missed some upgrade items, missed the (crypts?) secret places that you unlock -with sword upgrades- and potentially the real story behind HOB world. Maybe you can't understand the whole \"truth\" behind it's veil without these places. Oh well.. more reason so come back and get it all! XD\n\nThere's just 2 things that bothered my, but don't warrant a thumbs down by no means!\n- Fixed camera: Often you wont see where you are and were you're going. You'll have to wing it, trust yourself!\nI thought you could only screw things up with a bad 3rd person cam being too close to our character, which most times gets you killed. Well, in HOB there's BLIND SPOTS, more times than I'd admit I fell through the floor (glitches, many many times!) or straigth to the abyss, that's it, there are no bounderies, no hand-holding folks, you'd love it!\n\n- Kind of a spoiler, so DON'T READ if you don't want to be spoiled! it's pretty minimal though.\nThere are some giant *dead* robots that apparently are blocking the path or at least some secrets. These have a place with 4 slots, designed to be POWERED with 4 power cores (d'oh!) but here's the kicker: once you put these in, you CANNOT get them out to try/reactivate the other giants. So this -as far as I know- forces you to start a NEW GAME each time you want to reactivate such robot. Sigh.\n\nI've found this one way too late, in the end, and by that time I had no way of tracing back my steps or using an earlier save (not sure that I would, if I had one anyways). I think -but don't quote me on this- you CAN reuse these power cores IF they are not placed on the ONE robot that leads you to the ending. I'd need confirmation as it's just an assumption of mine which didn't check before it was too late. Perhaps someone else did.\n\nAnyways, it's a great game and you will most likely enjoy multiple passthroughs as it's kinda short once you know what and where to do. In fact, there are achievements for speeding to the finish line in less than 5 hours. First pass took me about 15 hr so YMMV, you know this!\n\nDo I recommend this gem from RunicGames, the creators of Torchlight I & II? YES, I wholeheartly do. I preordered this game and it's given back enjoyment more than it's asked price, so yes, worth it.\n\nI did liked the \"retirement\" feature of the Torchlights games and would like it to be here too, so you could take your (his/her) items and upgrades and pick up a new passthrough way faster than before, completing it each time a bit more, having a blast and maybe doing an evil laugh when you effortlessly slaughter the corrupted creatures that dare to face your rocky wrath!

(Warning light spoilers). \n\nIt takes the explore elements from Zelda, and some of the combat from Dark Souls/Breath of the Wild. The story telling is vague an wonderful, keeping it all organic as possible. Allowing you to think of \"wtf is going on\" and put together the puzzle of this deconstructed world you awaken in. You are assumingly Hob, a small version of maybe the large golems you notice throughout the game. I questioned a lot of \"How do I build this, and how do I build that, what is this icon?\" I have noticed alot of consumers complain that the game makes you explore the world yourself, rather then one narrow straight line to the finish line. I understand many enjoy not thinking for themselves, but for a game that is built to resemble a throw back to the original Zelda title. Then get over it, and just enjoy the game. \n\nThe one thing that takes me to a negative vibe in the game itself, sadly is a bug that is still exists and plagues my brain due to being 50% done with the game, is the Sword glitch. Due to Runic Games now being owned by Perfect World International I doubt I will the issue resolved with the sword bug with the forge. If you have two pieces and press the forge, it will glitch out and permaimently not allow you to upgrade your weapon. It is a bit of a throttle to progression, because then you have to unlock a door later on with a fully upgraded sword to advance. So you have to start fresh to fix it if the game does this bug.

I don't really love FPS games, and clicking adventures/RPGs don't hold my attention very well. That being said, Hob is very much the Zelda experience I've been waiting around for! \n\nIt feels a lot like Link Between Worlds actually, if I were to pick one. The combat is simple sword and shielding around, and the eviromental puzzles are always awe inspiring as they unfold before you with every twist of a knob or pull of a lever. \n\nIf you're looking for something that isn't particularily challenging and feels very much like a Zelda game, I highly reccommend Hob!\n\nPros:\nBeautiful atmosphere\n\nEndearing characters\n\nClever enviromental puzzles\n\nLight combat\n\nCons:\nNo dialogue may deter some, as there's nothing in terms of explaining a real story. A lot of it is up for personal interpretation (but that honestly made it more enjoyable for me somehow)\n\nFrame rate lag was a bit troublesome now and then.\n\nGlitching now and then was a bit annoying as well, but I still love this game. \n\nConclusion: I picked it up during the Winter sale when I had never heard of it before and had no idea I needed it.

The puzzles were challenging but never enough that it was unsolvable or rage-quit-y. The villains got progressively harder, and the way the tutorial introduced fighting styles forced me to use strategy and timing that I didn't expect I was going to be able to do well. There also was no point where I was frustrated with the absence of direct information given, and it only propelled, rather than stunted my interest.\n\nMy favorite part was the world itself. The beauty and colors were capturing and the creatures were perfectly crafted. The game was also the perfect balance of exploration and puzzling, and, as other reviews have said, the 'do-it-yourself' work.

The first few hours of it are a pure delight!  I definitely do recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle plattformers at all.  Everything looks amazing, and the areas are so imaginative!  This definitely touches on the same sort of otherworldly blend of nature and machinery seen in Portal 2.  That does however raise some small points.  \n\nFirst, this game is something of a metroidvania in that you will spend a lot of time revisiting places you've been before.  There will be a lot of running around.  The save points that were all over the place near the beginning will end up being very widely spaced apart in later sections.  The fast travel system is not as well distributed as one might like either.  This means the end game sequence is artificially extended by long, mandatory sequences of running, climbing, and jumping all over the map, and at the end of that, you have whatever it was that killed you the last time.  It was probably a fall since there are usually save points less than half a minute from difficult enemies.  I will give them credit for that.\n\nSecond, a lot of the puzzles are actually really easy IF you can find them.  That would be my biggest gripe is that even though you are given a map marker to where you need to go, you have to find the means to reach it, and since the whole environment is connected to machinery, the place you actually need to go next may not be near the place marked on your map, and it might not even be easy to spot.  I played through the entire first half of the game without a guide, but I admit to caving in and consulting a guide after wasting an hour running around trying to find a spot to use the final armament that I hadn't already visited.\n\nMy final complaint is that for all that you're changing the landscape, once you open up a new pathway, that's usually the extent of it.  There are a few puzzles that have you do A in order to do B and then undo A because B opened a way to do C, but once C or D is done, that's it.  You will probably never manipulate that part of the environment again.  Except for weak enemies, most enemies don't respawn, but annoying barriers like bushes and thorn hedges never go away (other than the few cuttable bushes), while only some walls and cliffs become passable.  You have a sword and three different tools by the end of the game, but not much to really do with them, so you will be running through mostly empty landscapes, climbing up and down because there are no stairs for this section of otherwise impassable terrain, and trying not to fall to your death in the areas where there is just no easier way through than to cross a narrow span or jump a gap.  It would have been nice if there was a little more interactability with the environment and especially a way to shorten some of the trips.\n\nAll that said, those are quibbles bred by long hours of hunting for obscure things that can be tricky to find even with a guide since nothing is labeled.  I still absolutely loved receiving this as a Christmas present, and I absolutely believe that it would have been worth it for me to buy it on sale.  Full price however?  Maybe not.  I certainly recommend the game, but if puzzle platformers are not your passion, you'll probably want to wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1514747483, "timestamp_updated": 1514747483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38909400": {"recommendationid": "38909400", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999288653", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515435412}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Hellboy brought me to this [b] Beauty [/b] and Zelda want me to stay [/h1]\n\nLike the Title mentioned, as fan of the Hellboy Series and his big badass Stonehand of Doom\ni was attracted to the Gamecover of [b] Hob [/b].

There's clearly been some kind of apocalypse here, but none of the game's lore is conveyed in words - it's all environmental storytelling, gestures from mute characters, and a few light-based murals you can discover along the way.\n\nI really enjoyed the environmental puzzling and the physical ways the character interacts with the world - punching open columns of rock to create ladders, heaving against levers to turn gears into place, and so on. The fighting is simple but feels weighty enough; though I never figured out how to perform complex combos, I never felt like I needed to either. This is not a combat-driven Torchlight at all.

Action-Adventure-Jump n' run trifft die genre Mischung wohl am ehesten.\nDer Star ist wie genannt die Spielwelt, die sich durch Interaktion des Spielers immer wieder ver\u00e4ndert und neu zusammenstellt, dabei eine Mischug aus Natur und Maschine darstellt\nBild\nBild\n\nDadurch ergeben sich immer neue Wege durch die Welt und die Progression wird durch eben diese neuen Plattformen, aber auch endlich erreichbare Abk\u00fcrzungen definiert, wobei es auch verteilt \u00fcber die ganze Spielwelt Schnellreise-Rohrpoststationen gibt.\nNebst den f\u00fcr den Fortschritt n\u00f6tigen Sachen, kann man auch viele Secrets finden, die die eigene Waffe verbessern, mehr lebens- und Ausdauerenergie geben oder einem Aufr\u00fcstungspunkte geben um mehr F\u00e4higkeiten freizuschalten, notwendig f\u00fcrs durchspielen sind die nicht, erleichtern es einem aber und der Entdeckungstrieb im Spiel ist sowieso stark.\nDenn die Bewegung durch die Welt macht einfach Spass, das Rennen, das Klettern, das Springen, das Entdecken, das ausprobieren neuer Wege.\nHier kommt aber auch der einzige Kritikpunkt auf, den ich ernsthaft habe, das pr\u00e4zise ausrichten der Spr\u00fcnge im 3D-Raum ist manchmal etwas schwierig, die Ausrichtung der Spielfigur ist nicht immer 100% ersichtlich. Da die Wege zur\u00fcck von Spawn-Punkten aus aber immer kurz sind ist dies nicht sehr kritisch.\n\nDas K\u00e4mpfen gegen sporadisch auftretende Gegner (die nach einmal besiegen der gegnergruppe aber verschwunden bleiben) sind spassig, das Kampfsystem funktioniert fl\u00fcssig und bei aller Einfachheit (Es gibt nur einen Schwertschlag, dazu einen Fausschlag und eine Ausweichrolle) gibt es ordentlich Abwechslung vor allem auch weil es verschiedene Gegner gibt, die ganz verschiedene taktiken erfordern:\nBild\n\nGanz generell, eines der sch\u00f6nsten Spielerlebnisse des Jahres, weil es einfach einen einzigartigen Flow entwickelt, nicht sehr anspruchsvoll aber befriedigend, es ist eines dieser Spiele, bei dem das Spielen einfach befriedigend ist, was auch durch viele sch\u00f6ne Details (Animationen, Soundkulisse, etc.) unterst\u00fctzt wird und das voller kleiner Liebensw\u00fcrdigkeiten steckt, wie dass die Respawn-Animation immer etwas verschieden sind.", "timestamp_created": 1514484579, "timestamp_updated": 1514484579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620935", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38787774": {"recommendationid": "38787774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089944958", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514481216}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438! \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433(", "timestamp_created": 1514481933, "timestamp_updated": 1514481933, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405237", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38775681": {"recommendationid": "38775681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097290158", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514804308}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[b] Such a totally amazing game!!![/b] I would like to extend my greatest  appreciation to that!

The reason I'm giving it thumbs down is (read cons). The game is addictive and I could tell a lot of thought was put into this game. Its very fun and has lots of secrects to find along with replay value.      \n\nCons:\n1: Crashed within 10 minutes of 1st starting the game but after a PC restart I played for around 10 hours with no issues. Then I changed the GAMMA due to a very dark underground area and it started crashing again. I noticed every time I turned the game off (or it crashed) the gamma would reset to default and would not respond sometimes to any atempt to change it. This was random because it would work at times then it would not. Every time I set it though it would crash within 30 minutes.\n2: I had an enemy that was frozen and was sent into the air from raising the land area which resulted in a floating statue. Later in the game it happened to my character several times and was a pain to restore to normal. I have seen post of it happening to random enemies and causing issues with completing the area.\n3: After 20 hours of gameplay I noticed it was not running as smooth as when I first started it up. There where no fps drops but movement became choppy and character didn't always respond to inputs from the controller. After the 1st crash within the 1st 10 minutes of the game it was flawless until I changed the gamma.\n4: Since Runic is no more I doubt any of these issues will ever get solved so that means for those who do not have issues from the start it will most likely be a game that myself and others will have to completely un-install after every play through then re-install to get the smooth performance back.\n\nPros: Super fun and great graphics with very nice lighting effects.\n       Lots of replay value and has HARD mode and a Speed run achievement.\n       The entire game is just one big puzzle and there is no holding your hand to get you through it.\n       Even though the game has issues it can be completed.\n\nAt the time I have 22 hours with the game completed and only have 4 achievements left to complete.\n\nEdit: After compleing the last 4 achievements without un-installing the game I got 1 crash for Microsoft Kernal and frame rates as low as 20fps.

The puzzles are pretty easy, but they are engaging and never feel out of place. They're not just trials, they are part of the architecture. Combat is easy too and I consider it a minor element of the game, but you fight just enough to remember that this world is alive. One regret though is that the unlockable combat abilities are not that useful, simply because you don't need them to win - I actually forgot that I had them. \n\nAnother regret is that I wish the game was longer. While its short lenght is not a flaw, it leaves me wanting for more. Should it have a sequel ? I guess not. Everything has a sequel and a prequel and a sequel of the prequel these days, and one-shots are refreshing and a good reminder of the beauty of ephemerality. Well, I'm getting carried away here, and the fact that Runic shut down pretty much answers that question anyway.\n\nI find many similarities between Hob and Hyper Light Drifter : no talking, a vague story, a ruined land where nature meets thechnology, underground facilities etc. (also both heroes wear a red cape, but that's not relevant). Hob is much lighter and brighter though, and even if its world is broken and deserted, you rebuild it with joy and never feel alone.", "timestamp_created": 1514258208, "timestamp_updated": 1515373471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38681729": {"recommendationid": "38681729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100841626", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514657707}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u611f\u53d7\u5730\u56fe\u5168\u8c8c\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u987a\u5e26\u4e00\u63d0\uff1a\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6c2a\u809d\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514257883, "timestamp_updated": 1514257883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38680738": {"recommendationid": "38680738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040374016", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514254949}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an absolutely magical experience!!!

It's also an open-world game, so at any point, you are free to do whatever you want and revisit any place at any time (you'll have to do that as you progress anyway). Like in most new platformer games, you can upgrade your character. Upgrade system is quite deep here, you can increase health, energy and acquire new abilities. To upgrade you need to collect some collectibles scattered across a big map. Most of the enemies you kill are one time only, meaning they will not spawn again at that point ever, which means revisiting some places, especially in the beginning, could be boring, but don't worry developers added fast travel option to most parts of the map. An interesting feature that Hob has as there is no sound. There is not a single spoken dialog between characters, the game makes you think about the story yourself, so it's hard to describe how good the story is without major spoilers.\n\nThe only problem with the game is a big amount of bugs where your character gets stuck in some sort of geometry, but an overall very solid game.", "timestamp_created": 1514035858, "timestamp_updated": 1514035858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38574285": {"recommendationid": "38574285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178004351", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513445482}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel hat einfach eine wundersch\u00f6ne Grafik ,sowie tolles Gameplay .

Dieses steuert sich mit Gamepad \u00e4u\u00dferst pr\u00e4zise und erzeugt im Big Picture Modus richtiges Konsolenfeeling.\nMan erh\u00e4lt nach Spielstart Zugang in eine bunte, comichaft gestaltete Welt die stimmungsvoll gestaltet wurde. Zun\u00e4chst einem Golem folgend erh\u00e4lt man nach kurzer Zeit ein Schwert und eine Powerfaust. Damit bewaffnet kann man dann das Gras in Zelda Manier niederschnippeln, morsche B\u00fcsche beseitigen um geheime Durchg\u00e4nge zu finden und Monster nieder strecken. Oder por\u00f6se Mauerst\u00fccke durchbrechen. Wobei das K\u00e4mpfen eher an zweiter Stelle steht. Es gibt im ganzen Spiel keinen einzigen richtigen Bosskampf oder \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig schwer zu bezwingende Gegner. Vielmehr geht es darum, die Spielwelt zu erkunden und somit auf ganz \u201enat\u00fcrliche\u201c Art die Story zu erspielen. \n\nDabei entfaltet Hob seine ganz eigene Atmosph\u00e4re. Denn es erz\u00e4hlt die Geschichte Non-Verbal und intuitiv.  Es gibt kein Tutorial, keine st\u00e4ndig nervig d\u00fcdelnde Hintergrund Musik, keine Zwischensequenzen mit Dialogen oder dergleichen. Vielmehr zwitschern V\u00f6gel, die Bl\u00e4tter rauschen, B\u00e4che pl\u00e4tschern, es fliegen Irrlichter zwischen den B\u00e4umen umher oder es schlagen Blitze ein in unserer N\u00e4he. Friedliche Tiere leben in dieser Welt. Der Wald wirkt mystisch und wie aus einem Fantasy Film, die Industrieanlagen bedrohlich, die W\u00fcste karg und hoffnungslos. An bestimmten  Punkten der Map kann man innehalten und in die Weite blicken. Auf diese Weise l\u00e4sst sich manches Mal erahnen, wo sich ein Versteck befindet oder wie es im n\u00e4chsten Spielabschnitt aussieht, was so den Erkundungsdrang steigert.\n\n\u00dcberhaupt muss ich sagen, dass die Entwickler die Map richtig geil hin gekriegt haben denn sie ist unglaublich gut durchdacht. Kein einziges Mal blieb ich irgendwo stecken oder dachte es geht nicht mehr weiter. Es gibt immer einen logischen Durchgang oder eine Weiterf\u00fchrung  in einen anderen Bereich den man finden kann. Durch das Bet\u00e4tigen von Schaltern heben- und senken sich ganze Abschnitte, ordnen sich diese wie Puzzleteile zusammen und vergr\u00f6\u00dfern die Hob Welt somit im weiteren Spielverlauf.  Dadurch werden z. B. Spielbereiche zug\u00e4nglich, die man zuvor nur in der Ferne gesehen hatte. \n\nWie eingangs erw\u00e4hnt erkl\u00e4rt das Spiel nichts. Das macht zwar den Einstieg ins Spiel etwas schwerer aber Hob erfindet auch das Rad nicht neu. Die Spielmechanik geht spontan von der Hand und prinzipielle Dinge wie das Hochleveln des Schwertes oder der Powerfaust usw. d\u00fcrften die meisten Spielerinnen und Spieler heutzutage ohnehin von der Sache her aus zig anderen Spielen schon kennen. Wenn man erst einmal drin ist kann man sich herrlich in der gro\u00dfen Spielwelt verlieren, Geheimg\u00e4nge finden und R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen die von der Schwierigkeit in etwa auf Zelda Niveau sind. St\u00e4ndiges automatisches Speichern und massig Wiedereinstiegspunkte nach dem Tod und M\u00f6glichkeiten zur schnellen Reise sorgen daf\u00fcr, dass man nicht unn\u00f6tig vom Spielerlebnis abgelenkt wird. \nZuletzt bietet Hob sogar noch ein Alternatives Ende und etwas Freiraum zur Interpretation der, zugegebenerma\u00dfen etwas simplen Story. Alles in allem w\u00fcrde ich sagen der erste Spieldurchlauf d\u00fcrfte bei den meisten circa 15-20 Stunden dauern, je nachdem wie intensiv man die jeweiligen Bereiche erkundet. \n\nMal abgesehen von ein paar Mini Bugs wie einmal ein kleiner Grafik- und ein Clipping-Error lief es bei mir absolut sauber. Es hat mir unglaublich viel Spa\u00df gemacht die Spielwelt zu erkunden und ich werde auch noch einen weiteren Durchgang machen. Daher kann ich Hob mit allerbestem Gewissen jeder Person empfehlen die ein Action Adventure mit sehr guter Atmosph\u00e4re und eher mittlerem Schwierigkeitsgrad sucht!", "timestamp_created": 1513542666, "timestamp_updated": 1513543619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693671", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38385253": {"recommendationid": "38385253", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992123547", "num_games_owned": 934, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507145446}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello everybody, End World Gaming here to share an excerpt from my review for Hob by Runic Games.\n\nHob is a fantasy action adventure game. It follows an unnamed character who loses an arm to a purple alien species. His robot friend sacrifices his arm to heal the main character. The story is presented without narration or voice acting. The story unfolds as you explore the world and it\u2019s surprising how well it does. The game focuses more on the journey and it\u2019s a very fun one to be sure.\n\nThe world of Hob is easily one of my favorite parts of the game. While exploring you can see wild animals wandering around and some you can pet. You have complete control over the world as well and where there wasn\u2019t land originally\u2026 Pressing a button will shift the land to reveal new areas for you to explore. This transformation system is incredibly impressive and it must have taken a lot of work in making it work so smoothly. The level design in this game is superb.\n\nThe main character will have to combat evil creatures while exploring the world as well. The combat system feels very fluid and you can easily change which direction you\u2019re attacking. This allows you to hit an enemy in mid-attack. Not all enemies are small though, and you\u2019ll often need to use your abilities to combat later enemies. Abilities include grapple, block, dodge, teleport, and punch. Each ability is also utilized in exploration and early in the game you won\u2019t be able to get to most regions.\n\nThere\u2019s also hidden objects that you can find within the world. The major ones allow you to upgrade your health, energy and sword. Your health and energy upgrade automatically but your sword must be upgraded manually. To upgrade your sword you must gather 3 pieces and then bring it back to the forge. Doing so will have the main character drop the pieces into a smelter to melt down the pieces (And previous sword) thus creating a better one. There are 4 sword levels in all.\n\nOther hidden objects include butterflies and schematics. The butterflies have no real impact on the story. The schematics on the other hand allow you to purchase new ability upgrades. These include faster punch charging speed, a bonus attack combo and new cloak skins. The cloak skins alter your character\u2019s stats so you should choose carefully.\n\nOverall, Hob has been a pretty amazing game. I absolutely love the level design this game has to offer. It\u2019s easily some of the best that I\u2019ve seen this year. The game is also an incredibly fun game to play as well. It\u2019s combat system is fast and fluid and it\u2019s platforming felt great. Hob is pretty much The Legend of Zelda game you didn\u2019t know you needed. It\u2019s an amazing game and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough.\n\nIf you're interested in checking out the full review or would like to see my final score, you can find the review here: http://www.endworldgaming.com/action-adventure/hob-review\n\nThanks for taking the time to read the review folks and happy gaming!", "timestamp_created": 1513541218, "timestamp_updated": 1513541218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38375320": {"recommendationid": "38375320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281509546", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513513513}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u9762\u7cbe\u7f8e\uff0c\u8c1c\u9898\u5de7\u5999\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u52a8\u542c\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u64cd\u4f5c\u667a\u969c\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u70b9", "timestamp_created": 1513513697, "timestamp_updated": 1513513697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38375054": {"recommendationid": "38375054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109655281", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513592487}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0424\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043c", "timestamp_created": 1513512979, "timestamp_updated": 1513512979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38374286": {"recommendationid": "38374286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359101427", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513509954}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6253\u901a\u5173\u8fd8\u610f\u72b9\u672a\u5c3d\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u624b\u6b8b\u515a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u6b7b\u4e8620\u591a\u6b21\u8fd8\u613f\u610f\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e5f\u662f\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u4e86\u3002\u8d4f\u8d4f\u666f\uff0c\u6253\u6253\u602a\uff0c\u89e3\u89e3\u5bc6\uff0c\u4f11\u95f2\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513510627, "timestamp_updated": 1513510627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38372744": {"recommendationid": "38372744", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991306788", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513504620}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a Zelda clone, plain and simple.

This will surely put a lot of people off, as its hard to keep track to whats going on if you dont pay attention or rush through the world. That being said, if you do take time to learn the world, its quite a good tale, assuming I understood it correctly. It wont blow your mind, but it is quite interesting. \n\nGameplay is mainly composed of platforming and puzzle solving with a bit of combat. Neither of those things are hard or annoying which was great. Camera is fixed so you will have to rely on the game to show you the environment rather than having a free look. \n\nAtmosphere wise, its nice and its incredible how it all fits once you start \"fixing\" the world. Its like a giant puzzle with shifting lands and different environments. \n\nSound design is not something you'd praise, and while there is music and sound effects, they rarely make an impression, which is a shame for such a pretty world. \n\nOverall while the game isnt something you'd praise, it is still quite the experience. if you're a fan of the genre, buy it and if you're not I would still recommend you at least give a try, if not for the obfuscated story but at least for the atmosphere and gameplay.  8/10", "timestamp_created": 1512937552, "timestamp_updated": 1512937627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38210910": {"recommendationid": "38210910", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990365217", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512818347}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a wonderful game.

Can't remember how many times I fell down a ledge because the camera suddenly shifts angle. Can get annoying going up the stairs in weird camera angles and you the controls don't adapt to it. Also worth mentioning some bugs where you can't take energy cubes out of their place and you have to restart the game.

There's puzzles, combat, upgrades, platforming and exploring. All these elements are fun but not amazing. The puzzles are easy and satisfying to solve, but you're for the most part just following a path pressing buttons and flipping switches. They are never as complex as actual Zelda dungeons.\n\nThe platforming is alright, but I missed being able to control the character mid air. The static camera also hinders the platforming sometimes. I liked the upgrade system, as all upgrades needs to be discovered by the player.\nThe world design is neat, but it never changes to drastically and sticks to a familiar style through the game. I got a bit bored of it at the end.\n\nThe game also features bugs! And they can really screw up the game as the bugs sometimes don't trigger puzzles or key functions.

Hob feels so much like it and much better in some places.\n\nYou are a sword-like-thingy wielding creature that explores and changes the world around you. There is some combat but if you like exploring (i.e you get all the upgrades and have enough currency to buy them) combat will not be too difficult on normal difficulty. There are 2 higher difficulty settings and one lower but to me it felt very well balanced. But combat will never be just a senseless buttonmashfest.

Unfortunately, home is pretty far away, and many puzzles and enemies block the path. I dove into this game blind, and I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nHob has a very Zelda-like vibe. You play a little guy in a tunic with a pointed hat hacking at grass with a sword. Of course, you'll find no rupees here, just health. That doesn't mean there is no shopping mechanic, however. As you defeat enemies and unlock rectangular stones with glowing symbols, you gain a currency. This currency is used to upgrade the abilities you gain along the way. There is no name for the currency.\n\nSpeaking of no name for currency, there's no names given for anything other than shop items. There is no dialog. On one hand, it's pretty great for those of us who get impatient while NPCs talk forever. On the other, it can make it a little harder to figure out where you're going. \n\nA good example of this is when the stone golem that's been helping you motions across a large hole in the ground. You cannot jump it. You cannot fly. You probably have no idea what the big symbol in front of the gap means because you don't have that ability yet. You just know you have to get over there. You get over there by completing a different area completely first. They also won't tell you how to use your new abilities when you get them. I personally had to check the control map a couple times to figure out what I was doing. This lack of dialog can leave some people very lost for a while.\n\nI played Hob with a keyboard and mouse, but there were a lot of times I thought \"I should really use a controller for this\". It works with the keyboard and mouse, but there are a lot of diagonal jumps. These jumps get a little awkward on keyboard when you're in the middle of a time-based puzzle (or if you're being impatient). They wouldn't be too bad, but you cannot change direction in the air. I found myself dying by falling off ledges more than anything (because I'm impatient). Otherwise, it feels nice control wise.\n\nThe combat in Hob in primarily done with your sword, but the other abilities you gain in your adventure can also be used. Punching a group of scorpions in the face can be quite satisfying. It also comes with a handy stun! Rolling, slashing, and punching your way through is pretty fun. Although, once you learn how certain monsters work, it can be a little on the easy side. That being said, I have been oneshot by a monster in this game. That\u2019ll teach me for not following map markers provided by a sentient golem that doesn\u2019t speak my language.\n\nThe puzzles usually involve moving large sections of the area. They\u2019re not exactly Myst hard, and you won\u2019t need to bring a notepad or calculator with you. They do make for some pretty cool sights though. Shoving an entire section of an area down to reach the other side is neat.\n\nOverall, Hob is a nice game for people who like platformers and puzzles. It looks nice visually, combat feels good (as it should from Runic Games), and just exploring in general is pretty fun. Aside from anything mentioned above, the only real downside I can see (if you can even call it that) is that it probably isn\u2019t for all ages. This is due to blood, violence, and some dismemberment.", "timestamp_created": 1511694803, "timestamp_updated": 1511694803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

I'm only 2.4 hrs into the game and the performance/quality are fairly disappointing.  The game has crashed twice.  Textures disappear and flicker constantly as I move around the world.  Trees will lose all foliage, details on the ground will vanish then come back as the character moves around.  I'm not exploring a solid place but one where things can vanish and appear back again at any second.  It's very immersion breaking.  My computer is old (i7-3770 and Nvidia GTX 770), but exceeds the minimum requirements.  I tried turning settings down to medium, but the game just looked ugly for it; and the disappearing textures just got worse.\n\nOtherwise the game seems fun, if not a little obtuse.  I've gotten stuck once right at the beginning in the tutorial and had to watch a YT video to figure out where to go.  Almost got stuck a 2nd time before stumbling across a place to climb.  Gameplay seems to consist of:  explore, fight some enemies, wander around looking for a way to progress, repeat.  It's something I could get into, but I think I'll have to set this aside for a few months and hope future bug fixes improve the experience.\n\nedit:  I took opportunity of Black Friday/Cyber Monday to purchase a better graphics card which wasn't on sale.  I bought an Nvidia 1060 6GB which improved on the flashing textures somewhat, but introduced frequent stuttering and hitching of the game.  That's at 1080p and settings set to High (and vsync helped a bit).  Still, performance was disappointing.  \n\nI've since finished the game.  It's an interesting tale, decent combat, puzzles that aren't too hard, with some rather complicated jumping.  I'm changing my review to recommended, but with steep reservations.

One in particular had a section that you can not progress the entire game unless you pass. It's in the vein of a platformer, but can take several tries to complete and for some might be near impossible.

It has a little something for everyone along the way, and is absolutely gorgeous to go through.\n\nBye Runic, thanks for this awesome game!", "timestamp_created": 1511576328, "timestamp_updated": 1511576328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37448883": {"recommendationid": "37448883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056316457", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510452802}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\n1\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u89e3\u8c1c\u90e8\u5206\u4e0d\u770b\u653b\u7565\u4f1a\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e50\u8da3\n2\u6ca1\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u6253\u602a\u7ec3\u7ea7\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5347\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u7b97\u89e3\u8c1c\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\n[spoiler]\u4e0d\u770b\u653b\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6f0f\u6389\u6536\u96c6\u54c1\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5267\u60c5[/spoiler]\n3\u98ce\u666f\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u7f8e\u672f\u5f88\u68d2\uff08\u6700\u5927\u4eae\u70b9\uff09\n\n\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1a\n1\u4e0d\u80fd\u7b97\u662f\u6c99\u76d2\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u7167\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u89e3\u8c1c\uff0c\u8be5\u53bb\u4e0d\u4e86\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u5c31\u662f\u53bb\u4e0d\u4e86\uff0c\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u6c99\u76d2\u65e0\u975e\u662f\u540e\u671f\u53ef\u4ee5\u56de\u8fc7\u5934\u53bb\u524d\u671f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff08\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u662f\u662f\u5267\u60c5\u9700\u8981\uff09\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d70\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002[spoiler]\u5e76\u4e14\u6d41\u7a0b\u8d70\u5b8c\u4e86\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u54c1\u4e5f\u6536\u7684\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\u4e86\u3002[/spoiler]\n2\u6ca1\u6709\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u3002[spoiler]\u901a\u5173\u540e\u6ca1\u4e8b\u5e72\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u770b\u98ce\u666f[/spoiler]\n3\u5267\u60c5\u4e0d\u957f\u3002[spoiler]\u5e76\u5b89\u6392\u5728\u9ad8\u6f6e\u5904\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u5f71\u6ca1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aARPG\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8bdd\u6709\u70b9\u70c2\u5c3e\u7684\u611f\u89c9[/spoiler]\n\n\u94b1\u591a\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e70\uff0c\u62ff\u6765\u5f53\u7535\u5f71\u770b\u7684\u8bdd\u5f88\u503c\uff0c\u5f53\u6e38\u620f\u6765\u73a9\u7684\u8bdd\u5e76\u4e0d\u503c", "timestamp_created": 1511576064, "timestamp_updated": 1511576161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37446597": {"recommendationid": "37446597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971121231", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517175914}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this through three times since I got it, one right after the other.

The art style is unparalleled, the world building new and unique, the gameplay and clockwork game world astonishing. I loved every second of this masterpiece, and will probably return to find all of the collectibles. \n\nReleasing at the same time as Cuphead might have been its downfall, as it seemed everyone ignored this gem while Cuphead (deservedly) absorbed the limelight. \n\nThe main gripe seems to be the fixed camera, but this was a very intentional design choice that is integral to the game play. It\u2019s a minor annoyance at first, but fine once you get your head around it.\n\nRunic Games had more talent on display in their three little gems than most triple A studios show in a decade of fatigued franchises. Their demise means there truly is no justice in this world.    \n\nBuy this game, marvel at its genius, and give the devs some love.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511559889, "timestamp_updated": 1511559889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37418096": {"recommendationid": "37418096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121071860", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511872868}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439, \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0439 \"Ori and the blind forest\" \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \"Nier\". \u041d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e - \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0435. \u0418 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 Sony \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f Journey, \u0442\u043e \u043c\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f Hob. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043a \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a \u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0435\u0451 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e Runic games...\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430 5 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f - \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430 14 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432. \u041c\u0438\u0440 Hob'\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043d.", "timestamp_created": 1511558072, "timestamp_updated": 1511873513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37417718": {"recommendationid": "37417718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015936204", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511369339}, "language": "french", "review": "A l'origine, j'ai achet\u00e9 ce jeu pour un enfant.

The action takes place both above and below ground but each part generally leads to you pulling a lever and watching massive chunks of landscape impressively spin, rise, fall, flip and generally reassemble itself into a configuration which allows you to press forward. There are collectibles which give you a number of advantages (i.e. longer health bar, new powers for your glove thing, etc) in combat but it's not a hard game at the best of times so I didn't even use some of the new powers I ended up with. The story is close to non-existent and even when I arrived without much fanfare at the ending I was none the wiser what was going on. Frankly it doesn't matter though because opening up the map and clearing out all the corruption is the main hook and it doesn't need anything else to grab you. It doesn't have the same beautifully lonely atmosphere of RIME and it's nowhere near as pretty but in some ways it's a more engaging game because it's less linear and has more stuff going on. Overall it's really good stuff and I loved the 10 or so hours it took me to finish it and open the entire map up. PSA: the performance on my PC at least was pretty ropey. It was generally fast and smooth but had blatant issues streaming in new parts of the open world as the frame rate would briefly crash through the floor with irritating regularity so maybe wait for a patch or pick up the PS4 version if it's better.", "timestamp_created": 1511530200, "timestamp_updated": 1511530200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

I'm a crotchety old goat at the best of times, frequently overly critical of games - but this one has that rare quality of delivering me directly to my childhood. A sense of wonder, or the beauty of simplicity? I don't know what it is, but Hob has it. Despite not sharing much in terms of gameplay, it reminds me of Bastion in some ways.\n\nIt isn't for everyone, however. The most commonly-cited criticisms are broadly correct; the basic combat, thin plot, and linearity are all valid complaints. If you don't like Zelda games, and aren't taken by the graphical style and general game environment, Hob probably isn't worth your time. Although I must've fallen to my doom dozens of times in completing it, the game could easily be described as being quite casual, if only due to how simple it is. Go here, unlock this piece of environment with your power glove, beat these enemies - rinse and repeat.\n\nHowever, it's how the familiar formula is delivered that makes the game shine. Everything about the world of Hob conveys a lush beauty that is rarely seen in smaller games like this one. I found myself staying at the various 'vistas' in the game for no reason other than to savour the view. See above...your mileage may vary, but I found the game world to be compelling in all the right ways. Even the way the grass moved captivated me, as ridiculous as that sounds - the animation really is superb across the board, with no wonky physics to be seen. The minimal, poignant soundtrack also does a good job of bolstering the sense of discovery and purity (for lack of a better word), as well as helping you empathise with your avatar at key moments.\n\nThe world is sprawling, but cut into neat sections that you unlock as you progress. This is somewhat linear, but that isn't always a terrible thing. Hob is an example of linearity done well, dressed up in a tux and obscured by the shifting environment. It isn't as simple as 'go here, do this thing', despite what I said above - the environment sees to that. FFX did linearity (mostly) right, while FFXIII got it wrong. Hob falls into the former camp, I feel. The combat is going to feel pretty basic to most people in a post-SoulsBorne gaming landscape, but it's serviceable and offers a sense of progression via weapon upgrades that alter combos slightly, and so forth. Nothing goundbreaking, but I didn't find it grating.\n\nGive Hob a shot. It's a sad state of affairs that Runic has now closed down, but this is a fine game to leave as their parting gift - it's clearly made with a lot of passion, despite the flaws. 2017 has been a bit of a rollercoaster for gaming so far, and shockingly Hob is one of the most enjoyable games I've played this year, despite the heavy competition. Far be it from me to dictate how people game, but I feel that approaching it in the right way will help a lot - leave cynicism (mostly!) at the door and step into the lush greenery with an open mind. Hob doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it sure looks and feels fantastic to experience.", "timestamp_created": 1511401518, "timestamp_updated": 1511401865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26,

Right off the bat, I have to say I really enjoyed my little adventure, of about, 15 hours of gameplay. I'm giving this a 7.5/10. It dropped points for a few reasons. First, it is a tiny bit glitchy... I got stuck in the environment six or seven times where I had to respawn, which was a little annoying, but don't let that put you off. Also, even though the visual style is great, there was nothing really new in terms of gameplay, nothing you haven't already seen in games before, and it even 'literally' borrowed a few mechanics from other games; for example, if you're low on health, be sure to cut the grass and spawn some health (I'm sure you've done that in another popular game). It also drops in framerate on occasion and gets quite chuggy in places. I have a powerful PC too, so if you have a low spec PC, you might want to try it out first. The final thing is a little more feedback would have helped. I got stuck a few times and founf myself wandering, not sure what to do next, but these are minor things in the overall experience. All in all, it's a great little game, quite a large world in which to explore and play, great (dynamic) level design, lots of collectables and a nice character upgrade system.

The creators at Runic Games understand \"show don't tell,\" and Hob does it. Probably the strongest statement I can make about Hob is that it does not have any major flaws for me, at least in terms of art and story. The story is simple and it works, there are questions that are never answered, but nothing that feels forced, awkward, or that logically breaks the story. The designs are consistent, the world is vibrant, and the puzzles are familiar to the genre of puzzle-games yet always have the unique \"Hob\" perspective. Some of the most challenging puzzles for me involved getting up to a ledge I could see, but could not reach, or finding a safe path down to a lower level. A lot of games can't manage the basics, but for me Hob shows just how important the basics are. Hob also features a new world design that I have never seen in any other game. The world of Hob is the most developed character in the game and it hides suprises around every corner. I have played this game for over 20 hours and I think there still might be some corner hidden away that I have not managed to find. I hope the devs will not leave this gem alone. DLC, or even a sequel would be fantastic, especially since there are enough blank spaces in the world map to add new content in the future. For now I will give Hob an enthusiatic 10/10.

They likened it to Zelda, which firmly caught my attention.  So without hesitation I downloaded and started playing.  I'm very glad I did!  The world is like one great big Zelda dungeon complete with labrynthine puzzles that intricately link together.  I felt \"stuck\" on occasion, but I really just had to sit back and think logically about where I can probably go next and look for hints built into the world.  Solving some of the puzzles was definitely rewarding and not overly frustrating.  The game isn't perfect though, as you get severe frame rate stuttering as you transition from area to area.  (It's presumably loading in the background.)  It gets even worse if you Alt-Tab to other apps and come back to the game.  It's like memory gets all fragmented making the stuttering even worse.  If that happens, just save and exit, and it should be much better when you start fresh.  I thought the game was the right length, but after finishing it I wanted to keep playing.

You know those little mechanical details you used to see in games and films? Well they actually do something here.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\nGreat fun to explore and to play. Often games seem to be one [b]or[/b] the other, but in Hob there's plenty to explore and to interact with. From the strange and cute wildlife (which you may cuddle or dice as you please) to crab-like mechanical platforms that even send the baddies fleeing in terror.\n\nThis game also boasts some of the best level design I've ever seen, which ties in with the exploration and puzzles brilliantly. But it's also far more vertical than you might assume from looking at the screenshots, and you'll often get to look over cliff faces to find there's something ahead/below. You might get stumped or lost for a moment, but their little visual cues and overall planning prevents frustration. The game rewards backtracking, which is especially useful once the world shifts or a new ability is unlocked. And there is an immersive fast travel system which you can use too.\n\nIt's also visually unique, having the look of a comic come to life. I feel like I'm playing in and with the concept art for games I grew up playing as a child. And I love the mesmerising soundtrack too - which sneaks out of the ambience nicely and emphasises discoveries. I just wish it'd be playing a bit more often.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nDespite the simple style (which is not a bad thing), the game is quite demanding and can lag at times. To their credit, the developers are constantly improving the game; but the framerate often drops drastically - most commonly when the camera pans up for some cinematic views, or peers down to reveal the depths of the game; which I assume is from loading masses of content at once.\n\nI hope the developers will find a way to improve pre-loading (perhaps by using more RAM) to prevent this. I'm sure that it will also ease the strain on the GPU, allowing less powerful devices to run the game (my Laptop for example, which only has integrated graphics, but a powerful CPU and plenty of RAM).\n\nOther than that, nothing really bothers me about the game... apart from creatures/enemies occasionally [i][b]*poof*[/b][/i] out if existence for seemingly no reason (they're not self terminating due to getting stuck).\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nIt may be a little demanding, but Hob is the most fun I've had in a long time.\n\nI hardly ever get to sit down and play for over an hour with all the projects I have going... and I just spent 3 in a row with my eyes wide and a smile on my face.\n\nNeed I say more?\n\n[h1]9/10[/h1]\n[i](I look forward to giving the last point, once performance has improved)", "timestamp_created": 1509542074, "timestamp_updated": 1521597708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36188337": {"recommendationid": "36188337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006961883", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "       \u53ef\u80fd\u6211\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u4f1a\u6df9\u6ca1\u5728\u597d\u8bc4\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd8\u662f\u8981\u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6211\u624b\u6b8b\u5230\u4ee4\u4eba\u53d1\u6307\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4ed6\u7684\u786e\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u503c\u5f97\u73a9\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u7f3a\u70b9\u4e5f\u662f\u6709\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u50a8\u5b58\u70b9\u5b89\u6392\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u80fd\u591a\u4e00\u4e9b\u50a8\u5b58\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c11\u8dd1\u4e00\u4e9b\u8def\u5c31\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u6700\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1509533168, "timestamp_updated": 1509533168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36185363": {"recommendationid": "36185363", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984356746", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507324241}, "language": "french", "review": "very nice", "timestamp_created": 1509522645, "timestamp_updated": 1509522645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36184358": {"recommendationid": "36184358", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970310047", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507789733}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased Hob mostly based on the reasonable launch price-point of $20 and amazing experience with Torchlight 1 & 2.\n\nI admit I went into this game confused as to what the game was about, not knowing much more than \"The art looks neat, and apparently ther'es a mechanical arm you can upgrade.\"  Unfortunately after several very confusing hours of play, and trying to come back to this game several times, I still can't tell you what the game is about or much more than \"it looks neat, and there's a mechanical arm you can upgrade.\"  Sadly, I've also lost all motivation to continue.\n\nThe underlying vision of this game appears to be centered around explorarion and adventure, where everything about the game is expressed in a non-verbal way.

I only hope that based off what I have written on this game - and not what I had to click in order to post the review - people will be able to understand just one person's experience with this game. \n\nBased off of early footage, it would have been fair to assume that Hob would be a zen puzzle game. The setting appeared to pay tribute to the likes of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, whilst the art assets and sound design all appeared to build upon the signature Runic style, which is to say, a team heavily influenced by their experience with Blizzard, but with a Promethean flair about them. To say that the Torchlight series was anything other than an indie candle which was lit from the inferno of Diablo and WoW would be optimistic. The game's prized [i]ember[/i] says all that needed to be said there. However, it wouldn't be fair to Runic, who did after all work to the best of their means to keep their vision alive, and it paid off for them, and all the loyal players who came to warm themselves by Runic's captured heat. \n\nIt was a source of pain then, when I drew too close to Hob, chargrilled atop Runic's writhing flames. What I had hoped for was another quirksome puzzle game with a few twists, a unfolding narrative, and a creative game world with crisp mechanics and feedback that made progress intuitive and rewarding. In other words, I was hoping for a more spacious and open-ended S-xy Brutale. What I got instead, was a 3D platformer.\n\nEt tu Runic\n\nMy desire to keep my experience as fresh and unspoiled actually left me ignorant as to the game's core operation. I could see why the store page brought with it such a strong suggestion to bring with it a controller. Imagine if one might, the agony of navigating down slippery platforms barely exceeding the width of the dainty protagonist with WASD. The scenery - whilst at first inviting due to it's alien and abstract geometry, becomes lethal and trecherous as only one might expect from decrepit abstract ledges in advanced states of ruin. How ironic. \n\nIt is actually possible to fall off platforms within barely a hair's bredth of error when least expected. After a while of traversing the terrain with minimal difficulty, it may well be possible to blunder into certain death half a dozen ways. I've been oneshot by a troll's club down a narrow chokepoint where the camera is obscured by foliage, I've slipped off a low wall and instanty died after landing on a cactus, and falling into the abyss after holding the line straight with the D key (no wobbly adjustments with a joystick involved). Perhaps my least favourite are the frequent occasions where the feeble character will drop off a ledge and plummit only 30ft or less to result in a torrent of blood. A grizzly, if predictable outcome for us mortals, but quite the contrary to how generous every other platformer from Banjo Kazooie to Mario has always been. I loathe platformers, yet even I was astonished by just how greasy and unforgiving fairly innocent platforms appeared. The novelty wore off bloody fast. \n\nClipping has also continued to be an issue in the game. The occasional moment of being lodged in place between two or more objects in the game has been an infrequent, if vexing experience. A cruel fate which even the QA testers of the game must have raised hell over, for avoiding a game ending bug such as comes from getting trapped in the scenery, is the only reason the respawn option in the main menu exists. After all the energy spent on crafting Hob's world - and the world is very pretty - I can sympathise with Runic's solution to the bug, even if as cynical patches go, it's a devilishly funny one. \n\nCombat plain sucks. Beneath appearances, the core combat functionality is no different to Torchlight's method of click to win. The difference is that at least with Torchlight, the player's avatar could take a hit, and had limited, if sparkly abilities to cast. Hob has a bit of brass, and sure doesn't look like the little slugger ought to be capable of hauling around that impressive robot arm of his. The little guy has limbs that make spaghetti look like seqouia, and he's just as squishy as would be expected. The truth is, I think everybody could have done without combat in Hob. Finding creative ways to evade and defeat the zerg creep would have been enough, without having chittering goblins and those wretched cowards who toss infinite exploding slugs into cramped arenas. They're just the worst. Unlike the obnoxious platforms however, the mobs can be spanked into submission with Hobs aforementioned brass cudgel. It takes a while, but being able to trick mobs into launching themselves into hazards brings the occasional mirth, and after wrestling with the controls, mirth is very much needed. \n\nOh, and whilst I remember, the fact that the keys cannot be rebound is sinful. Runic overlooked one of the essentials of game design. That's a paddling right there, with a dinky brass bat. \n\nWell thank you very much for reading this far. Please don't make the same mistake that I did. Invest in a controller. As pleasing as the world it to the eye, it's still a trecherous one, and even with a stick, expect to die a hundred silly ways.

Very rarely does the game clearly show you what your objective should be, so you are left looking for something to hop onto or looking for a path that you missed. The puzzles that are done well feel fantastic and are very satisfying to complete. I would have liked to have the game zoom in on the objective when entering a new area, then I have a direction to work towards. That small change would already make the game a lot more engaging. \n\n- Camera angles are good, but not great. Too many times I was left wanting to move the camera manually in order to move my character around. The game does a good job 90% of the time, but the other 10% took me out of the game. \n\n- Combat is not engaging or challenging. Movement in this game is fast enough relative to the enemies that it's not necessary to fight anything unless required to move on. When I do have to fight enemies I find myself mashing X and occasionally dodging an attack or two. Enemy variety was extremely low and I was disappointed that they did not significantly change upon entering a new area. I would have liked to see quicker enemeis with more varied attacks to match the protagonist. \n\n- Upgrades are not substantial enough. I didn't feel compelled to get many of the upgrades because they just weren't that useful. The only upgrade I was excited to get was the green cloak which allowed me to move quicker. Combat upgrades saw very little use in my playthrough as I rolled my way through most enemies. \n\n- Performance is inconsistent. I was regularly dropping a large number of frames at medium settings with a GTX 1070 @1440p. It didn't prevent me from finishing the game, but it was annoying at times. \n\n---Positives---\n\n+ The artwork is amazing, as you can probably tell from the previews. You can really sink into the charming world as it transforms, and boy does it transform. \n\n+ Hob does a great job of showing you the story and how to play instead of outright telling you. This might be annoying to some new players, but you quickly catch on. \n\n+ The controls in this game are well done. The character is easy to control and platforming is enjoyable, which I can't say about most 3D platforming games. New abilities are implemented well and gradually introduced in the way they should.\n\n+ Save points are frequent and generally in a useful spot. I only ran into trouble with these when I was backtracking to previous areas. \n\n+ The map does a good job of letting you know what you missed, where you should be going, and even providing hints at how to access specific areas. \n\n---Closing Thoughts---\n\nThere is an amazing game hidden inside Hob that could be revealed if a couple major flaws are fixed, but as it currently stands I cannot recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1509488583, "timestamp_updated": 1509488583, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596974", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36177061": {"recommendationid": "36177061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050341332", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game on both my old pc (i5 2300, gtx 550 ti, 4 GB ram), on which it runs nicely on medium settings in full HD, and on my lenovo laptop (i7 6500u, gt 920 m, 8 Gb ram) which on the other hand (what is quite strange) can smoothly handle only very low settings in HD.

If you've played Journey and felt moved by it, or have played a Zelda game and enjoy exploration, environmental puzzles and fluid combat then you're going to really have fun with Hob.  I've read many online reviews and the Metacritic scores just don't do it justice.  It's not a perfect game, but it really is fun and worth your time and money.\n\nHob is the kind of game that doesn't bore you with tutorials or backstory.  It plops you into its world and lets you explore.  The best way to play is to simply let your intuition and curiosity guide you.  The game does a great job of giving you waypoints so that if you get lost or bored exploring, you have a general sense of where to go and what to do next.  This game can be a very relaxed, zen-like experience, but there's enough mystery, puzzles and combat to keep things entertaining.  I personally feel you should just go where curiosity leads you and enjoy how solving puzzles transforms the landscape and opens up or changes the world.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, Hob shines brightest with its fun environmental puzzles that unlock, change or move portions of the world around.  It's like the world itself is composed of this giant, living puzzle, and to progress, you figure out how to unlock it.  For the most part, the puzzles are fairly straightforward.  There were a few times that I spent maybe 10 minutes wondering exactly how I could get to a certain location, or how a puzzle worked.  Only once or twice did I almost check the Internet for help; but I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't have to.  \n\nThe combat at first is a bit limited.  I kind of wish you could unlock some of the cooler elements earlier in the game so that everyone could enjoy teleporting through enemies and stunning them, or using the glove to knockback enemies.  When you combine the simplistic elements together you can actually create little combos and facing large groups becomes very enjoyable.  So my advice here is to upgrade your sword and your glove as soon as you can and don't forget to keep upgrading as you go.  Because it's not \"necessary\" it can be easy to forget, but it's well worth it.\n\nPlatforming is a little frustrating at times.  I feel like that's one area where the game could be improved.  The character sometimes feels \"floaty\" and not anchored to the world.  If they could get the physics of landing jumps and grabbing ledges the way the Tomb Raider games are able to, this game would be that much closer to perfect.  Even though you'll miss your share of jumps, it's by no means terrible and with all the well placed save points and lack of any real death penalty, it's no big deal anyway.\n\nThe world itself is incredibly beautiful and the art and level design group should be praised.  Animations are lovely.  Even ambient wildlife is beautifully animated and fun to watch and \"pet\".  I absolutely love that the developers allow you to pet animals.  I have wanted to do that in games since forever and it's a lovely touch.  Anyone who appreciates beautiful level design or who loves cell shaded style worlds should play this game just to appreciate how absolutely gorgeous it is.\n\nThe story in Hob is interesting and its mysteries are compelling enough to make you want to see how it all ends.  I enjoyed that there are multiple endings; although, it would've been nice to have a little more reason to choose between them.  In my opinion, there's not a compelling enough argument for one of them.  All that said, the story is somewhat light and I would've loved to have learned a bit more about some of this world's inhabitants and more of the backstory behind it; even if that was through pictograms or some other non-verbal method.\n\nThe game did feel a little short, but that said, I somehow managed to spend 30 hours playing it.  Yes, you can rush through it, but this is a game that you should just take your time and savor. I really hope that Runic adds some DLC to expand on those foggy gray areas on the upper left side of the map; and if not, I hope they consider making a sequel.  Games like Hob are some of my favorites and it feels like they only come along once in a while.

L\u00e0 o\u00f9 on attendait un Torchlight 3, Runic Games a donc fait fi des demandes de ses fans pour tenter une exp\u00e9rience ludique singuli\u00e8re et originale. Point de narration chiante dans Hob, son histoire se d\u00e9voilera sans paroles et sans GPS et autres points de contr\u00f4les obligatoire. On incarne donc une cr\u00e9ature qui va devoir tenter de sauver son monde d'une dr\u00f4le d'infection qui transforme tout ce qu'elle touche en cr\u00e9ature malfaisante ou pire qui vous tue \u00e0 petit feu. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9, notre personnage sera sauv\u00e9 par un robot tout droit \u00e9chapp\u00e9 de son usine et qui va sacrifier son bras pour nous sauver. Apr\u00e8s une courte convalescence, on va vote comprendre que ce bras va nous permettre de nous d\u00e9fendre et d'explorer un monde en mouvement constant gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses capacit\u00e9s.\n\nHob est un jeu sp\u00e9cial et qui fait une tr\u00e8s forte impression dans ces 4-5 premi\u00e8res heures de jeu. On comprend qu'il va falloir se d\u00e9brouiller seul pour avancer et que seul notre sens aiguis\u00e9 de l'observation ainsi que notre curiosit\u00e9 naturelle nous permettra de d\u00e9couvrir des passages secrets et autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'avanc\u00e9e de l'histoire. En gros, il va falloir explorer les diff\u00e9rents niveaux \u00e0 la recherche de petites cr\u00e9atures nous permettant d'\u00e9radiquer d'une zone l'infection. Ce ne sera pas toujours possible de prime abord et il faudra parfois avancer ailleurs pour d\u00e9bloquer une nouvelle comp\u00e9tence comme le fouet afin d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des zones inaccessibles auparavant. Forc\u00e9ment, attendez vous \u00e0 faire pas mal d'aller retours dans le jeu mais sachez qu'il est possible de faire la navette entre diff\u00e9rents centre de t\u00e9l\u00e9portation dont celle de notre base principale o\u00f9 on pourra upgrader notre gant et acqu\u00e9rir de nouvelles am\u00e9liorations diverses.\n\nFistiland, au fond du fun!\nSi le jeu fait tout pour que l'on se sente seul dans un univers hostile et d\u00e9labr\u00e9, on y fera pas mal de rencontres plus ou moins amicales. Hob fait \u00e9galement la part belle aux combats avec un syst\u00e8me simple mais au final tr\u00e8s efficace. Notre gant nous permettra de frapper nos adversaires, de leur faire perdre leur garde ou alors d'enlever des bouts d'armures pour que l'on puisse esp\u00e9rer les toucher. Ajoutez \u00e9galement un bouclier et vous obtenez presque toute la panoplie d'un Zelda! Il faudra aussi utiliser une sorte d'\u00e9p\u00e9e upgradable en trouvant du m\u00e9tal rare et retournant \u00e0 la forge de d\u00e9part. Celle-ci est efficace mais elle n\u00e9cessitera souvent d'\u00eatre tr\u00e8s mobile et d'attaquer avec un bon timing car elle dispose \u00e9galement d'animations lentes et qui vous laisserons \u00e0 la merci d'un contre bien senti des ennemis. Si l'on tape sur un mur par exemple, notre personnage reculera pendant quelques secondes le temps de g\u00e9rer l'impact ce qui nous obligera \u00e0 se battre dans des endroits pas trop exigus. Il est \u00e9galement possible de faire tomber ses adversaires avec le poing en chargeant son attaque pendant quelques secondes ce qui aura comme d\u00e9savantage de nous laisser immobile et donc vuln\u00e9rable.\n\nJ'ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les combats dans Hob mais ils sont tout de m\u00eame assez simplistes et redondant vers la fin du jeu. Le challenge n'est clairement pas dans les combats car on est rarement d\u00e9bord\u00e9 par le nombre de nos ennemis et qu'il est assez simple de se focaliser sur les faibles avant de se retourner vers les forts. Autre point int\u00e9ressant, les ennemis peuvent se toucher entre eux ce qui peut nous aider \u00e0 g\u00e9rer des situations cocasses en les faisant s'entretuer avec un achievement \u00e0 la cl\u00e9. En gros, on meurs bien plus souvent en chutant lamentablement dans les d\u00e9cors qu'au combat et c'est un peu dommage. On est tr\u00e8s rarement mis en danger et seuls quelques combats sp\u00e9cifiques offrent un peu d'adr\u00e9naline et des sueurs froides; c'est d'ailleurs dommage d'avoir le meilleur combat dans une des 2 fins possibles... Frustrant.\n\nAvec une carte, tout est plus simple.\nDans Hob, le monde \u00e9volue au fur et \u00e0 mesure de vos actions. Les niveaux ont une g\u00e9ographie variable et activer des m\u00e9canismes fera monter et descendre des morceaux du monde pour vous lib\u00e9rer le passage vers de nouvelles zones \u00e0 explorer. C'est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la carte incluse dans le jeu que l'on va comprendre que tout est finalement assez lin\u00e9aire et qu'il faudra souvent aller d'un point A vers un point B pour d\u00e9verrouiller un nouveau m\u00e9canisme. On y trouvera \u00e9galement les secrets ainsi que les zones de t\u00e9l\u00e9portation et autres upgrades. A vous donc de vous faire votre propre chemin et de lire la carte pour y trouver votre prochain objectif, celui-ci peut \u00eatre indiqu\u00e9 directement sur la carte mais il vous suffira simplement d'aller l\u00e0 o\u00f9 se trouve les robots g\u00e9ants pour y trouver les cr\u00e9atures pour permettant de 'fister' la cr\u00e9ature responsable de l'infection de la zone. Au pire vous risquez de vous retrouver bloquer 1 heure en tout pendant les 12 heures n\u00e9cessaires pour terminer le jeu en ayant d\u00e9bloquer les 2 fins.\n\nIl y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'inventivit\u00e9 dans l'univers de Hob. Les monstres sont sympathiques et les d\u00e9cors de toute beaut\u00e9. On prend un r\u00e9el plaisir \u00e0 explorer cet univers et \u00e0 tenter de d\u00e9bloquer le plus de secrets possible et \u00e0 aller chercher la petite b\u00eate nous permettant de terminer le jeu \u00e0 100%. La dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu est excellente \u00e0 la vue du prix demand\u00e9, ajoutez \u00e0 cela une bande son vraiment au top par le g\u00e9nial Matt Uelmen dont Gamekult a fait une brillante interview il y a peu. Tout n'est h\u00e9las pas parfait dans Hob, loin de l\u00e0. Sur ma configuration, j'ai eu toutes les peines du monde \u00e0 le faire tourner convenablement (Geforce 1070, i5 et 16Go de RAM) avec \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de soucis de ralentissements inexplicables. Cela ne m'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 de passer du bon temps et de m'amuser mais il a fallu \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de mises \u00e0 jour pour venir \u00e0 bout du probl\u00e8me et j'avais termin\u00e9 le jeu depuis bien longtemps. Rajoutez \u00e0 cela une maniabilit\u00e9 pas toujours \u00e9vidente dans les combats et dans les sauts et vous obtenez des d\u00e9fauts g\u00eanants mais pas r\u00e9dhibitoires pour autant. Comme expliqu\u00e9 plus haut, j'ai eu \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de morts dues \u00e0 ma profonde maladresse et c'est assez frustrant. Jamais assez pour vous faire ragequit le jeu mais assez pour n\u00e9cessiter des temps de pause.\n\n\nSome people just want to watch the world evolve.\nHob est une assez bonne surprise avec son c\u00f4t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s color\u00e9 et son ambiance au top. Si le gameplay est assez basique et que le challenge n'est pas forc\u00e9ment au rendez-vous, on se surprend \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier les moments calmes et contemplatifs que nous propose le jeu par le biais d'endroits sp\u00e9ciaux o\u00f9 l'on peut admirer le d\u00e9cor tranquillement. Les puzzles ne tritureront pas vos neurones et l'on avance \u00e0 bon rythme dans le jeu sans mal. Hob est presque un jeu plus sympathique \u00e0 regarder qu'\u00e0 jouer en y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissant un peu mais cela reste tout de m\u00eame un beau coup de coeur me concernant. J'ai beaucoup appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 l'univers propos\u00e9 et les possibilit\u00e9s offertes par notre gant et notre arme. Le jeu fourmille \u00e9galement de petits d\u00e9tails et autres attentions aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments du d\u00e9cor qui forcent le respect. Pour peu que vous aimiez les jeux ind\u00e9pendants originaux qui s'\u00e9loignent du metroidvania-like et que aimiez l'exploration, Hob constitue un excellent passe temps et se trouve \u00eatre une belle exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 vivre m\u00eame \u00e0 plein tarif!", "timestamp_created": 1509053692, "timestamp_updated": 1509053692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731892", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36023918": {"recommendationid": "36023918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015892696", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508964099}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0445\u0430\u0432\u0441\u044f. \u0426\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0457\u0432\u043a\u0430, \u0449\u0435 \u0446\u0456\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0456\u0448\u0456 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438 \u0456 \u0437\u0432\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1509051311, "timestamp_updated": 1509051311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36021848": {"recommendationid": "36021848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032051825", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515495428}, "language": "english", "review": "Hob is the latest title from Runic Games, the developers of Torchlight 1 & 2. Set in a half organic, half machine world, it\u2019s a wordless action/adventure game filled with exploration, light combat and mild puzzles. Drawing inspiration from titles such as Zelda, Ico and Shadow of Colossus (maybe even a bit of Metroid?), Hob takes things from each game and then adds its own spin on top of them while offering up a couple of new ideas in the process. After a friendly robot names Jeeves seemingly wakes you up to a partially deconstructed planet being taken over by an unknown life form, you start on a journey to get the world back to the way it was, all while finding out a bit more about what happened while you were slumbering.\n\nAfter spending around 30 hours playing the game twice (average playtime seems to be around 10 hours) and spending almost another 35-40 (offline, so i wouldn't be forced to update) just running around exploring and taking screenshots, i can safely say Hob has become one of my favorite games of all time. Even after spending all those hours getting to know the game world pretty thoroughly, i still crave more. While playing, and even afterwards, the feeling of one more thing waiting to be discovered was always present. And i don\u2019t just mean normal gameplay type things (like a new upgrade, story revelations or a brand new area), i also mean things like little spots on the map you haven\u2019t made it to yet, or maybe new paths to objectives you never realized were right in front of you. And this, to me, is why Hob is such a special game. The world, and the characters that inhabit it, are so full of detail, mystery and charm, you can\u2019t help but want to explore and experience every last thing the game has to offer, big or small. Runic Games has utterly succeeded in creating an unique, intriguing and atmospheric world that just begs to be discovered. I never got tired of trying to reach a new vantage point just to take in the beautiful views or scouring the different areas looking for the subtle environmental storytelling.  \n\nI found Hob to be a great mix of exploring, puzzles, combat and platforming. The level design is amazing, always keeping things fresh and interesting. The way the world moves and shifts as you complete objectives is so satisfying. Even small things, like creating steps out of the side of a wall, are moments of joy. The puzzles aren\u2019t difficult yet they offer a light challenge and a nice change of pace. The combat, while simple, is enjoyable and gets even better once you unlock some of your upgrades (the charge/ground punch that blows apart enemies is especially gratifying). A few of these upgrades also enhance your movement, making traveling around the planet easier, quicker and all around more fun. The platforming can also be quite engaging (and even intense at times), however the fixed camera angle (it\u2019s mostly from a top down perspective) got me killed on a few occasions. This is one of the two things i would change about the game if i could. The ability to have a camera i could control would be priceless. Not only for gameplay reasons, but also so i could view this gorgeous game from different perspectives. I almost feel the fixed camera does the game a disservice by limiting what you can see of it, and i desperately want to see it all! Even a first person look around mode would be hugely appreciated. While i can understand one of the reasons for it (to make the player feel small and world feel big) it comes at the cost of a bit of mystery, since you know what\u2019s around almost every corner before you get there. The other thing i would change is the fall damage. It\u2019s a bit too restricting in my opinion, especially for a game that wants you to explore and has lots of potentially fun cliffs you could jump off of.\n\nVisually, the game is a dazzler. I fell in love with the art style the very first time i saw it and love it even more now after completing the game. The attractive colors, the way the cloud shadows roll across the ground, the gently blowing grass that realistically moves as you walk through it. These all help pull you into the world of Hob. Throw in top notch animation, tons of passionately crafted details (like all the animals that help make the world feel alive, the tiny sprite creatures who watch you curiously, and the wavy wind gusts that streak across the screen) and add a moody and relaxing soundtrack and you get quite a magical experience.\n\nI did run into a few glitches during my playthroughs (like falling through a few walls and disappearing water), but nothing too bad. The developers have been hard at work listening to feedback and constantly patching the game though, so i\u2019m confident most/all of the bugs will be ironed out quickly, if they haven\u2019t been fixed already.\n\nAt $20 Hob is a steal. The fun and quality you get for that price is crazy. I think they could have asked $30-35 easily and that would have been more than fair. But at the same time, i\u2019m glad they set it at a lower price point if that means more people are able to experience this wonderful title. It definitely exceeded all my expectations and i hope and pray one day we\u2019ll get another game set in the brilliant world of Hob. Highly highly recommend.  \n\nHuge thanks to Runic Games for the review copy.", "timestamp_created": 1509045614, "timestamp_updated": 1509045614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36017471": {"recommendationid": "36017471", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969117807", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509034821}, "language": "french", "review": "Je viens de le finir et ce jeu est un vrai chef d'oeuvre !

Combat is challenging but fun - it's kind of like Zelda crossed with Dark Souls, because you have to time your attacks carefully and dodge the enemy attacks. Exploration is rewarding - tons of collectible upgrades to find. The puzzles in the dungeons are mostly clever and interesting, and the dungeons themselves are always well-designed and look cool. The design of the world is really impressive too, with different areas and obstacles and creatures to encounter.\n\nThe Bad: The movement can be a bit frustrating at times, as the game uses a fixed camera so you sometimes will jump expecting to land in one position and you'll end up falling or landing somewhere else. The story is difficult to follow at times because there's no dialogue - everything is conveyed by the characters pointing and gesturing - and sometimes I had no idea WHY I was going somewhere, I was just following the marker on the map. The map also doesn't show dungeon entrances, and since dungeons contain collectibles it's very difficult to find them later and collect 100% of the items.\n\nOverall this is a very good game and I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes ARPGs with a focus on the Action, like Zelda, Dark Souls, or Torchlight.", "timestamp_created": 1508712836, "timestamp_updated": 1508712836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35932478": {"recommendationid": "35932478", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961057689", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508709485}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful, mostly very relaxing game.

Great visuals, amazing music and the joy of exploration makes this a great game!! As you keep exploring, you understand the world and its mechanics and that is what will help you solve the puzzles. This game absolutely tells you nothing except where to go and at times it gets frustrating because the paths are well hidden, but its all worth it at the end.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the art style, absolutely stunning!! There are spots where you can sit and just enjoy the view, there were times when i just sat there for minutes.\nFor an indie game and at this price, it sure is a long game(which is great!!). Money well spent. :)\n\nThe one thing i hate about this game is how bad the optimization is. The frame rate drops are the biggest pain in the a**. I have a Gtx 970 and yet this game fails to give me a proper 60fps most of the times even at the lowest settings. I believe this is a issue with majority of the players. The good thing is that the developers are working on it, this game receives regular updates but none of them were able to solve the issue.\n\nI love exploring and collecting stuffs in games and I would have done it if only the fps issue didn't exist. Maybe someday if it is fixed, i'll come back for more. Even with the fps issue, this is an amazing game.

Well not really because the core mechanics of what make those two games great are a filed down mess.\n\nThe majority of this game is walking around the map pushing buttons, and when I say majority I mean 98% of the game is spent doing this. There are no actual challenging puzzles in the game, any puzzle you come across is solved by walking around an area till you find a button you didn\u2019t push, a ladder you haven\u2019t climbed, or a cube you haven\u2019t pushed into the right area. Most of these puzzles became incredibly frustrating because you would hit a button, then an area across the map would have changed slightly and you\u2019d have to figure out what changed. \n \nYou don\u2019t really have to think at all while going through the game, most of the puzzle go as follows. If you hit a dead end, there\u2019s probably a button nearby, and you better push that button so that it lights up another button five rooms back. You spend around an hour in each area pushing buttons, so you can go to another section across the map to push more buttons. It gets incredibly tedious, and really starts wearing on you after you catch onto the fact that there is no more substance to the game.\n\nThroughout the entirety of Hob there were zero bosses, which was a serious problem with the game. It would set you up perfectly for a boss fight, you\u2019d push a button and a huge shutter would happen causing the platform you were on to shoot underground, straight into a massive robot manufacturing facility, were you\u2019d ultimately have to battle a colossal robot scorpion. However, the scorpion never came, there was never going to be a boss fight. You never get to fight that grand robot scorpion, you enter this beautiful looking robot facility, push more buttons, and leave. There is never a boss to challenge your mechanics, and what you\u2019ve learned through the monsters in the area.  Some would say this isn\u2019t really a downside because the game was meant to focus on its story, which is understandable, but it doesn\u2019t help the game from becoming stale.\n\nThere\u2019s minimal combat and whenever you actually do get into a fight, the combat feels stiff and thrown in just as a distraction from the dull task of clicking buttons. You have a roll ability which is comparable to the dash from Hyper Light Drifter, or the Roll in Dark Souls, it grants you a few Invincibility frames and darts you in whichever direction you point the stick. There is no cool down or Stamina bar forcing you to use these rolls strategically. Every fight turns into rolling around until the enemy uses one of his two attacks, then you strike him until you see his attack animation start again. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nThe fighting became so boring and frustrating that I found myself just running past the enemies, because it was better than hitting them in the face with a sword thirty times till they exploded into bits. The only time I wouldn\u2019t run past them was if the game deemed it necessary to kill them to open a door, or lift a platform. There wouldn\u2019t be any indication that you needed to kill them either, you would just have to figure that out through elimination.\n\nThere are two weapons in this game, you have the classic sword, and a robotic fist which you can charge up and hit for damage slightly higher than a basic sword attack, which basically means you\u2019ll never use the Fist unless you need to destroy an enemies Rock Armor. The charge up on this weapon is actually incredibly long for the low damage return, it\u2019s a high-risk weapon with low reward.\n\nThere's also some upgrades to your character which grant you new abilities, the only ones I purchased was the Shield upgrade, which you\u2019ll never use because it costs energy to deflect hits, and slows down the game to an unbearable crawl, and the Teleport behind enemies' ability, which you\u2019ll never use because it costs energy, and you can just roll around practically making you invincible. There are also abilities to change some of your sword combos, like a stab while sprinting combo. This was the only one you would really use, but it never felt ground breaking. You wouldn't unlock the upgrade and say to yourself. \u201cWow, this ability is going to change everything!\u201d It's just more of the same, you hardly even notice using it.\n\nNow onto the worst thing in this entire game, the Grappling Hook. This was the worst thing by far in the whole game. The grappling hook uses energy for you to hold on to the \u201cHook\u201d which in longer platforming sections will seriously frustrate you, it\u2019s already hard enough just using the thing. To jump from hook to hook, you have to make sure your camera, slowly moves itself into position so the next hook is in view, while holding yourself up with the hook running your energy low. You then have to look at it with the left stick till it glows, then I think you press A to latch to it. I say I think because it\u2019s so terrible that sometimes it will just jump you off the hook and you\u2019ll fall to your death. Sometimes you'll jump to the next hook effortlessly, then you'll fly straight back to the previous hook. It\u2019s awful in all regards. There\u2019s a section where you have to do six grapple jumps in a row and after all that work, what do you get? A cloak that you don\u2019t even get to use because it costs eight butterflies which is a ton!\n\nAcross the map there are hidden sections where you can find different Cloaks, each one of these has to be unlocked with a ridiculous number of butterflies. It took me till about three quarters through the game to unlock one of these cloaks. They offer a boost stat effect, for a downside of another stat you have, generally health. The one I bought was the Green cloak which increased your speed. It didn\u2019t really change too much but it is there if you want to collect something to try and spice up your game.\n\nWhile exploring this world you'll come across these Chests you can open, giving you ten green orbs, or a new schematic for an ability or cloak. Early on these chests are a life saver when trying to afford your initial upgrades, and I always felt relieved when I found one.  However, the problem that happens in Hob is the fact that enemies drop these green orbs as well, and they drop way more than the chests. This makes the chests feel like a waste of time trying to collect once you're further into the game, especially when majority of them only have ten green orbs in them. \n \nThe biggest enemy in the entire game is the perspective. The camera is constantly out to get you, making platforms seem in reach when in reality they\u2019re incredibly far away. The cameras are in fixed locations that you cannot rotate, while walking it will snap to a new location sometimes changing the direction you\u2019re moving in causing you to fall off a platform. Slight inclined platforms are some of the most annoying things in this game, you can\u2019t tell where the edge is properly, you don\u2019t know if rounded objects like the pipes you walk on will be collided properly. There is a section where you're climbing a colossus which is fairly broken, once you get to one of its joints it starts pushing your character off. You basically have to fight the game to advance past this section.\n\nLadders are also horrifying, they\u2019re so frustrating it\u2019s difficult to describe. When walking up to a ladder and pushing towards the left once attaching to the ladder it will force you all the way to the left on the actual ladder, forcing you to change the angle of the stick. It seems like a stupid complaint but through the seven-hour play time it really adds up becoming incredibly irritating.\n\nOne thing that gets incredibly annoying is the fact that when every you approach an object your character climbs on it, so you have to get in a very precise location to pull a lever, or you\u2019ll just start climbing on it.

It is a 3D platformer, living puzzle-box of a world, that evolves and changes the further you progress. As soon as I started playing Hob I wanted to know what happened to this place and what was going to happen next.\n\nVisually, it is a work of art.\n\nExploration and discovery are key roles and none of the inhabitants of this world really tell you where to go or what to do. You get to figure that out for yourself. That's part of the fun and once you get it, the flow of the game really draws you in.\n\nAs a game, it is one of few I have played in several years (PC & Consoles) where my excitement to play consistently wasn't driven by some need to do \"daily quests\" or involve myself in some new weekly \"multiplayer modes\" just to climb tiers as a progression scheme.\n\nI just enjoyed the game and wanted to see how it ended.\n\nI recently finished the game and was more than happy with my time spent playing it and the price. Torchlight I/II were awesome, Hob was amazing, and I am already looking forward to whatever Runic Games has to offer next.\n\nMy only recommendations are:\n\n(1) If you get frustrated, go back to areas you may have overlooked with a fresh eye. Don't rush - and resist the urge to \"Google it\". You're only cheating yourself from having that \"Aha! I got it!\" moment that comes from figuring it out for yourself.\n\n(2) A game controller (PS4, using DS4Windows in my case) is really much more fun and natural than a keyboard + mouse. This is my own personal preference, although a game controller is also recommended by the developers.

Puzzles, exploration, item collection, it's all there.  What I liked is the emphasis on the exploration, no matter what direction you took, you always seemed to end up where you where supposed to go, so I never felt lost while moving towards the next objective.  Finding secrets/collectibles was very well implemented.  Some are obvious to find, others a little more obscure and more difficult.  And what I loved was stumbling on a room that a lot of detail went into made specifically just for a health, energy upgrade, etc.  Sound, music, and ambience are all very good.  The art style, aesthetics, character design are top notch.  And of course, the manner of opening new areas/shorcuts is very creative and imaginative, and I was always pleased to watch it unfold.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the camera.  For the most part, it did it's job, but other times I would find my view stuck behind some object, or the angle itself would make me miss jumps.  The camera is just troublesome.  I've had some performance issues with framerate and vsync.  I ran 60 fps for the majority of the time, with skips in framerate during gameplay, and some areas that suffered framerate drops.  You'll also run into quite a few graphical glitches, bugs that broke immersion for me.  There wasn't a whole lot of variety in enemy types, as you'll see the exact enemies in every part of the game.\n\nOverall, aside from the flaws and glitches/bugs, I had a blast with Hob and enjoyed every minute with it.

The world is unique and interesting. The artstyle is enough to sell the game on its own. The mechanics are solid, if a bit lackluster. It also runs very well (at least on my machine anyway) with the framerate dipping below 60 only a couple of times. I ran into a few minor bugs, sure, but only one that forced me to restart the game in order to progress. All in all, it wasn't technically bad.\n\nNow with all the nice things I have to say out of the way, I'm about to rip this game apart.\n\nI was looking for a zelda like experience. 6 hours in, I was wondering where the dungeons where at, where where the boss fights? I've picked up a couple upgrades, but I'm still running with just a sword and a robo fist.\n\nThere are no dungeons in Hob. There's a couple (maybe 3) underground areas that might be large enough to count as dungeons, but they're all so straightforward that they're just a seriese of obsticals.\n\nOnce I got over the initial wow factor of the new areras springing into place, the exploration of the world just swung back and forth between follow the blip on the map, and hunt for the one square centimeter that you haven't stood on yet. Often, the route you're supposed to take is easy to miss, which left me frequently thinking \"what do I do? where do I go?\". That's bad conveyance.\n\nCombat in this game felt like it was trying to be dark souls, and did not succeed. I feel one of the biggest detriments was the lack of variety of ways to kill enemies. You can slash enemies, and you can punch them, and that's pretty much it. Hob would  benefit greatly from some kind of ranged attack, even if it was extremely limited in use.\n\nEnemies could be classified into two groups: Trivial enemies that where basicly no threat so I'd just ignore them, and Absurd enemies that would kill you in one or two hits (three hits if you have almost all the health upgrades) no matter what you do so I'd avoid them as much as possible. While it certainly didn't help that I'm bad at the combat of this game, I didn't feel encouraged to get better. The best solution was the avoid combat, unless of course an enemy sensor eye stalk was in the room. This is a shame, because I like good combat systems. I like killing monsters. I didn't like killing monsters in Hob.\n\nI thought maybe it was because I was using a controller, maybe that's why the combat felt off. So I switched to mouse and keyboard and discovered CARDINAL SIN NUMBER ONE: you cannot rebind the controlls. There are two presets for mouse and keyboard, and one preset for controller. That's it. This right here is enough for me to condemn even the best game. It's 2017, ALL games should have completely rebindable controlls.\n\nThere is only one boss fight in the entire game, and it's at the very end. At this point, I just turned the difficulty down to easy because since I never really practiced the combat during the entirety of the game, I had no hope of actually beating that fight. Also, I just wanted to get to the end already.\n\nOn game length, I beat it in about 13 hours, although someone who doesn't suck could probably do it in half that time. While I'm totally fine with short playtimes  in games if I really had fun with it, I can't say that I really had fun with Hob. I finished it wanting more than it could offer. The last 5 hours of play felt like a slog, I was going through the motions without caring anymore why I was doing them. Knowing all the while that I wouldn't find any worthwhile challenge along the way (and then they spring the game's only boss fight on me, but I already went over that).\n\nI would have loved to see what this game would have been if Runic gave it another year before release. I applaud them for doing something different from what they've done in the past, and I'm sad that I didn't like it as I thought I would.", "timestamp_created": 1508329624, "timestamp_updated": 1508329704, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453077", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35816446": {"recommendationid": "35816446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977745680", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508866797}, "language": "german", "review": "Grandioses Game!

Players must learn to survive, understand their true purpose through acquiring skills, and ultimately transform the nature of the world itself. Hob is presented without text or dialogue. Narrative is revealed as players explore and interact with their mysterious planet, and the strange life forms that inhabit it. Hob features smooth controller gameplay, multi-layered puzzles, and striking visuals.\n\n\nHob is the newest and most ambitious project of Runic Games, a developer made famous by the popular Torchlight franchise.\n\nMoving away from the previous style of Diablo clone games Runic Games delivers Hob. Hob is the name given to a tool used to cut/manipulate gears. This word perfectly defines the main character as you roam through this beautiful world. Hob's world is a machine, and throughout the game, you must master puzzles and dungeons to rearrange the world to what you need it to be. This is a fantastic concept that makes the world seem like a living character on its own. Hob is not a game that will please everyone although I'm sure Hob will please the fans of a good Indie game filled with puzzles and some very subjective story telling.\n\nUnlike the overwhelming majority of games, Hob's plot is transmitted subjectively and artistically. The path is pointed (literally) by the faithful squire of the protagonist and there is also a map to assist the player if he gets lost. Other than this you are on your own. There is no tutorial, which I find refreshing. Runic must feel the player is smart enough not to have their hand held during the opening areas of the game. I respect that. The overall story can be as deep or as light as you want it to be. There are optional rooms to unlock in game that give you a visual clue as to how the world became what it was, but doesn\u2019t tell it to you like other games do. Now I quite enjoyed this as I explored the world more freely than I would have if there was a linear story or even waypoints put in front of me (give me a dot on a map and I will follow it). However, I can see this having the opposite effect on some players. They could become confused by the slow and very subjective storytelling, and find it difficult to progress through the game. \u00a0The game features well thought out puzzles that will require a bit of thinking. Despite the degree of complexity, the gameplay and the puzzles are intuitive and should not cause a headache for most players. Hob also has some satisfying RPG elements. There are a lot of collectibles scattered throughout the world. From sword fragments to improve the character's attack to Heart pieces to upgrade your overall health (Link to the Past anyone???)\u00a0I must say, I fell in love with this game as soon as I saw the art work and E3 trailers earlier this year. The game world is beautiful and the use of colour is executed perfectly. The main world areas above ground are colorful, vibrant and seem full of life, but when you delve into the dungeons there is a distinct change in tone making each area feel ancient and abandoned. The music in the game is perfect with each area/dungeon having its own unique soundtrack.\u00a0\u00a0Hob is a game that is fun and full of life (even if it is a little Zelda-esqe). I highly recommend this game to everyone. It looks and sounds beautiful; the puzzles and combat are satisfying and the dungeons are challenging and different enough not to come across as boring or repetitive.\n\nI played Hob through Steam on launch day and I have held off on my review as there were initially some \u2018bugs\u2019 I encountered. There was an issue with GTX graphics cards that would make the game crash at launch and I also encountered a lot of dropped frames but after a few very quick updates the game now runs smooth as butter.\n\nHob is available now on Playstation 4, Steam, GOG and Humble Bundle\n\nwww.honestgamingreviews.com\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508142001, "timestamp_updated": 1508142001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35766439": {"recommendationid": "35766439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386492647", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513683889}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u67c4\uff01\n\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u8272\u5f69\u9971\u6ee1\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5bcc\u6709\u521b\u610f\n\u89e3\u8ff7\u90e8\u5206\u96be\u5ea6\u7565\u4f4e\uff0c\u8dd1\u56fe\u6240\u8017\u65f6\u95f4\u592a\u957f\n\u5267\u60c5\u57fa\u672c\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u8111\u8865\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11boss\n\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5f88\u503c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u94b1", "timestamp_created": 1508135951, "timestamp_updated": 1508135951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35763642": {"recommendationid": "35763642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192026045", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509857039}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like a chill puzzle adventure with a little bit of fighting then this game is for you. The puzzles are not difficult, in fact the majority of your path will be linear with a few paths that lead off to treasure. The graphics are beautiful and remind me of Borderlands with their comic like look. You can upgrade your sword, health, energy, and even your cloak throughout your travels. There is no dialogue and the inhabitants speak in sim-like babble which gives the game some charm as you get to use your imagination. Their are two endings which you can experience right after each other and their interpretation is up to you.\nThe only problems I had were a few wonky camera angles that did result in death; your character will sometimes bump into a ledge and fall to their death instead of grabbing it, and I found several spots where my character became stuck and I had to respawn. In one of the titans my character also fell through the floor and sustained damage.

It's a bit confusing at first but after encountering world events corresponding to the itels you find, you get the grasp. Go to your work bench and see what \"this full meter\" does to your sword,  and how about these mysterious butterflies ? are these for crafting abilities ? \n\nIn the scenes you'll encounter power up stations, mysterious traps and corruption that you have to do away with in various ways. What's that ridable tripod that gives stuff power ? \n\nIn this game, you find out things by doing and it's sometimes frustrating but just when you're about to get stuck, you discover a new drop or ladder, path or action you have to take that will make you discover the world further. The game doesn't feel linear though, becuase you're mostly poking holes in the corners where you explored and go ever further on the scenario. This is a wonderous adveture to figure out.\n\nSometimes you'll access a passage and a dungeon which will make sense of the progress when you come out of its tail or top end. \n\nSo because there's almost no hand holding I call it \"pragmatism simulator, the game.\" \n\nWhen you are in dungeons you'll unexpectedly find new things you never thought you'd need before, and this is it's very mch like a metroid game, that with every ability found/upgrade, world layer raised or corruption removed, there's an other layer of exploration you can do in the same place.

on Windows 10 (the issue hasn't been fully narrowed down as of writing) there is a pretty high likelyhood that you'll encounter severe dips and stuttering throughout Hob. The only solution so far is to get on the Windows Insider program and update to the Fall Creators Update. This fixed a lot of stuttering for me, but there were still times where my framerate was halved on a GTX 1080.\n\nHob is a good game, but I was having a hard time deciding and started out this review with the intention of not recommending it for the combination of performance issues, and gameplay issues I have. Visual design is great in Hob, I love the Borderlands esque art style, and the world and characters are fully realized. I do have a minor gripe that they have some missteps particularly at the end of the game with the lack of voice acting, but my main criticism lies in the gameplay.\n\nThe core of my issues with Hob's gameplay is due to the camera. You have no camera controls, as it's always locked and determined based on your position in the world. This works very well when you're rebuilding the world and have long shots of entire land chunks coming into scene which is really cool, but in gameplay it feels clunky. It's hard to judge where you're going to jump, so whenever you're doing precision platforming you're at risk of falling to your death. Not to mention for some reason you're stuck with Castlevania jump dedication, meaning as soon as you hit the jump button you're locked in. You get no manueverability whatsoever, which really clashes with the decision to have a locked camera. And considering you'll be doing a lot of jumping, this becomes a major issue. I died multiple times or had to restart puzzles more than once because I wasn't able to judge which direction I needed to point the left stick upon jumping. The camera also obscures your view in multiple areas, but this wasn't nearly as much of an issue.\n\nI really want to recommend Hob and I do if you aren't at risk of performance issues, and know that you won't be frustrated by dying due to camera confusion. I was able to really get into the Hob for the last 3 or so hours of gameplay, but before that it was more of a grind to figure out performance issues and fight against the camera, which was really unfortunate. The game definitely had a lot more potential than was realized. I definitely think the unique \u2018world building\u2019 concepts they have in Hob are worth experiencing, but maybe wait for a price drop and make sure it\u2019ll run well for you.", "timestamp_created": 1508037355, "timestamp_updated": 1508048060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35732443": {"recommendationid": "35732443", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982011454", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507997746}, "language": "english", "review": "I would recommend this game without much thought if it was 12-15\u20ac.\nFor 20\u20ac, the game feels too linear, buggy, and non-challenging.\n\nPersonally I also found myself getting increasingly annoyed with the control-scheme used to climb ladders (walking up to a ladder on your left, you'd be holding the stick to the left. As soon as you touch the ladder, you have to press up. The character in most modern games will simply continue to climb the ladder as long as you hold whatever direction formerly counted as forward. In Hob, this is not the case) and the camera also leaves much to be desired at times.\n\nCombine annoyances like this with very linear maps/puzzles and largely uninspired upgrades which barely improve upon the simplistic combat, you're left with a poorly optimised, mute yet beautiful Zelda-clone.\n\nIf that's what you're looking for, this game is gonna be just your thing, and I'm sure I'd enjoy it a lot if I hadn't just refunded it for its pricetag.", "timestamp_created": 1508025187, "timestamp_updated": 1508025187, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35730766": {"recommendationid": "35730766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118805234", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508018868}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game worth :>", "timestamp_created": 1508019116, "timestamp_updated": 1508019116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35724156": {"recommendationid": "35724156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062114252", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506701307}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u5165\u624b\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u672c\u4eba\u662f\u300a\u706b\u70ac\u300b\u7684\u6b7b\u5fe0\u7c89\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6beb\u4e0d\u72b9\u8c6b\u5c31\u8d2d\u5165\u4e86\uff01\u867d\u7136\u8c1c\u9898\u505a\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u7528\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u63a9\u76d6\u4e0d\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u201c\u7c97\u7cd9\u201d\uff0c\u5c31\u66f4\u522b\u63d0\u548c\u300a\u706b\u70ac\u300b\u6bd4\u4e86\uff01\u5168\u7a0b\u73a9\u4e0b\u6765\u8fd8\u662f\u4e00\u5934\u96fe\u6c34\uff01\u8fd9\u5145\u6ee1\u827a\u672f\u6c14\u606f\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e14\u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4\uff0c\u90a3\u597d\u6b79\u4e5f\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u5230\u5e95\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u56de\u4e8b\u513f\u5427\uff01\u54ce....\u771f\u662f\u53ef\u60dc\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e48\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5236\u4f5c\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5c45\u7136\u540c\u300a\u706b\u70ac\u300b\u5929\u5dee\u5730\u522b\u554a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1508001189, "timestamp_updated": 1508001189, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35723414": {"recommendationid": "35723414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335834845", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508006152}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego excelente lo disfrute de maravilla todas esas 16 horas que me llevo finalizarlo, aunque no lo termine al 100% quede muy satisfecho, los $14 dolares que me costo valieron cada centavo.

It's polished and feels like a finished game (which cannot be said of all games these days).\nI would recommend it to anyone who likes beautiful puzzle platformers with a bit of action and set in a unique world (so, most people?)\n\n[b] Slightly longer [/b]\nIt reminded me of Journey, mixed with The Neverhood (or Armikrog), mixed with some of the charm and je ne sais quoi of old-school games such as Rayman, Jak and Daxter, or Crash Bandicoot; but with updated graphics and modern game design principles applied. That is of course coming from someone with a PS / PC background - someone coming from a Nintendo background would no doubt compare it to Zelda games or Super Mario 64.\nI got from it a feeling I haven't felt from a game in a long time, it's a feeling I can't quite describe, but something akin to nostalgia mixed with innocent curiosity and fun - like I had the opportunity to be a child playing a favourite PS2 game during school break for the first time again.\n\n[b] Longer and more technical [/b]\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n[list]\n    [*][i] Setting: [/i] Beautiful and creatively thought out world\n    [*][i] Pace: [/i] Puzzles are light but interesting; you're never stuck on one thing for long\n    [*][i] Not frustrating: [/i] Save points are regular and the only penalty for dying is going back to the save point, any progress between deaths is automatically kept\n    [*][i] Clear is clear: [/i] Monsters typically don't respawn (with very few exceptions), this means when you're running back to a previous part of the world you're not constantly killing. Once you've cleared an area, it's pretty much clear.\n    [*][i] Tone: [/i] Nice mix of tones that flow well between cuteness, fun, creepy weirdness, sadness, and mystery\n    [*][i] Progression: [/i] Progression is quite clear - you do something and the world changes, opening up new areas and enabling you to go back to old areas to do things you couldn't do earlier that puzzled you (you get \"ah ha, that's what that was for\" moments). You also get more stats and abilities as you go.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n[list]\n    [*][i] Combat: [/i] The combat in Hob is... not perfect. It successfully increases the pace of the game and helps you define new areas from old, and is a bit of an interesting break in tone, plus it informs the plot a little as you go. But it's almost too simple - you get a lot of moves but 80% of them you'll never really use because certain combinations just work more effectively and are less risky. There are also some options to customise combat style (wearing different cloaks which affect your stats), but these take a long time to get, even longer to get more than one, and hard to change between. Plus I didn't tend to find the options that appealing.\n    [*][i] Camera Angles: [/i] You have no control over the camera. Surprisingly this actually works in the game's favor 85% of the time, it simplifies a lot of the gameplay and is used to hint at things you might otherwise miss. However, at times you can get stuck with a weird camera angle that doesn't quite work, and the controls are oriented based on the camera angle... so if it shifts halfway through you running along a ledge all of the sudden you may be running in the wrong direction and fall. Also, running along ledges is hard in general with the angles given.\n    [*][i] Controls: [/i] Some of the controls aren't great, and they're not explained. You have two dodge moves but I didn't even realise this until 1/2 way through the game (and that was by accident). There's also some inconsistency - when climbing up a ladder, 'up' is always 'up', even if the ladder is 90 degrees from the camera angle on the right. Conversely, when using an ability to climb up a ledge, 'up' is the direction the ledge is from you in 2.5D (so usually to the left or right), it isn't necessarily 'up'. Not a game breaker though, it still plays smoothly and you learn to compensate for these inconsistencies after 1 or 2 deaths, just a little annoying.\n    [*][i] Unclear Ending: [/i] If you don't pay close attention to the mural movies found using your sword, and go through both endings, you will likely need to look up an essay dissecting what went down to understand it all. If you do pay attention and go through both, you may still need to look up said essay. For the most part the non-verbal aspect is quite endearing and works, but here the lack of clarity in communication right at the end as the plot is fully revealed can leave you feeling a little confused. I don't think verbalisation was needed, but the visual communication needed to be stepped up one notch - show us a telepathic cutscene of the past, give us slightly easier to understand murals, and/or a longer and more comprehensive pantomime sequence at the end. Something along those lines would have made for less confusion and a better feeling of resolution at the end of the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Neutral [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]The majority of puzzles in Hob are jumping puzzles - you have to work out how to physically get somewhere you can see, and often have to get creative. I like this type of puzzle, but I can understand if people do not.\n    [*]The ending is quite bittersweet. Mild spoiler (as to tone and vague idea behind ending rather than specific plot): [spoiler] It involves a grey choice to make, which some may consider cool and others may consider unsatisfying. To have something heavy placed on your shoulders with no real 'right' answer and both positive and negative outcomes to either option is certainly interesting and different to the norm... But it also leaves you feeling bittersweet either way and unsatisfied that after affecting so much positive change throughout this beautiful world you're now uncertain whether you did the right thing. [/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n[b] Overall [/b]\nThis game will never be my favourite game. It doesn't quite stand up to the design and polish of Ori and The Blind Forest, the uniqueness of Journey, the puzzles and plot of The Talos Principle, or the combat of... well, most games with combat.

Theres some satisfaction finding out how to reach certain locations to get the hidden items, but it never feels like you have to wander aimlessly forever, although I understand some people will see that as a weakness of the game.\n\nThe combat is a little weird for my tastes, doesnt feel responsive or \"snappy\" its a little \"loose\" if that makes any sense, that feeling also extends to other game mechanics like some of the plataforming parts, and other parts where the game feels a little buggy like getting stuck on some geometry or spazing out between some bushes.\n\nI question the choice of camera perspective a little bit, doesnt seem ideal for this type of game, althought they clearly took measures to minimize the problems caused by it (jumps correct the angles if youre a bit off, and you can only fall off ledges if youre sprinting).\n\nA lot could've been done to improve the world map, its already been said but theres no indication of dungeon entrances, I had to look at a map someone made.\n\nJust be prepared to face some sort of glitch (hopefuly you won't, there are't too many), personally I was hit by an enemy while collecting a butterfly, the thing then became un-interactive but I didn't get it, makeing it impossible for me to 100% the game, since im missing 1 butterfly even though I uncovered all the map.\n\nThose problems didn't prevent me to have a blast playing Hob though; watching the world assmble piece by piece and then exploring those places, or the new places formed by a part you previously explored and the new part is great fun.\n\nI would say of you want a zelda-like experience pick this one up, even if its not 'a link to the past', its still an excelent game with a GREAT value (its 20$ but it really feels like a 30$ game).\n", "timestamp_created": 1507933908, "timestamp_updated": 1507933908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35701120": {"recommendationid": "35701120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382503818", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511107554}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u600e\u4e48\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6587", "timestamp_created": 1507928355, "timestamp_updated": 1507928355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35699395": {"recommendationid": "35699395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047186175", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508856169}, "language": "english", "review": "I have not yet finished Hob, but I have played about 8 hours at this point, and I feel very compelled to review it. I don't post a lot of Steam reviews, but for a gem like this I feel like I want everyone to know about it. It's SUCH a crowded year in gaming in 2017, and I fear amazing smaller games like Hob are going to get completely overlooked. But I'm considering putting this in my top five this year, and I've played nearly everything across handhelds, PC and consoles. It's just that good.\n\nHob is being described by many as something like the old top-down Zeldas. But it's much more complex in its RPG elements and combat, and perhaps a little less complex in its puzzle solving and dungeon-ing. Yes, it's linear, but I like that I'm constantly being pulled along and discovering new areas. There are plenty of little hidden upgrades and things for those who want to go the extra mile figuring out how to get to every little area.\n\nWhat initially sold me on Hob was its beautiful, colorful art style. But the gameplay is keeping me thinking about this game even when there are much bigger titles out there like Shadow of War out right now. I just love Hob.\n\nTwo things it could use: More story elements. And fewer bugs -- I've encountered a few 'stuck' moments that required me to reload the game. Hopefully those will get patched out soon, but they are no reason not to play the game because it has frequent save points that automatically save when you walk past them.", "timestamp_created":

suggest this to pretty much anyone.

One last con would be that there's very little replay value, just 'collect-a-thon' achievments and some 'garbs' for different play styles. A new game + (peranently lock on very hard mode maybe even?) would be awesome in my opinion.\n\nI played on hard difficulty, with the purple 'Dynamo' garb on that cuts you health in half, and found the game pretty easy, because of the constant supply of healing items. Maybe if they make a second HOB, or similar game, they'll give you less healing items from the ambient environment.\n\nLast words would be: I hope this development team makes another game, because that was really fun!

storytelling where there's no dialogue (that can be understood at least), where you're put in a world of ancient machinery. Has a lot of similarities in feel to Legend of Zelda, Ico, and Hyperlight Drifter. If you love turning cranks, inserting power cubes, stone doors opening, discovering collectibles in little nooks of the map, and also some light combat to round it out, PLAY THIS.\n\nI love games where you can seamlessly explore and unlock an entire world. There are loading screens for exterior to interior transitions, but in the main world map you're never stopped to wait for a loading bar to finish.\n\nThere are indicators for where you should go next, but none of it hits you in the face unless you've opened the map. Even the menus have no language in them (except for essentials like settings, and tutorial prompts). The delight of exploration, and uncovering new areas is sooooo much fun!\n\nI ran into framerate issues here and there, but the game was so much fun to play, I didn't care. Occasionally the camera angle made platforming difficult (especially deciding which way to point the thumbstick when hanging from edges), but again not a dealbreaker.

It's a 3D action adventure platformer with combat that blends Zelda and Dark Souls. While most of your time is focused on platforming, the occasional combat segments are fun and intense. Platforming is simple but fun. I'd recommend playing with a controller as k/m make things a bit more difficult.\nA lot of your time is spent roaming around trying to figure out where to go next. Sometimes the map includes a marker but even when it's there it can be hard to get to. You'll spend a decent amount of time in dungeons trying to restore order back to the world. These dungeons have small puzzles to solve and secrets to uncover. Hob has a static camera at all times, which leads to some truly gorgeous views but also some issues during combat. I'd say the views are worth it, however.\n\n[h1]Score:[/h1] B+[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\n\nThere isn't much of a story here. You're thrown into a world filled with dangerous goop and tasked to get rid of it.\nRunic takes pride in the lack of dialogue in this game, and i'll give them props for attempting that. It mostly works, though I think the game would benefit from a bit more clarity here and there. As you play, you sort of put together that the world saw some sort of catastrophy and a lot of it has disappeared. By going through dungeons you restore it back to normal. Even with this in mind the game sorta feels like there's no purpose to what you're doing. I'm just kinda doing things and the world reacts to them. Maybe in a sequel we'll get more of a story.\n\n[h1]Score:[/h1] C[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nOh lord does this game look gorgeous. It's one of the best uses of cel-shading I have ever seen. If you're not playing this on high graphics you are really missing out. The color pallette could use some variation. I get that green and purple stand for good and evil here, but there's a bit too much green. It makes it hard to tell where I've been and where I need to go next. The vistas are incredible, however. I've taken a screenshot at every single one and I really want to seek the rest out. Even when it was confusing where to go, the aesthetics were more than enough to keep me occupied.\n\n[h1]Score:[/h1] A+[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nSince there is no dialogue, there's no voice acting to critique. Combat has satisfying sword clashes and fist mashes. The score is hardly prevelant, but when it plays it's easy on the ears. Most of the tracks are quite uplifting, but there's a dark song here and there. I enjoyed it enough that I downloaded the soundtrack and placed it in an ambient work playlist for later. Not much else to say on it.\n\n[h1]Score:[/h1] B[/td]\n    [/tr]\n     [tr]\n        [td]\n[h1]Value:[/h1]\n\nAs you may have seen from other reviews, this game is not for everyone. I enjoyed it despite it's flaws, but not everyone will. If you liked the first Jak and Daxter, you'll LOVE this game. If you don't have patience and would rather blow your way through a linear experience, maybe sit this one out. Depending on how quickly you grasp the game's concepts, your playtime will vary greatly. I have around 12 hours in but an hour and a half of that is idle time. I still have to go back for extra collectibles but I got most of them in my first play. Achievement hunters will want to go back and clear everything out, but otherwise there's really no incentive. For $20 I think the game is definitely worth it. Especially if you're into eye-candy like this.\n\n[h1]Score:[/h1] B+[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[i]Note: I did experience a couple crashes during my play. One every couple of hours. Saves are frequent enough to where this wasn't a huge deal, but it's fairly annoying. Keep that in mind while playing.[/i]\n\nHope my review helped.

On one hand this game has a beautiful scenery and fun gameplay but on the other hand it was hella buggy for me, to the point it made me mad. I played the entire game with the controller.\n\nCONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS.\n\nA few examples for bugs I encountered:\n\n1. In the first 30 Minutes of the game, after you leave the starting area and the two doors get opened by the robot dude, you're able to go back into that area without going back through the doors. This causes the game to keep the doors closed and without the fist you're not able to make the ladder appear to leave the area. \nThis got me stuck for like 20 minutes because I just couldn't figure out how to open those doors, of course it was a bug because those doors should have been open the entire time, you just need to to the right and trigger the opening scene before heading down or else you're basically screwed and have to begin a new game.\n\n2. Enemies suddenly went invisible after they killed me, this was especially annoying with the big guys who have a wide area attack, at one point I couldn't pass an area because I kept getting killed by the invisible enemy. The only solution to that was restarting the game entirely. This happened quite a few times actually and it was gamebreaking.\n\n3. Enemies disappeared in walls, this made it impossible to trigger scenes, like situations where you have to defeat all the enemies in order to make a ladder appear or anything alike. The only solution to that was getting into a teleporter and then teleporting back to the area again, sometimes I had to restart the game too. Pretty time consuming.\n\n4. When starting the game with the launcher, the game got stuck at the first logo sometimes, to the point I had to go back to the login screen to avoid having to restart my PC because it was totally frozen. I avoided this by starting the game without a launcher.\n\n5. Killing certain enemies in some way, I don't know how, causes their death sounds to be played in a loop, for example the guy that throws the exploding blue thingies at you. It was kind of funny though so I wouldn't really want that one to be patched out, it also fades away once you're gone from the area where the enemy is in.\n\nThe jumping in this game is incredibly annoying, mostly because I personally dislike the idea of linear jumping, from the beginning it didn't feel \"right\" to me. I'd have preffered to have air control in a game like this and I still think it would have been better after finishing it. Sometimes it just didn't really register your direction input right and you ended up jumping somewhere you didn't want to jump, especially into an abyss or on the top of thorns and once you're on the top of thorns, you're screwed because you can't jump for some reason and you'll die.\n\nThe enemies are a bit too easy in my opinion, I played the game on very hard and once you got all the patterns down they're really not that hard to beat, it's just a 1 2 3 pattern each time and easy to avoid by rolling. The only difficulty comes up when the game just spams enemies at you but that doesn't really have to do with difficulty but more with mashing your button and teleporting around the area. \n\nBlocking is so goddamn useless in this game, I maybe used the shield like 3 times and it was really unreliable each time, so I always preferred rolling or teleporting over blocking. The upgrade that gives you energy orbs with blocking is pretty nice but that also brought up the question why energy orbs weren't just a normal part of the game? They were pretty useful but I only got to use it in the last fight, where it pretty much saved me.\n\nThe story is really confusing to me unfortunately, to be honest I still have no idea what is going on there or what happened, who the roboter guy is, who the burning lady at the end is, who that silent girl is that you can kill at the end.\nWhat happened when you chose to reach out for the hand of the burning lady? I mean the  game just ended and I got an achievement saying something but I was only baffled and was like \"what the fu*k?\". Those lore rooms didn't help me either, it were just some shapes that moved on a wall so I started ignoring those rooms entirely and stopped looking for \"swordkey\" parts.\n\nThen there are these \"vantage points\" where you can sit down or lean on a wall and look at the scenery I guess? I just thought they were kind of unnecessary because I was admiring the whole landscape the entire time anyway, I love floating islands and stuff like that so the game got to me anyway.\n\nOk, of course the game also has positive aspects, as I already said the scenery is beautiful and I love the whole art style of the game, which is heavily based on shapes.\nThe music was really nice too, harmonized well with the surroundings and everything.\nBut yeah I couldn't get the bad taste out my mouth from all the stuff I mentioned before.\n\nStill I would recommend this game because after they released some patches it already started to run better and I got it quite early after release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507675339, "timestamp_updated": 1507675339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35625706": {"recommendationid": "35625706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059566191", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507756496}, "language": "english", "review": "Embark on an adventure in this 3d-platformer, environment-puzzle story of a world struck by organizm of unknown origin, slowly infesting and restructurizing existing life.\nHelp protagonist activating ancient machinery and push infestation back before the world is completely taken over, all while trying to unravel history of mysterious planet keepers' struggle against the alien biological onslaught.\n\nThis time-stealing masterpiece is one of the best 2017 games, and does it come with AAA price and culture of DLC, micro-transactions, loot boxes, pre-order bonuses and 60$ entry fee?\nNo, you get this fantastic experience for 20$!\n\nIf this isn't worth supporting, I don't know what is and I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

The beautiful visuals and stunning soundtrack don\u2019t make up for some clunky gameplay and a story that may fail to engage players. A team brave enough to change completely genre moving away from a golden goose like Torchlight in order to create a little gem of level design and exploration. A puzzle game full of mysteries and wonder. Runic Games take you on a wondrous mysterious journey through fantastic environments making Hob well worth your time. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, Hob feels like a close cousin to [b]The Legend of Zelda[/b]. A pretty good action-adventure, with a fantastic world eager to be explored with satisfying puzzles and fun. The creature design in this game is so fantastic. The combat system is a little bit too simple, but the experience is really positive. Hob never loses momentum as you dive deeper and deeper into the game. It constantly rewards you by making the game easy to consume and feeling like you can go for just a little longer.  As a result, this is one of the few games that I\u2019ve ever had trouble putting down. The gorgeous artwork might draw you in but the content will not let you leave. All in all It's a really great if at times a little frustrating puzzle/platformer full of Henson-like characters and moodiness reminiscent of films like The Dark Crystal or animated films like Don Bluth's Secret of Nimh.

El juego de Runic Games requiere paciencia y consistencia para disfrutarlo a pleno.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYAR651McII\nAn\u00e1lisis completo publicado [url=https://www.simpatiaporlacritica.com/single-post/2017/10/09/Hob]aqu\u00ed[/url]\n\nDesde el lanzamiento de Torchlight, sobre todo desde la segunda entrega, existe un idilio entre la desarrolladora Runic Games y el gran p\u00fablico gamer. Esta gran aceptaci\u00f3n logr\u00f3 que haya mucha expectativa por el pr\u00f3ximo juego de Runic, que no iba a continuar con la saga Torchlight. El resultado es Hob, cuyo desarrollo tom\u00f3 a\u00f1os de esfuerzo y sacrificio, como suele suceder en todos los estudios independientes. Las conclusiones son dif\u00edciles de clasificar, ya que si bien la aceptaci\u00f3n es favorable, hay varias reservas que nos gustar\u00eda compartir con todos ustedes.\n \nGeneralmente empezamos las rese\u00f1as contando un poco de la historia o la trama del juego. En el caso de Hob, esta tarea se nos dificulta ya que apenas tenemos indicios sobre lo que est\u00e1 ocurriendo en el mundo del juego. De hecho, no hay tutoriales, gu\u00edas de control, sugerencias, di\u00e1logos, absolutamente nada. Los personajes se expresan con sonidos y gestos, haciendo que tengamos que adivinar qu\u00e9 hay que hacer en cada paso que damos. La ausencia de una interfaz que nos lleve de la mano en todo momento no es algo necesariamente malo (quiz\u00e1s los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes lo sientan mas) pero que usualmente funciona en juegos minimalistas. Hob tiene pretensiones \u00e9picas, desde su motor gr\u00e1fico, la amplitud de escenarios, variedad de movimientos, mec\u00e1nicas intrincadas, etc. Es ir\u00f3nico que un juego con tantas aspiraciones tenga un contenido narrativo tan pobre, como si no importara. Estamos de acuerdo que muy de poco vamos entendiendo la historia, pero la sutileza no siempre funciona en todo el p\u00fablico, y consideramos un error depender de ella en un juego de este calibre.\n\nTambi\u00e9n es dif\u00edcil encasillar a Hob en un g\u00e9nero definido. Podemos decir que es un juego de exploraci\u00f3n y puzzles de escenario, tambi\u00e9n se puede llamar un ARPG, o incluso un juego de plataformas. Cada definici\u00f3n por separado ser\u00eda correcta, al igual que todas juntas. A esto apuntamos cuando decimos que \u00e9ste es un juego de por de m\u00e1s ambicioso. Hob pareciera no conformarse con nada, explotar absolutamente todas las ideas que surgieron en el desarrollo, lo cual no siempre es algo bueno. \n \nHay que reconocer, sin embargo, que las mec\u00e1nicas funcionan bien, siempre y cuando logremos entenderlas. Hay un trabajo muy pulido en los movimientos del personaje que son muy ricos en variedad y combinaciones. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los controles simples (saltar, correr, esquivar, atacar) hay una especie de \u00e1rbol de habilidades con skills \u00fanicos que iremos comprando o combinando para ir progresando en nuestro da\u00f1o y resistencia. Por otro lado, todas estas habilidades ser\u00e1n completamente indistintas en el aspecto de exploraci\u00f3n del juego, donde nos pasaremos investigando los escenarios para combinar objetos, descubrir pasajes o poner en funcionamiento extra\u00f1os mecanismos que nos har\u00e1n progresar en la historia.\n \nEsta dualidad de acci\u00f3n y puzzles producen una incomodidad en el gameplay que no logramos sacudir. La complejidad del juego hace que nunca podamos relajarnos y disfrutarlo. Esta tensi\u00f3n de nunca saber totalmente cu\u00e1l es el siguiente paso, eliminar enemigos en el medio y resolver algunos puzzles tambi\u00e9n, producen que no podamos definir a Hob como un juego \"divertido\". Sin embargo, sin duda podemos decir que es un juego interesante.\n \nEn resumen, recomendamos este juego con algunas reservas, advirtiendo claramente que es un t\u00edtulo pensado para un tipo de p\u00fablico y la gran masa de jugadores probablemente no lo entender\u00e1. La calidez de la comunidad con Runic Games salv\u00f3 a este juego de la indiferencia o incluso de la mala prensa. Sin embargo, Runic deber\u00eda tomar nota ya que raramente la industria (y sobre todo los jugadores) dan segundas oportunidades ante un paso en falso.

It makes me wonder how much of an impact that had on its creation.\n\nHob is an interesting experiment that has potential. It has an interesting art style and some interesting design ideas that ultimately fail to mesh together. \n\nThe Good:\nCombat and exploration. \n\nCombat is used sparingly but feels decently rewarding. You react to enemies hitting you, evade and go in for some hits. You don't have to manage stamina or energy and some enemies require you to remove their armor in various ways, but beyond that it's fairly straightforward. I kind of wish that the dodge roll and attacks would require stamina, so that there would be more decision making in the heat of battle. Enemies stay dead forever once slain, so there is not really any incentive to get good at combat either, which is a shame. Sometimes combat is combined with platforming elements, at which point the game becomes very VERY frustrating.\n\nExploration keeps the game going once you are about 2 hours in, because that's about when the game starts giving the player long term goals and the story actually unfolds. Until then players are gated off from most of the interesting content, while the game has to fulfill a long winded first arc of the game. However, once you are free to explore, the game really takes off, and finding upgrades through opening up the environment or revealing new areas was for me the height of the experience.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe concept of no dialogue was a great idea, but it felt poorly executed through the game. Especially during the first two hours you are led by an NPC through the world, not really knowing what to do or indeed why you are doing what you are doing. There is some corruption in the land, but it takes a long while before the game lets you do something about it. Usually no dialogue in games also means that the game will try and communicate with the player in different ways to understand certain new mechanics, especially so in a tutorial. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Hob. I found myself stuck early on because I needed to use a mechanic that the game hadn't even let me know existed in the game before.\n\nPuzzles fall in the same category, and become hard to solve not because they are difficult, but because the game fails to inform the player about all the possible decisions/choices.\n\nControls and camera, and platforming. Easily the worst part of the game are both the controls and camera. The controls change relative to the way the character is facing, not which way the camera is facing, making it really difficult to control the character. The camera itself is fixed to certain locations based on the player's location. The angles chosen for the camera make the game really difficult to maneuver even if doing simple actions such as walking.\n\nThis is exacerbated through the type of level design the game uses, and is especially a huge problem during platforming. I died countless times on the simplest platforming jumps simply because my character would not jump in what otherwise seemed like the right direction. Ladders that were to the sides of the camera were very difficult to climb up, and this was made worse when the camera was obstructed by world geometry.\n\nBased on these things it is hard for me to recommend the game. It's sad when a game that has some really interesting concepts going on, both visually and gameplay wise, is brought down by the lack of fundamental game design (and in the case of Hob's team, actual game designers).", "timestamp_created": 1507513598, "timestamp_updated": 1507513598, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35586702": {"recommendationid": "35586702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158096251", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514183723}, "language": "english", "review": "Best $20 i've ever spent.

First off, I really love the art style. It is very much similar to other Runic Games. Normally, I will not play a game that requires a controller. This is not beacuse of any bias I have against them, it is due to arthritis in my hands. I can't move the sticks as fast as I need to for most games. This one, so far anyways, you do not have to be super fast with the sticks. The timed spots in the game and walking on ledges the controls are very forgiving. The biggest thing that I like about the game is that you can relax while playing it, Sure, it is a platformer, but it tends to lean more twoard the puzzle side. The puzzles are not that hard to figure out. In other words, they do not use \"moon logic\" to figure out. ie the red ribbon, combined with the purple feather and the tin bucket. I also enjoy that fact that the game doesn't hold your hand. It lets you exploe to figure out where to go next instead of telling you.\n\nI highly reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys platformers and puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1507382085, "timestamp_updated": 1507382085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592322", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35543453": {"recommendationid": "35543453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280872744", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507637179}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5730\u56fe\u677f\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5951\u5408\u7b80\u76f4\u662f\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u798f\u97f3", "timestamp_created": 1507380587, "timestamp_updated": 1507380587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35542794": {"recommendationid": "35542794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355886109", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507379109}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1507379008, "timestamp_updated": 1507379008, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35542695": {"recommendationid": "35542695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967453097", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510805910}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoy this game, do not like the random hitching that happens, sometimes happening constantly, usually happens after certain amount of time when playing, hope its fixed soon.\n\nIf you have a gtx 1080 be aware you might run into issues, there also crashing issues, however if not ran into it my self, if heard people that have crash issues run firefox in background, i use chrome my self.\n\nUpdated to windows 10 fall update + bunch of patches for this game, if not had any insane stuttering not even small amount of stuttering, not sure if this was game patch that fixed it or windows 10 fall update, windows 10 creators edition is infamous for its stuttering it causes in games.", "timestamp_created": 1507378760, "timestamp_updated": 1507581492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35541326": {"recommendationid": "35541326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417199412", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516455241}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e05\u65b0\u7684\u753b\u98ce\uff0c\u8212\u9002\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f88\u9002\u5408\u4f11\u95f2\u73a9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1507374737, "timestamp_updated": 1507374737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35540578": {"recommendationid": "35540578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962973141", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508235197}, "language": "german", "review": "Brilliant.

games\n+ you enjoy simple linear platforming, puzzling and combat\n+ you prefer being amused by simple game mechanics rather than by its story\n+ you're looking for a linear gaming experience\n\ndon't buy Hob if:\n\n- [u]you can't stand repetitivity[/u]\n- you don't like simple puzzles based entirely on button pressing and exploration\n- [u]you like enemy diversity and boss fights[/u] (both absent here)\n- you enjoy digging into lore elements and history\n\n[b]Verdict: 6.5/10, good looking but really mediocre game[/b]\nTime required to 100% the main game without a guide: 13-14 hours\nTime required to speedrun it: 4-5 hours\nTime required to get all the achievements: 30 hours (maybe)\n\n[b]Detailed version[/b]\n\n1- [b]The game's strongest point is its aesthetic[/b], which you will be always be able to appreciate thanks to the multiple \"vistas points\" scattered all around the game map (which is quite vast) and through its dungeons, just to show:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1159559567\n\n2- [b]The combat, upgrade system and the enemy variety are predictable and unoriginal[/b], meaning that those hidden schematics you will find will contain predictable (sorry for the repetition....uh. The irony.) and not so \"useful-and-game changing-addition\"; that the enemy variety is absent and that their combat moves and patterns are easily spotted and understandable at a first glance\n\n3- [b]The game is as repetitive as a old man that does nothing all day and that didn't do anything funny or worthwile in his life besides listening to village/ harbor rumors and gossips[/b]\nYou will often have to walk in circles (literally, you will even do it at different heights) to press different buttons that will change the world's appearance and the game's stages in order to allow you to get upgrades and hidden/distant game locations. Even if seeing gears and huge cogs moving and grinding can be quite compelling, seeing it for hours might get you bored or less interested in the gameplay.\n\nREAL LIFE \"RANT-ISH\" EXAMPLE:\n[u][b]The more i played this game the more i had that same feeling that i had while wooing a girl i liked (unsuccessfully): i kinda (pfff) knew she wouldn't say yes eventually, but i was like: \"well, i've started already, let's see how it pans out\". Ofc i ended up with nothing in my hands (Postitive Mental Attitude at its finest) and lot of wasted time and efforts but i was committed to finish what i started (which...i'm not sure what i even had started and accomplished).[/b][/u]\n\nShitty and cheesy jokes aside, the more you'll play, the more you'll realize that there's nothing to play for:\na)[u] boss fights are absent.[/u] Period. Even if there's a \"corrupted world\" theme and gigantic dungeons, forget the idea that you'll be facing grotesque or forgotten creatures. The only fearsome creature you'll face today will be this long winded review\nb) [u]lore elements are extremely rare and not properly explained[/u]. Even accessing to \"lore areas\" and dungeons will not reveal that much to you.\nc) [u]the map is not consistent[/u], meaning that it will show you those collectibles you've missed picking once you'll get enough close to them, but it won't allow you to \"blacken/cross\" them when you've collected them, making the collectibles' hunt less enjoyable. On top of that, dungeons' entrances aren't pointed out on the map and there's no map for underground dungeons\nd) even getting all the butteflies, sword pieces etc WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING WORTHWILE (hence my cheesy rant example). If you want to be really rewarded for your collectible hunting efforts, then play Hollow Knight or Hyper Light Drifter (both reviewed by me, feel free to check and rate my reviews).[b] Getting upgrades won't improve your game experience, it will only allow you to kill enemies more easliy[/b]\n\nTO SUM UP:\nBuy this game if you want an average and pleasant platforming gaming experience, if you're looking for a platforming and adventure masterpiece, LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE, as besides Hob's good visual experience, there's not more to recommend here.\n\nThanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night.", "timestamp_created": 1507281177, "timestamp_updated": 1507282864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706579", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35513696": {"recommendationid": "35513696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048824325", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515323837}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely enjoyable. With mouse + keyboard, control seems a little bit imprecise at times, or the perspective makes control harder than necessary.\nOther than that, very immersive, beautiful. The lack of text and dialogue make you discover the story, or possibilities of what the story could be, which makes the game rather unique.\nThe world is rather big, and changes. So there is replay value, because you simply forget how things were at the beginning, because they look completely different at the end.\nI love the artstyle.

Probably took me a good 8 hours to complete figuring out how to restore the world. Every button reveals an awesome reaction and pressing buttons have never been so satisfying like ever compared to this game.\n\nThis game reminds me if Torchlight met with Soul Reaver and the Legacy of Kain series. Without dialogue, the story reveals a touching depth that can be found from developers with passion to an overall vision of a game. The skills and upgrades only befitting a core character progress that is neat and simple but can evolve in complexity during battle. The core skill upgrade reminds me when Raziel gets his core talent as a wraith, more accesible paths open up across the world, in Hob's case, His replaced arm... 'armaments'. However, the armament upgrade can also be used in battle.\n\nOverall, this game feels short for me in 2017 on whatever price but the feeling this game gives me...that exploration, watching entire terrain shifts due to my actions, the story gradually panning out as I go, figuring out puzzles that arent so megalomanic but rewards it brilliantly, the musical score and creatures of this world, the ambient feeling. All this has been missing in today's heavy hitter AAA games.

There are a ton of parallels, the most important being that you can scythe down patches of grass with your sword (sometimes finding money). \n\nHob features a strong emphasis on environmental puzzles but it also includes weapons and skills + upgrades etc. and enemies throughout, which gives it some needed variation. The monsters you encounter are -not- the focal point and are hardly ever a real obstacle, but to create a fantastical world like this and not have enemies in it at all would simply be a let down. \nThe puzzles themselves as far as difficulty goes are challenging at times but definitely not \"difficult.\" So far I haven't found myself getting stuck on an area for an unreasonable amount of time or ever thinking \"this shit is unfair\". It may be an adventure game but it's definitely one you can just relax and play casually. \n\nThe thing I love most about Hob is the art style. Each new area is breathtaking in it's own way, not to mention the world as a cohesive whole, which grows/opens up to you in surprising ways as you progress forward. \nStylistically in a nut shell I'd say it's somehow both mechanical and magical at the same time.

I do not enjoy a lot of games because things there seem arbitrary and you do not know why something work and why something else does not. Not many games include a manual describing game mechanics, and often it's not possible to figure those out by just playing the game. Well, with Hob, mechanics are well thought out so that they are obvious to you very soon.\n\nThe minuses are in my opinion minor: Combat while is not difficult, can be tedious. Frame rate severely drops on some scenes. The camera angles in certain (rare) locations glitch and it's possible to get stuck inside geometry, so you have to respawn to progress.

Die Spielwelt selbst ist schon wahnsinnig spannend, in den tieften H\u00f6hen bis auf die h\u00f6chsten S\u00e4ulen und Berge, wird einem viel geboten. Ganze Areale lassen sich durch R\u00e4tsel freischalten und /oder \u00e4ndern sich dramatisch, sodass in bekannten Gebieten sich das ein oder andere erreichen l\u00e4sst. \nEs kann zus\u00e4tzlich auch noch neue Kampff\u00e4higkeit oder Upgrades der Waffe oder der Ausr\u00fcstung gesammelt werden, was auch sehr sinnvoll ist. Mit dem freigehaltenen gr\u00fcnen Umhang durch die Spielwelt zu flitzen macht schon Spa\u00df. \nUnd mit jedem Schwertupgrade auch ein neues Archiv in der Spielwelt \u00f6ffnen zu k\u00f6nnen, belohnt das Erkunden unheimlich. Auch wenn Die Archive selbst sehr kryptisch sind. \n\nDas Kampfsystem finde ich gut. Ich w\u00fcrde mir aber eine Eigen Belegung der Tasten w\u00fcnschen statt einfach nur aus 3 Schemata zu w\u00e4hlen. \n\nHob hat aber auch noch einige Probleme, die aber nicht Spielentscheidend sind. \nIch gehe mal davon aus das die noch gepatcht werden.\nDas h\u00e4ufigste was auftritt sind das Items oder das Leben nicht ganz Angezeigt wird, mal ein Gegner unsichtbar ist oder das Gras verschwindet. Aber alles nicht so schwerwiegend. \n\nWas aber einem Schwierigkeiten macht ist die Steuerung!! Mit der Tastatur sind mache Sprungpassagen mehr Gl\u00fcck als K\u00f6nnen. Das Spiel ist auf die Konsole ausgelegt und manche diagonalen Sprungeinlagen schwierig, aber nicht unm\u00f6glich, \ndazu z\u00e4hlt auch der Einsatz der Kopplung an zwei Stellen. \n\nDie Musik, ist eher vernachl\u00e4ssigbar, passt aber ganz gut der Welt, muss man sich aber nicht unbedingt mit kaufen.\n\nTrotz der Macken, hat es viel Spa\u00df gemacht!!!\nGro\u00dfes Lob wegen der sich ver\u00e4nderbaren Spielwelt, Schwerpunkt Level Design.

Some parts will have you scrching your head for a bit but it's not too challenging combat or puzzle wise. It's difficult becuse apparently they got some homeless guy in front of a gas station to test it.

You'll see icons scattered around the map but with no direction as to what they mean (mostly). When a dev makes a game that chooses to go with little to no voice or written directions, you could say that they are lazy. I do. I'm sure they would say they are being \"artistic\".

Yes, it's different but nothing is wrong with that.\n\nThough I should note that I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind it when games get repetitive when the repeated action is fun enough.

A no fight mode with just the riddles would make the game even better for me. Had to look up my prefered ending on YouTube as the final fight was by far to difficult for me even with easy settings. \n\nPro:\n- a world beyond your imagination, completely fresh, i hope for more storys from this world\n- for my taste very nice graphics with soothing music which reminds me of times long gone in diablos tristram ;-)\n- riddles and world are some of the best i have seen, all but one where solvable without help, did not find the start\n- very easy to get in the flow, one more puzzle, one more checkpoint, one more collectable ;-)\n- took me 20 hours to solve, so 1 Euro per hour, very very high value for your money\n- first game i played completely with controller(required!!!), after hundreds of games with mouse/keyboard surprisinly good!\n\nCons (buy and play it, these are just to warn you!):\n- i hate the save system, could not find out how to save my progress to show some sequences again to my wife. wtf?\n- while kind of related to the story, the fights did not help me to enjoy the world, i could very well live without them.\n- if you do not figure out the save system, you can not go back the complete the world beyond some point at the end.\n- never had a console, i assume Hob is pretty much like a console game, so i will never own a console.\n\nI expect to play this game again for my wife in spectator mode, as an avid WoW player (have been, too), a game depending on a controller is completely unplayable for her.\n\nLooking forward to Hob 2 - Hob 10 ;-)\n", "timestamp_created": 1506944966, "timestamp_updated": 1506944966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35412333": {"recommendationid": "35412333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097769716", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513752169}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519\u5f88\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1506943320, "timestamp_updated": 1506943320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35412084": {"recommendationid": "35412084", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981560091", "num_games_owned": 2502, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512885437}, "language": "english", "review": "About 5 hours in and I am enthralled by Hob, a beautiful action/exploration/puzzle RPG.\n\nHob is very different from the previous Runic games (the highly recommended Torchlight games), but has it's own charm.\n\nCombat is light and not overly challenging, but the main focus here seems to be the puzzle/exploration experience. If you are after a relaxing, take it at your own pace type of game this will fill that niche nicely.\n\nFor the headache sufferers this game has no ultra tense moments (so far) and the simple, infrequent combat allows you to play without too much stress and therefore seems suitable for 'light' gaming if you are afflicted with a headache. Frequent save points also allow you to pick up/put down at short notice without losing your progress.

Runic Games decided to make something different from Torchlight and Hob was the result.  Not a complicated game in any point quite simple but sometimes you need to explore to find the right path.\n\nThe combat system is more of the same, you can unlock some extra \"upgrades\" but if you don't go for those the game will not be especially more difficult. The story is there but is not really deep and 2 endings which can be both obtained at the end. The soundtrack is good and I don't know why but I got it for free, maybe because I have also both Torchlight?\n\nTo get the 100% the game could take easy at least 3 or 4 more hours and maybe less depending of your knowledge of the map and how fast you can go. All objects and collectibles appear in the map once you get close enough so no pressure, I'll might go for it in the future.\n\nOne thing that was a problem sometimes is the camera. Because of the level design and how thin are some paths I failed more jumps that I would like dying in the process.\n\nI general a good experience and a relax adventure, in my case no question.

It's also always nice to see narrative evolving in videogames, because Hob's story is not all \"in your face\", since there is no actual English in the world itself, much like in Hyper Light Drifter. I'm sure there will be people who have figured the entire backstory out, but I'm afraid I don't completely understand it except for the big and obvious stuff.

"review": "O aspecto mais interessante de Hob, e aquele que o diferencia de outros jogos similares, \u00e9 a forma como o mundo se desdobra diante do jogador. Ainda existe um mapa vasto, e cada \u00e1rea do mapa se torna acess\u00edvel com o tempo, conforme o jogador avan\u00e7a em sua aventura. Por\u00e9m, ao inv\u00e9s de locais prontos, esperando para serem visitados, o mundo de Hob funciona como um gigantesco quebra-cabe\u00e7as. Plan\u00edcies, florestas, desertos, montanhas. Cada peda\u00e7o do mundo \u00e9 uma pe\u00e7a gigantesca, uma mistura de mat\u00e9ria inorg\u00e2nica e engenhosidade tecnol\u00f3gica. Cabe ao jogador, ent\u00e3o, deslocar essas pe\u00e7as, de modo a desbloquear novos caminhos.\n(...)\nDa mesma forma que o mundo, em geral, os pequenos elementos de Hob tamb\u00e9m se inspiram na mesma constru\u00e7\u00e3o por pe\u00e7as de quebra-cabe\u00e7as. O bra\u00e7o bi\u00f4nico, origem dos poderes utilizados pelo protagonista, ganha peda\u00e7os adicionais ao longo do jogo, que desbloqueiam novas habilidades e mudam a apar\u00eancia da ferramenta. A espada, arma principal contra inimigos, tamb\u00e9m pode sofrer altera\u00e7\u00f5es, se tornando mais poderosa. Mais uma vez, o incremento \u00e9 representado visualmente por um novo agrupamento de pe\u00e7as m\u00f3veis.\n(...)\nPara ajudar na navega\u00e7\u00e3o, al\u00e9m de um mapa detalhado, que mostra a posi\u00e7\u00e3o de colecion\u00e1veis j\u00e1 vistos, o mundo de Hob \u00e9 rico em sua fauna e flora. A ideia da Runic Games foi desenvolver um local neutro, em que tudo o que representasse perigo fosse apenas uma consequ\u00eancia da tentativa de sobreviv\u00eancia de diferentes esp\u00e9cies. Isso significa que h\u00e1 criaturas que ir\u00e3o te atacar, enquanto outras s\u00e3o completamente indefesas. E como n\u00e3o h\u00e1 um time inimigo, todos os ataques desferidos por qualquer ser afetam as criaturas a seu redor. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel, dessa forma, utilizar golpes de inimigos para derrotar outros seres hostis.\n(...)\nA c\u00e2mera. Se fossemos listar qual \u00e9 o maior problema de cada jogo, sem nenhuma d\u00favida uma c\u00e2mera ruim estaria no topo do ranking de maiores falhas. A c\u00e2mera de Hob \u00e9 fixa, e o jogador n\u00e3o pode controlar nenhum aspecto da visibilidade. Isso significa que o est\u00fadio programou cada mudan\u00e7a de perspectiva que ocorre entre salas diferentes do mesmo cen\u00e1rio. O resultado final n\u00e3o \u00e9 de todo ruim, e funciona durante a maior parte do jogo.

So many of the big games seem to want a deep committment of time before they get good.  Others start good but soon turn into a grind, revealing its shallowness.  Sometimes I wonder if I'm outgrowing games and will have to take up gardening or something.\n\nLuckily Hob has come along.  Hob has been fun from the beginning and is still fun.  New mechanics, zones, and story elements are introduced regularly and I'm having a great time.  The pace is not hectic, and the visuals are beautiful.  Eventually I'll finish it, but I actually think it might be worth a replay.  Watching the world evolve is been a unique experience, and it would be worthwhile to watch it again from the beginning.\n\nMany have compared Hob to other games, but I don't think anyone has compared it to 'The Room' series of games.  The way the puzzles work and the way pieces of the landscape fit together remind me on it.\n\nI have a pretty mediocre computer, but have had no issues with this game; it plays pretty smooth.  I've played most of it up until now with a keyboard and mouse, and it wasn't too bad.  But I just splurged on a controller and it makes the game much more enjoyable.  I didn't find the platforming hard with the K&M but combat was a chore.  Now it feels much more fluid.\n\nIt's disappointing this game hasn't received more buzz.  If you're sitting the fence I recommend you give it a try.\n\nEDIT: Finally finished it.  Some have claimed to do it it in 7 hours but it took me twice that.  Except for a brief period at the beginning (when I focused on an objective I couldn't yet achieve) I never was at a loss for something to do, and it seems like you can hit the main objectives in different orders.  I still have many secrets I haven't found, however. There are at least two endings, and the game lets you 'continue' after you've experienced one to try the other.  The endings are open to interpretation; I'm still puzzling out what they mean. Which is good!\n\nIn summary, I'd say this is one of the best games I've played in a while.  Awesome style, gameplay, and value.

Ultimately a recommendation, nonetheless. [/b]\n\nUsing a controller IS recommended. Mouse + keyboard ain't too bad, but the experience is definitely tailored for the controller.\n\nThe games good in the ways you'd expect. Combat's fun and you've got a big ol' world with many secrets to find and places to explore. Art style's neat and there's unlockable abilities along the way, that while few, are fun to use and spaced out well. \n\n[b]However there are a few notable downsides.[/b]\n\nWhile the soundscape of the world is nice and well made, a lack of real music leaves a distinct lack of character to the world. That's right, there is almost no OST.\n\nThe overworld is a clear derivative of the developers work on Torchlight, but far too often leaves you without direction. You know the games that make you go \"wtf where do i go, what do i doooooo...\"? Yeah, that.\n\nThis game lack dialog entirely. This isn't a bad thing in of itself, but most good games that do this tell their stories in other clever ways. This lacks such an alternative. After finishing the game I felt I understood very little about the world, which untimately left the ending feeling very unsatisfying.\n\nThis games overworld (where you spend the majority of your time) suffers from some pretty severe frame drops, which is a real shame. I upgraded PC recently, and was shocked to still be experiencing such issues.\n\n[b]I enjoyed my time in this game for the most part.

Perfectly fine for those who don't mind being confused by a game every now and then but everything is definitley solveable. But the glorious thing about these puzzles is, is that you can go somewhere else to fill your time. Definitely not immediately is everything able to be solved due to needing power ups and ability upgrades. Which is also a nice feature to be able to upgrade your character, which will push you to find all the small hidden paths to get currency, hp and energy. They really are delightful and fulfilling to find once you have finally figured out how to get to some things that are in sight but unreachable at certain points. If you enjoy back tracking to certain areas after pushing further and further in the game, to solve certain things you couldn't before then you will like Hob, this game has plenty of that. There is a story here, but there is 0 dialogue and you have to watch everything as it happens around you to learn what exactly the story is about. It's not hard to grasp but you may miss some things if you are not paying attention. The game has enough to thrive on through just gameplay if you're not interested in the story. \n\nPros:\n- Puzzle solving is fulfilling\n- Atmosphere/Art \n- Upgrading abilities and Character\n- Secrets to find\n- Platforming is great to figure out and becomes more interesting with the introduction of some power-ups (adds to the puzzle solving aspect)\n- Controls are fluid\n\nCons: \n- Enemy mechanics get stale\n- Camera is unadjustable which may lead to (many) deaths from the platforming\n\nPros/Cons:\n- Do not get if you are easily frustrated by not being able to figure out what to do next. This game does not hold your hand. It definitely gives you a push in the right direction but will not help you plainly figure out what/where to do/go next.\n\nTL;DR If you are looking for a game that has story and you don't mind no dialogue with great gameplay and puzzle solving that will not hold your hand then this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1506885890, "timestamp_updated": 1507092993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506579", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35393621": {"recommendationid": "35393621", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971084272", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507388552}, "language": "english", "review": "Hob is a game that is a mix between Zelda and ICO, the world building is great looking, the main characters is charming and the over all flow of the game is well done.

I love the art style and it's definitely reminiscent of Torchlight, which is what led to me looking forward to the release of this game. Exploration is fantastic, and the world expands in a unique way that surprised me when it first happened. As you expand the map, the game does a great job of making sure you can easily and simply move and backtrack between sections of the world. The game doesn't hold your hand with where you're supposed to go and what you're supposed to do, although it doesn't really need to because everything is quite straight-forward.\n\nNow onto the bad. The game doesn't just strongly recommend a controller, it straight up doesn't fully support KB/M. There are no prompts in the game that tell you what key to press, only prompts that tell you what action to press and you have to go through the menus to see what the controls are. The default KB/M controls aren't awful, but I don't see why they couldn't have put in the simple feature for people to choose their own controls and rebind keys. Using the map, especially the fast-travel map is not nearly as nice as I would have hoped, you can't use the mouse at all to select travel points.\n\nFor the most part, using KB/M wasn't that bad, though. There are only one or two instances of platorming that were a pain in the butt, but there's a lot of platforming in this game and the rest was fine. The camera is dynamic but locked, most of the time the camera was placed well but there were a few times it could have been better. The camera does a good job to show you hints about collectibles.\n\nThe game will keep you occupied for about 10 hours, give or take, depending on what kind of pace you play at. Exploring the world is amazing, which is exactly what I was hoping for. As I was playing the game, I was planning on making a point of how easy the game makes it for you to track collectibles. Once you see them they show up on the map so you can go back later and collect them when you have the necessary abilities to. However, now that I've finished the game and have collected everything that I had found, I realize the game does [i]not[/i] make it easy to find what you're missing. Once you find an item on the map, it disappears. This means that if you want to compare to a complete map, or you want to look at your own map and see where the obvious gaps are, you can't tell what you've already collected. The map also doesn't show entrance points to dungeons, and it would have also been nice to be able to see from the main map which collectibles were left at what dungeons. This definitely isn't a game-breaker for me, but it did kill my motivation to 100% the game like I was originally planning to. I would end up having to either run circles around the world, hoping I look in the right places, or follow a video guide and redundantly visit every item location I've already been to.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Beautiful visuals, world feels alive\n- Exploration is awesome and relaxing\n- Combat is fun\n- KB/M controls are okay but the only reason they aren't better is due to developer choice.\n- Map is helpful for your initial world exploration, but awful when you're at the end and want to 100%.\n- Puzzles are a little too simple and straightforward, but they're still engaging enough.\n- Approximately 10 hours of regular gameplay.\n- Performance is fantastic. I played at 5760x1080 and was running over 120fps on ultra a majority of the time, with only occasional dips down to the 60 range. Never went below 60.

I suggest waiting for a major patch or sale, unless you are thirsting for an action adventure with platforming elements.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with great creature design and a new take on a metroidvania-style world, where the world reshapes itself as you progress the story - unlocking new areas and collectibles as you play, as well as changing the geography of old areas. The dungeons often follow a similar theme, unlocking shortcuts or opening new paths as you solve puzzles. The downside to this is that it can sometimes be hard to navigate the world, as old paths are replaced or landmarks move. Sometimes you may wonder if you are even supposed to be able to traverse an area, or have yet to find the solution to an obscure puzzle.\n\nThe enemy variety is pretty good, with different types of enemies that act in unique ways as well as variations that require the use of acquired abilities to defeat. Fights can vary between ridiculously easy to frustrating depending on the enemy combinations and environment, where enemies might kill each other before you even land a hit, or stand in a camera blind spot and make it extremely tedious to end the fight.\n\nAs for the puzzle elements in the game.. They vary as well from extremely easy, to clever, all the way to obscure and frustrating. Sometimes they are basically \"find your way to the next switch\" or \"push the block\", other times it can be pure trial and error just to find out what you're supposed to do. Many of them also involve platforming elements, which opens up another can of worms, namely that the platforming elements are the weakest part of the game and by far the largest issue.\n\nThis is a 3D platformer where the camera is fixed - often at uncomfortable angles - and you can't adjust your trajectory while jumping. Ledge-grabbing is not forgiving, which combined with the camera angles can make it very difficult to land certain jumps and results in you having to repeat sections multiple times until you manage to get across a series of narrow ledges. Sometimes it can be hard to tell if you're even supposed to be able to make a jump or not due to the fixed camera and main character failing to grab ledges repeatedly. To make it even worse some puzzles are timed and involves a series of jumps, which means that you can't even take your time to make sure you line up correctly. This is by far the most frustrating part of the game and if bad platforming has been an issue for you in the past, this may be a deal-breaker.\n\nTo top this off the game has several bugs and issues. I have personally had a crash, several animation issues, texture issues and enemies attacking me from beneath the floor. Nothing severe enough to stop my progression, but it's yet another thing testing my patience.\n\n----------------\n\nAs a quick summary:\n\n+ Great visual design\n+ Charming creature designs\n+ A very compelling world to explore\n+ Fun gameplay with variety\n- Awful platforming, and a lot of it\n- Wildly inconsistent puzzle design\n- A constant feeling of sluggishness to the character during platforming and combat\n- Bugs\n\nIn the end I'm having fun and much of the game gives me a similar feeling to classic Zelda titles, but the game really makes me work through a lot of frustration for those moments. If you can deal with poor platforming this is a very good game for the price, otherwise I'd suggest holding off for a patch that fixes the issues.

The gameplay is also enjoyable and connects basic platforming, light action combat and relaxing puzzling. I especially want to highlight the combat animations and fluidity because I think this aspect is absolutely on point; it's super smooth looking and feeling but retains just the right amount of control you need for the enemies in the game. The game world is quite vast but you'll never get lost. It offers just the right amount of landmarks to navigate around with ease and just enough opportunities to explore dungeons and gather collectibles to satisfy. The verticality and terra forming in Hob is also well-done and impactful.\n\nThe skill and equipment system is servicable but not exceptional. You can upgrade your sword multiple times by collecting the pieces scattered and hidden around the world. You can also unlock skills and cloaks that can be purchased using orbs you gather along the way. I feel the developer could have put more emphasis on combat and the skill/equipment system around it because it feels just so right. But oh well.\n\nStory is okay, there is no spoken dialogue or anything but that fits the game's atmosphere just fine. It's reason enough to keep on discovering the world.\n\nUnfortunately I've got to echo what other reviews already pointed out: The game is riddled with performance issues (specifically hitching/stutter) and scripting bugs. I've found myself wondering what I missed more than once during my playthrough. Turned out some script simply didn't trigger correctly unti l restarted the game and I was stuck despite having fulfilled everything the game asked for. The game also shouldn't stutter on a GTX 1080 paired with a 4790k. I hope the developers adress these issues in the future - especially the scripting bugs because these are really annoying. Still, these issues weren't game-breaking for me so I can still recommend Hob.\n\nAll in all, a truly wonderful experience - but unfortunately this experience right now is tainted by performance issues and bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1506870581, "timestamp_updated": 1506870581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35384917": {"recommendationid": "35384917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096465427", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507307343}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\nPS\uff1a\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u6211\u8df3\u6b7b\u7684\u6b21\u6570\u6bd4\u88ab\u602a\u6253\u6b7b\u7684\u6b21\u6570\u591a\u5f88\u591a", "timestamp_created": 1506870569, "timestamp_updated": 1506870569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35384757": {"recommendationid": "35384757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052962412", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506865502}, "language": "german", "review": "Good game but difficult to understand all of the story, i only got the main parts", "timestamp_created": 1506870307, "timestamp_updated": 1506870307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490976", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35384314": {"recommendationid": "35384314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112366442", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511438893}, "language": "english", "review": "like Zelda, but better.

and set pieces are very atmospheric. I found myself taking a screenshot for almost every vista I happened to find.\n+ Wordless narrative lets you imagine what happened in the world of Hob right to the very end.\n+ Combat is pretty straightforward at first, but obtaining upgrades allows for more creative tactics.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Occasional frame drops in certain areas, even with good hardware, indicate the need for better optimization.\n- Graphical bugs are relatively minor and rare, but they still have the capacity to linger on in your mind as they are quite apparent, which may detract from the experience.\n- Lack of control over the camera can make combat and traversal a little frustrating at times, but it's nothing that will make you throw your keyboard or controller at the wall.\n\nOverall, as a game that seems to borrow a bit from The Legend of Zelda and (to a lesser extent) Metroid, it'll certainly keep you entertained and parhaps a little bit in awe.

Its also quite buggy.  I clipped through walls, watched textures pop in and out, got stuck vibrating between two pieces of terrain, and once even had a baddie play his death sound on loop.  That one was actually fairly amusing.  The worst problem, though, whould be the framerate drops.  Keep in mind I'm running an older gaming machine with a graphics card that was midrange at its time, so that's part of the reason why.  But I've played larger and more detailed games without the same problems.  It doesn't break the game, because most of the time the game ran smoothly, but it is something to watch out for.\n\nBecause of all the bugs, my initial impression of the game wasn't great.  The opening area was pretty, but the tutorial is managed wordlessly and I had already had framerate drops and collision problems.  Also I could do very little to interact with the environment at the start (it is a Metroidvania/Zeldalike, after all) so it all just felt warmed over.  Then I went to the next area, which was desert and electricity themed.  Its by far the worst looking section of the game.  In context, the particle effects and electricity arcs fit right in.  But I hadn't seen the rest yet, and so it struck me as looking cheap.  Fortunately the game really started to open up here, and gameplay started to feel really good.\n\nDespite the rough start, this is a fantastic and beautiful game.  It plays well, looks great and has some interesting mechanics.  You might want to wait for Runic to patch it before pulling the trigger, but if you like exploration games and 3d platformer/brawlers, this will be right up your alley.\n\nJust please, mind the wildlife.", "timestamp_created": 1506842438, "timestamp_updated": 1506842438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35367616": {"recommendationid": "35367616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029656122", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508595401}, "language": "german", "review": "Eines der besten R\u00e4tsel-Jump and Run-Geschicklichkeitsspiele, dass ich je gespielt habe.

I wanted to be able to call it a masterpiece.  There are so many things it gets right.  But there are others it just gets completely wrong.\n\nFirst off, the game has no dialogue and the only text describes you power ups.  The story is not force fed to you, which is good, but is also bewildering.  What makes the game shine is the world.  As you progress through the game, your actions change the world in dramatic ways.  I won't spoil it, but there are two main ways you change the environment, and both are very cool and satisfying.\n\nAt first glance, the game feels kind of like a Zelda game, but not.  You have a sword, you swing it, you roll out of the way and dodge enemies, and sometimes use a shield of sorts.  There isn't a whole lot of combat fortunately, and it works well most of the time.\n\nThe game is mostly about exploring your environment and changing it as I stated before.  And this is really where the game shines.  The environment is so beautiful and masterfully crafted.  The graphics are amazing and the style is off the charts.\n\nWhere the game fails is platforming.  And you have to do a lot of it.  You always have a fixed perspective, and the camera is mostly OK, but there are times where you will jump in a direction and know you will hit your mark, but you somehow won't.  It's always hard to judge precise jumps, which can often be frustrating.  You will die plenty.  Fortunately, load times are quick, but sometimes checkpoints are several minutes back.  \n\nOverall, Runic did an amazing job on a game that I want to call a masterpiece, but I will call it great instead.  I liked feeling like I was actually helping to fix the world, and that part was a lot of fun.  Sadly, the end left a lot to be desired, but that's just how it is with some games.", "timestamp_created": 1506830696, "timestamp_updated": 1506830696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793364", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35361155": {"recommendationid": "35361155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009488702", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506555379}, "language": "english", "review": "Overhyped, over-reliant on the visuals.

You control a mysterious character exploring a bizarre clockwork world. The story presentation is reminiscent of games like Journey or Ico, as there is no (understandable) dialogue, though don't be expecting anything too deep. As you explore, you'll fight a few basic enemies, learn new abilities and combat techniques, and unlock new parts of the world. Its all great fun, if this is the kind of game you like.\n\nBy far the greatest achievement of this game is the environment. Some vistas brought back fond memories of PS2 era platformers like Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank, and Runic put a lot of effort into this world. The art design and level design flow together to create areas that are a joy to discover and explore. I could ask for a bit more variety in tilesets, but the game did offer up one or two surprises, and the world turned out to be quite expansive. \n\nIt is just a shame that the core gameplay mechanics of platforming and combat are not entirely as polished as I would like. You have the usual assortment of block puzzles, grapple points, climable surfaces and so forth, and most of the traversal is pretty simple. I was surprised occasionally by a clever secret, which would often lie in areas which required some thinking to reach.\n\nUnfortunately, the platforming suffers slightly because it is 3D movement with an isometric camera, so expect miss-judged jumps, odd angles and inconvenient perspectives to get in the way of your enjoyment. Sometimes I'd encounter bugs where I'd jump out of the geometry, with no way back but to kill myself. A particular section required me to blindly jump down a pit, after which I died several times for no clear reason. Then, once, it just worked, for no apparent reason either. These issues don't crop up too often, but really pull you out of the experience when they do. \n\nSadly, the simplistic combat suffers from much the same issue. Its passable, but not great. You have dashes, stomps and charge attacks in addition to your standard sword swings, and can upgrade powers along the way, but it never quite clicked for me. Everything feels just a bit too sluggish. This isn't the super slick combat of something like Hyper Light Drifter. Too often I'd want to land a strike or blink out of the way of an attack and my character would just do nothing. The lock on feels useless, especially after I found out every enemy was weak to just running around them in circles and using sword dash.\n\nSo it sounds like all I have are complaints, but the fact of the matter is I still enjoyed it. The issues with the camera perspective and the combat are not serious issues, as when these function as intended, they didn't get in the way of the fun. \n\nOverall I'd recommend this game because it scratches an itch for games we rarely get on PC. If you love exploring environments, collecting powerups, and just being in a gorgeous stylized world, I think you'd enjoy this game. It will surprise you in ways I don't really want to spoil. The game is longer than I expected, especially if you are looking to collect everything.\n\nThe game came for me at just the right time, and I couldn't help but come back to it each night, and see the journey through to the end.

There are people who are complaining about this game because it doesn't explain what's going on and you have to actually figure it out for yourself. These people are all wrong (although I'd still like Torchlight 3 please, Runic, hint hint).\n\nHob is a good game. It looks lovely, it sounds lovely, It plays well.\n\nI reject most puzzle-platformers because the precision needed for the jumping puzzles makes me crazy - try something a dozen times and fall every time at the last step of a fifteen-minute jump sequence, throw my computer out the window. That did not happen here. Well, not more than a couple of times. It's very forgiving (the grappling is the hardest part to master).\n\nThe exploration is good, there's a lot of hidden things to find, and the way the landscape continually rearranges itself as you do things is awesome.\n\nThe fighting ... well, I played on easy difficulty so I don't know how horrible it is on other difficulty levels, but I enjoyed it. The game plays fair - each type of enemy has a technique and it's fairly easy to figure out what to do in each case.\n\nNow the bad stuff.\n\nYou really will want a controller for this, or you're going to have a lot of trouble doing things like making jumps successfully across a gap in a CURVED walkway. Fortunately, it played pretty well with controller (I used the Steam Controller).\n\nThere is no free camera movement and sometimes the decisions they've made about where to place the camera in a scene are a little baffling.\n\nThere are still quite a few bugs. I didn't encounter any that were game-breaking, but others have. There was one point where I had to exit and reload to unstick a movable object that refused to move.\n\nThe last three minutes of the game are horrible. You are asked to choose one of two endings.

Sadly it's a rather big disappointment.\nLet's start with a good side: the stylized graphics. It's great, nice grass vertex shaders, so much work on the animations and how they are so well embedded in the game world. The universe is intriguing and was the only thing that got me keeping pushing further into the game despite it's design flaws. It's a great art pipeline demonstration from Runic Games and everyone involved should feel proud of this hard work.\n\n\nTHE COMBAT !\n\nWhere things shatters is how dramatically coherent the art direction fits the gameplay: a mechanical, redundant and therefore predictable experience.\nThe game mechanics are rather poor. Combat wise it really feels like a nerfed Hyper Light Drifter. Controls are really well made and feels right don't misunderstand me, but it's the actual combat mechanics that feel off.\n\nFor attacking you got :\n- A sword swing : fast, normal damage. Low risk, low reward...\n- A simple punch : slow, normal damage. Higher risk, low reward...\n- A charged punch : really slow, slightly higher damage... Or is it just my brain trying to make sense of this mess ? Biggest risk, low reward...\nFrom the attack system only it's already falling apart. You end up always using the sword for any situations making this big arm of yours pretty useless for such a defining characteristic.\n\nFor defending you have :\n- A doge roll : fast, normal range, no energy use. Low risk, normal reward.\n- A lightning dash : instant, normal range, cost a full energy bar, is stopped by any enemy. (Unless you buy an upgrade.) Low risk, high reward, resource cost compensation.\n- A shield (Haven't actually bough the upgrade so I can't tell, but it feels quite static for this kind of gameplay. Furthermore I haven't met any enemy on which it would be interesting to use a reflect mechanic.)\nDogging feels meh, it hasn't much flavor. And it sure isn't enough to prevent me from ending up bored of those combats.\n\nEnemies :\nI have met more than 8 enemy archetypes in about 2h of gameplay. They all got there own 3D model, animations. There is no color-swap and mesh reuse is almost inexistent. I'm so impressed by the technicity deployed here. But there actual combat patterns feels the same. I approach each confrontation using the same low risk high reward boring combat mechanics, to beat them down the same boring way. This makes me really sad for all the hard work put into this game.\n\nI don't understand what kind of fun or emotion this combat feature as a hole tries to convey me. And I feel so disconnected from it. It fails as skill driven combat system where games like Nier: Automata or even Hollow Knight shines. It fails as a discovery based combat systems where Dark Souls or Monster Hunter are at there best. It fails as an empowerment based combat system where Path of Exile or your own previews game Torchlight succeed at keeping players attention for the fuill first hours. And there is so many unique combat systems out there like Undertale, Crypt of the NecroDancer or One Finger Death Punch, what does Hob brings ? Hob doesn't nearly beat the kings, neither does he bring anything exotic to the table. Why wasn't this combat feature cut from the game ?\n\n\nTHE PLATFORMING !\n\nWhat platforming ? There definitely is a jump mechanic in the game and it sure is used to jump from platform from platform. But it's as interesting as the other 80% of the game witch is running, not falling, walking, not falling, running, falling ... no wait you can't unless you perform a jump. Great, on less tension to the game. Why no also make the platforming extremely permissive ? Well it's done. And now let's challenge our player in those amassing platforming levels... Well it's so easy it feels no different than running on plain ground. It's fine for a game to make platforming feel this fluid if its not it's main. But if it's not platforming I'm still searching why I should keep playing this game. When failing at those platforming challenges presented as some variation from the level designers it doesn't feel like we actually made a mistake, but more like our nanny stopped babysitting us for a second.\n\n\nTHE PUZZLES !\n\nI really hate redundancy but ... What puzzles ? Everything is literally laid down : both the problems and the answers. Big shiny buttons, prompting you to use your sword button to perform an action with your fist. Good work here on the diegetic guiding : the path is drawn by lights, energy networks, well outlined climbable surfaces and shifting camera to emphasize elements. I understand that giving all this information to the player is important not to get him lost. But hey, the point of showing him the way is to lead him from on interesting thing to the next so he don't lose time doing the boring stuff. But if combat isn't interesting, platforming is so permissive and puzzle are already answered for us where is this next interesting thing you are trying to lead us Hob ?\n\nIf I was ever to reopen the game it would be to discover more of those environments and still be amassed by those cool animations. But I'll have to force myself to go trough this annoying design. It frustrate me to see so much work be wasted in such a dumb way. It feels like this game didn't had a clear goal of where it wanted to go... gameplay wise.", "timestamp_created": 1506811031, "timestamp_updated": 1506811031, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7,

I gave as much feedback as I could and reported everything odd that I encountered. I still am actively reporting issues as I go through multiple replays in order to unlock the remaining achievements and hopefully keep improving the game to be its best self!\n\nEnough about that, let's talk Hob!\nThe game is incredible! It has a very beautiful, comicy artstyle, that I truly liked. The soundtrack is magical and endearing and the leveldesign is creative and definitely one of the highlights for me. Although the progression is just like in similar games, where the world is gradually unlocked and backtracking allows for new paths to be taken, the beauty lies in the way this feature is implemented. You as the character activate gigantic, old machines to add massive tiles of land onto the world. Solve puzzles to change small portions of the environment or simply PUNCH buttons to add convenient ladders as you go.\n\nHob offers fun little puzzles - never too difficult -, moderate platforming - never too frustrating - and a solid combatsystem - never too challenging.\nOn higher difficulty settings the enemies start hitting like trucks, able to knock you back into your respawn pod with a solitary smack to the face. But the clever usage of your abilities and a very responsive combatsystem reward your continuously improving combatskills to overcome every foe.\nWithout any major spoilers though, I felt a distinctive lack of boss encounters. Having a plethora of tough boss encounters is always something im looking forward in video games. This was (possibly on purpose) missing and I honestly would have loved to see, what they could have come up with.\n\nCollectibles: I love collectibles! And Hob has them: \nHeartcontainers (oh I haven't mentioned the Zelda influence yet, well duh.. it's pretty hobvious!), Upgrades for your Masterkey (Just brilliant! Way smarter than just a sword.), new cloaks (You can look just like Li.. someone wearing a green cloak!), upgrades for you fist, new abilities, additional energytanks, butterflies and achievements!\n\nWith all this in mind, there was one final touch, that made me truly and deeply appreciate Hob. And that was one specific aspect regarding the storytelling. You see, not just the hero is a mute this time around. Everyone is. No annoying voice overs. No textbubbles to scroll through.

It\u00b4s linear. You sometimes have to search a lot around little areas to find the right way. It has no voiceover or story. And there is an achievment for speedrunning it in under 5 hours...\n\nBUT: It\u00b4s been a long time since I had so much fun with a Metroidvania. It\u00b4s simply beautiful. It has so many \"wow\" moments. Every frustating situation rewards you afterwards.

The puzzles are mainly straightforward and level geometry based so as not to cause any huge blocks to the flow and progression.  The storyline could have used some more meat on it in my opinion.

Decir que el juego me ha decepcionado mucho. El trailer es muy enga\u00f1oso ya que te da a entender que es un juego de exploracion y accion. Nada mas lejos de la realidad. Es tremendamente lineal, para mi casi rayando un walking simulator, si no fuera porque hay otras mecanicas. Los puzzles, si se le puede llamar asi, no suponen ningun reto, simplemente dale a este boton y ahora dale a este otro, para ni\u00f1os de 3 a\u00f1os. Y los enemigos son poco variados y no hay muchos en cantidad.\n\nEl concepto me gusta, es muy bonito y graficamente esta bien trabajado, sin contar con los bugs iniciales, caidas constantes de FPS, pero cosas que se le puede perdonar a menos que tengas un PC de gama baja. Pienso que se le podr\u00eda haber sacado mucho mas jugo a este juego, me esperaba otra cosa la verdad. Lamentandolo mucho no puedo recomendarlo.\n\nActualizo: Bueno una vez finalizado, decir que ni de broma os compreis este juego. Esta LLENO de bugs. Hasta el punto de ver enemigos invisibles, quedarte atascado en muros e incluso quedarme atascado en un pilar sin poder avanzar mas en el juego. He tenido que entrar en la carpeta del juego e ingeniarmelas para conseguir meter un save anterior.

From the hybrid creatures with endearing animation, the environment which seems alive, to the sound engineering, everything fits together perfectly.\n\nInitially a little confusing, as the game does not fall into the all too common pattern of exposition that we see in so many games, you are thrown into a world where there is little of what we would consider 'traditional' language. The characters don't speak in any traditional sense, yet they communicate, through noises, gestures and animation, the environment provides audio and visual cues. This may make initially playing it a little jarring, as you don't get someone telling you specifically what to do, which includes telling you what your purpose is.\n\nNot knowing your motivation you can ignore the guidance of the construct that greets you on first starting out - in fact you are free to explore. Whether following the guidance, or exploring on your own, you will quickly discover that there is a corruption blocking your way forward. This corruption, or at very least the existence of it, is perhaps the least original part of the game, but only because it is somewhat of a heroes journey staple, something we've seen before in games. It works, however, as these things often do. It likely reminded various players of different things, but I was reminded of at times the \"flood\" from Halo or the Zerg. Reminiscent but not a carbon copy.\n\nAs you progress the story unfolds through scripted moments and some of the discoverable areas, plus history built into the landscape you travel through - imagine being an archeologist or anthropologist visiting an area where you didn't speak the language, you look for knowledge in the world around you. You also get a sense of the story from interactions with the other inhabitants; the passive creatures you meet may provide their own guidance, and for me the gestural cues delivered by a combination of the art, animation and sound were superbly done, feeling like being communicated with rather than just present for a monologue.\n\nThe world itself is a construct, moving as you visit and engage new areas, shifting previously inaccessible areas to make them available, sometimes taking areas from undergound and knitting them into the world above. Awesome to watch as massive chunks of landmass move and shift, sometimes flying past you.\n\nOpinions may vary on the puzzles, some feel them too easy, others find them too cryptic, others too linear. My opinion is that if you view it from a more overall perspective they strike an even balance.\n\nI haven't finished the game, I would estimate I am about half way through, however I've definitely taken my time to soak up every discoverable vista, spent time trying to befriend beasts and look for every hidden rune, marker or half-obscured fallen giant. With a speed-run achievement set at 5 hours, the general consensus, and I'd agree, is that a typical play through might be around the 15-20 hours if you aren't lingering to just enjoy the world.\n\nIn summary I feel like this game represents what artists can achieve when they are working on something that they are passionate about. The art, the direction, the design, the emotion and the sound, everything is just done so well that on their own each is great, but when taken as a whole the sum is greater than the parts.\n\nAnd finally, the developers. Engaged. It's not unique for developers to engage with their players, but it's certainly not the norm. From them posting feedback, and responding to it, on their live Discord server, to the blogs and developer interviews, they demonstrate that they love what they do.\n\nWith the sad news of Runic Games studio being closed by the company which owned them, I can only epilogue this review with:\nThe final outing from Runic Games demonstrates their passion for *creating* games, not just churning them out. The work the team achieved was amazing, it's just a shame we wont be seeing more from them as a family (but we'll undoubtedly see them all move on to other projects which they will bring their passion to).", "timestamp_created": 1506751847, "timestamp_updated": 1511837942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35324203": {"recommendationid": "35324203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964379853", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506749729}, "language": "english", "review": "A little Zelda, a little Shadow of the Colussus.

The world is pretty large, and is only made larger by underground areas, the removal of rot which opens up new pathing, and the ability to literally rearrange the world; blocks of the world rise and fall by your hand to allow access to regions that were otherwise inaccessible.\n\nMain points:\n- The world is pretty open for exploration. There will be objectives marked on your map, but it's up to you to figure out how to get there and what to do once you're there.\n- The combat is smooth and satisfying. I feel that \"simplified Souls-like, but still requiring skill\" is a good description.\n- There are upgrades and whatnot for your character: new moves and different costumes which slightly change how difficult the game is. Personally, I chose a costume that limited my health, but increased energy recovery speed.\n- IT HAS A WATER LEVEL!\n- The puzzles are satisfying. I heard a youtuber describe the world as fixing a jigsaw puzzle which someone had put together incorrectly, and I'd say that's pretty accurate.\n- It seems to draw influence from Journey/Abzu (storytelling), as well as Hyper Light Drifter (storytelling and environment).\n\nOverall, I love this game.

There is a total lack of any kind of tutorial or guidance...

The beauty of it is that, because the camera is always pointing north, the map is always pointing in the correct direction!

When you approach one of these hotspots a blue X appears (or kb/mouse equivalent) and you press X to make something happen. There might be a handle that you use to pull a giant stone circle into position, drag a block into an alcove to activate something, or punch a button to send something spinning.\n\nThe target items are dotted around the map, and when you discover/activate them they disappear from the map, so it's always populated with yet-undiscovered targets, and new areas/items are revealed on the map as you unlock them in-world. The route towards these items is never as straightforward as it appears on the map, it always turns out to be convoluted, festooned with obstacles and requiring mechanisms to be activated to open the way.\n\nMany games have 3D graphics, it's not a big deal. However, this is not just 3D graphics, the world has vertical DEPTH. You're always climbing to high points and descending into caves and secret passageways. Finding your way up and down is just as important as pinpointing your location on the map overview. It's a labyrinth full of weird and wonderful contraptions, monsters, animals and fairies. Every time you turn a corner there's something new, hour after hour. Did I mention how massive this game is?\n\nAs you move through the world you collect powerups, hidden butterflies and artifacts. You battle enemy monsters. You pet friendly wildlife. You activate all manner of giant mechanisms made of stone, shining metal and glowing buttons. But most of all, you explore every nook and cranny, high and low, punching your way through walls (and the ground!) to reveal hidden tunnels and pathways, and dragging blocks and contraptions around, fitting them into inactive mechanisms to bring them to life.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\n\nEvery so often you come across a group of enemies. I'm playing on medium (default) difficulty, there is also easy, hard and very hard available. Medium is an apt description. There's enough challenge that you have to make a few attempts but it never reaches the point of frustration.\n\nEach type of monster has its own weakness. [snip] They all have their individual victory cries and gestures when they win the battle, but once defeated their death is permanent and they're cleared from the map never to be seen again regardless of Hob's respawns. This makes them the best indicator of new areas because if you find a monster it means you haven't been there before, and once you've defeated them you can look around for new collectibles and mechanisms in that area. The corpses take a while to decompose, so you can even identify recently-conquered areas from the older ones which are clear of bodies.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\n\nKeyboard/mouse is an option, but this really must be played with a controller. I can honestly say that this is the most satisfying use of a controller I've ever experienced... [snip]\n\nThe piece de resistance is the controller rumble. It's brilliant. You jump from a height and you feel your landing. Get too near a lightning emitter and it'll tingle to warn you. When big stone mechanisms are activated, the grinding sounds are complemented by a heavy shake. I can't get enough of it.\n\n[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]\n\nThere are many good things to say about Hob, but if I had to pick one aspect that really sets this apart from other games it's the world-unlock animations... [snip] the 'cutscenes' can't be called that because they don't cut away from the game. [snip] The camera zooms out and the whole vista erupts with giant stones and grassland rising up from the depths or water pouring into dry beds to form lakes, changing the whole landscape. It's a sight to behold, I tell ya. And it happens a lot.\n\nAt strategic positions on the map, usually in very high crows nest positions, there are vista spots. These are places where you sit on a ledge and the camera slowly turns and pans out to reveal a particularly spectacular view of the world with impressive distance perspective. Sometimes they're vertical views, and if you suffer from vertigo watch out for those!\n\nMost of the game has only ambient sound effects. I say \"only\", but these are fantastic subtle sounds that connect you with the environment to make you feel like you're there. [snip] There is very soft music occasionally but you have to pay attention or you won't even notice it... [snip]\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nOnce you get over the aforementioned initial hump, I'd say the challenge is still medium/hard.\n\n[snip]\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\n[snip]\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nIt's a steal. I would gladly pay two or three times the price, it's head and shoulders above other games in this price range, both in quality and quantity. Don't wait for a sale, get it now.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nIt does have its problems initially, but by the time you're a few hours into the game you'll have forgotten all about them as you immerse yourself in this epic world of wonders. I really can't recommend this strongly enough. This is my favourite type of game and as such I've played many of them so I have plenty of comparison. Up to now my favourites have been games like Conarium that dazzles with UE4 graphics and item discovery, or Figment that focuses on voice acting and music with some light puzzling and combat, but no other game I can think of combines such high quality of platforming, graphics, adventure and puzzling all in one package.\n\nI feel so sorry for Runic. They've crafted this masterpiece and are greeted only by Torchlight fanboys flooding their forum with complaints about how this game shouldn't exist and they should be working on Torchlight 3 instead. I think they would all immediately shut up if they had a chance to play this.\n\nI've awarded this our (very rare) highest rating of Autosave, but I think we need to create a new rating above it simply named 'Hob', as this would be the only ever recipient of it.\n\nIt's September now, but I'm pretty sure this will be my Game Of The Year.\n\n[quote]More reviews at SaveOrQuit.com[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1506742485, "timestamp_updated": 1506743594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35321321": {"recommendationid": "35321321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046881334", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506741294}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud1a0\uce58\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ud68c\uc0ac\ub77c \uc77c\ub2e8 \ubbff\uace0 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uc644\ub8cc\ud558\uace0 \ub09c \ud6c4 \ub290\ub080 \uc810\uc744 \uc801\uc5b4\ubcfc\uac8c\uc694\n\n\uc77c\ub2e8 \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4 \uc790\ub9c9\uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uad73\uc774 \uc790\ub9c9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810 \n\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc74c\uc131 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294\ub370 \ud55c\uae00 \uc74c\uc131\uc740 \uc65c \uccb4\ud06c\uac00 \ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \u314b\u314b\n\n\ud37c\uc990\uacfc \uc804\ud22c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \uc26c\uc6b4\ud3b8\uc774\ub098 \uae38\ucc3e\uae30\uac00 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub835\ub124\uc694 \n\n\uc800\ub294 \uc774\uac19\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\ub958\ub97c \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub098\uac8c \uc990\uae34\uac70 \uac19\ub124\uc694\n\n\ub2e4\ub9cc \ub108~\ubb34\ub098\ub3c4 \uc2ec\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784 \ub4dc\ub78d\uc740 \uc5b8\ub2a5 \ud53d\uc2a4\ub97c \ud574\uc92c\uc73c\uba74 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1506742245, "timestamp_updated": 1506742245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35320465": {"recommendationid": "35320465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015169414", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506739528}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1506740051, "timestamp_updated": 1506740051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35319531": {"recommendationid": "35319531", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966890150", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506898343}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game for those who like to explore.

It is called an \"open world\" game which might be seen as a little misleading, as the main story is fairly linear, but you can take time out to explore, hunt for that elusive power up, scythe the grass with your sword, interact with the animals, or go and pick a fight.\n\nIf it has a downside, its minimal storytelling sometimes left me wondering what to do next, as not all keypoints in the main narrative generate mission markers on the map, and I have a short memory.\n\nIt really does need a controller though, as some parts are close to impossible with a keyboard, and when you are navigating along a narrow ledge or platform, which twists and turns in odd directions, there is sometimes no key combination for the required direction, so you have to tap the two relevant direction keys in varying amounts to generate the right direction. I managed to get through the game, with a good degree of completion without a controller, but it does get very frustrating sometimes.\n\nThe back story and characters don't really have a lot of emotional depth however, it's really the PLACE with all its charm which provides the depth atmosphere.\n\nA delight to play, close to perfect, but not quite. The map is a bit too minimal to be useful sometimes, and some of the animations e.g. when emerging from a save point, are too lengthy when you are tapping the keys in frustration after your latest failed precision jump, waiting to get to it again.\n\nAlso it's a bit buggy at the moment but the devs are sweating blood to polish it up, so full marks for effort.", "timestamp_created": 1506724288, "timestamp_updated": 1506724288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35312884": {"recommendationid": "35312884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163468513", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507430838}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4 \uc815\ub9d0\n\ub0b4\uac00 \uac00\ub294 \uc774 \uae38\uc774 \ub9de\ub294 \uae38\uc778\uc9c0 \uc758\uc2ec\uc774 \ub4e4\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\uc2e0\uae30\ud558\uac8c\ub3c4 \ub9de\ub294\uae38\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.\n\uae38\ucc3e\ub294 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uac00 \uc3e0\uc3e0\ud55c \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1506720318, "timestamp_updated": 1506720318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35312605": {"recommendationid": "35312605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011221192", "num_games_owned": 766, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506719377}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't really know what I expected going into Hob, I just saw it randomly on the new releases on steam and thought I had heard of the name from somewhere, it was an amazing experience, a few frame drops here and there, but the sheer beauty of the game and the amazing sense of exploration kept me going, would highly recommend for others, not a combat heavy game which is really nice for a change of pace for me personally.", "timestamp_created": 1506719708, "timestamp_updated": 1506719708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35312345": {"recommendationid": "35312345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041480315", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506717642}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Simple, yet satisfying\" was my mantra for this game.\n\nHow are the puzzles?

Exploration and puzzles steal the spotlight while combat actually work much better than I've come to expect in a game like this.  Watch the world change around you and slowly discover the secrets necessary to save it.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth the time and money invested into it.  The visuals are absolutely breathtaking as you watch the world transform around you.  I found myself awestruck at the sheer imagination put into this universe at several points throughout playing.  Creature, character, and especially environment design in Hob is truly something to marvel at.\n\nPuzzles were relatively simple most of the time, but required quite a bit of exploring, which was rather fun.  Jumping, grappling and warping around was very fluid and the intuitive mechanic of following the power lines was the perfect amount of instruction.\n\nCombat was relatively standard for a little action RPG, which isn't a bad thing at all.  Enemies were challenging at time (I played on \"hard\" on a scale of easy, normal, hard, very hard) and it felt like the perfect degree of challenge.  Find schematics that you can use to unlock new abilities and upgrade your weapon for a more in depth experience -- but to be quite honest, you're not necessarily going to feel a huge difference.\n\nThe storyline of Hob was more of an implied world-building scenario rather than a narrative.  Elements of the world unfolded and unveiled themselves to you and the background of the universe was more implicit than solidified, leaving it open to thought and deliberation.  To me, this perfectly fit the tone of the game -- finding yourself in a universe full of otherworldly imagination.\n\nI got 15 solid hours of gameplay before \"beating\" the campaign (of course there are always things that you miss that you can opt to go back and find if you so desire).  I was very peased with this -- I was honestly expecting to get about half of that.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Hob to those looking for an explorative, imaginative, atmospheric experience.  To those who favor combat and exciting gameplay over world building, maybe wait for a sale.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1506713819, "timestamp_updated": 1506713819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35309151": {"recommendationid": "35309151", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972393258", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506782039}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed this, would love to see more similar games.", "timestamp_created": 1506712316, "timestamp_updated": 1506712316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35308434": {"recommendationid": "35308434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006757809", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507056724}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Um estilo de jogo que remonta aos antigos the legend of zelda, uma palete de cores bem distribuida, e o melhor jogo da runic games at\u00e9 agora.

Most monsters don't pose any difficulty, but combat is still fun enough when you go up against the bigger monsters. But it's clear that combat isn't the main thing about this game.\n\nPushing, pulling switches and buttons will sometimes dramatically change the environment and I really enjoyed discovering this really unique world. I haven't come across any difficult puzzles yet.\n\nI am a fan of exploring, discovering new worlds and this world is very beautiful and unique. \n\nStory wise the game leaves most of it up to you. There's no narration, just the mumbling of your robot friend who will guide you to the next part of the adventure. What I miss in the game is a bit more clarification as to why the hero has to do what he's doing.

What makes that unfortunate is that it really isn't THAT great.\n\nThe problem with there being no spoken or written words is that you may come back to the game having NO CLUE as to what you're supposed to do next.\n\nThe map is lacking; there are no markers for entrances to underground areas, (so unless you have a great memory you'll lose track of where you need to back-track so you can finish off raiding them after you get all the upgrades,) as well as no markers for respawn stations, so you'll be looking for those too, since they're scattered around randomly in clusters. If there could be a mini-map with a quest marker, or a translucent overlay it'd been better than having to pause it every few minutes.\n\nSixty percent of me playing this game has been running around looking for where I'm supposed to go next, which got so frustrating that I'd have to shut it off and relax for an hour or two.\n\nThe game is fun.\nWhen Mr. Robotto shows up, it makes me smile.\nThe sprites are cute as hell flower children.\nThe combat mechanics are well done.\n\nBut the game is buggy, one time I started it up and my guy hopped out of the spawn tube but his skin was all black, except for the eyes and the arm. Sometimes the vines on the wall near the robot graveyard blink in-and-out of existence. You can still use them, but they're invisible.\n\nI know it's still new, and some kinks still need to be worked out, and I wish Steam had a \"Not Yet\" or \"Later\" option for these reviews.\n\nUntil

You'll get a small handful of upgrades that unlock new areas of the game, and you'll hunt around for heart containers, energy upgrades, and chests that contain money or gear.  The majority of the game is wandering around the large world pushing buttons to open up new areas, with a little bit of really simple combat thrown in.\n\nFor a while, I really enjoyed the laid back nature of wandering around, pushing some buttons, and seeing what happened.  After a few hours though, the game had shown me most of what it has to offer.  I'd seen most of the cool visuals, gotten all of the gameplay-changing upgrades, and found out about all of the different button types to press.  That's when I realized that there was nothing to the game but pushing buttons.\n\nThere really aren't many puzzles in the game.  Everything is solved by walking around, finding the button you haven't pushed or ladder you haven't climbed, then pushing or climbing that thing because it's all that's available.  In a better puzzle game, like Zelda or Inside, there's something to figure out.  \"If I push this box here, I can reach that rope, which I can use to swing over there and light the torch, and once I light all of those...\"  In this game, what happens when you push a button (or lever or box or whatever) is unpredictable.  Sometimes the entire room will move around.  Sometimes a ladder will appear.  Sometimes it lights up a button three rooms back.  There's little thinking involved.  Just keep your eyes open and everything solves itself.\n\nIt's not uncommon to spend an hour in one part of the map pushing buttons and jumping around, just to find out that all that accomplished was allowing you to push a NEW button halfway across the map.  That's not particularly rewarding.  After going through that routine a few times, the games myriad of little problems started wearing on me.\n\nThe camera sucks.  It will lead to you dying because it swings around in unexpected ways, hides the place you're trying to go, or gives a bad angle for the jump.  If you've ever played a Lego game, it's the same problem here.  Fixed camera + 3D platforming = missed jumps.  The penalty isn't too harsh, but it's not fun running back to where you fell for something that doesn't feel like your fault.  Combat is pretty basic with sword swings, a roll attack, and a couple situational moves.  In the back half of the game, enemies take enough hits, and give so little reward for beating them, that combat becomes  tedious and usually just best avoided.  Backtracking is hampered by a poor map, lack of mini-map, and insurmoutanle walls of trees not any taller than the character is that randomly cut off progress when you just want to get back to one of the too infrequent fast travel spots.\n\nAnd there are bugs.  Most of the crashes seem to have been fixed, but upon release it was crashing every 15 minutes.  It was fixed very quickly, but why did it ship so broken?  Even after the patches, I still had the force my guy to respawn when he got stuck in geometry, and died dozens of times due to getting stuck in geometry, bad hit detection with the environment, or a sudden loss of control causing my guy to fly off the map.  Once I had to restart because the map suddenly when completely white as if I hadn't explored any of it.  With all these little issues, moving around the world just feels bad, which is a problem since wandering around is most of the gameplay.\n\nNone of these flaws, individually, make the game not worth playing.  But they all add up to a pretty mediocre game that makes a good first impression, then peters out.  It runs out of new ideas and devolves into wandering around the map looking for the things you haven't done yet.  There's fun to be had if you can overlook the flaws, but I can't recommend the game as a whole.", "timestamp_created": 1506658754, "timestamp_updated": 1506658754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760528", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35281826": {"recommendationid": "35281826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064466965", "num_games_owned": 3104, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507700833}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u98ce\u5f88\u559c\u6b22", "timestamp_created": 1506658253, "timestamp_updated": 1506658253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35281796": {"recommendationid": "35281796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139491084", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506699933}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5f88\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\uff01\n\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u662f\u61f5\u903c\u7684\uff0c\u62bd\u4e1d\u5265\u8327\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u8c1c\u9898\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u5df1\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u5168\u5165\u5751\u3002\n\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a1.\u6e38\u620f\u6700\u5f15\u4eba\u5165\u80dc\u7684\u662f\u6070\u5230\u597d\u5904\u7684\u89e3\u8c1c\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\n2.\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u505c\u7684\u7ed9\u60ca\u559c\uff1b\n3.\u6bcf\u7a81\u7834\u4e00\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e00\u6761\u6377\u5f84\u65b9\u4fbf\u65e5\u540e\u590d\u8dd1\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u8dd1\u8def\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e13\u5fc3\u8d70\u4e3b\u7ebf\u3002\n\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1a\u4e0d\u592a\u559c\u6b22KO\u602a\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6162\u955c\uff08\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u6162\u955c\u51fa\u73b0\u4f1a\u67091\u79d2\u4e0d\u80fd\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f88\u70e6\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1506658180, "timestamp_updated": 1506658180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35281444": {"recommendationid": "35281444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019697691", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507607166}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Recomendo muito este game.

Most notably the many jumps. This is a little bad since this is a massive part of the game. There have been occasions where the jumps have seemed to be misaligned or shown from an awkward angle.  A lot of the time, the checkpoint is quite near so not too punishing but there are points where I had to travel quite a bit to get back where I was and all because I couldn't even see the paltforms properly.  This all means that the game can get quite frustrating at points and I have yelled at the screen a couple of times. \nStill, I have persevered and have gotten further in the game each time.  There is much to be said for the joy of finding hidden passages and solving some light puzzles. \n\nA bit more story wouldn't go amiss either. The game feels a little isolating.  It would be nice to have something a bit more substantial. I guess that is the way they wanted it to be though, so I wouldn't criticise it too much for that. I guess it adds a purity to the exploration.  \n\nI've played it for 6 hours up til now and I can only see one edge of the map (the bottom edge). The other edges still seem quite a way away from the parts I have explored so I estimate it being more than double the size of what I've seen so far.  That makes it a decent sized game. I think if you are a patient gamer, and don't mind annoying awkward jumping on rare occasions, then this is well worth the asking price.", "timestamp_created": 1506646726, "timestamp_updated":

The fun is in exploring. The ending just kind of sits there. Ignoring the end, it is a nice world to explore. The puzzles are challenging, the combat sometimes tedious but there's not too much of it.\n\nRe the ending: [spoiler] apparently there are two of them, although I wouldn't have known this if not for double-checking on Youtube.

What first drew me in was the art style. It is very reminiscent of the Studio Ghibli movie \"Laputa, Castle in the Sky\", one of my favorite animes. It seems to have been inspired in large part by that movie, both in terms of aesthetics and worldbuilding. It gets my seal of approval, for certain. The world is also quite expansive, and the fact that through progressing, you're putting the world back together, in a very physical sense, is something I found quite engaging.\n\nEqually, the music and ambient sounds are very atmospheric, to the level where I could see myself just listening to it outside of playing the game.\n\nThe gameplay and storytelling is straight-forward, no nonsense there, and grips you right from the start. The fact that there's no (intelligible) dialogue doesn't stop the characters in the game from having personalities that clearly shows as you progress through it. The fact that there's a lot of mystery and not a lot of explanations, I find, motivates me to progress rather than turn me off from playing.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to sing it's praises without mentioning a few problems I've had with it, however.\n\nAs a seasoned puzzle solver, the problem solving part of the game comes across as quite simplistic and one-dimensional. They could've made them more advanced, without them becoming a hindrande, I think.\n\nThe lack of controller setup makes the mouse + keyboard option quite unintuitive, and sub-par to using a controller. Plays best with a controller, as the game description says. It's still quite playable with mouse and keyboard, once you get used to the control scheme, but it's weird for a game of this type.\n\nFinally, there are still some slowdown problems when you sprint around and force the game to load new level pieces at a high pace. The developers are hard at work squashing that bug though, and it's barely noticable on my middle-of-the-range system. Watching early release videos on youtube, you see a few crashes, but I've had no crashes so far.\n\nEnd verdict: If you like gorgeous platforming puzzlers with a bit of Zelda'esque combat, this is one of the best choices out there.", "timestamp_created": 1506624820, "timestamp_updated": 1506624820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499380", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35267988": {"recommendationid": "35267988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127277828", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506857172}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u9053\u5177\u6ca1\u6536\u96c6\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5728\u54ea\u3002\u597d\u73a9\u5f52\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u5173\u5361\u786e\u5b9e\u5f88\u96be\u3002\u6700\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6740\u4e86\u5979\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u4f1a\u767b\u4e0a\u5b9d\u5ea7\uff0c\u9ece\u6c11\u767e\u59d3\u4f1a\u88ab\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f1a\u6e10\u6e10\u8001\u53bb\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff08\u6709\u4e9b\u4f24\u611f\uff09\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u81e3\u670d\u9ece\u6c11\u767e\u59d3\u4e0d\u4f1a\u88ab\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u7528\u548c\u5c0f\u7d2b\u6253\uff08\u4e00\u6b21\u8fc7\uff0c\u5c0f\u7d2b\u633a\u597d\u6253\u7684\u3002\u8bb0\u5f97\u4e70\u4e2a\u7f57\u6c49\u8863\u3002\uff09\u4f46\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ee7\u627f\u8005\u3002\u6700\u597d\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5c40\u90fd\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6210\u5c31\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506622809, "timestamp_updated": 1506622809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35267893": {"recommendationid": "35267893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048964027", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506548691}, "language": "english", "review": "**Bottom Line**: If you like Zelda or Bastion, you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe story is as promised. No one says words at you, but there are things like creatures pointing or leading you in a particular direction at the very beginning just to get you to relevant tutorial plot points.\n\nBeyond that, Hob is a Zelda-like adventure puzzle platformer that pretty much never leads you by the hand. You are free to take as long as you want to find out where you have to go and what you have to do to progress.\n\nGameplay progression is pretty simple and very familiar. Wander around, finding upgrades, which open up more parts of the (fairly large) map that you wander once again to find more upgrades\n\nIt's not a new formula, and it's not a particularly innovative take on what is probably one of the oldest game archetypes known to gamers. But it is a solid and enjoyable execution of a classic formula.\n\nThe game is not incredibly keyboard friendly, which is fine since it says about 20 times before you get to play the thing that you should play it with a controller, but it isn't impossible without a controller, and can be adapted to without a tremendous amount of diffifulty.\n\nGraphically, this game is beautiful. It's artstyle and design is very similar to Bastion, which can be roughly summarized as \"technologically advanced ruins\". The environment is equal parts natural and gargantuan machine. These two elements are seamlessly, beautifully blended.\n\nThere are some technical issues. The one that I imagine everyone will notice almost right away is that, regardless of your computer specs, you will encounter frequent FPS drops and stuttering. Nothing that crashes the game, but frequent and severe enough where you will wonder what exactly the game is doing to your computer.\n\nOverall, I give Hob a 4/5.", "timestamp_created": 1506622538, "timestamp_updated": 1506622538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35267697": {"recommendationid": "35267697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006062935", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506787388}, "language": "french", "review": "un univers magnifique", "timestamp_created": 1506622055, "timestamp_updated": 1506622055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35267628": {"recommendationid": "35267628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134918016", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506979566}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon je vais pas troun\u00e9 autour du pot longtemps, HOB est un jeu superbe et que je peu recomander les yeux ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de gens, mais je vais tout de m\u00eame notifer quelques points.\n\nLes plus : \n\u2022 S\u00e9rieux il est magnifique ce jeu, je vous dis \u00e7a en plus sans le faire tourner en ultra sur ma machine.\n\u2022 Dynamique mais pas trop, c'est \u00e0 dire qu'on \u00e0 jamais le temps de s'ennuyer mais on est pas envahi de combats ou de platforme innutile, c'est tr\u00e8s bien g\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\u2022 Des puzzle et des zone cach\u00e9 pour toute les difficult\u00e9es, autant certains puzzles sont d'un simplicit\u00e9 ab\u00e9rante, autant d'autres demanderons de se poser quelques temps et de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chire.

It took me a total of 7 hours to beat the game on my first playthrough(hard mode) without collecting all the upgrades (i did get all the sword parts and lore) but I did spend quite a while exploring and looking at all the vistas. After getting a basic idea of where I was going I then did another run in just under 3 hours. I would say it would take the average player 5-6 hours to beat on the first playthrough.\nI honestly can't explain why I enjoyed this game so much but it was such a ride with very few moments where there was either no action or no puzzles, it was a none stop very well written journey.\nOnly thing that I found really disapointing was the lack of boss fights which I think would have been a great addition to each dungeon to change the pace of the game a bit.\n\u00a314.99 for this game seems about right based on how long it took to beat, but for the sheer enjoyment it gave me then it's an absolute steal at that price.\n\nI advise everyone to try this game and fall in love with the cute little weird flower things like I did\n\nTLDR:\nBuy it", "timestamp_created": 1506596671, "timestamp_updated": 1506597512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35259315": {"recommendationid": "35259315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315813801", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507052715}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0432 Torchlight 1 \u0438 2 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u043b\u0430, \u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0441 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0432\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c. \u0423\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 Hob \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0436\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0435\u0451 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0435. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u044b\u043c \u0433\u0433 \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439.\n\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u043e =)\n\u0422\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1506596093, "timestamp_updated": 1506596093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35259089": {"recommendationid": "35259089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109296134", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508552961}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8bf4\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u6709\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u5417\uff1f\u600e\u4e48\u6ca1\u6709\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1506595036, "timestamp_updated": 1506595036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35258961": {"recommendationid": "35258961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284029132", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506660907}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5509\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u8fd9\u4e48\u5927\uff0c\u53ef\u60dc\u6211\u770b\u5b8c\u4e86\u3002\n\nBut I can still feel a gentle breeze.", "timestamp_created": 1506594535, "timestamp_updated": 1506594535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35258943": {"recommendationid": "35258943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278624631", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506696447}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me tiene enamorado este juego.

En resumen, por 20 \u20ac que cuesta me parece casi una compra obligada si te gustan los juegos de plataformas con acci\u00f3n y exploraci\u00f3n.", "timestamp_created": 1506594421, "timestamp_updated": 1506594421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35258124": {"recommendationid": "35258124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252016188", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508549485}, "language": "schinese", "review": "10\u5e27~20\u5e27~emmmmmm~~", "timestamp_created": 1506591179, "timestamp_updated": 1506591179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35257873": {"recommendationid": "35257873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317088701", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507380022}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u786e\u5f88\u5f3a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6211\u4eca\u5e74\u73a9\u7684\u6700\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e86\u5427\uff0crunic\u5e72\u5f97\u6f02\u4eae\uff01\u7ed3\u5c40\u4e0d\u7ba1\u600e\u4e48\u9009\u90fd\u8650\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u9009\u62e9\u539f\u8c05\u5979\uff0c\u5821\u5792\u4f1a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4f60\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u7136\u540e\u6709\u8bf7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4f4d\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\uff0c\u63a5\u7740\u5f00\u59cb\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6e\u56de\uff1b\u5982\u679c\u9009\u6740\u4e86\u5979\uff0c\u522b\u4eba\u6bd5\u7adf\u6551\u4e86\u4f60\uff0c\u738b\u5973\u4e5f\u662f\u88ab\u611f\u67d3\u624d\u53d8\u6210\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff0c\u4e8e\u5fc3\u4e0d\u5fcd\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u6700\u597d\u9009\u56f0\u96be\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u654c\u4eba\u6253\u8d77\u6765\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d\u3002\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u5c31\u4e00\u5806\u89e3\u8c1c\u8981\u7d20\u3002\u5730\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u522b\u51fa\u5fc3\u88c1\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u5bab\u672c\u8001\u8d3c\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u65e0\u9650\u5f00\u8fd1\u9053\u6709\u6728\u6709\uff0c\u5230\u5904\u90fd\u662f\u7bdd\u706b\u6709\u6728\u6709\u3002\u8bf4\u53e5\u516c\u9053\u8bdd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u9ed1\u9b42\u6709\u4e00\u62fc\u554a\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5730\u56fe\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u7ec4\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e0b\u4e86\u8840\u672c\uff0c\u539f\u4ef7\u4e70\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u56de\u7968\u4ef7\u3002so\uff0c\u8fd8\u770b\u4ec0\u4e48\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u8d76\u5feb\u53bb\u4e70\u6e38\u620f\u554a\uff0c\u4f60\u4e0dtm\u4e70\u7206", "timestamp_created": 1506590057, "timestamp_updated": 1507382162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35257799": {"recommendationid": "35257799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272087705", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506873356}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u75af\u72c2\u6389\u5e27\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506589744, "timestamp_updated": 1506589744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35257028": {"recommendationid": "35257028", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993654897", "num_games_owned": 643, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506558196}, "language": "english", "review": "Now, Crash and I have computer spec high more than required and very low setting but I get very low fps.

It's a perfect blend of Zelda and Metroidvania puzzling. The art is cell shaded which is a big plus in my book.\n\nNeutrals:\n\nCombat is meh. I'm on very hard, and it's laughable. The puzzling isn't difficult, but at times, the game seems artificially difficult when you miss a small path that's critical to solving one. \n\nCons:\n\nOptimization is still kind of spotty.

Wasn't intending on going over the 2hr. limit, but lo and behold I've lost my $50 EC to the dregs of time. [Why there isn't a rent option on Steam, I don't know.]\n\nFunnily enough, that's not the only issue that wants to make itself glaringly apparent. There is a lot of running back and forth in this game, as is expected, but it becomes glaringly annoying when you get to a point that's right in front of the thing you have to get to, looks like you can reasonably walk or jump to it, and then get your hopes, dreams, aspirations and patience (much of which has dwindled down from all the zigzagging nowhere) blocked off by and cast into the chaos that is invisible walls. Granted this would be rectified by the time you figure it out, giving you a sense of accomplishment. For me it's just continual annoyance at how much this game costs even at pre-order price.\n\nSo when you figure out one confusingly area-wide puzzle. you are then faced with the next question: where the hobscat do I go now? The map only helps to an extent, probably for good reason. But then there's those other times when you get to a thing at the south of the screen that looks attainable from where you're standing, but can't. \n\nWhich brings us to the elephant's flatulent infant: the camera. I know the whole point of the camera switching from top-down perspective to 3D is to get a gander at the scenery and even actually show you where the thing you're supposed to get to is, but: \n- the theme of the game already ruined the first for me to begin with.\n- after you go past this point, finish dealing with it and have to take the path back, you have to deal with it again. This isn't helped by the fact that even on the lowest settings, in open areas, even underwater at times, the game lags immensely. It also seems that the camera is actually an elephant when it does this as it struggles to actually keep up with you, and if you're running off to a cliff facing ground 3-4 blocks below you, tough luck.\n\nCombat's alright, but not as fleshed out as it could've been. The decision to make the moveset expandable through schematics well-hidden in areas seems like a good move....then you realize that some of these moves are just common sense to have on the get-go, and by the time you get them, you might actually be on your way to finishing the game: unless you're stuck dealing with the amazing question of where to go and what needs to be done to get a move on. Not to mention one of your abilities gets no love after its acquisition. You don't even get to use it on enemies unless they have certain things to target with it. Really? The one other legit power you get aside from your charge fist and you don't even try to flesh that out, Runic? I know the enemy variety is scarce but sheesh.\n\nAll in all: don't buy this game. My own \"bias\" aside, you're more than likely to waste a bunch of minutes just trying to figure out where you have to go, then going to the same spot constantly before you get to how scarce the game feels on the ~action~ side of things. And when you do get to where the game \"gets good,\" your disappointment will be worsened by the fact that you can't get a refund.\n\n- A salty review written by a moron who went too far to get a refund.", "timestamp_created": 1506555935, "timestamp_updated": 1506555935, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.349671", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35250973": {"recommendationid": "35250973", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983170068", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507052384}, "language": "french", "review": "un Zelda like excellent! un tr\u00e8s bon puzzle game et une DA sublime !!! et cette fa\u00e7on de nous plonger directement dans l'inconnu et de nous faire d\u00e9couvrir l'histoire au fil de notre progression.

Feel free to ask me any questions in regards to the game and I'll do my best to answer them. \n\nI love the way this game communicates ideas without using a known language. it's like watching a Jim Henson production. Like Dark Crystal where the Skesis had this strange language and communicated via noises yet you could immediately tell what they were 'saying' via body language. Kudo's to the animators who worked on this because that part is amazing.I do wish It zoomed a little closer in during those few short but sweet dialog moments. Then again I wish we could zoom in in general. I'd really love to take a closer look at all the creatures. The creature design in this game is so fantastic. \n\nMy biggest issue is getting lost and not having any idea where to go. There are things I can't access because I lack upgrades and the areas are so big I end up losing track of where I've been. Checking the map doesn't help as it's a bit confusing to read. I'm not usually this terrible at games like this which leads to my getting frustrated now and then. Fortunately the 'Ah!' moments and story more than make up for it. Visual-wise however this is a beautiful game. Runic has managed to create a style of artwork that stands out from the rest of the games I've played over the last few years. Most textures have an almost animated quality to them with rich mood-setting colors breathing life into its naturalistic world. It features a mix of natural and steampunk yet without it being cliche. It feels like the setting is its own time and place rather than trying to fit into a specific genre. \n\nThe character designs are all unique and help add to the feeling of this place being a real live world. My only nitpick about it is that the ground textures seem almost an afterthought and a bit too simplistic compared to the rest of the environment. It pulls you out of the world a bit so hopefully they'll give those an upgrade at some point. \n\nThe music is wonderful and deserves its own section. A little surprising given I'm used to Matt Uelmen's music being a bit more thematic but the looser, more mystical nature of the melodies fits perfectly. It sounds wonderful through headphones and really blands in with the environmental sounds. It melds into this cohesive living landscape of sound that makes the environment feel so much more alive. There are all these little rhythmic touches that hearken back to his older work yet never in a way that sounds too derivative. Instead it sounds like the result of a gradual maturation of skill. As much as I love his past scores I'd consider this his best work yet. So much more subtle that his previous work but that's what makes it all the more magical.\n\nI can tell that this games maps are a definite progression from Torchlight and Torchlight II's. The way everything fits together seems almost haphazard at first but then when you start to piece things together it starts making you feel like you're just barely uncovering pieces of this huge living machine. It's rather breathtaking in scope at times. I guess that's why I'm getting so frustrated. I want to see more of this amazing world. It can be a head-scratcher and calls for a measure of patience but the thrill of seeing the entire world around you change is worth its more frustrating moments. It's great for those looking for a mix of exploration with a bit of combat but if you're looking for pure action it's probably not for you. You're going to spend more time looking for clues and solving puzzles than you are fighting and what fighting there is seems to be a bit shallow. \n\nAll in all It's a really great if at times a little frustrating puzzle/platformer full of Henson-like characters and moodiness reminiscent of films like The Dark Crystal or animated films like Don Bluth's Secret of Nimh.", "timestamp_created": 1506549648, "timestamp_updated": 1506549701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35250170": {"recommendationid": "35250170", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970943884", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510032261}, "language": "english", "review": "the game won't start.

Nicely-flowing puzzles and platforming with a massive result in literally shifting the world around, coupled with combat encounters that were sensibly placed made sure of that. This persisted until the final third/quarter, where things started feeling too alike and its mishandling of its wordless narrative became evident. To be honest, for that portion of the game, I was left without much purpose and the conclusion, well, it did little to change anything. I really wish Hob had managed to keep me engaged until the end, be it through more varied puzzles, mechanics, encounters or more significant discoveries. With that in mind, the game does have enough things going for itself to make it worth the time of those who raise an eyebrow at the thought of exploring and awakening a mysterious world using gauntlet, brain and, sometimes, brawn.[url=http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1356/hob-pc-review] Full Review[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1506542376, "timestamp_updated": 1506542376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35248470": {"recommendationid": "35248470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022088744", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515904866}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc81c\uac00 \ud574\ubcf8 \uac8c\uc784\uc911\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c9\uac10\uc774 \uc190\uc5d0 \uaf3d\ud790\uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc608\uc058\uad70\uc694. \ud37c\uc990\uc774\ub098 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc804\ud22c\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c\ub294 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac8c\uc784\ub0b4\uc5d0 \ub300\uc0ac\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294\uac8c \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub3c4\ub97c \ub5a8\uc5b4\ub728\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83 \uac19\uc544 \uc544\uc27d\ub124\uc694...", "timestamp_created": 1506542260, "timestamp_updated": 1506542260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35248420": {"recommendationid": "35248420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027212177", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506723537}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply wonderful!\n\nIts is so unbelievable charmingly beautiful that it keeps making me smile. \nThe graphicstyle is gorgeous and unigue and sux you right into the world.\n\nAt this Pricetag its a steal, so I wholeheartly recommend getting rid of 20 bucks asap.\nRuns without any issue 2.\n", "timestamp_created": 1506542094, "timestamp_updated": 1506542094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35248377": {"recommendationid": "35248377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047814505", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506541687}, "language": "german", "review": "Habe nun die Story abgeschlossen und muss sagen das ich obwohl ich viel erwartet habe nicht entt\u00e4uscht wurde - meine Erwartungen wurden sogar \u00fcbertroffen.\nIch hoffen Runic wird dieses Game und dessen Review zum Anlass mehr solcher Perlen zu entwickeln!

"language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I've played this year so far, and it was only $20.\n\nImagine if Zelda and Journey has a baby and it was a metroidvania title. Thats Hob. Its combat is simplistic yet has depth to it. It can be button mashy (especially in the beginning) but as the game goes on the enemies become harder and the combat begins to evolve and get deeper. \n\nThe puzzles are challenging and fun to solve, similar to that of Zelda. You also get upgrades as you progress through the game to both your combat abilities and your \"Glove\" abilities which are mostly used for enviornmental puzzles, but can ALSO be used in combat. This is a pretty great system and I love it. \n\nThere are places and area (specifically in the beginning) where you might not have the ability or upgrade needed to get to or unlock a certain area. This is where the metroidvania style comes into play. These are almost all (atleast so far for me) optional upgrade items, like a heart piece, or a mana brick, but useful none the less for those of us willing to take the time to back track and find them. \n\nThe story telling is almost purely through the enviornment, and this is where the Journey feel comes from. There is no dialogue, which might sound like a negative, but I really dig it. I'm not sure exactly why I'm doing what the characters are doing, but I do know I'm having fun doing it, and I can see things in the enviornment that seem like subtle clues as to whats happening in this world. Speaking if which I LOVE the art design and direction. The Music is also top notch as well, really setting the mood and tone. \n\nThis game has barebones requirements to run on your PC and for only $20 I simply CANNOT recommend this game enough. I should note, I am only 2 and a half hours or so into the game but man I am really digging this game.

Beautiful art style plus atmospheric soundtracks add a lot of positive points to my thinking about this game. The puzzles are not so so enough to make you feel bored through your first 2 hours of playing. The combat is pretty great, you got slash and dodge at the beginning and would get more various techniques throughout the story. Personally, I quite enjoyed playing this game till the very end.\n\nThe problem is, Hob doesn't have much explanations about the basic things in game. Maybe you will wonder a lot at the beginning about how everything works because there won't be any conversation explaining what you need to do. \n\nAnother concern is the control part. ugh.. I don't say this game has a terrible controller support. It works perfectly but the moves are not quite right for me. For example, you can't control the direction while in the air, it's just a straight way jump and I really feel uncomfortable with it. I mean, oh come on 3D moves without 3D jump eh? For me it's a big problem because you can't enjoy the game fully if you're uncomfortable with the control right?\n\nFor the summary, I will rate this 8/10\n\nIf you go for the Adventure-Puzzle part, I absolutely recommend you to buy this game but for the platforming, it's such a let down.", "timestamp_created": 1506511300, "timestamp_updated": 1506700135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35239725": {"recommendationid": "35239725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010389134", "num_games_owned": 2198, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507802972}, "language": "english", "review": "Hob is a must play game. It's a well crafted masterpiece in my opinion that needs your attention. Even if platforming and solving puzzles isn't your thing, the game is also an exploration-heavy action adventure, you will not be disappointed, you will love this.\n\nStory:\nYou arrive in a new land, nobody there speaks your language, there is no text to help you, you don't know what you have to do but there seems to be a friendly robot that cares to guide you but never holds your hand,  you must figure things out by yourself. The lore of the game will \"blow your mind\" if you can find all the clues and once again i'll say that the game has zero text or speach that will tell you the lore, the way they tell you the story is brilliant.\n\nGameplay:\nYou solve puzzles, you complete challenging platforming levels you fight various of enemies and you collect stuff you find along the way to upgrade your character. Everything is requiring exloring and if you do it right you will find some very well hiden secrets. There is a rewarding feeling when you figure those puzzles out, and when you finally complete a cave/dungeon or kill a badas enemy with your minimal gear. The level design is perfect, i can't remember an other game with such a perfect level design.\n\nVisuals:\nThis is a goreous game, everything is beautiful and very carefully placed in the world. There are some spots on the map that you will stop just to take some screenshots and admire the scenery or look for places you haven't been, even in lower end pc's the scenery and the backgrounds are beautiful.\n\nAudio/Music:\nNobody speaks your language, but you can understand what the locals want to say to you, the music is very relaxing and the ambiance sounds help you to understand your surroundings.\n\nDuration:\nThe game is \"short\", about 10-20 hours to reach the end, it took me 25-30 to uncover everything on the map. I don't say its not value for money, this game has so much to give to you. Nevertheless i wanted more of it, really badly. This game should be a series one day and Runic showed us in the past that they can do it. \n\nBacktracking:\nI was a bit confused in the beginning i had no idea what i was collecing or where i should go next. Later on i got used to it, everything made sense and i knew what i was looking for in each new area. I can see people getting lost for their first 20ish-30 minutes and backtrack a lot until they find out how to progress from the first areas but it's something that makes sense a bit later. Minor-spoiler if you are backtracking or lost: You can fast traver and look at your map!\n\nSynopsis:\nThey worked really hard on this game and it something you can tell just from the first couple of minutes playing it or just watching a trailer. It's a game you must play by yourself and don't get spoiled by videos or streams, it's a game you must take your time to admire and don't rush to see the ending. The progression, the character upgrates, the new stuff they planned for each new area that the player was supposed to be, they crafted this game with love and passion. New mechanics, new jumps, new puzzles, new secrets, new everything in every corner. I loved the part that you could stop in most places to admire the scenery and to look for new places you haven't been and maybe take one screenshot or ten. I loved fighing bosses especially when i speedruned it with the bare essential gear as one of the achievements suggests. And i loved spending some time to understand the lore after i finished my first run and had no clue what happend. \n\nNow it's your chance, make it home.", "timestamp_created": 1506510959, "timestamp_updated": 1506510959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657872", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35239619": {"recommendationid": "35239619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101198546", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506516387}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u4e86\u5927\u698220\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u8bf4\u4e0b\u611f\u53d7\u753b\u98ce\u5f88\u72ec\u7279\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4e5f\u5f88\u8212\u670d\u6218\u6597\u624b\u611f\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u8fd8\u6ca1\u73a9\u5230\u3002\n\u7136\u540e\u8bf4\u4e0b\u522b\u7684\uff0c1700+1070\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u4f1a\u6389\u5e27\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u9ebb\u70e6\u95ee\u4e0b\u5782\u76f4\u540c\u6b65\u600e\u4e48\u5f00\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1506510467, "timestamp_updated": 1506510467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628949", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35239408": {"recommendationid": "35239408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196184299", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506852724}, "language": "german", "review": "HoB gef\u00e4llt mir wirklich gut.

"language": "english", "review": "I'm enjoying the game immensely.  The art style is gorgeous and the world is vast and breathtaking.  Exploration has been fun so far; The game has a distinctly metroidvania feel to it, featuring unique and interesting environmental interactions with various character abilities.  Both movement and combat are suprisingly crisp, fluid and responsive with no animation locks. Even the music that I've heard so far is atmospheric and resonant without being intrusive.\n\nThe game's outstanding issue so far is odd inexplicable FPS drops and slowdowns. With a system that tremendously exceeds recommended specs the game drops as low as 20 FPS at times.  So far I've tested in 1920x1080, 2560x1440 and 3840x2160 with a variety of settings and the same results.  I haven't ruled out the possibility of some issue on my end however, and will continue to experiment.\n\nI've had a great deal of fun with the game so far and hope that sooner rather than later the performance issues will be ironed out.\n\n[b][i][u]EDIT 9/28/17:[/u][/i][/b] Turning off Vsync in the Nvidia control panel and playing with only the game's Vsync yielded some favorable results.  There are still massive framerate drops, but even the worst drops are well above my monitor's 60mhz refresh rate.  It'a a band-aid solution at best.\n\n[b][i][u]EDIT 9/29/17:[/u][/i][/b] Finished the game and admittedly my response soured somewhat towards the end.  Hob does a lot of things right, but there are some missed opportunities for really spectacular gameplay.\n\nThe complete lack of boss fights is puzzling as the crisp, fluid combat quickly becomes unnecessary and inconsequential.  I kept getting cool abilities and upgrades, then just running past enemies because [i]not[/i] fighting was faster and more efficient.\n\nThe game seems aggressively underexplained; Even at the final cutscene you're given nothing more than characters pantomiming while speaking unintelligible gibberish.  There are locations where the lore of the game is supposedly revealed, but they're optional so the player can skip them either intentionally or accidentally.  In addition, the lore locations all seem to show obscure symbols and lights devoid of context.  I'm still not entirely sure just what happened in this game.\n\nThe worst issue is the camera and the player's inability to adjust it.  The only zoom and rotation are controlled by the game itself at specific points; The game shows the player what it [i][u]thinks[/u][/i] is relevant at the time.  This can highlight important changes in the ever-shifting world, but just as often it leads to frustration when you can't even get a good look in the direction of your objective or line up a jump comfortably.  Lack of depth perception will become an issue eventually, as well as the necessity of making blind jumps towards the screen.\n\nEven with these issues however, the game is definitely worth a play just for the experience, although it's probably best to wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1506493253, "timestamp_updated": 1509627000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35236238": {"recommendationid": "35236238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324324770", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507192192}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e4b\u524d\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e00\u76f4\u5f88\u5361\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u5230\u5361\u987f\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506491412, "timestamp_updated": 1506764616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35236220": {"recommendationid": "35236220", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991921123", "num_games_owned": 3093, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506483711}, "language": "english", "review": "I sat and played this for 2.5 hours straight, there are only a few games that I can just sit and play like that.

Fun combat; dodge, roll, block, leap, slash, dash and punch enemies to make them explode into bloody bits. Puzzle solving. Open world. Skill and component upgrades were a nice surpise. \n\nDislikes:\nPuzzles aren't very complicated. Camera position can make some areas awkward to navigate.\n\nThoughts:\nI spent the first 20-30 minutes very cautious and couldn't figure out how to progress beyond the starting zone, then it happened by accident. A little direction may have helped, but I understand that they wanted to do the story without words, so I suppose it was like another puzzle to solve. While the puzzles aren't very complicated I do enjoy figuring them out. The combat is also enjoyable with different methods required for fighting different enemies. Some enemies will one shot you. I have died many, many times playing the game on Medium difficulty. Most deaths are a result of falling off narrow bridges, missing jumps, or due to some other environmental hazard though. Overall I am enjoying the game and am surprised to only have earned 14% of achievements after 5 hours of gameplay. I did not expect the game to be much longer than that for a single play through. I'm curious to see if there is any replayability or if it's a one and done game. For $20, I definitely recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1506489114, "timestamp_updated": 1506489114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727118", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35235816": {"recommendationid": "35235816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261352523", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513669376}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1506488959, "timestamp_updated": 1506488959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35235778": {"recommendationid": "35235778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341008442", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506488473}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u54ce\uff0c\u5931\u671b\u554a\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u65e0\u65f6\u65e0\u523b\u4e0d\u5728\u5145\u5206\u9610\u8ff0\u4f55\u4e3a\u5361\u987f\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e5f\u5f88\u50f5\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u662f\u8fde\u5e2e\u52a9\u9762\u677f\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fc7\u6765\uff0c\u53c8\u6ca1\u6709\u65b0\u624b\u6307\u5f15\uff0c\u5148\u7ed9\u5dee\u8bc4\u4e86\uff0c\u7b49\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506488758, "timestamp_updated": 1506488758, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35235555": {"recommendationid": "35235555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057273826", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520077349}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9700\u8981\u8010\u5fc3\u6765\u4f53\u4f1a\u7684\u7cbe\u81f4\u5c0f\u54c1\uff5e\uff5e", "timestamp_created": 1506487757, "timestamp_updated": 1517493513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35235523": {"recommendationid": "35235523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011548196", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507127105}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

The character upgrades and skills are nice. The Controls feel good for the most part. The aesthetics are neat but it's not for everyone.\n\nThe main downside with gameplay can be some performance issues in areas where a lot of stuff is going on as you run through. Hopefully Runic will fix that with patches. The camera is fixed and transitions awkardly at times. I did die a couple times when running and jumping through sections I'd already cleared only to have the camera mess with my movement and make my jump lead me off a cliff.\n\nThe biggest downside to me personally is that there is literally one boss fight (which is optional). Sure there are some stronger enemies here and there, but none of them are required to defeat to progress. It really took away from the game from me because that was one of my favorite parts of those types of games.\n\nFor others the lack of a storyline or clear character motivations will hurt your experience. If you look past that and just want to focus on the gameplay you'll be fine, but it's definitely something they could have improved upon.\n\nI would still recommend the game but it's probably something that is better to get on sale. The game is fun. It just has some issues that make it something a bit more niche.

Its got its own stone mixed with steampunk vibe that makes the game ever changing and exciting what comes next. It tells narritive through gameplay. One of the best aspects of the game i think is to let the [b] player [/b] play the game there [b] is [/b] no tutorial in this game it doesnt hold your hand it makes you connect 2 and 2 together with unique flowing level design, that \"builds\" the player quite literally into the atmosphere. Solving puzzles getting upgrades. making you want to explore every nook and cranny just to be sure you didnt miss a blueprint or a major piece to your health or energy or gaunlet, etc. Hob is a great game headed in a good direction other devs should pick up on.

The remnants of a long lost world are scattered across lush green forests, and dusty brown deserts. Ancient temples and copper pipes protrude from the natural canopy that has covered up the secrets of the past. Discovering these secrets is what drives you forward in Hob, and it makes the game an ever evolving mystery right up until its final moments.\n\n\nWith no exposition, Hob\u2019s main menu fades into the first moments of gameplay. You are freed from a tomb by a hulking mechanical automaton. You\u2019re not told to follow it, but you know it is what you\u2019re supposed to do. These moments teach you that this robot is your guide, and friend. Your new friend\u2019s will becomes clear over time: It wants you to restore the world to its former glory and destroy the blight poisoning the land.\n\n\nThroughout your journey you will literally rebuild the world by repairing the ancient machines that rest just below the surface. These serve as the game\u2019s dungeons, and upon completing them you are rewarded by watching the world literally rise up from the abyss. Every time I saw the intricate puzzle pieces shift and move into place I was amazed. Hob has a stunning art style, but the ever changing level design is what really steals the show.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also come across upgrades in these dungeons. Chief among them are Armaments that enhance the giant robotic hand your character has. These Armaments upgrade your traversal abilities allowing you to access previously inaccessible locations. In addition to Armaments you will also find health and energy upgrades, as well as schematics that allow you upgrade your combat abilities.\n\n\nThe combat is a bit of a mixed bag. You have a sword and the previously mentioned hand to attack with. You also have a simple dodge that provides a few frames of invincibility, and you can unlock the ability to block with a shield. When the encounters work as intended, the combat can be fun and challenging, but it does get repetitive over time. The real issue that I ran into where enemies that would get stuck on the game\u2019s geometry or lose aggro for no reason. These glitches totally broke the flow of the combat encounters when they arose. They sometimes led to untimely deaths that felt out of my control. Thankfully, the game uses an in-world resurrection system similar to the Vita Chambers in BioShock, so you rarely lose progress when dying.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a big world hiding just below the surface.\nHob features a fixed isometric camera that locks your field of view. The camera only moves when the game wants you to pay attention to something. It will drop down to a more conventional 3rd person view at key parts of the story to provide you with a grand view of the adventures ahead. Other times it will shift just enough to give you a peak at an area you cannot access yet, showing you a secret you may want to investigate later. Generally, the camera serves the game\u2019s style well, but can sometimes be a nuisance during later platforming segments. The camera can sometimes make it difficult to judge depth and this can cause jumps to miss their mark. In addition, I ran into a few instances where I clipped through the ground when performing a jump. These moments were rare, but frustrating.\n\n\nYou must solve puzzles to reactivate the mechanisms that bring life back to the world. The tools you use to solve the puzzles are fairly traditional; you have to move blocks around or reach certain destinations in a short amount of time. While the tools are ordinary, the solutions are not. Just like the story, you have to pick up on context clues to understand what the game is asking of you. Many of the puzzles are seamlessly integrated into the natural flow of the game, and you may not even realize you\u2019re solving one until you complete it.\n\n\nThe inevitable conclusion here is that Hob is a masterwork of exploration and puzzle solving. All of the game\u2019s aspects come together to form a cohesive whole that is both entertaining and awe inspiring from start to finish.

The game has many callbacks to the classic Zelda feel. You are plopped down on unfamiliar territory and you are to use your wits to unravel the world around you.  There are two main weapons in the game, your glove, and your sword. Both of which seem like they have upgrade paths - but only after you have found fragment pieces of each of them to upgrade.\n\nI have been to what feels like 3-4 mini dungeons, in these they give you an upgrade for your glove ala the items you find in dungeons in classic Zelda. These glove upgrades are much like the Zelda items where it is used to help solve the upcoming puzzels,  not only that, but they are used in unlocking areas in the outside world as well.\n\nI love classic Zelda, and sometimes I wonder why there aren't more games like it in the genre.  The only time where I am frustrated at times is when I am lost at what to do next. Since there is no dialogue or voice acting, you are encouraged to explore every nook and cranny of the world.\n\nThere were times where I felt like I stumbled upon a place way too high for my charachters skill level - where enemies were taking my whole life bar away in one swing - it is moments like this that provide a sense of wonder in the world of HoB and I can't wait to see what I uncover next.\n\nOne of the minor gripes I have so far is that there is no motivation for the charachter to traverse this world. Why were you plopped on this piece of land, so what if you collect sword and glove upgrades? What does that entitle? Why are you doing these things,  is there a greater evil, are you trying to save the world from the monsters that roam the land? Motive of why you are doing the things you do is unclear at the moment; hopefully that clears up as I progress through the game.\n\nThat notion however is a double edge sword - it just makes me want to continue digging deeper in the world of Hob.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1506453826, "timestamp_updated": 1506453826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497124", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35228493": {"recommendationid": "35228493", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971247035", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506727336}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo sensacional, jogabilidade precisa, visual de cair o queixo (ainda mais em 4k), muitos puzzles de qualidade, um \u00f3timo investimento!\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1506453748, "timestamp_updated": 1506453748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35228411": {"recommendationid": "35228411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098919216", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508657795}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ed4\u7ec6\u89c2\u5bdf\u6478\u7d22\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u633a\u61f5\u903c\u7684\uff0c\u6162\u6162\u89e3\u9501\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u8d8a\u5230\u540e\u9762\u8d8a\u6fc0\u53d1\u4f60\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6b32\u671b\u3002\u5f88\u591a\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5899\u58c1\uff0c\u8def\u75f4\u4e0d\u5efa\u8bae\u5165\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506453423, "timestamp_updated": 1506453423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35228372": {"recommendationid": "35228372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092720274", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506452872}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435. \u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e\u0439!", "timestamp_created": 1506453250, "timestamp_updated": 1506453250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35228355": {"recommendationid": "35228355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022664141", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506632593}, "language": "italian", "review": "CRASH CRASH CRASH SU CRASH, faccio 5 minuti di game e poi freeza e crasha consecutivamente, what can i do?

Overall, I would still recommend HoB, but here are my thoughts on some of the more talked about features.\n\nFirst, the game world.  The game world of HoB is pretty exquisite.  The art style, creatures, and sense of grandeur are extremely well done.  Watching the world change, based on your in game actions, is really neat and satisfying.  The way the different pieces of the puzzle-like world fit together and change over time is seamless and I'm pretty blown away.  I actually cannot imagine trying to make something like this work.  In my eyes, it's quite an achievement.\n\nSecond, the story or lack of one.  For me, this isn't an issue.  I'm actually having a great time with the mystery of the world.  I feel like the character, I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on while piecing things together through the puzzles.  It's pretty refreshing especially since I'm a bit of a snob about writing.  I'm not done with the game so I don't know how it unfolds, but right now (4-5 hours played) it is not an issue.  In fact, I think it works incredibly well because of the World's mysterious atmosphere.  That said, a lot of others have expressed frustration about this.  Their sentiments have been akin to, \"I'm doing this just because.\"  To those people I say, \"use your fucking imagination.\"\n\nThird, the combat.  Combat is pretty similar to Zelda (much of this game is similar to Zelda).  You swing your sword and punch your way to victory.  Some mobs die in a couple hits, others take quite awhile to kill.  Some aren't very dangerous, others kill you in 1 hit if you incorrectly time a dodge.  The progression of your sword skills/glove skills are noticeable.  Enemies explode when they die, combat sounds are present, and when a club smashes the ground, you feel it.  \n\nFourth, the puzzles and secrets.  I don't play tons of puzzle games, but I've been enjoying the ones in HoB.  I haven't found one that has completely stumped me for ages, but they don't feel insignificant either.  Thus far, I'm finding them pretty satisfying and with a reasonable amount of variance.  I imagine this is because most of them fundamentally alter the layout of the world and for some reason being able to see the impact makes them feel good to me.  I've discovered several secret areas, and I'm sure I've missed others.  It's exciting when you find one.  You feel like a small child that has figured out how to get into cookies.  Suck it, game.\n\nMy gripes:\n\nFifth, the controls and camera.  In general, the controls are fluid on the controller.  Your character is responsive, turns well, and moves well in combat.  The one caveat to this is during some of the jumping puzzles.  Your character cannot turn in the air.  Once you jump, you've jumped.  I cannot tell you how many times I've jumped from one log, to the next log, clipped the edge and fallen to my death.  It is frothing-at-the-mouth-maddening.  Absolutely livid.  The veins in my neck look like the forearms of a fucking gorilla.  I shit you not, I was backtracking earlier and came to a log jump and died 8 times in a row because my stupid character can't just stick his giant bionic arm out and grab the side of a log.  First jump, wide left.  Second jump, wide right.  Ensuing jumps, all over the place.  Holy shit.  I was freaking out.  This happens a lot.  Oh, nice ladder there.  Walk up to it, expect HoB to grab it, instead go flying off the fucking cliff to my death and have to run back.  Are you kidding me with this?  COME ON, MAN.  \n\nWhich then, of course, brings me to the camera.  It's fixed, you can't move it.  Which isn't that bad, exceptt when you're behind something and literally just have no idea what your character is up to.  Whoops, \"goodbye cruel world\" as you parasail to your death.  Lots of weird situations where you're just running aimlessly, have no idea what's near you and then smash into something (like thorns) that hurts you.  I'm sure there are very good reasons for the camera being fixed, but be prepared to flip your shit.  Between the camera/controls while jumping, you'll be rage quitting for sure.  I've rage quit a lot.\n\nLastly, the performance.  Performance has been a bit of an issue for a lot of people.  Some players cannot even start the game.  Fortunately, I've avoided those severe issues.  In my time playing, I've crashed twice.  Well, my game has frozen and stopped responding, forcing me to close it out.  And you will absolutely experience stuttering in some areas/chugging in some areas regardless of your computer's power.\n\nOverall: I've really enjoyed HoB thus far and I am looking forward to continuing to explore the World's mysteries.  I'd probably rate it 84/100, but that score would easily be in the 90s/100 if they fixed the controls and the performance issues.  The camera is only mildly irritating and mostly comounded by the controls.  The atmosphere of this game is incredible.  Pick it up.\n\nUpdate: Regarding game length, it took me just under 10 hours to complete the story with roughly half of the steam achievements.

"*UPDATE*\n\nJe mehr ich Spiele und je mehr ich in die Welt von Hob eintauche, desto mehr zieht es mich in seinen Bann. W\u00fcrde ich mich manches mal nicht so tollpatschig anstellen, h\u00e4tte ich den kleinen Kerl nicht so oft sterben lassen. Ich kann nicht einmal sagen das es mir jedesmal leid tut. Weil selbst das geh\u00f6rt zum Lernprozess in der Welt von Hob. Jedes Puzzle welches man l\u00f6st, jeder Fortschritt - auch wen er noch so klein ist - macht einem Spa\u00df, beruhigt - ja, befriedigt gar - in einem Ma\u00dfe, welches ich in wenig Spielen hatte.\n\nIch bin noch immer vom gesamten Setting und Stil des Games \u00fcberzeugt. Steuerung ist mit dem XBox Gamepad sehr gut. Die Mechaniken sind plausibel und sinnvoll. Der Sound gibt der Atmosph\u00e4re den letzten feinschliff und passt auch sehr gut zum rest. Ich freue mich was da noch so kommen mag. Dementsprechend werde ich dieses Review immer wieder anpassen.

Whether it's through new enemy encounters, upgrades, new abilities or locations, you are always doing something new, which I really appreciated.\n\nOne major aspect of the game is combat. It's relatively basic, but feels quite meaty. I would compare it to Bastion. Most enemies can be killed relatively quickly through simple button mashing. Where as some larger enemies will be a bit more akin to Dark Souls. Where one swing can do massive damage, and you really need to time your dodges and attacks. However this is much more rare, and most of the combat I've encountered so far has been more like the first example.\n\nYou've got a basic attack button, where your character will go through a sword slashing combo. Another button will allow you to charge up your fist. This is needed to open cracked walls, activate heavy switches or break stone armor on enemies. It feels really cool to use. You can also do aerial attacks, and have the ability to purchase new moves like sprinting attacks, or a shield. Again, adding to a nice feeling of growing stronger.\n\nAs you play through the game you will earn major new abilities that allow you to traverse new obstacles. Such as a \"warp\" that allows you to traverse over huge gaps or terrain, and is needed to progress through the game or access new secret areas.\n\nSpeaking of secrets, there are a lot of them. You do a lot of platforming in this game, and if you have a keen eye, you can find a lot of different types of secrets. Either a chest that will give you a bit of extra money, or a permanent health/energy upgrade. The game is open world, so you can always retrace your steps or teleport to an older area to find missed secrets.\n\nThe third and final element of the game is puzzle solving. I would say this is the majority of the game, and it's done quite nicely. I haven't encountered anything that stumped me for ages yet, but they are tough enough to make me feel accomplished when I solve them. A lot of the times, after solving a puzzle you will open up a shortcut to a previous area, or shift the land entirely so that major areas connect. It's a really nice feeling since it gives you that feeling of long-term progression.\n\nOnto the story. There isn't much of it. There's no text, or dialogue. There aren't many major characters, and the story isn't in your face. At the moment, I'm just doing stuff because... why not? There's a little bit of character interaction and an intro cutscene that gave me a bit of a drive to actually feel motivated to do what I'm doing, but I don't see the end goal. That's not to say that's a bad thing, I have no problem with it, but some might. There are a few \"lore rooms\" that you can find that will tell stories in the form of hieroglyphics, but I haven't encountered anything more than that so far.\n\nOverall, I'm absolutely loving the game. Everything feels great. It feels like a good Zelda adventure. My only gripe is that I feel like the game can use some optimization. Even on medium graphics, on my 1060 I get frame drops quite consistently when I reveal a new area.\nOther than that, I can strongly recommend the game if you like the look of it!", "timestamp_created": 1506445516, "timestamp_updated": 1506523223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717167", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35225753": {"recommendationid": "35225753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151097535", "num_games_owned": 752, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506774400}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1]Runic Games, die Entwickler von Torchlight I & II gehen nun mit [i]\"Hob\"[/i] in die n\u00e4chste Runde.

Ihr erwacht ganz allein, als ein einsamer Held auf einem zerst\u00f6rten Planeten, dessen Zivilisation von gef\u00e4hrlichen Gegner \u00fcberrannt wurde. Ihr m\u00fcsst diese ausschalten, verschiedene Arten von Puzzlen l\u00f6sen und alles daf\u00fcr tun um den Planeten wieder gesund zu machen.\nMein Fazit ist ganz klar: Hob lohnt sich! c:", "timestamp_created": 1506445151, "timestamp_updated": 1506445151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1786, "total_negative": 212, "total_reviews": 1998}}

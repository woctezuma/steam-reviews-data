It's annoying that you can't set your resolution, the windowed mode is useless because the window box is so ridiculously small that you can't really see anything.

After reliving old memories by watching gameplay videos of it I found out it was on Steam ! I may have some biases due to loving this game so much in my earlier years, but here is my review;\n\nSUMMARY: [Scroll down for Pros/Cons]\nBasically you click to feed your fish in each level, you can also click to collect the coins they drop,pet after the first few levels who will pick up the coins for you, there are other pets later on who do the same thing. \nThe main game is like a clicker game but it's different. You start off with two guppy fish in each level, you start with being able to feed them one food at a time, then as they grow [they have 3 growth stages] they will unlock new items and fish to help you progress in the level so you can unlock an egg which gives you a new pet. \nThe pets help you do certain tasks, some of them will drop coins, or keep your guppies safe, or help you battle off the aliens that come in each level.\nSpeaking of the aliens, those appear every level, and there are many different kinds of them that have their own abilities, and their own way for you to kill them.\nThe game has a total of 5 tanks, and 21 levels, the last one being a final boss. There are a total of 24 pets, you get one after the end of each level, and the extra ones you buy with Shells, a currency that you get in special bonus levels that allows you to buy pets and fish in the Virtual Tank\nThe Virtual Tank was made for the \"animated wallpaper\" craze of the early 2000s, you can set it to be a screensaver. You can also buy fish from a shop that changes daily, the fish you buy from here grow if you check on them daily and they also drop Shells.\n\n\"Well what can I do after I beat the main game ?\"\nThere is a challenge mode unlocked after beating the main game where being similar to the main game where you avoid alien attacks and try to get the egg, every 4 seconds an item increases 1% of its original price, but once an egg piece is bought the prices reset, the longer you play this mode the harder the aliens that attck you get, you get awarded shells for completing challenge mode levels.\nThere is also a time-trials mode where instead of egg peices you buy an egg that contains a random pet that  will assist you until all pets are in use, the goal of this mode is to make as much money before time runs out, 5% of the money you earn will be converted to shells.\n\nTL;DR SUMMARY:\nThe best way I can explain it in short is it's a bit like cookie clicker with more depth.\nThere's also aliens. \n\nPROS:\n- Fun and simple gameplay that is easy to understand and a good time-waster\n- Amazing graphics that hold up for being released in 2002 !!\n- Many gamemodes and game types\n- Great soundtrack ! [Love the Tank 2 theme, it's so calming]\n- A great game to play to take your mind off things for a bit\n- Many levels, unlockable fish and pets, and more\n- Fun little Easter-Eggs that may spice things up\n\nCONS:\n- May be too repetitve for some people\n- Tank 1 soundtrack is kinda headache-inducing if you play through the tank in one go\n- Can become boring if you try to beat it all in one go, try to break it up over a few days or weeks\n\nThat's all I have for cons ! Again, I may have bias,,, \nTotally reccomend this game though !", "timestamp_created": 1514427315, "timestamp_updated": 1516433380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601364", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38761903": {"recommendationid": "38761903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022255920", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467185205}, "language": "english", "review": "there are fishies in this game", "timestamp_created": 1514425376, "timestamp_updated": 1514425376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38757429": {"recommendationid": "38757429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043727092", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514430875}, "language": "english", "review": "i'm in 2nd grade again and it's better than i remembered holy shit", "timestamp_created": 1514415464, "timestamp_updated": 1514415464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38728051": {"recommendationid": "38728051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036387728", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514327691}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my childhood game, and although I have this as not recommended, I do recommend this game if you have also experienced this game in your early days, and want to re-experience that. As for newcomers, unless you're 10 years old or younger, I don't recommend this game at all. \n\nSo why don't I recommend this game? Simple, it's incredibly repetitive. When in your first levels, you may enjoy the game, but then after I would say the fourth or fifth level, is when you will probably just get bored of the game and probably just stop playing the game ever again due to its heavy repeating. Not only that, but the game practically requires an auto clicker to stop from cramping your finger/hand after awhile on all levels. But other then all of that, if you do plan to get this game, I would say your best bet is to treat this like solitaire, or minefield, in terms of if you get really bored, and you don't really have any other game to play, it can probably help you out in that regard.", "timestamp_created": 1514360348, "timestamp_updated": 1514360348, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38718623": {"recommendationid": "38718623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159706185", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515970032}, "language": "english", "review": "Childhood.", "timestamp_created": 1514336288, "timestamp_updated": 1514336288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38671149": {"recommendationid": "38671149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167422251", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483193114}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this game before Steam even had this.

The love put into this game, like all Popcap games shows. They literally studied gold fish to make this game. The aliens are really creative with a lot more variety than you'd expect, a lot of cool mechanics, purposefully made tedious (in a good way of course). This game will give you a good 10 hours if your quick and as with every Popcap game (or most with a campaign) it is possible to replay the campaign, but obviously it isn't as easy as the previous expedition, and the game comes with a virtual fish tank with a shop refreshing daily with new creatures to add your tank. Oh and it comes with a nifty screen saver of your virtual tank. Overall this game is a huge 9/10 from me, only cons were that I wish there were more levels to the main game, and maybe a couple more bosses, but now I'm looking for things to critisize.

Deluxe is a game I have played in my childhood- as many other reviewers here have. However, even if you are older than 6, I think you may still like this game, I'll explain.\nInsaniquarium is an old game, there are 2 things you are required to do: You are tasked with simply buying/feeding fish, occasionally doing certain things to keep bigger or different fish alive (like feeding a bigger fish normal fish, or feeding even bigger fish the already mentioned big fish that feeds on your normal fish, or feeding a certain creature beetles).\nThe other thing you must do is defend your fish from aliens by shooting them with your laser gun. \nYou can save up money to bye temporary upgrades that can make your job easier, such as getting the ability to give the fish more than 1 thing of food at a time, getting better food, or getting a better gun (the final upgrade turns your gun into an automatic weapon, making tougher levels super easy). \nThe main goal of Insaniquarium is to save up enough money to bye all 3 peices of an egg, once this is done, you unlock a companion fish that can help you out in your playthrough. You also move on to the next stage- there are 4 stages and you after you get the last egg, you move on to the fifth and final stage (which is only 1 level).\n\nThere are a few modes besides the main story, such as a time trail mode, a normal fish tank mode where you buy and take care of fish without the danger of aliens, and a mode after the main story that allows you to reply the game with all of your companions (and you even get a story of the companions after each level).\n\nNow as to why I recommend this game... it is a fun little game that will keep you occupied if you don't have much money, or you are just looking for something small to play. \nPerhaps you are a parent and you're trying to buy a game for your kid- in that case then get this game for them! Trust me, this will be something they cheris throughout their livesand if you get involved and play the game with them, it will be a memorable expirience.\n\nMy score for the game is a 6/10 as a normal game, and an 8/10 for nostalgia value.", "timestamp_created": 1505066814, "timestamp_updated": 1505066814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34860575": {"recommendationid": "34860575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324045595", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510464103}, "language": "english", "review": "When I was five I first played the game.I addicted to playing it.There are adequate time to play it.So I play it from moring till night.Therefore my vision has been declare to 0.5 .So my mother forbid me to play computer games.Now it is 12 years past.When I find it again I bought it.Thank you POPCAP.Although you have been annex by EA,I can't forget you.", "timestamp_created": 1505046112, "timestamp_updated": 1505046112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34849240": {"recommendationid": "34849240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184251766", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510123330}, "language": "schinese", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1505000505, "timestamp_updated": 1505000505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34845280": {"recommendationid": "34845280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381504579", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513404522}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and addicting \n", "timestamp_created": 1504986391, "timestamp_updated": 1504986391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34844099": {"recommendationid": "34844099", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997444576", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504982567}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really good game, very worth playing.

found this game on Popcap as the free online version. It had no music, and only one area but I remember playing it for hours. It was simple, but it was the perfect blend of tricky mechanics and pacing that kept me coming back.\n\nFast-forward to about 2012 to when I was around 12 my father had purchased a Popcap collection that included this along with some other favorites of mine like Heavy Weapon. I remember being glued to it for hours. I'd never had so much fun with it as I had with any other game. At the time I had played stuff like XIII, the Sly Coopers, Ace Combat 5, Call of Duty Finest Hour, Medal of Honor Frontline, and some of the classics such as Deus Ex and Half-Life. Yet the music and the simple structure of Insaniquarium gave me a sense of euphoria that I hadn't felt before at the time. Much of it was childhood nostalgia but I remembered at the time admiring the atomspehere and rising difficulty. For being about 11-12 the amount of fish and money required to finish each level was enough of a challenge to encourage me to keep going. I remembered finding the levels in the 4 area to be outright hell. The concepts were simple to follow, the bosses were varied to create some doubt when entering a new level. The music was very cheerful and inviting, setting a friendly environment for the most part and but even the later levels also created a sense of the rising challenge. There's only about 5 tracks but each sets the mood all on its own without too much duplication, with the exception of the main menu music being reused for level 4. At the time, it was a firm favorite that seemed to encompass everything I found to be fun with elements of management, survival, and even a minor shooting portion thrown in. All within a game about feeding fish. It seemed flawless.\n\nFast-forward to about 2016 when I opened this account. Having been unable to own a computer powerful enough for Steam for years I was supremely curious to see what was available here. When I discovered that the old gems of Popcap were available I snapped it up instantly (Inspite of it being about $80 at the time). I immediately downloaded the favorites: Heavy Weapon, Chuzzle, Hammer Heads, and of course, Insaniquarium. And so the question presented itself, did the game still hold up 5 years later at the age of 17? Well right off the bat I could say that the difficulty certainly was not what I remembered. When was a kid the game took me quite some time to beat as I said I found the level 4 area to be hell quite often. Well after being dedicated to beating it I swept through the game across a few days with a collective time of about 6 hours. The management boiled down to just setting up a system that got you the money you needed without committing fish genocide and staying within your complusory money-burning budget to get each egg shard to complete the level. The bosses themselves were only a minor disturbance especially because I did not remember what type was what. All except for the Squid monster, screw that one. Being invulnerable and then laying waste to countless fish peoples upon normalizing caused more headaches and vexations than I remembered. The convoluted set-up of guppys to guppymunchers to beatle muncher in the level 3 area was both an inviting challenge and a Gordian Knot constructed only with the purpose of slowing down your monopolization of the fish and egg-shard market. Otherwise the levels were still fun. Although shorter on account of me panicking less when fish started turning into skeletons due to Squid and Robot genocide, the fact that they were short kept everything fun and fresh as it meant I didn't have to spend an hour to get through the level. They were long enough for me to enjoy the set-up of the money machine and short enough for me to glide along the levels like the fish I was raising (starving). The music was still as cheery and memorable too. I found myself looking up the tracks afterward and playing them while I was doing other things. The first level especially does a fantastic job and constructing the friendly tone of the game. This game is meant for you to have fun with your fish-slavery and money-grubbing efforts. But holy smokes I need to talk about the Credit music. So when I cut the head off of area 4 I found myself at the big showdown when you need to kill the evil menace sending all the evil monsters to destroy your perfect ecosystems. This battle when even high stakes as your population consisted of your pets, the life-long allies that meant the difference between failure and securing yet another pet. So it was both heart-breaking to see them slaughtered and hectic to keep them alive. When the smoke cleared, I had about 4 survivors. But don't worry, that angel fish you acquired like a level ago purposely stayed out of the fight to keep them alive. So the credits roll as my crew is brought back from the watery grave and in a game with a colorful and bright atmosphere the music is surprisingly somber and sad. It's slow and drags along, filling an empty void with a sense of loss. I really found myself not wanting to leave the game as this music played. For me credits and final boss tracks at their best when I get a sense of loss. If the game is really good and doing its job I should be left wanting more and to never leave in the first place. For how simple it is the credits music really left me in that state. I had to sit through it and absorb it all until the end. It's probably one of the few times I've found myself wanting to sit through a credits screen. For that reason alone I give this game a solid 9/10. For a simple point-and-click management game it does its job really well of giving you a bright atmosphere with a fun challenge filled in. There aren't very many decisions and you won't find yourself regretting your purchases too often but the pacing of the game flows smoothly enough to keep me hooked into capping off every area. With that said my nostalgia did not preserve the difficulty or even the little feeding simulator where you can raise fish for shells and steadily upgrade your community within that tank. That for me took too long to build up any money for anything and if you wanted to get the upgrades for the tank like the Bubblator you needed BIG cash. Cash that you could realisitically only get from doing the other gamemodes. That system would be fine if the virtual tank had more impact on the core gameplay. Otherwise the only motivation for getting said shell currency is for the secret pets which can in itself be the ultimate reward. While I liked killing some time with it it wasn't the Zen Garden from Plants vs Zombies where I could get money at a fairly decent rate for some fantastic new plants and upgrades. All in all the feature is something that you might return to on occassion but I didn't find myself sticking to it long.\n\nSo that's it, Insaniquarium.

These fish need to be fed every 5 seconds or they will die. But if you are like me, you use drugs instead to feed the fish, it doesn't make them any happier but it shuts them up for about 2 minutes before they want more fucking drugs, also if the police get suspicious I can always tell them that its fish food. \nThere are many types of fish. There is the regular carnivore, who eats your small fish, A living bowl with tentacles that only eats stars made by your fish. A pair of tits with pinchers that somehow releases beetles that feeds a tadpole with oversized eyes that needs to eat a beetle every 10 seconds. And finally we have the fish that's bigger than your mother that literally shits treasure chests. But its not easy keeping them alive. Every 5 minutes, some ugly ass alien comes in and tries to eat your fish, but you can't let the aliens eat your fish or otherwise you will go broke and lose your shit. Fortunately you have Illegal weapons from outer space, so dealing with aliens is easy. After you get enough money, you will need to buy 3 magical egg pieces that magically hatch into a pet that will help you with later levels. Pets come in different shapes and sizes. Some of them are very useful in giving money like the oyster with huge ass lips and some of them are completely useless such as the stupid pink hermit crab that pinches fish that get near the bottom of the tank. Eventually, you will face the leader of the aliens and she wants revenge on your pets that you have hatched. She takes 10 million hits to kill even with a level 8 blaster, but she should be no problem if you play lots of clicker heroes or if you are a perv and a weeb, sakura clickers. After you defeat the leader of the aliens, you will get arrested eventually because of all of the noise you were making with the alien blasters. Also, the fish wouldn't eat the drugs. Moral of story: Don't do drugs and if you do, make a better excuse rather than using it to feed the fish. 100000/10 would get arrested for drug possession again.", "timestamp_created": 1483046211, "timestamp_updated": 1483046211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505574", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28746550": {"recommendationid": "28746550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066295515", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482958908}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very good if you wanna relax.", "timestamp_created": 1482920745, "timestamp_updated": 1482920745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28731034": {"recommendationid": "28731034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115284010", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482113512}, "language": "english", "review": "if you want to treat the fish and fighting the aliens.

As a child, my father purchased this Christmas Megabundle for about a hundred dollars that included some of PopCap's greatest hits such as Bookworm and Feeding Frenzy. However, as I was trying random games that Christmas Day, I was delightfully surprised by the unique artstyle and gameplay of Insaniquarium and was hooked far after I beat the game. \n\nThis game has strong appeal to me because of many reasons. For one, most gamers will appreciate the casual gameplay that it provides while those that are seeking more difficult waters are provided with the Challenge Mode, a special but optional \"hard-mode\" that brings, in fact, quite a challenge for such a calm game. Another is the creativity of the development team. From a sluggish snail who helps you gather coins to a vicious shark that will help defend your tank at the cost of some of your small fish, it's obvious that a lot of time was put into making each and every one of these unique characters. And finally, the replay value of the game.

It was one of my favorite computer games, if not THE favorite at the time. I really love this game! It might be an aquarium game, but the twists this game puts into it makes it great.\nBuy fish, feed fish, watch them give you money, get more fish, get fish that eat those fish giving more money, etc =\nProfit\nThis game also has aliens! Every now and then, an alien will pop up in the tank, and you have to kill it before it kills all your fish. There are several different aliens and ways to beat them. Normal ones, ones you need to feed to kill, two headed, rocket launching and more. \nThere are four different tanks, five levels for each one. You can also play a timed version of said tanks, where the objective is to collect as much money as you can in a short amount of time, some of it going to your virtual tank. The vitrual tank is basically a normal, virtual fishtank. It's what it sounds like. For this tank you earn shells, which you do NOT earn as quickly as simple coins in the main game. Every day new fish are for sale, and if you are lucky, you might even find some color changing ones. There is also challenge, which you can play after beating the main game (which I have never gotten to. Never got that far.)\nTo end each level you need to buy the three parts of the egg, the eggs getting more and more expensive as you go on. After doing so, you get a new pet. You can have three active at once, and they can do several things. Feed your fish, gather money, fight of aliens, give you new fish, make money, and more. There are also very expensive bonus pets you can buy for shells. \nAt first it's pretty slow, but once you get a lot of fish in your tank towards the end of the levels, it can get pretty hectic, especially later on. You will need to click constantly! Switching from collecting as much money as you can to feeding your fish so they don't die, to making sure the fish with more special needs don't die, and fighting off the occational alien.\nThis game is awesome, and I would highly recommend it. It might be a bit old, but it's fun nonetheless. \n", "timestamp_created": 1475573475, "timestamp_updated": 1475573475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552571", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25747484": {"recommendationid": "25747484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285025458", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474405334}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game, it's fun!", "timestamp_created": 1475103881, "timestamp_updated": 1475103881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25573471": {"recommendationid": "25573471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331129292", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513164710}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game", "timestamp_created": 1474217937, "timestamp_updated": 1474217937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25563786": {"recommendationid": "25563786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061466590", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474184526}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat the game in two days while sharing library with my mom on vacation away from my rig, so don't be fooled by the lack of playtime.

You decide! It is fun either way (but you will only progress through the former, not through acts of cruelty).\n\nYou play with the mouse, and depending on how you play, you will hurt your pointer finger or your mouse. Thankfully, there are features that ease this, such as other fish or creatures (e.g. carnivors or star catchers) you can buy that reduce the amount of bits of money to collect (diamonds as opposed to several gold coins, or pearls as opposed to beetles) or upgrades to your weapon... there are other features that you will find out yourself, but pay the money to save your finger... or your mouse.\n\nThis game looks dated and cartoony, but PopCap has made a masterpiece that is an insane mix of real time strategy, simulation, and shooter that picks at your trigger finger and your smarts. It has high replay value and you also get to have your very own virtual tank to keep (as opposed to the fish you have to defend against aliens).

I hesitated before buying this on Steam because I was worried that all the nostalgia magic would disappear, and that I'd see this game as a piece of crap 10+ years later-- that's what happened with watching the newer Pokemon episodes, anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game was still as charming as ever. I do recommend getting this game, it's got more than enough replay value to warrant spending 4.99 on.\n\nIt's a simple game in concept: you have fish, you feed the fish, you kill aliens that randomly appear, fish shit cash monies, use fish monies to buy egg pieces, the end. It's easy enough to play a level or two in lecture (mind the clicking noises, though), but it can get a bit tricky, especially when it comes to deciding which special pets you'd like to bring to your tank on any given level. The chill fish tank mode that you can keep outside of the actual game is cute, it's always fun seeing the fish's personalities and giving them strange names.", "timestamp_created": 1430812889, "timestamp_updated": 1430812953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15691490": {"recommendationid": "15691490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127560632", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1515814937}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as good as I remember it.\n\nThe only downside is the resolution is really bad for modern computers, so you'll probably end up playing it in a small window.\n\nOther than that, amazing time-killing game, just like most of Popcap's other titles.", "timestamp_created": 1430777238, "timestamp_updated": 1430777238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15667371": {"recommendationid": "15667371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004311443", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434891591}, "language": "english", "review": "Childhood Classic.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1430648668, "timestamp_updated": 1430648668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15653484": {"recommendationid": "15653484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191990730", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470209709}, "language": "english", "review": "very addicting. i love it", "timestamp_created": 1430574890, "timestamp_updated": 1430574890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15602300": {"recommendationid": "15602300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028137800", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433635041}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally the best game of the 21st century. dont eat my fish you stupid fucking aliens", "timestamp_created": 1430255267, "timestamp_updated": 1430255267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15601161": {"recommendationid": "15601161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083709305", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505593085}, "language": "english", "review": "Spend countless hours feeding virtual fish just to watch them die from random space aliens in your fish tank.

Be that as it may, the lot of clicking that you do is quite rewarding. The game goes in depth with unlockables, and different forms of items you are able to purchase. Being one of PopCapGames most sucessful games, Insaniquarium offers many great levels, game modes, and a variety of different fish you can choose from to raise. Some fish you can raise in your own Virtual Tank, that you need to check on from time to time to make sure they don't starve. Many of the fish available for purchase(in-game purchase) do a variety of unique things, making you all the more inclined to get more.\n\nAs you play the main Adventure Mode, you will discover many different species of pets, whether it be an angler fish, an electric eel, or even a deepwater lobster. These pets aid you in taking down enemies and feeding your fish to gain higher  funds in your wallet, and overall increase the flow of gameplay.\n\nPlease acknowledge that this game isn't for everybody.

However, it is a responsibility. Before getting a fish tank, here are some basic rules that you should know;\n\nA great starter fish is a Guppy, they are small, inexpensive and not too hard to care for. \n\nFlakes are a simple and effective diet for fish, and guppies live them! When feeding it to them, they will eventually grow. \n\nWhen guppies grow, they will begin to shit out nickels and dimes. When they reach thier maximum size, the dimes will turn into gold coins. This is natural for a fish, and can pay off bills.\n\nSoon, you can try a more advanced fish, a predator Oscar that eats young guppies. Because guppies turn a flake into pure gold, the Oscar manipulates this and turns the guppy itself into a diamond and poops it out. Again, quite natural, it's called reverse bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, sometimes advanced alien fish overlords will teleport into your tank, and eat every fish you loved. To combat them, you need a gun! I prefer a starter Glock 17, yet later they'll send in heavier alien overlords into your tank, even multiples at a time. Once this happens, you need to buy a sawed off shotgun from your local gun dealer. You have to be careful though, bullets can sometimes break the glass of your fish tank if not used correctly. \n\nYou can also use a kitchen knife to kill these 3\" aliens and then throw them on the barby to feed your family and friends at a party. It sure will make an impressive entree. \n\nNow, guppies and Oscars aren't the only fish you can get. You can get a minature yellow finned penguin that can get pregnant by the water itself. \n\nFinally, if you want to upgrade your fish, you can feed them FDA (Fish Department Area) approved Asprin Fish Pills that are much better than flakes or pellets. You can also feed them Science Stuff in a jar to make fish shit out golden stars from Super Mario World. \n\nThank you for reading, may your fish tank prosper and not be overtaken by alien fish overlords.", "timestamp_created": 1420182516, "timestamp_updated": 1420182652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

When combat occurs, there's a sharp balance you have to hold between managing aggression and doing damage; less attacks per second to keep an important character safe, or more to finish him off but maybe propel the alien into your school? It's very difficult to the point that survival horror comes to mind as a genre.\n\nThe budgeting system is intense. Allocating funds between fish and weapons borders on art instead of strategy. Don't walk into this game expecting a casual experience. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that the upgrade mechanics are also amazing. While it's usually linear improvement, expect stellar new graphics and sounds along with your stat buffs. There are upgrades for fish, weapons, food, and more that I won't mention.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is absolutely killer. Seriously. It's amazing. You could sleep to the calm tracks, but I can personally vouch that when PopCap wants to build suspense, they build it. They then deliver. Hard. The enemies you'll be fighting in this game are, as previously mentioned, no joke. Those linear upgrades I mentioned are less upgrades and more a scrabble to keep up with the standard of ten steps behind the enemy. Good luck accomplishing even that. And believe me. You'll be pounded with sick beats the whole time.\n\nThe cast in this game is great. Deep, dark, thoughtful lines and lovable characters, models, and animations make this game truly beautiful and unforgettable. Every death is truly a tragedy. The end credits are mostly comic relief (literally the first you'll see in the entire game), so they lack a bit in the way of factual information. Through my own research, I've found a few of the character actors:\n1. The dolphin's sounds were ripped directly from a Soviet nuclear submarine.\n2. One of the \"hidden\" special characters' grunts are from Sylvester Stallone's first role ever. I'm not sure they attained the proper licensing, but it looks like the beginnings of the lawsuit were swept under the rug.\n3. The guppies sound like a plethora of different actors, but is actually just Bill Murray pretending to be hundreds of other actors.\n4. The final boss is voiced by Bill Murray acting as himself.\n5. The last one I could figure out was the carnivores' bite sounds are the exact same sound as the dog bites in CoD: Ghosts. I'm not sure how that happened, but I promise that if you compare them they're exactly the same.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to touch on is the amazing graphical expertise that the art department at PopCap has. Genuinely soothing and peaceful graphics put you into a calm state right along with the soundtrack; that is, until and alien shows up and the advanced gore engine tosses guppy shreds all over your tank. The shading effects are also amazing. Shadows are affected by laser blasts and temporal warp shifts (TWSs as known ingame), and you can almost see the reflection in a guppy's eye as her beloved little sister is strewn halfway across the tank by the razor-sharp teeth of an extraterrestrial. When it needs to build suspense, it acknowledges the hardware shortcomings of the time and leaves a lot to the imagination; however, I promise you that when that suspense finally culminates, you'll wish they'd left a little more to be imagined.\n\nThis game definitely isn't for casuals or noobs. I'm not trying to be offensive, but I promise that it'll stomp you into the ground over and over, and its version of a reprieve is stepping back long enough to pull on a pair of steel-toes. The only tip I can give is to avoid indecision because I promise that if you falter for even a second, it'll destroy your guppies so fast that your economy will be irreparably tanked. And if you ever try to turn tail and run, you shouldn't be surprised to find some boot laces dangling from your nose.

I had an actual disc, a DISC.\n\nDon't be fooled by its \"casualness\",  this game is INTENSE.  Insaniquarium Deluxe is an aquarium simulator.  With a few twists.  Aliens attack your fish, fish can die if they turn green for longer than 10 seconds, and it has riduculous \"buddies\" that help you through each level.  The goal of the game is to buy fish and feed them so they give you coins.  With these coins you buy more fish, food, potions, and egg parts.  In order to beat the level you must buy 3 egg parts.  At random points during the game aliens will appear and try to kill your fish.  You have to click the aliens to kill them, ALOT.  RIP your mouse.  It also has a quirky and albeit immature sense of humor which when I played it my 10 year old self loved.  There is a buddie named \"Preggo\".  She is a fish that overtime gets bigger and eventually gives birth to a guppy complete with an absurd fart sound.  I played this game 9 years ago and it was a blast.

PopCap's major successes include Bejeweled, Peggle, and Plants Vs. Zombies, but through playing all of their games for the past twelve years, Insaniquarium is by far my personal favorite, and in my opinion, the most original, creative, and fun. \n\nThis game is part simulation, part \"management\", part tycoon, part action, and all sorts of...well, insanity. You are put in charge of an aquarium, where you can buy goldish, carnivorous fish, and many other types of creatures that you grow and make money off of. (First win of the game: goldfish poop money!) You use this money for upgrades (upgrade the food to make the fish grow faster and get hungry less often, buy carnivorous fish that poop diamonds but eat little goldfish, etc.). You have access to dozens of unlockable aquarium pets throughout the game that help you in various ways, and you choose which three you'd like to bring to any level. Oh, but I haven't mentioned the aliens. That's right, folks, aliens are so jealous of your awesometacular aquarium that they'll attack, and throughout the campaign the aliens get fiercer (and sometimes come in multiples!). Aliens will eat your fish, but not if you kill them first with a laser gun that you can also upgrade...with the money your fish poop, of course.\n\nNot only does this game have a great campaign that will keep you busy over the course of quite a few hours, but it also presents new challenges to the player along the way, in the forms of various alien types, different fish you have to figure out how to make profitable, etc. Not only that, but throughout playing you'll unlock sea shells that serve as currency for a \"Pet Aquarium\", where you can purchase fish (among other things) for a relaxing sim aquarium. These fish are essentially the same species from the game, but they come in a large variety of color combinations and sometimes even have special skills (some hilarious, some useful, etc.). What's even better? The selection of fish in the store is randomized and changed daily, meaning you'll come across some really awesome fish one day that you might not see for awhile again, so you can save your shells and get rarities or even just cool looking fish to add to you aquarium. You can collect quite a few, and you can even name them. You also have access to their \"interests\" screen, where you can learn more about your fish. Does Gill like to take walks in the park? How long have you owned little Floater? You can see all that and more.\n\nInsaniquarium is a perfect example of PopCap at their finest. Sure, the game is \"casual\", but it offers you so many options and it has so much detail that many developers wouldn't have added in (like telling you your fish's interests, for example).

It's odd that this is not under the horror/suspense tag because that is just what it is. Raising many, many, fish, only to have them taken away from you after a bond has been formed. I've named my fish individually, then was FORCED to feed them to another species of fish, only to have that species of fish savagely murdered by weird-ass, freaky-ass, nigga-ass alienfish. My heart could not possibly experience hardships any worse than it has for the hours I have clocked so far, and I only got this game yesterday. Many questions are left un-answered. Who are we? Why are we feeding the fish? Why are there predator aliens and monsters, that look like lions, invading this tank and eating my guppies? What the fuck, bro. Thos guppies be ma niggas. You can't just walk (swim?) on up into my hood, and eat them like you own the place. Nigga you don't even pay rent, damn. There is too much nudity and suggestive content in this game for the general public. Let me tell you a little about one of the \"pets\" you aquire early on, named \"Preggo\". That's right. Her fucking name is Preggo. Just as her name suggests, she is an a-sexual-babyshitting-demorphed-rubberduck-thing. But you're probably thinking, \"So what? It's the miracle of birth!\". Well you're fucking WRONG. She literally SHITS them out. There's a sharting sound that plays every time one of these little shits are born. And believe me, they dont last long. That's right, your newest addition of the family is just food for these carnivorous fish, appropriately named \"Carnivores\". They pop out of her brown-star only to be eaten up by these scat-loving carnivores. So anyway, this game is NOT for anyone light-hearted or under the age of 18. Do I recommend this game?

A good combination requires quite some thought.\nAliens come in a lot of types, each with a different attack pattern. There are aliens that shoot missiles, aliens with two heads, aliens that can regain health, aliens that are killed by being fed, you name it. Fighting is intense, because you have to avoid having all your fish eaten.\nWhat I like most are food chains. In each of the 4 stages there's a different food chain. You start from cheap guppies, then earn enough money to buy a \"shark\"(I forgot its correct name) that feed on guppies. Fish at a higher level cost more, require food that cost more, and in return produce more money.

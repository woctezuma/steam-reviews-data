I could happily add the soundtrack to my \"shit to relax to\" playlist.  8/10\n\nThe controls are very nice. They're smooth, responsive, and don't have any weird gimmicks, like Axiom Verge had, that make stuff uncomfortable to control. The grappling hook's fixed 45 degree firing angle and set duration is a relaxing break from more Super Metroid style grappling. It adds some challenge in timing your grapples properly while removing some challenge from having to aim them. The dashes aren't difficult to control either.   8/10\n\nThe exploration is good, although it feels less expansive than the original Metroid, much less later ones. There are secrets to be found, sequence breaks to perform if you're good enough, and post-main-game content to explore.    7/10\n\nThe combat could be better. There's no real point to fighting anything besides bosses if you can just run past instead, but there's no real reward for running past like with an Iji pacifist run. The bosses are moderately challenging, and moderately fun.   7/10\n\nOverall: 7/10 in general, 8/10 if you're a sucker for Metroidvania's like me, and add an extra half point to those anytime it's on sale, since the base price is already very reasonable.", "timestamp_created": 1515695958, "timestamp_updated": 1515695958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39249447": {"recommendationid": "39249447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963688296", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 1054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 721, "last_played": 1515372513}, "language": "english", "review": "A Metroid/Super Metroid tribute that wears its references and salutes on its sleeves. ESA doesn't pretend not to know where it came from, but it's more than enough of its own game that you won't feel like \"you've done this before\" even though the game seems to try and set you up for it several times before going its own way. Controls like you'd expect Metroid would, just smaller and 8-bit (again), certain aspects like grappling take a bit of pratice to get used to because that's one thing that ISN'T like Super Metroid. Also, no morph ball.\n\nA lot of people have gotten hung up on the graphics and I myself am not too fond of \"pixelshit\", but they started to grow on me as I played. The other factor is difficulty, this game is a lot more like the original NES Metroid in that respect. It tends to be pretty merciless. You can't get energy back from enemies, it must be restored at a repair station or save station which means a lot more emphasis on avoiding confrontations when you can. Because of the nature of the game it can also mean bumbling around with low health and missing powerups when you already had access to them, if you just knew where to look. Normal in this game is most other game's \"Nightmare\", expect to die, a lot.\n\nThe plot starts of a la Metroid Fusion, explore the ESA, find out what went wrong. However, it gets weird after you reach the first ending, to say more would spoil it though I did end up digging into guides to figure out what the hell to do next several times, some of the post-game puzzles felt almost TOO obscure. Prepare to get stuck for awhile, especially if you insist on trying to figure it all out on your own.\n\nThe soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a long time and fits the mood and aesthetic of the game extremely well.

The animations in the game are well done, and each area seems handcrafted without a single wasted pixel. Some areas even have a dynamic feeling as they undergo change as the game progresses. The soundtrack is also great and fits the ambience of the mysterious station.\n\nGameplay wise it plays very much like you'd expect where you explore an uncharted area and fight bosses, while also finding tools along the way that allow you to explore more of the world. The grappling hook took you get is particularly fun to use. There are even a few optional upgrades you can get in the game, but they kind of end up making you overpowered.\n\nThe game tells it's plot in a wonderful way, where just as you explore the station like it's a puzzle, the story is the same way. It's a puzzle you slowly unravel and even includes a cryptic language for you to decipher to unlock the secret ending.\n\nESA also manages to mitigate some of the problems other metroidvanias have with backtracking by introducing a fairly substantial teleport system that allows you to easily transport yourself around the map to places you've already been. It introduces this just as the map really starts to open up more.\n\nThe only real drawback is the difficulty in the game is a bit uneven. Relatively early on certain boss fights will be on the difficult side, largely because you have limited health. However, during the end of the game most of the bosses end up becoming really easy thanks to having collected HP upgrades and some optional mobility/weapon upgrades.  Plus, as much as I enjoy the different bosses most of them don't involve a whole lot of movement. Instead they tend to be pretty stationary, and you need to dodge their attacks.  Luckily these are both flaws recognized by the developer, Hempuli, and something he is working on for the sequel!.\n\nThe game is only $8 and it is a great value, and should take you anywhere from 6 hours if you just power through the mainstory, to over 20 hours if your a completionist and go for the secret ending.", "timestamp_created": 1509563347, "timestamp_updated": 1509563347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36000547": {"recommendationid": "36000547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026492249", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461803501}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite of all time Metroidvanias.", "timestamp_created": 1508979586, "timestamp_updated": 1508979586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35782892": {"recommendationid": "35782892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158796130", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506034142}, "language": "english", "review": "p good\n\nim stuck tho plz help", "timestamp_created": 1508195821, "timestamp_updated": 1508195821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455397", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35725096": {"recommendationid": "35725096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053547790", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507995763}, "language": "english", "review": "This game wasted no time in reminding me of the worst aspect of Metriodvania.

It can be quite challenging for players newer to the genre or less experienced when starting out, but the concept is great, along with the multitude of challenging bosses and endings, along with plenty of secrets (some quite obscure, requiring finding all sorts of secret areas) and powerups. So basically, if you think the premise or trailer is cool (The trailer actually displays rooms from real environments in the game) and you're up for a challenge (certain early bossfights can take 5-10 tries to beat or more) and late-game some areas and bosses can be quite frustrating to navigate if certain completely optional powerups are not unlocked (for example the OP triple-shot module for the gun).\n\nSecondly, before the teleporters are unlocked the fairly frequent backtracking can sometimes get tedious, as earlier in the game the only way to get to key locations is to go through 10+ rooms filled with enemies and obstacles. While it's not extremely heavy on backstory, the general atmosphere and design style of the (absolutely massive) sector-based station is also quite nice     \n(and, fun fact, the Trailer actually displays rooms from real environments in the game).\n So, in conclusion, I would definitely recommend trying this game out, as the price ($8.79 CAD) compared to the hours of content is fair, though as much as I fanboy over this game (being new to the genre) it isn't free of issues to critique, for example the original controls for Keyboard are set to X-jump, and C-shoot, but thankfully in the settings under Keyboard C, they are rebindable, which I recommend taking advantage of, as it's easy to forget the controls after taking a 3-4 day break.

Yes, this includes Axiom Verge. ESA has textboxes to help move the story along as well (something I thought was a huge problem/annoyance in AV,) but I think the fact that the player character was a silent protagonist in ESA, just made the game better. At the very least, there wasn't any balls-dumb writing to the tune of:\n\n\"Uhm, HEY? Big scary creature thing that's obviously a hostile boss? I'm like, uhm, LOST? So like uhm, hey do you got a minute? Like, HEY? Whoa, how can my existence real if my hair don't real? Whoa,\" \n\n...that you had to slog through, like how Trace was in AV. Still, I think I'd still prefer the silent protagonist, even over a well-written character. That way you can inject your own small motivations into the chracter as you wrestle with the spooky isolation of wandering around a decades-long abandoned research station, which is actually pretty huge, as well as having two old derelict spaceships floating hearby that you can port to and explore, and even spend some small amount of ganeplay down on the planet the startion is orbiting.\n\nEnemy types and their behaviors are pretty standard for this type of game, as well as the types of powerups you find. (Double jump, hori/verti dashing, heat protection, triple shot, charge beam, grapple hook[EVERY game that pays homage to Metroid should have some kind of gapple hook!] sheildy bits that orbit you, life extenders, and a bunch of other things.) \n\nThe game is designed so that a good chunk of these things, while extremely helpful, are not necessarily required to reach the FIRST ending. This game has ridiculous amounts of replay value, and last I checked, there are no less than 6 endings you can reach, (I've only found 4 so far,) as well as quite few side quests and a couple secret bosses apart from the \"main game.\"\n\nBosses in this game (I think there over 19 or 20 of them, secret bosses included,) are pretty challenging, but are actually fun to fight once tyou figure them out, (Again, very unlike AV.) A good chunk of them have two or three phases to boot, so it's not just the same 1 to 3 patterns the whole time. A large part of the challange in ESA stems from how there are no health regenerators dropped by creatures and bosses, at all. The only way you can replenish your health is at a save point or health station, of which there are many located within the game world at fair intervals. This definitely means you can cheese your way through certain situations, but when it comes to bosses, it's kill with what you have going into the fight, or be killed. This might frustrate some people. (This is why it is important to explore and get some powerups that you might not \"need,\" but would certainly improve your survivability. Maybe.)\n\nThe music is spooky, grim, desolate, and higly menorable.

Another thing about this game, yes exploration is fun but on the map you can see just to many possible exit points to unexplored rooms that make you revisit the same closed off rooms again and again (booring). It would have been good if the game mark the exits on the map as closed off, until you get the possibility to open them, for example by showing the doors color. Exploration is fun, but running back and forth is not and its 2017 so I refuse to use pen and paper again to write my own map and mark the blue doors, the red doors, the yellow doors etc. that should really had been done in the game itself.

Even after I stopped playing a few month ago, it still haunts me a little.\n\nI don\u2019t need to tell anyone that ESA is a metroidvania. The few screenshot and video provided on the steam page show it without a doubt. Metroid is obviously it\u2019s stronger influence, or more specifically, the first Metroid on the NES and boy does it do a good job to reinvent Metroid 1. So much so it is almost a spiritual successor. From the cryptic level design and hidden power-up to the astounding atmosphere and sense of wonder, it is a strong and faithful respin on Metroid 1. And also Super Metroid in a way.\n\nTo represents what is ESA, I think my experience with the hookshot as a whole is a good comparison. Soon after I acquired it I realized it was made to be used in ways that seemed to be cheating so the player could get to places they weren\u2019t supposed to go. Just like the wall jump in Super Metroid, the hookshot gives a sense of freedom and encourage the player to explore. The wall jump in Super Metroid is not a necessity. In fact, you can beat the game without using it. But if you decide to master it, you can totally break the game. However, in ESA you are expected to break the game and think outside the box.

Despite ticking many of the right Metroidvania boxes, it was mostly the smaller nuances of the moment to moment gameplay that ended up turning me off.\n\nFirst of all there's the art design. I'm not personally a big fan of pixel art once it starts getting too low-fi, but ESA looks pretty good regardless. I think the visual style of the game nails the ultra-retro vibe quite well. The problem comes with how this ties into gameplay. ESA doesn't do a great job of clearly deliniating different elements of the game world from one another, partially because of the lack of detail, but partially because the art direction mixes many similar shades together to the point where things that should pop out just don't. Platforms you can stand on, foreground vs background elements, and even some enemies suffer from this problem. It isn't a gamebreaker, but I found myself running into enemies I thought were background elements and falling through blocks I assumed were solid more times than I consider acceptable in a game like this.\n\nThen there's the handling of progression and exploration. Most well designed Metroidvanias reward players who remember the locations of locked doors or inaccessible paths once they obtain the upgrade required to bypass them. Generally speaking, even if these pathways require multiple upgrades to navigate, you gate them off with the most difficult to obtain one first. That way the player is always rewarded for remembering the location and returning with the required powerup. ESA, by comparison, has several instances in which backtracking across the map mid way through the game only allows you to progress one or two screens further than last time, only to plant another progression blocker in front of you that requires something else to bypass. Certain elements of exploration and backtracking are punished in this regard rather than incentivised, with no way for the player to know that they should've waited to obtain more upgrades before coming back.\n\nThe controls and moment to moment gameplay in ESA are more or less good, but certainly not great. Double jumping, swinging, and shooting underwater after getting a certain upgrade can all feel pretty awkward and fiddly to execute at times. It certainly doesn't have the fluid, buttery smooth gameplay that you want out of a movement-heavy platformer, but it's not terrible either. I will commend the bosses for being very well designed around the game's control scheme, and overall I found them to be the most enjoyable part of the experience up to a point. The same can't necessarily be said for the regular enemies, however, with some of them being so bad as to simply charge at you and then stand inside your sprite until you shoot down at the floor to kill them. The adversaries with more fun movement and AI patterns are almost wholesale clones of Metroid enemies, and their stage placement sometimes feels haphazard as opposed to carefully considered.\n\nWhat ultimately made me decide to put the game down was the age-old problem that often kills my motivation to carry on with a title: the feeling that it was wasting my time.\nThere were a few minor instances of this earlier on when failing jumps required me to backtrack across a screen or two largely devoid of challenge to reattempt them, but upon getting to an (otherwise very fun and memorable) boss that required me to go through two phases before getting to the part that was giving me trouble -- the first of which required me to sit around waiting until the boss revealed its weak point -- I decided I'd put enough time into ESA. I adore a good challenge, but I have little patience for games that force me to sit, wait, and repeatedly progress through trivial challenges before being allowed to reattempt the fun part. It's a shame, because up until that point I'd been happy to press on with the game on the strength of the boss battles alone.\n\nOverall, I'd give ESA a mixed recommendation if I could. It captures the retro style it's going for very well despite the issues with visual clarity. The music is fitting, the art is neat, and as far as Metroid clones go this one does a similarly good job as Axiom Verge at evoking the same kind of amtosphere. The bosses -- time-wasting issues aside -- are incredibly good, with fun designs and interesting mechanics that challenge you to master their patterns and respond appropriately. Unfortunately it just has a lot of rough edges, lacking the tightness of a truly good Metroidvania both in terms of its controls and level design. I'll admit that I probably have higher standards than most when it comes to the genre, so take that into consideration when evaluating the helpfulness of this review, but compared to many of the Metroidvanias released within the last few years ESA just didn't hit the mark for me.

When you think you've reached the end of the game it just keeps going and going.\n\nEveryone who played Axiom Verge should give Environmental Station Alpha a go as well.

All the basic tenets that make a game experience great are there, but... It's a very quirky game. Poor controller support. Using the keyboard required some re-binding and was ultimately a little awkward, but my steam controller did not work well for this game. Every time I was in the middle of a complex set of movements I would get interrupted by a joystick-interfacing keyboard dialog box pop-up (best way I can describe it). Also the controller button binding options just aren't up to par. These negatives got in the way of enjoying the game to its fullest potential, which is sad because the game itself is quite enjoyable. I find myself 'unable to not recommend' this game, but I'll have to give it a lower score than I'd like to. 7/10 for poor controller/keyboard support and mildly annoying music (this also coming from someone who typically loves indie game music).", "timestamp_created": 1493480092, "timestamp_updated": 1494177867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31405054": {"recommendationid": "31405054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079950590", "num_games_owned": 583, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493436403}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy parecido a los metroid.

Metroidvania is my favorite genre, and after having played Ori and the Blind forest and Axiom Verge this month, my thirst for them still was not satiated.  Up next on my list was ESA, so I fired it up and had at it.\n\nAt first, I was really thrown off by the graphics. Text is really hard to read (W and H look almost identical) and nothing has much detail. As I went on though, I started forgiving the graphics. They're still not what I would call good though, but it's the style the developer wanted.\n\nCombat is a bit strange. Your gun shoots a tiny little beam that almost acts more like stabbing with a long sword, and there are a total of three gun upgrades, one of which is at the very end of the game, and another is very well hidden and you will likely miss it until, again, the end of the game. The other one sits at roughly the halfway point, so for the majority of the game, you feel very weak and never upgrade your combat prowress.\n\nWhere this game falls apart for me though is with the level design. Like any Metroidvania, you gain new skills that open up new pathways for you. Unlike good Metroidvanias though, ESA has some very flawed thinking. Usually, when you reach a dead end and a new powerup, the game tells you where to go next for the next upgrade. Being the explorer I am though, I like to make my own path. I just got the blue block destroying upgrade, and I remember some blue blocks on another path. I go that way, destroy the blue blocks, and on the other side is... red blocks. Great, I don't have the red block destroying upgrade yet. It works that way every time. You get a new upgrade, want to use it elsewhere, only to find out that going that way is entirely pointless and unrewarding. It makes the game feel much more linear than it should be.\n\nThe game does open up a lot at the very end, but that's another thing I don't like about this game. This game has a huge postgame. The first ending you get is very underwhelming. It actually has multiple stages. First you collect some extremely hard to find disks, then you get the second ending.\n\nThen you're supposed to find four even harder to find pillars to kill a new boss. Then you're suposed to fight off some new enemies and collect three orbs (they're easy to get, except one you're supposed to know that numbers mean map coordinates. I didn't know they existed until I looked). Then you're supposed to DECRYPT AN ALIEN CIPHER, FIND A HIDDEN AREA, SOLVE 14 RIDDLES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND TRAVERSE A CONFUSING MAZE. Once I got to this part, I said screw it. I was already using a guide at this point because of the disks, and I wondered why I was bothering. I'm pretty sure there's even more postgame after all of that, but I seriously couldn't care less.\n\nSo, to summarize, ugly art style, poor level design, poor progression of powerups, and a very pretentious postgame that essentialy requires a guide for anybody that's not into cryptic riddles or deciphering a made up language.\n\nI'm not saying the game is terrible though. These are just the things I hated about the game. I obviously liked the game enough to get this far, but there was too much disappointing in the game to recommend it to others.

While the textures themselves are somewhat mediocre, the details and extra little animations make up for it. \n[*] The sound design and soundtrack are amazing. The soundtrack immerses the player in the environment (no pun intended) and feels somewhat spooky while retaining a sense of exploration and mystery without being blatantly scary. \n[*] The gameplay is very consistent and fun to use. The powerups are executed well and are also very fun to use.\n[*] The bosses are all very unique and look amazing, and most of them are very fun as well. \n[*] The story is very intiguing and fun to play through/figure out.\n[*] There is lots of postgame. I'm pretty sure there's up to 200% completion...?\n[*] There are multiple endings. Maybe not a \"pro,\" per se, but it's very interesting and adds a layer of complexity and life to the game - which I like.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Neither PROS nor CONS:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Sometimes it's a little unclear where to go; however, this is a metroidvania, so just exploring when there isn't a better option is a given. Sometimes this is a little frusturating, but it's not that big of a deal most of the time.\n[*] The bosses seem to have a difficulty spike after maybe the second boss. After that, they are still very challenging, but don't get much harder (in comparison to the player; of course they get harder to match the new powerups you gain, health you get, etc.). They aren't ridiculously hard, but it is a little bewildering at first; and thankfully most of them are very fun, so it's made up for. \n[*] The story takes it's time to become clear. There's a sligihtly disproportional amount of gameplay/story at the beginning of the game, but it gets more and more fleshed out as you progress. It is a little confusing at first, and there are some elements that seem somewhat irrelevant and random earlier on in the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] A couple of bosses are a little bit hard to figure out. They aren't difficult once you know what to do, but it can be a bit annoying at first. \n[*] Sometimes charging up the weapon is a little buggy and/or takes longer as if it's lagging (I'm not entirely sure why this happens, but it always happens in certain rooms, seemingly for no reason).\n[*] Some major game aspects (namely the diskettes and mystery orbs) seem to have no explanation at all. I had to have a friend tell me what they were for and how to get them, and after I figured out how big of a role they played in the story I was a little frusturated and felt like I left a big chunk of the game incomplete.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun game for it's price. It is probably some of the best $8 I've ever spent, and I definitely feel that I've gotten my fun's worth and then some. If you're looking to get into metroidvanias, I recommend this as a good start. Even if you're not new to the genre, it's still a great game and is very fun without being overly easy or overly difficult.", "timestamp_created": 1489716037, "timestamp_updated": 1489716221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30546805": {"recommendationid": "30546805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143519060", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482994449}, "language": "english", "review": "Seems a bit rough around the edges in the early game, if your willing to withstand some frustration as you get your bearings within the game then go for it", "timestamp_created": 1489692659, "timestamp_updated": 1489692659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494090", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30478097": {"recommendationid": "30478097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072350374", "num_games_owned": 1504, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489551020}, "language": "english", "review": "Great small Metroidvania.

Along the way you will pick up some sweet items and upgrades, and will duke it out in some of the best boss fights I've ever seen. The space station is absolutely massive, and each room is intricately detailed and feels authentic, and each area is populated with its own enemies, puzzles, and unique objectives.\n\nThe visuals are \"minimally\" styled, but I find them to be exceptionally well done and think they add to the charm of the game.

My only complaint about the presentation overall is that it isn't in full widescreen.\n\nLike any \"Metroidvania\" game, progress is tied to exploration and item upgrades. You are given general objectives throughout the game, but sometimes knowing where to go next or how to get there is a bit obtuse.

However, I always felt that the Metroid franchise lost something along the way when jumping from 8-bit to the 16-bit era.\nSure, Super Metroid has better controls, better power-ups, better graphics, the list goes on. Its a much more polished  and mechanically satisfying game, and its one of the best player empowerment experiences out there. So much so that every single Super Metroid clone out there always tries to recreate that experience.\nBut it lost something. It lost the feeling of isolation and fear of being in an alien environment and the threat of getting lost and having to backtrack through rooms filled with dangerous species that could easily destroy you if you arent careful.\nBy now you must be shaking your head and saying that Super Metroid has that as well in spades. And yeah, I agree with that but that experience is really only felt in the first few hours of the game. Once you get into the groove of things in Super Metroid, small enemies cease to become a threat and you are just blasting through every level getting every power up that in turn makes you even more powerful. Bosses become easy targets, since your health gets so high you can tank them. The handheld Metroids are even more helpful to the player, showing them every single secret right away on the map, they just become a checkbox waiting to be checked. Its an easy game, is basically what im saying. There are no moments of real frustration and tension in Super Metroid. And I wouldnt have it any other way, part of what makes Super Metroid so great is that feeling of getting stronger with each room explored and how the final stretch of the game contrasts with the beginning of the journey.\nBut yet I still long for that feeling of constant danger and being lost in a hostile world.\n\nI can now safely say that Environmental Station Alpha finally filled that void.\nFrom the moment you step on the game's world you feel this sense of smallness and caution that few games manage to achieve. You are weak, your weapon is weak, the world is big and doesnt tell you were to go, and enemies surround and gain on you so fast you barely have room to breath. And it stays that way until the end no matter how many power ups you get.\nAnd its hard, its beautifully fucking hard. Bosses are incredibly complex and challenging, and some of them even trick you into thinking that you killed them only for them to go to a 2nd more harder phase. The platforming is tight, every jump matters, and getting lost as you try to find the next path is, in retrospection, some of the best frustrating moments I have ever had with a videogame.\nEvery power up matters and drastically changes the way you play from then on. Take the grappling hook for example:what was a gimmick in Super Metroid that can only be used on certain surfaces, in ESA the item can be used EVERYWHERE. The platforming gets even harder, demanding you to use your brain and figure out how to approach certain jumps in combination with the hook without any handholding or condescending tutorials, it becomes a tool in use for the rest of the game, and using it is so much fun, especially since you can use it to move faster through areas.\nThe charge shot is a godsend once you find it, and unlike in Super Metroid where it easily gets disposed of when you get stuff like the Ice Beam or Plasma Beam, it becomes an essencial part of your strategy against every enemy and boss.  \nCertain areas even change due to your actions, much to the players surprise, turning what were by now easy areas to traverse challenging all over again.\nFinding a Health Tank is always a motive for celebration in this game, they are so well hidden and reward players who explore every nook and cranny, and there are so many instances where the game trusts you to make certain judgement calls and leaps of faith because it knows you have the capacity to solve those issues.\n\nAs for the world design, what can I even say? I took a look at a map of the game once I finished it and I could remember almost every single area and corredor, and if thats not a mark of good level design, I dont know what is. There is even a crazy amount of sequence breaking for speedrunners, showing how much work the devs put into this game.\nThe aesthetic and artstyle is gorgeous, and the simple yet effective pixel art leaves room for your imagination to fill in the blanks. The tunes are moody and atmospheric as you would expect from a metroid clone, and the diverse biomes are so memorable and different from one another, one area in particular that left me in awe due to its beauty and soundtrack.\nThe controls are also great, it doesnt have the floatyness of Samus, jumping feels very natural and responsive.\n\nAnd there's secrets! Not the kind of secret that's spelled out on the map or that anyone can catch right away, but real secrets. Fez type of secrets. The kind that makes you solve riddles and puzzles to unlock post-game content that add much more value and story to the game. \n\nAs you can guess, im infatuated by this game, its everything I wanted from a Super Metroid successor and it saddens me that this doesnt get as much attention as games like Axiom Verge, which while being a good game feels very soulless and lacking that Metroid mystique.\n  \nAs for cons, they are mostly just nitpicks. While I appreciate the simple plot which serves as a vehicle for the gameplay, providing some context for your commitment to it, I wish it was a bit more interesting and less cliche, but then again this really isnt an issue, and the post-game does add more interesting lore to the game.\nMy other nitpick is that it doesnt have an escape sequence. I can understand not wanting to rip off Metroid, but the thing is, there is a moment where the station is being destroyed and you have to get to your ship as fast as possible, and the game simply shows a cutscene of you escaping. So why not put an actual escape sequence for the player?\nIt also might steal maybe a bit too much from Super Metroid, but it has such a unique presentation and style that it manages to differenciate itself just enough to not be considered a rip-off.\n\nAll in all, this might be the best Super Metroid clone I have ever played.

Parfait, cette \u00e9valuation va tr\u00e8s certainement vous int\u00e9resser.\n\nPartons imm\u00e9diatement du constat. Il y a tellement de similitudes entre [i]Environmental Station Alpha[/i] et Metroid qu'on pourrait crier au plagiat. Regardez les screenshots, c'est flagrant. Vous voyez ces longs corridors caverneux ? Horizontaux et verticaux, parsem\u00e9s de stalagtites, de structures m\u00e9talliques encastr\u00e9es... et de passages secrets ! Vous reconnaissez ? Il ne manque plus que les portes bulles... Vous voyez ce petit monstre h\u00e9risson en demi-lune ? Je vous laisse deviner son mode de d\u00e9placement : oui, il rampe le long des murs et des plafonds, et tourne en boucle sur les plateformes! Copie conforme de l'original sur NES ! Et ces chauve-souris qui vous guettaient, coll\u00e9es au plafond, elles sont aussi de la partie ! M\u00eame le h\u00e9ros rappelle samus avec sa combinaison orange... \n\nJe hais les plagiats. Je devrais d\u00e8s lors ha\u00efr ce jeu... et pourtant, ce n'est pas le cas, bien au contraire. En fait, je qualifierais ce jeu d'hommage \"tr\u00e8s pouss\u00e9\" \u00e0 Metroid. Mais pas de plagiat, non. Car ce jeu a malgr\u00e9 tout une identit\u00e9, une saveur propre. Je m'explique.\n\nTout d'abord, je pense que Metroid a su entrer dans l'histoire gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la conjonction de 2 \u00e9l\u00e9ments distincts. Je pense \u00e9videmment en premier lieu \u00e0 son gameplay typique, le fameux genre \"metroidvania\", p\u00e8re d'une ribambelle colossale de rejetons. La deuxi\u00e8me cl\u00e9 de son succ\u00e8s r\u00e9side, \u00e0 mon sens, dans l'atmosph\u00e8re extraordinaire qui s'en d\u00e9gage. L'ambiance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Metroid met mal \u00e0 l'aise : froide, hostile, oppressante, r\u00e9p\u00e9titive, claustrophobique. Plusieurs param\u00e8tres concourent \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat, mais le plus important - de loin je dirais m\u00eame - reste son incroyable bande sonore (elle a vraiment marqu\u00e9 mon esprit \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque). Aujourd'hui encore, 30 ans apr\u00e8s, aucun metroidvania n'est parvenu pas \u00e0 la cheville de l'original \u00e0 ce niveau... \nQu'en est-il donc d'[i]Environmental Station Alpha[/i] ? Contre toute attente, ce jeu a mis\u00e9 sur une ambiance bien plus relaxante dans les phases d'exploration. Ces phases b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de musiques douces, rendant le voyage tr\u00e8s serein. J'ai beaucoup appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 ce niveau, les musiques sont tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9ables et le contrepied me semble vraiment r\u00e9ussi. L'esprit oppressant de Metroid n'a toutefois pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9, loin de l\u00e0, comme nous allons le voir maintenant.\n\nLe deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui rend ce jeu original repose sur le niveau de difficult\u00e9 des bosses. C'est l\u00e0, ponctuellement donc, que le jeu vous mettra la pression et jouera avec vos nerfs !! Quel contraste avec la promenade qui nous y a conduit ! Attendez-vous \u00e0 maudire du pixel ! Les bosses sont nombreux et fonctionnent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 l'ancienne, alternant plusieurs phases d'attaques, de mouvements, puis de faiblesses. En bref, on esquive, on attend la faille et on attaque. Sauf que ces chiens sont vraiment coriaces et ne vous laissent aucun r\u00e9pit ! De plus, je ne r\u00e9velerai pas un grand secret en vous disant que certains ont plusieurs formes. Vous pensiez en avoir enfin termin\u00e9 avec ce maudit monstre ? AH AH ! Surprise ! Le revoil\u00e0, avec une barre de vie recharg\u00e9e, et encore plus v\u00e9ner ! Sadiques ! Je vous laisse imaginer ma stupeur lorsque j'ai d\u00e9couvert la troisi\u00e8me forme d'un certain boss apr\u00e8s 3 bons quarts d'heure de lutte... Le pire est que vous ne pourrez m\u00eame pas accuser la maniabilit\u00e9 ou la r\u00e9activit\u00e9 du jeu pour la simple et bonne raison qu'elles sont parfaites !! Si vous cherchez du challenge, vous serez combl\u00e9. Sinon, r\u00e9trogradez directement en mode easy au risque de vous d\u00e9courager (et encore, ne l'ayant pas essay\u00e9, je ne vous garantis rien ! ;)).\n\nPour conclure, je conseille ce jeu \u00e0 tout amateur de metroidvania pers\u00e9verant, et tout particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 ceux qui ont connu metroid premier du nom.

It has an atmosphere and 2D exploratory gameplay most similarly to Metroid, a fact that is pretty much undeniable. Compared to other \"metroidvanias,\" which take on an explicitly different theme or music style, Environmental Station Alpha wears its Metroid inspiration pretty openly on its sleeve. So Metroid fans who are big fans of the series' exploration and atmosphere would do well to check this game out.\n\nBeyond its inspiration, however, it's just a well put-together game in general. Upgrades, bosses, and environments all open up at a very comfortable and easily digestible pace. There's a sense of weight to the robot you control, giving it a different feel from the somersaulting action of Metroid (I'd say the main character feels more like the Cave Story protagonist). Attacking is done with a continuous short-range stream rather than individual shots like in Metroid, giving attacking a more deliberate and precise feel as well. \n\nThe map is huge, but not overwhelming, and teleport systems are all in the right places to facilitate fast travel without devaluing the exploration itself. Its biggest accomplishment, however, is the nigh-incredible use of landmarking and identity generously peppered across each and every single room in the game. ESA not only borrows from Metroid's atmosphere and gameplay, but also the distinctiveness of every one of any given entry's rooms. I can still picture the entire station in my head, how it all connects together, without needing to look at the map screen. No area in the game feels dull, and the way upgrades and switches change the landscape just beg further curiosity for the surroundings. In short, it's inspired by Metroid in the biggest way it counts--level design.\n\nI suppose the only negative thing I have to say about the game is that it takes a while before it really gets going, since for a while all you can do is shoot and jump, but it all starts to pick up once you acquire the grappling hook (it's called a hookshot in this game, haha). It immediately makes for a rather fun way to traverse the environment.\n\nIt's hard to put into words just how well thought out the game feels, but it's what I'm focusing on because its outward appearance suggests that of a cheap Metroid imitation, so I understand this makes it somewhat of a hard sell. Nonetheless, if you can look past its similarity and try it out for yourself, I think you'll end up being pleasantly surprised with a new Steam favorite.", "timestamp_created": 1484356890, "timestamp_updated": 1484356890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29196401": {"recommendationid": "29196401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018893476", "num_games_owned": 568, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490936259}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple, abstracted pixel-art style with an interesting story and mysterious, yet wonderful atmosphere & soundtrack.\n\nPlenty of hidden secrets and difficult-to-get-to places to keep things engaging for those old schoolers - those who enjoy exploring & discovering what otherwise might be overlooked details - thoes who would gladly take on any challenge.\n\nUpgrades and progression keep the pace up and the player engaged - though not knowing where to go sometimes might be a bit of hassle, the exploration of the built atmosphere with different 'biomes' adds to the feeling of adventure.

Lots of very fun platforming puzzles that are very rewarding, and fun to find.\n\nThe battles are well designed, focusing on learning patterns to defeat an enemy, rather than fussing aroud with which weapon would or wouldn't be optimal (since there is only 1 weapon)\n\nAmazing secrets, from simple secret entrances for a basic powerup like a health container, all the way to the suprisingly massive (and well hidden) post-game content.\n\nGreat difficulty curve. I feel this game sets the standard for difficutly curves in metroidvania games. You'll be trying to beat each boss multiple times (for me, it was around 3-5 tries per boss), as you learn their patterns, and the exploration is just dangerous enough to keep you on edge, but not too difficult to be constantly dying while exploring.\nGoing off of difficulty curve, there's no ammo or health, or any pickups besides powerups/collectibles. This means you don't worry about ammo for a weapon, and you heal at save points (and some other designated spots). This is great because it means you are never farming enemies for health/ammo/etc.\n\nAmazing post-game. You defeat the final boss, and have most (if not all) of the map unlocked, but as you continue to play, you don't even realize that there is a very large, challenging, and well planned post game which is very satisfying for those completionists out there.\n\nReally this is everything I could've asked for in a metroidvania.\n\nIf you're a fan of the metroidvania genre, you will NOT be dissapointed here!", "timestamp_created": 1483432702, "timestamp_updated": 1483432702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28903758": {"recommendationid": "28903758", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972595109", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483239793}, "language": "english", "review": "Environmental Station Alpha - 7/10\n\nFirst half of the game - 9/10\nSecond half - 4/10 (maximum frustration)\n\nThe dev made a fantastic Metroidvania game, then couldn't resist adding more \"content\" after the game was done.

The exploration aspect of this game has people talking. ESA features so many secret rooms, reading story bits, boosts and easter eggs, both included in story mode and optional, that it takes a precise map and sincere effort to find them all. \n\nTo master this game means to master mechanics such as jump, dash, hook, charge & spam shot. The controls are what you expect them to be, no awkward combinations or button layouts. Alternatively, I've never got comfortable with dash mechanic in Hyper Light Drifter, a similar in a sense game, where you have to direct gamepad's trigger with inhumane speed. Thus I couldn't have found a number of unlocks and secrets, hidden behind trials which required continious dashing through spikes or disappearing tiles. In ESA there's an instadeath spike maze and dash sections, but oppositely I was in control of them.\n\nWhile this game is undoubtedly hard, you can count ridicilous rooms on one hand. ESA'a gritty flavor is where you fall in love with it. It tries hard to seem harder than it actually is. It loves showing you the pick ups through the walls in a yet unaccessible room. Then It taunts you with empty rewards room while you are at 1 HP, saying, \"The upgrade - it's missing, move along\". But the upgrade is there close by, hidden.

If you like Metroid clones, you should give this a try, period, though there are flaws.\n\nEssentially it's what you'd expect from this sub-genre of game; a 2d platforming interface with a large map to explore and upgradesd throughout.  I use Metroid clone rather than Metroidvania to describe it since it lacks any of the RPG elements usually associated with the -vania affix; this is pure, oldschool Metroid style, not unlike Axiom Verge or AM2R.  Of course, it's a bit less 'pretty' than those games, opting for an ultra-simplistic 8bit style with 8x8 tiles (rather than the 16x16 you'd usually see in this style of game), yet it still manages to get the job done with surprising flair and quality in this approach.  As well, the soundtrack's quite nice and aesthetically the game pulls off a great eerie, lonely atmosphere.  It basically pulls off something similar to Super Metroid's tone using only tools a bit closer to Metroid 1's, which is impressive in and of itself.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's for the most part about as simple as this kind of game gets; you run, jump, and shoot, with upgrades that increase your ability to do most these things in various, simple ways.  Once or twice you'll encounter a somewhat unique upgrade such as the grappling hook which comes with a surprisingly deep physics system that allows skilled and clever players to sequence break with it alone, but most everything else is almost disappointingly bland given how crazy powerups in this genre have gotten (again Axiom Verge is a good example).  What's more, and this is the game's deepest fault IMHO, the feeling of increasing in power as you traverse the game -- perhaps the single most addicting element of this genre -- is stifled in myriad ways.  Not only are the powerups themselves generally small and rarely make you feel a full order of magnitude more powerful in and of themselves, but the game does all kinds of things to keep you feeling modest.  Most notably, as you go through the game and power yourself up, the station \"comes alive\" more and more and traversing the gameworld actually becomes [B]MORE[/b] difficult, even if you can techinically reach new places... though occasionally you'll even be locked completely out of previous zones until later still!  And even at the very end, when you're fully geared and the whole map should be your oyster, it's kind of a nightmare to get from place to place, even with the teleport system you unlock.  And on top of all that, the endgame is absolutely full of challenges that limit your powerups or force you to turn them off or punish you for using certain ones... it truly makes you feel almost bad for powering up at several points, and that's not a great thing.\n\nAnd speaking of endgame... yeah... well.  It's hard enough as it is, definitely a challenging game to begin with and most the bosses will give you a run for your money until you've memorized them quite well, ESPECIALLY toward the end... but oh, no no no, even beating the difficult final boss isn't really the end, of course.  At this point you're meant to solve some intensely crazy, ARG-level puzzles throughuot the game, complete all kinds of wild challenges (several of which force you to turn off your meager powerups or punish you for using them, as stated) and complete \"hell areas\" to get the \"real\" ending, and... honestly?  This is where I gave up.  I love to do everything in these types of games, and surpass all the challenges, but ESA... between the difficulty of traversing the map, the mostly-weak powerups and the meek feeling brought about by their limitations, the fact I even got lost as to what to do next with use of guides at this point, and the brutal difficulty and myriad things to do... this endgame was just too much.  Of course, some of you may be salivating at the sound of that challenge, so it's not necessarily a bad thing, but just beware.\n\nEven with all those criticisms, I'd still recommend this game if you're a fan of the genre.  It was truly an out-of-nowhere surprise and if you're very patient and curious you may get a hugely rewarding experience -- and even if you're like me and quit after the 'bad' ending, it'll still be worth the time and money.", "timestamp_created": 1479065816, "timestamp_updated": 1479065816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26546288": {"recommendationid": "26546288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319742755", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488424997}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like a metroidvania style game, play it. plenty of bosses too.", "timestamp_created": 1478903700, "timestamp_updated": 1478903700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26483691": {"recommendationid": "26483691", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995200366", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478526041}, "language": "english", "review": "I have mixed feelings about this game.

The graphics are simple, yet beautiful.  There are a plethora of secrets to discover.  It's a satisfying and immersive exploration-based experience.  I really love this game!  Highly recommended!\n\nOn the other hand, it can be incredibly frustrating.  \n\nSome of the bosses, even after I figured out their patterns, were butt-kickingly tough.  I had to restart the game in easy mode, just to have a chance.  Only gamers with elite platforming skills should try the normal difficulty.\n\nPrecision platforming using the swinging \"hookshot\" mechanic is required to progress.  The hookshot is lots of fun, but it's difficult to master, so there were many repeated attempts before I got lucky and landed where I needed to land.  It was especially frustrating when I had to link several precise swings while being shot at by turrets, as any damage will disrupt your arc.\n\nBacktracking: Most power-ups allow you to access new areas all over the map.  So, when you get the ability to destroy the red blocks, you have to try to remember all the places you encountered red blocks, and seek them out.

I can't understand why this little gem with a huge Metroid-like world is such a sleeper? Why hasn't this indie title spread to consoles and gained more notoriety? The game has it all. It has the retro feel with uncomfortably pixelated graphics (at first; then, somehow, your mind gets accustomed to it - and actually likes it!), tight as hell controls (rivaling Super Meat Boy), exploration, exploration, exploration, tons of tough as nails bosses (I do have complaints about a couple, but, overall, well done) and just grade A platforming.\n\nHere are my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Tons of bosses\n- Tons of hard bosses (this also has a con)\n- Profound feeling of satisfaction once a difficult part is completed\n- Cool upgrades that, like Metroid-style games do, allow you to explore more areas and get more cool upgrades\n- Wicked story with an other-worldly feel, a la Super Metroid\n- I haven't played any portions post-campaign, but I hear there's a ton of extra content and an additional difficulty setting that promotes replayability\n\nCons:\n- Boss fights can be a bit unfair by design. The controls are tight, yes, but the perspective can blind you from attack. One boss, in particular, took more than a few of my tries. The room was enormous, and the boss itself had 3 iterations that forced you to use almost the entire room. If the dev blew up the perspective so that almost the whole screen could be seen, it would be more strategically effective as well as more visually imposing. Don't get me wrong, I loved it!\n- That's it.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is a classic Metroid-style game with a twist - you'll see it. It's much tougher than Metroid ever could be, so it's not for the faint of heart. But, when you beat that grueling boss or get that seemingly impossible upgrade (you know which one it is if you've played the game and reached the end), it's so unbelievably satisfying. For $10, you really can't beat it. From what I've seen in some YouTube post-game walkthroughs, there's a ton of additional content with some cool unlockables and puzzles. There's also a secret that you can find in the game that shows you how to unlock a super hard mode - that is, if you're a masochist! Anyway, much respect to the dev - so much content and so well-integrated. Please make another game like this! And, for those of you still reading this, what are you waiting for?

After playing the entire story mode and a good chunk of the postgame. This is the best Metroidvania I have ever played. I played Axiom Verge and it was fantastic but it cannot compare to this game. Great story that ties in and actually pulls you into the postgame and super nice controls make this game really good to begin with but the bosses seal the deal. In normal Metroidvanias the bosses aren't that hard. In this game though,you could be stuck on one fight for a few days or even a week. With that though comes a great feeling of triumph and pride when you finally put one down. Also, the music. The music really sets a tone for each place you come across. And all teh tracks sound awesome. There is really only one problem I have with this game and thats the difficulty. This is a  game for someone who knows their way around a sidescroller. Parts of it can be downright brutal and completely unforgiving. No health pickups emphasizes that fact so if you think your gonna beat this game in a day or even a few days your wrong.

Yes, it's a challenge, and though I haven't tried it myself there is an easy mode. It hardly needs it though, because though it is difficult it is never unfair. Every obstacle is learnable, every boss can be beaten without taking a hit, and each time you try again you make progress. This contrasts metroid, where you can power-through bosses if you've found enough health upgrades, that option doesn't exist here, you have to adapt. I love this in a game, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.\n\nLevel design is fantastic, I was never lost but always felt like I was exploring on my own. Powerups are all novel and feel great, always changing up the gameplay subtly to keep it interesting. Gameplay is sharp and accurate, perfectly designed for the platforming and enemies.\n\nWith all love I give the game, I do offer some criticism though. At the beginning of the game, the aethetics sometimes interfere with the mechanics, I didn't know what I had to kill, or what to stand on at times, by the end of the game this is a non-issue though. The post-game content is... confused. The post-game feels vastly different from the main game, not an extension of it as it should be, and it isn't nearly as polished, though it IS deep (post-game took up 16 hours of my 24 hour play time, for the lazy that means it took me 8 hours to get to the end). I'd only reccomend flying blind to the dedicated players, but don't feel ashamed of following a guide, the extra bosses are absolutely worth it. It's also a bit weird that there are a ton of secrets in this game, but very few are truly discoverable until the post game. I was begining to think there were no secrets at all, and then I found a bunch all at once. Shoutouts to the bike.\n\nTL;DR: If you like pattern-based or precision side-scrollers, this game is a diamond in the rough.

It is not, however, much of a metroidvania so far. Shortly within my first play session I had noticed a rather strong linearity to the game, and further in I'd found that it seems to actively prevent and discourage exploration by denying any sequence breaks. Often times I'd reach an area (whether through intended means or not) only to immediately find that just past the obstacle was some new one that I yet lacked the upgrade to bypass, rendering most of my backtracking worthless.\n\nSecondly, enemies do not drop anything. While this does have benefits, it also takes away any incentive for combat in the game. Oftentimes you'll be able to encounter rather strong regular enemies in somewhat out of the way locations, but these almost miniboss like encounters provide no benefit. It is a simple and easy matter to completely bypass them.\n\nThird, at a certain point in the game I was tasked with flipping a switch in one part of a level to reach a boss. Upon flipping the switch, the layout of the entire region was changed with new platforms that often blocked off your old paths. However, the relationship between that button and the new platforms appearing doesn't make any sense from a logical perspective, and they block off areas I could access before, but have yet to find a different route too.\n\nIn closing, ESA will be plenty of fun if you want a good platformer and don't mind exploring a bit. Don't go into it expecting a metroidvania though. The game's constant barricading, infrequent optional upgrades, and outright denial of sequence breaking prevent that.\n", "timestamp_created": 1472431002, "timestamp_updated": 1472431002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508593", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25104854": {"recommendationid": "25104854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080873439", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515212995}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u044b\u0436\u043e\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u0432\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c- \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1472007492, "timestamp_updated": 1472007492, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25066629": {"recommendationid": "25066629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170927818", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509164302}, "language": "english", "review": "its literally metroid fusion, without the rolling into a ball.", "timestamp_created": 1471840709, "timestamp_updated": 1471840709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466200", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25032093": {"recommendationid": "25032093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258036637", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502994742}, "language": "english", "review": "Only played through a small part of it and this game is already a blast.

I thought it was an alright game and very impressive for a one man job, but it didn't hit me in the same spot as everybody else. I always felt it couldn't really decide if it wanted to be gameplay or story driven and in the end neither portion of the game felt like the \"complete\" experience. I guess, it just wasn't my cup of tea but if you love it, I'm happy for you.\n\nWith that in mind, I was absolutely blown away by the beauty of Environmental Station Alpha. I'll go as far as to say, I felt like this is the best Metroidvania that isn't a Metroid I've ever played yet. (And yes, I've played Axiom Verge.) Simple in design, strong in execution. Little to no unnecessary dialoge or other gameplay interrupting cutscenes. The focus stays on exploration and progress and that's what I enjoyed oh so very much about ESA.\n\nThe game is not perfect (nothing is) of course. The difficulty is always somewhere between challenging and too damn hard; I had to repeat a few boss fights quite often and the only thing that kept me from rage quitting was the very awesome boss music. Unfortunately, I felt that the very last boss of the game was just artificially unnecessary hard and the ending I got after that fight was everything else but satisfying. It hurt me a little that a game that started so amazing ended so disappointing, BUT I haven't yet found all the extras, so there might be a special ending somewhere.\n\nWhile sound design is not outstanding and the music does nothing interesting, I fell in love with the soundtrack immediately. The feel of uneasy calmness is perfectly captured in the lo fi psychedelic tracks and accompanies your travels through the deserted space station. If you want to play a simple Metroidvania that doesn't give you too much handholding and keeps the atmosphere mostly in the level design instead of the story, you will like Environmental Station Alpha!\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1466529411, "timestamp_updated": 1466529411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23669870": {"recommendationid": "23669870", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972631323", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466542111}, "language": "english", "review": "Among the top ten best metroidvania games i've ever played.

The way Environmental Station Alpha does it isn't through a notable gimmick but rather through craft. It is a quality and cohesive title that, barring difficulty issues, could be a real treat for you.\n\nIt's the classic story of an abandoned research facility and an agent sent in to investigate where it all went wrong. The player takes control of a robot that will explore ES Alpha and discover the truth behind its downfall. Along the way the player will explore, fight, and powerup in traditional Metroidvania fashion. \n\nThe powerups are cool and have that great mix of unlocking new areas in Alpha while assisting in moment-to-moment combat/traversal. You will explore many diverse regions of the Station that are memorable as they are fun to traverse. The game provides many interesting scenarios including the player speeding through a region while their health is slowly drained by the intense heat. These are interesting biomes that are fun to traverse the first couple times. That brings me to one of the game's few flaws. \n\nTo get around, even with teleportation, you'll have to go over lots of ground that you likely have already trekked through because even with all the powers you obtain, the paths through ES Alpha are labyrinthian and don't open up as \u201cwide\u201d as they should. One must take the long way around to get anywhere, even late in the game. It can be grueling or tedious and it's only exacerbated by the game's difficulty.\n\nNow I won't tell you if the game's difficulty is bad or not, but it's a hard game that can be unforgiving at times. For example, not only are a couple bosses very difficult and long, the game utilizes a very draconian save system. There is no autosaving, there are no checkpoints. The player must go to save rooms to record their game. If the player beats a boss and then dies without saving, the player will have to load in to their last save and do the boss over again and if there's a long gauntlet on the way to the boss, the player will have to do that too.\n\nBringing it back to the positive, ESA employs a pixel art graphic style that is one of the most considered pixel artstyles in modern indie games. The music is similarly great with lots of memorable ambient sounds that have real emotion and story behind them. The game's simplistic presentation goes very far.\n\nESA also has a very involved post-game (or extended ending, if you will). It highlights what's already interesting about the plot and expands on it. Warning though, conquering the post-game involves a cipher puzzle so if that bugs you, you might want to employ a help guide. The secrets of ES Alpha truly feel forbidden enhancing the otherworldly, alien tone of the game.\n\nIf you want a Metroidvania that relishes in its quiet, lonely tone and can tolerate some occasionally vicious difficulty, you'd be doing yourself a favour by checking out Environmental Station Alpha. It's engaging, it's interesting, and it's a real gem in the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1465440275, "timestamp_updated": 1465440275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23337493": {"recommendationid": "23337493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137988952", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456374108}, "language": "english", "review": "ESa is structured a lot like the original Metroid and definitely pays homage to it. The game is very much focused around exploring a huge map with varied environments to find new power-ups that help you explore further. This is coupled with finding random HP upgrades that are often hiding behind breakable walls and discovering the lore of the area you are exploring.\n\nOverall the game plays well. The controls are far more responsive than the game it pays homage too, which assists greatly in the epic boss fights and some incredibly difficult platforming segments. ESa makes very good use of allowing the player to traverse the environment using it's various power-ups even before the correct power-up for a certain segment is found. There were numerous times where determination and precision got me to an area I would have normally required a power-up I didn't have to get to.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, they are balls hard. You can't take very many hits, so most boss fights require the player to know all of the boss' attack patterns and how to deal with them. This is both a strength and weakness of the game. On one hand the bosses being so difficult made defeating them feel really satisfying. On the other, losing repeatedly to the same boss in it's last phase is frustrating as hell. This frustration also partly comes from having to reload from the last save point, which is only near a boss about half the time. The other half of the time you have some walking to do.\n\nThe only other gripe I had with the game was a brief segment in the middle where the game gave me no direction on where to go next. I still hadn't discovered enough power-ups to really explore the station fully on my own and I spent about 5 hours trying to figure out where the way forward was. This really messed with the pacing of the game.\n\nOverall I quite liked the game.

Wir wissen gar nichts und m\u00fcssen uns ins ungewisse St\u00fcrzen.\n\n[h1][b]Grafik[/b][/h1]\nSehr einfach gehalten in einer sch\u00f6nen 2D -Pixel Welt. Die Gebiete und auch die Gegner sind sehr sch\u00f6n designt. Man f\u00fchlt sich damit auch gleich etwas zur\u00fcck versetzt in die Zeiten zu NES bzw. Gameboy.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\nAnfang k\u00f6nnen wir nicht viel und m\u00fcssen durch die  Gegend springen und Monster mit unserem Strahl t\u00f6ten.\nMit der Zeit erhalten wir aber mehr F\u00e4higkeiten die wir auch ausschalten k\u00f6nnen. Diese F\u00e4higkeiten sind notwendig um in bestimmte Gebiete zu kommen. Die Steurung mit dem Gamepad muss man hier  vorab  einstellen, bevor diese Aktiv ist und das empfehle  ich hier auch. Auch wenn die Beschreibung der F\u00e4higkeiten im Spiel  schlecht \u00fcbersetzt sind kommt man schnell dahinter. Auch die Bosse bieten sch\u00f6ne Abwechslung. Das ganze Spiel errinnert einen Stark an die Metroid Reihe.\n\n[h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1]\nDie Musik passt sich auch hier jeder Umgebung an und auch bei Bossmonstern \u00e4ndert sie  sich. Das Gef\u00fchl einer verlassenen Station wird durch die Musik gut vermittelt und man kriegt mehr Lust darauf die Station zu  erforschen.\n\n[h1][b]Wiederspielwert[/b][/h1]\nErfolge gibt es hier leider nicht, jedoch kommt  man schnell in Fahrt um die Gesamte Karte zu erforschen. Was oft nicht einfach ist. Da man Geheimnisse entdecken muss oder erst bestimmte Gegenst\u00e4nde brauch.  Wird man das Spiel dann einmal komplett durchhaben wird man es nicht unbedingt noch einmal spielen wollen. Finde ich hier aber auch nicht notwendig.\n\n[h1][b]Herausforderung[/b][/h1]\nDie Bossmechaniken sind am Anfang recht einfach werden jedoch mit dem sp\u00e4teren Verlauf immer Anspruchsvoller. Auch die Gebiete und die Monster haben es sp\u00e4ter in sich. Auch kriegt man nur den Hinweis wo man hin muss mit einem  einzigen Punkt. Wie man da hin kommt muss man dann selber herausfinden was nicht immer einfach ist.\n\n[h1][b]Fazit[/b][/h1]\nIch w\u00fcrde dieses Spiel als gelungenen Metroid Klon bezeichnen mit einer etwas anderen Geschichte.\nF\u00fcr den Preis kann man hier auch nichts sagen und kann  an  der Stelle dieses Spiel nur empfehlen.", "timestamp_created": 1462310865, "timestamp_updated": 1462310865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22720275": {"recommendationid": "22720275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035355955", "num_games_owned": 3688, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462012417}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing music and environments.

Go find out why.\"\n\nThat's about all you need, and all you get, to start exploring Environmental Station Alpha. Despite its simplistic appearance, there is a lot of atmosphere and mystery surrounding the space station. As you explore, you find upgrades that let you explore more, and you eventually discover what went wrong. So now you know what you need to do to save the day.\n\nBut ESA doesn't just ask you to find out \"what\" went wrong. It also poses the questions \"Why?\" and \"How?\", and therein lies the trap.\n\nMy first run through the game clocked in at 5 hours. Literally, exactly 5 hours. 5:00:00, on the dot. Navigating certain areas, and figuring out where to go, is generally obvious enough thanks to mission objectives being marked on the map but there are moments in the game where you're just left wondering where you're supposed to apply the new upgrade you just got. There could be 20 unexplored rooms, but only 1 of them is where you need to go next. Repeat this for each upgrade and it quickly becomes tiresome. Bring a notepad; ESA doesn't have any sort of \"Map markup\" feature that lets you leave notes on your map, but it does explicitly state which tile on the map grid you're on at any given time, and maybe just writing down \"red blocks at 18-12\" would be enough.\n\nThat isn't my biggest gripe with the game, though. As I said, I got through the main story in 5 hours, which I'm assuming isn't too bad for a first-time without the use of any guides. However, the ending leaves you feeling unsatisfied, as if there was another approach you could have taken for a more satisfying resolution.\n\nWell, there is. This game is absolutely loaded with secrets. I don't mean cute hidden upgrades (though there's a couple of those), I mean new areas, new bosses, new endings, the whole shebang. And it is absolutely esoteric. Is it worth it? Honestly, I want to say no. The post-game content is great (exploring the new areas, fighting the new bosses) but it's so bogged down with pointlessly esoteric nonsense and repetitive filler tasks that the effort involved to get there is far greater than the payoff. The two fights with You-Know-Who were a blast, but it took me close to 8 hours of faffing about in order to unlock what I understand is the True Actual Final Boss.\n\nI like that the game offers a rather deep rabbit hole to go down if you're willing, but because of all the dead-ends, invisible walls, and one-way doors, it's too much of a chore to fully complete. As much fun as I had fighting the post-game bosses, I can't say that all of the filler content in between them was worth the time and effort. The base game, however, remains a solid experience, and I can recommend the game on that point alone.", "timestamp_created": 1460762632, "timestamp_updated": 1460762632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22183036": {"recommendationid": "22183036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041694226", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467844167}, "language": "english", "review": "Environmental Station Alpha (ESA) is a challenging Metroid-like that focuses on exploration and interesting platforming mechanics. You play as a robot who has just discovered an abandoned station somewhere in outer space. You'll explore to unravel the mystery of the dissapearance of the station's crew, and the strange things going on in the local computer system. \n\nPros:\n- excellent movement & controls\n- unique upgrades add to interesting platforming\n- great soundtrack; atmospheric and fits the retro theme\n- optional upgrades & rewards for further exploration\n- Checkpoints/warps/shortcuts to areas keep the game interesting up until the final stages of the game so things don't get too repetitive.\n- The most hardcore challenges of the game are often optional, however, a completionist is going to have intense difficulties to overcome in the end-game. \n\nCons:\n- Some bosses are annoying if they're too challenging. The jog back to the bossroom is often short, but any time I have to face a boss more than 10 times just to get lucky can get old (I know, I know, git gud... ;)\n- No Steam achievements \n- *edit: i had a complaint about the ending, but continued playing and realized I hadn't actually finished the game :P \n\nSimilar to other classic action/puzzle games, in ESA the player finds upgrades and power-ups throughout the world (Charge Shot, Dash, Energy Upgrade, etc.) and uses these new tools to gain access to new areas. Don't think this is just a clone, however, because ESA adds a number of unique upgrades that become integral to your movement and survival throughout the game. \n\nDevelopments in the storyline will tell the player their next objective on the map, but ambitious players will be rewarded (sometimes with with killer, optional upgrades) for further exploration into the many different routes and rooms hidden throughout the world. The developer also did a great job with keeping things interesting while backtracking through previously explored areas - new enemies and traps emerge to prevent you from taking the easy path back to an objective.\n\nI don't want to spoil too much in this review, but suffice to say that when I beat the game I did not get the best ending possible. It looks like there is still A LOT for me to explore in this very involved and complicated map. It's clear to me now that the developer just might be a sadist and has likely lured many a gamer into obsession with this completionist nightmare. And yet we must be stalwart and overcome the challenges presented us.\n\nFor a game that borrows so heavily from one of the greatest and most influential series in gaming history, ESA is a shining example of a great idea made better with creative innovation.", "timestamp_created": 1459536633, "timestamp_updated": 1459562125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500710", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22180567": {"recommendationid": "22180567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053686830", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465963507}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the top-tier metroid games.", "timestamp_created": 1459527340, "timestamp_updated": 1459527340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22120893": {"recommendationid": "22120893", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984466786", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459096312}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best metroidvanias, but rarely ever mentioned.\nIt's got everything: Good exploration, boss fights, platforming, puzzles, power-ups, secrets and it does all of these perfectly.\nIt's a long game if you plan to do everything by yourself, and you should.", "timestamp_created": 1459245284, "timestamp_updated": 1459245284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22053534": {"recommendationid": "22053534", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971408012", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501286233}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have any affinity for Metroidvanias, I urge you to pick up this game.

Il faut savoir dans quoi vous metttez les pieds : pour moi, ce jeu est un des meilleurs de son genre (metroidvania). Vous y trouverez de l'exploration dans un monde bien construit, cachant de nombreux et tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant secrets. Vous y trouverez aussi des combats, et notamment des boss relativement durs mais avec des patterns tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressants, parmi les meilleurs que j'ai vus.\n\nCes aspects en font un bon, voire excellent, metroidvania. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 ce jeu se distingue nettement, et de fa\u00e7on merveilleuse, des autres jeux du genre, c'est dans ce que l'on appelle le postgame. Le jeu est loin, tr\u00e8s loin, de se terminer au boss de fin. Il y a plusieurs fins, de nombreux secrets que l'on ne peut d\u00e9couvrir qu'apr\u00e8s la fin, etc.\nSurtout, le postgame change radicalement la fa\u00e7on d'aborder le jeu. Ce dernier devient un jeu d'\u00e9nigmes. Au lieu d'explorer \u00e0 l'aveugle en fonction des power-ups acquis, vous \u00eates orient\u00e9s par des messages ou des personnages. Vous passez donc de Super Metroid (en quelque sorte) \u00e0 La-Mulana (en moins cryptique).\n\nEn gros, si vous aimez les Metroid-likes et, encore plus, si vous aimez La-Mulana, foncez, vous ne le regretterez pas. (Et si vous n'avez pas fait La-Mulana, faites-le, c'est un classique relativement m\u00e9connu). Vous avez deux jeux en un : un Metroid et un jeu d'\u00e9nigmes.\n\nUn mot sur la difficult\u00e9. On pr\u00e9tend que ce jeu est difficile. Il y a m\u00eame une critique de RockPaperShotgun o\u00f9 le journaliste explique avoir rencontr\u00e9 un mur de difficult\u00e9 infranchissable. Or, c'est (relativement) faux. Le jeu est parfois ardu, mais il n'est jamais injuste. Par ailleurs, les boss, qui concentrent la majeure partie des critiques, sont incroyablement simples d\u00e8s lors que l'on se rend compte qu'ils disposent de patterns faciles \u00e0 anticiper. En bref, le jeu est exigeant sans \u00eatre injuste.

First thing's first, if you're a fan of unfair games, this is the sort of game you might want to pick up. That's not to say it's unbeatable, just have fun re-loading because you took one hit in the gauntlet before the boss chamber. \n\nPros: Graphics, sound, and gameplay are all good. The graphics are low-bit, but done in a style that works. Music is just phenomenal. The gameplay is pretty fluid and easy to get the hang of. The atmosphere is done absolutely wonderfully.\n\nCons: There really aren't any outside of my personal gripes, to follow. It runs smoothly and if the extreme unfairness is your cup of tea, then all the power to you.\n\nGripes: The game is unfair and difficult. The hard spots are hard enough, but you find yourself taking a lot of cheap shots in a lot of places. Unfortunately, taking a hit or two on the way to a boss means you either have to have the boss down pat and not be off by a microsecond with any of your moves, or just re-load. Health is far too scarce for it's own good, and when you do happen across an upgrade, it's usually completely inacessable until much later in the game. There are exceptions of course, though the game pretty much just taunts you with health that you desperately need, especially on later bosses. There are no health pickups whatsoever, and what little they did to assuage that quickly becomes inadequate. You need to just get used to the controls and avoid taking hits rather than actually staying and fighting. Especially when everything you encounter starts to hit you for more than one point of damage, because even at max, normal mode's HP cap is 30. You wind up being incredibly flimsy. Oddly, I found the difficulty varies rather harshly from one boss to the next, one boss will beat you over and over and the next one you'll beat on your first or second try. \n\nAt the end of the day, I have to say that these games are the most fun when your effort is actually rewarded, and your efforts are usually rewarded with obstacles you can't pass.... yet. Kinda takes the wind out of exploration. I found myself tentative about even exploring, since if it wasn't the right way to go, there would be no payoff. And that's just no fun.

It's fun to play from start to finish, satisfying to find things, and mostly just the right level of difficulty. Only at one point (a boss with WAY too many \"gotcha\" extra forms) did I seriously consider a ragequit. My main complaints here are that several hidden things (including some exceedingly useful upgrades) are hidden in a completely unclued manner, or put in places that communicate to the player \"come back later\" rather than \"keep trying\", and that the ending you get for finding what the game considers 100% is thoroughly unsatisfying and predictable.\n\nThe second game is for people who thought Fez wasn't cryptic enough, and also needed some combat and cheap insta-death precision platforming. It basically just feels like a long drag of purposeless padding, along with a section that asks the player to go through a ridiculously, unnecessarily cheap section two or three different times. Basically you have to do a bunch of random-seeming running around through sections of the game you've been to already, followed by going to a cryptic secret section, followed by a dumb maze, followed by more running around including said cheap section again and the maze again and possibly twice, and when you're all done running around you have to start mostly over again in a new game+ and beat the whole thing all over again, and just...ugh.\n\nWorse still, most of the instructions on what the game wants you to do in this part are locked behind a weird alien language that I honestly have no idea how anyone ever translated, as the only way I was able to know what any of it was saying was by reading a walkthrough. I mean, even Fez had a \"Quick brown fox\" room. And no, I don't think that discovering any of this latter part of the game myself would have been any more fun, because it probably never would have happened. There's a decent boss fight or two buried in this section, but it's mostly just not worth it. As of this writing I've basically lost my enthusiasm for playing the game thanks to this part, especially since the only endings that aren't the two that suck from the aforementioned first game require completing pretty much the entirety of this part.\n\nSo..I have to recommend this game entirely on the gameplay of the first part.

I'd give it  7/10. I was much more excited about it from watching the trailers than I have been playing the game. I've progressed quite a ways(about 3/4ths of the way through) and here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nInteresting enemy types\nVery challenging \nThe boss fights are really hard and fun\nThe environments look good\n\nCons:\nThere are quite a few problems.\nThe bosses rearely give you a sense of achievement. Yeah, you won, but some of them give you nothing for beating them which can be pretty diasppointing after a hard fought battle( where you die 20 times).\n\nThe powerups are pretty lame. I feel so underpowered in battle it's sad. I mean just think about playing super metroid with nothing but the charge shot most of the game...kinda lame right?\n\nThe music is good in some areas( water level, title theme) but in others it is just bad or really poorly chosen i.e. it does not fit the context of the gameplay at all and only serves to create this asymmtery in the mood( like the temple music).\n\nIt can be a really frustrating experience due to a combination of no health drops from enemies, spread out save points(which you are teleported back to when you die and lose all progress since you last saved) and difficult and sometimes obtuse platforming sections( The sand section just sucks, it really does).\n\nMy least favorite aspect is the backtracking which is really the meat of the game(this is what takes the most time in a playthrough). For example, I beat a boss and got a new marker but there was literally no way to get to it UNLESS I somehow knew of this one little room far away from it that housed a secret powerup. I only figued it out by reading online. I couldn't progress in the game until I figured this out; this got really annoying.\n\n\n\nOVerall: I do reccommend it.

Many reviews both positive and negative will touch on the difficulty of the bosses, but each of them behave consistently enough that victory is not a matter of luck, but figuring out the correct counter-strategy and perfecting its execution. Enduring defeat long enough to establish this muscle memory admittedly requires equal parts humility and stubbornness. However, the sense of accomplishment that follows defeating each boss easily justifies each failed attempt.\n\nBeyond the excellent boss fights, the game's greatest achievement is the fact that exploring the station is not only fun from the very beginning, but becomes even more enjoyable as the game continues. The various power-ups obtained over the course of the game -- and I strongly recommend tracking down the optional ones -- allow for smoother, quicker movement as long as the player has the necessary platforming skills, and the computer terminals scattered throughout the station build enough backstory that the game never feels quite as lonely as its spiritual predecessor did.\n\nFor those that remain hungry after completing the game, there is an overwhelming amount of post-game content to challenge the player.

A robot is sent to a multi-sector research station to discover why contact was lost. There are biomes to explore, logs to read, bosses to defeat, upgrades to acquire, and secrets to discover. Just remember: while it is similar, this is no Metroid adventure.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe few pixels that make up the cute little robot controlled by the player should be an overall indication to how threatening it can be. Movement options are fairly limited most of the time, so the environment, enemies, and bosses can seem unforgiving at times. Some powerful upgrades exist, but get used to short-ranged weaponry, four directions of fire, and no health drops. Since save and restore points are the only sources of health in the game, ESA gameplay rewards a conscious and patient player.\n\n[h1]Exploration[/h1]\nExploring the station is fun. Each environment feels unique with its own aesthetic, music, pace, and enemies. Even though backtracking is a major part of the game, know that the areas in Environmental Station Alpha aren't always as they were, be it new enemies in old places, closed off routes from overgrowth, and activated security systems adding challenges to original paths. Teleporters can used to get around the station quickly.\n\n[h1]Getting Lost[/h1]\nEven though exploring is fun, be prepared to get lost. A lot. Areas that seemingly lead elsewhere are often out of reach with the player's current upgrades, or, there are hidden rooms behind walls that have little or no visual indication, contrary to other areas that may have cracks or color variation where blocks can be broken or passed through. Players may find that shooting and dashing at every wall conceivable seems like the only way not to miss something. There are times when the next destination is obvious, as certain events update the map with markers, but other times when players might feel at a complete loss as they try to decipher riddles.\n\n[h1]Art & Soundtrack[/h1]\nEnvironmental Station Alpha executes the retro feel excellently. The game features a darker, more neutral palette with pops of bright color that references the original Metroid and Super Metroid. The sound design appears to draw inspiration from those games as well. The soundtrack has Brinstar-like catchy tunes, but also has many atmospheric songs and sounds that enhance the feeling of isolation as the player delves deeper into the station's secrets. Some of the music gets quite eerie.\n\n[h1]Writing[/h1]\nThe story is driven primarily by logs, so be prepared to read. I'm typically not a fan of story progression through text logs, but I don't mind it in ESA because the text logs are fairly short and sprinkled throughout. The subjects of these logs can seem confusing at first, but as players progress, more pieces of the puzzle are assembled regarding the events that transpired across the station before the robot's arrival. Some of these logs are filled with riddles, which may become clearer as they're revisited after exploring new areas.\n\n[h1]Boss Design[/h1]\nEach boss is a unique experience of varying difficulty and technique. There are a number of optional and secret bosses that test players' understanding of the game's physics. I find that the bosses of Environmental Station Alpha are a major highlight.\n\n[h1]Secrets[/h1]\nThe game goes surprisingly deep with optional power ups, secret areas, an alien language, hidden rooms, easter eggs, and inside jokes, all of which the game doesn't spoil for the curious explorer. Close to--if not half of the game--includes the postgame secrets. Good luck to those that set out avoiding a guide for the postgame content. \"Involved\" is an understatement, but another area where Environmental Station Alpha shines.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nGamers that enjoy the Metroid franchise will likely enjoy Environmental Station Alpha. It's undeniably influenced by that series, but most certainly no imitator. This isn't a cheap and short indie game. In fact, it's a big game for the low price. It is similar in length to Metroid, and even deeper with its secrets.

It's real good.  I am still enjoying the game thoroughly, even though I beat it hours ago.  It's one of those games that sucks you in while you're playing it, and stays on your mind when you're not.  The controls, graphics, atmosphere, and music all come together into a nice polished enjoyable experience.\n\nI'll get the flaws out of the way first.  I really only see two, and they are quite minor:\n\n[b]Pacing[/b] - If it's your second or third time through, the game probably plays fairly smoothly start to finish.  However, on the first try you will likely spend a fair bit of time searching for the next powerup, switch, or boss that advances the game.  I ended up revisiting the same dead ends a couple times, and this was occasionally frustrating.\n\n[b]'One-way Loops'[/b] - The map is a necessity to the game.  However, often times when looking at the map it appears there may be two similar paths from your current location to the place you want to go, but only one of them is passable in the direction you are traveling.  It's sometimes very frustrating to almost get to your destination only to find out that \u201cyou can't get there from here\u201d.  More than once the only way there is not the obvious way.\n\nThese are very minor gripes.  Minor, because of the nature of the game's strong points, like:\n\n[b]Exploration![/b] - The game is large, and so much more full of variety than you could have possibly expected out of an 8x8 tile set and an \u201cimaginary sound chip\u201d.  There's so much to see and discover, and it all looks fantastic in its low-fi splendor.  Every portion of the station has its own look and atmosphere, its own enemies, and its own set of unique and interesting challenges.  So when you're not sure where to go next, just go somewhere.  It's nice there.\n\n[b]Controls[/b] - The controls are tight.  They have enough predictability so that getting through a difficult area is much more a matter of practice than it is luck.  More than once I encountered a room or a boss where my first reaction was, \u201cYou've got to be kidding me, this looks impossible.\u201d  However, after a few attempts (yes, you'll be retrying things regularly), the precision and repeatability of the controls becomes evident, and the completion of said room or boss is a very rewarding payoff.  Several times I found myself saying, \u201cWow!  I really pulled that off!  I'm amazing!\u201d  Which brings me to:\n\n[b]Rewards[/b] - Accomplishing a difficult series of jumps, finding that one secret spot that looks a little different than the others, and beating that punishing boss are usually good enough rewards in and of themselves.  However, occasionally you'll find an optional powerup that is just a joy to use.  You know what I'm talking about, because you've played other Metroidvania-type games.  It's that powerup that lets you go back through other areas that were difficult the first time, and completely tear them up.  Blasting through them so much faster than before while wearing a big stupid grin and giggling a little.  Yes, this game rewards its players for a job done well.\n\n[b]Hints[/b] - Not really the obvious hints that tell you where to go next, but rather subtle hints like difficulty that say, \u201cMaybe you should turn back.  This will be easier later.\u201d  Usually if you encounter an area or enemy that seems unfair, it probably means you're headed in the wrong direction.  HOWEVER.  Several times throughout the game I stuck with it and muscled through an area ahead of schedule.  Not necessarily breaking the order of the game, but possibly to get a health or weapon upgrade a little early, so that I could have a little breathing room in the challenges ahead.  Very rarely was there ever an \u201call that work for nothing\u201d situation.\n\n[b]Atmosphere[/b] - The graphics, animation, and music put you there in the game.  Occasionally you'll spot inspiration from other beloved games in the genre, but it all really stands on its own, even if you're not bringing all that rosy nostalgia with you.  The water area is calming yet dangerous.  The lava area is close and oppressive.  The jungle area is verdant and lush.  At every point along the journey, the game draws you in to its amazing atmosphere.\n\n[b]Free DLC[/b] - Yep.  The game received an update recently which included an optional new (seemingly large) area with new music, enemies, and graphics.  It's clear this developer enjoys their work.\n\nLike I said, I beat it, but I'm definitely not done with it.  I'm not a completionist by any means, but the game still has so many interesting things to do that it will be keeping me entertained for a good number of gaming sessions yet.  If you've ever enjoyed a Metroidvania game, this is definitely one to add to your library, and it seems almost criminal to be buying it for under ten bucks.\n\nP.S. My biggest request is for a Linux port.  Streaming it to a Linux machine has a number of issues that other games do not, and it has some deal-breaking control issues when played under Wine.  So if you want to play it on your Linux machine, you're fairly well out of luck unless you're better at troubleshooting strange issues than I am.  Since the game is built on MMF2, a Linux port (while not directly supported by MMF2) should be possible and mostly hassle free through a 3rd party library.  I think this developer has a bright future, and hopefully a Linux port can put a few extra dollars in their pockets, and help speed them along through their next project.", "timestamp_created": 1452319842, "timestamp_updated": 1467436525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20357342": {"recommendationid": "20357342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031555805", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477429177}, "language": "english", "review": "Like many other games in the genre the hints to Metroid are plenty and often apparent. ESA, like Axiom Verge, sometimes gets a bit too close when it comes to lifting graphical assets and enemy movement patterns from Metroid to not annoy me (if I wanted to play Metroid or Super Metroid I will play the originals).\nESA does, however, offer a good experience at a good price. Although not graphically intricate or inspired, the game does look nice from a pixel art perspective. Like mentioned, I do feel the hints to Metroid when it comes to some of the tiles and enemies are a bit too much. \nThe game has quite a bit of backtracking and a surprisingly large map. Music is a delight. Sounds are nothing spectacular, but don't detract from the overall experience.\nBoss battles are my primary gripe with this game. Although not very inspired, they do offer more than decent challenge, which I enjoy. It does annoy me to no end, though, when the HP bar is almost empty only to suddenly refill and the boss enters another state. I can live with this as a chocking WTF-kind-of-thing once, but it happens often and occasionally even twice with the same boss.\nThe backtracking also becomes quite tedious towards the later part of the game when suddenly the station is powered up and you get shot at from all kinds of thingymajigs.\n\nPros:\nMusic\nArt style\nThe challenge\n\nNeutral:\nSounds\n\nCons:\nAnnoying HP refills on many of the bosses\nBacktracking gets tedious towards the second half of the game\nWouldn't mind if the developers had ventured further from the Metroid graphical concept", "timestamp_created": 1452106306, "timestamp_updated": 1452106306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20336932": {"recommendationid": "20336932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017035548", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464139483}, "language": "english", "review": "I was expecting this game to feel more open like some other \"metroidvania\" games, but I still enjoy it when i'm not crying from trying to beat a boss 30 times, and actually beating the boss is rewarding (if i don't think about how long i spent that i could've been doing something more productive/less masochistic) If you like games that feel very open and exploratory and with a strong mood, this isn't the best one for that, but if you like boss battles, the boss battles here are intense with a lot of depth and cool ideas, and the overall aesthetic of the game is neat.\n\nCool game in general.\n\nEDIT: after playing this game more and getting to 58% completion, i find myself wandering around the fairly large area not sure what to do and sometimes leading nowhere, but it's pretty rewarding to find the stuff that you're meant to.", "timestamp_created": 1452037368, "timestamp_updated": 1455227048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20315761": {"recommendationid": "20315761", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985159146", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452665789}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the game to the nasty plant boss.

La-Mulana is garbage that throws insane and cryptic stuff at the player from the beginning. This game I beat with 92% completion rate without using a guide and knowing nothing about it.

ESA managed to hold my attention for over 75 hours of exploration, trying somewhat challenging things, and more exploration. This is Hempuli's first commercial release to my knowledge, but he spent about 3 years tinkering with this game and trying to make it better. This is a better-designed metroidvania than Super Metroid was. There's no arbitrarily huge amount of health that you need to recover by grinding off of little enemies spawning out of pipes. You find a save, you get your health back, you fan out in multiple directions and see if you can find anything. The only real negative I can think of when it comes to ESA's exploration is that you don't find some little missile pack buried in each room, stuffed in a wall. You don't get that momentary gratification and pointless increase to the capacity of a weapon you'll never use. Instead, when you find some health or a bonus item, you feel massively more rewarded. That's not for everyone, but it's certainly for me.\n\nI see a lot of complaints about ESA stemming from its difficulty. \"This boss has too many phases\", \"I don't have enough health\", \"I don't know where to go\", all that kind of deal. The boss pacing definitely feels off in a couple of places. Some of the earlier bosses are decidedly more challenging than later ones feel at the time. The reason this doesn't bother me is because each boss actually feels very unique. Each boss has its own mechanics and feels complex in its own way, aside from a couple which are designed to teach you basic mechanics and one that acts as an item progression gate. Health, and dying a lot, are also not issues. There's an easy mode available directly from the start if you can't progress on normal, and it increases your maximum health, lowers enemy damage, and starts you with more maximum health. ESA also does a great job of directing you to where you need to be if you interact with terminals you find. Similar to Zero Mission, ESA will explain where you need to go through highlighting the target square on your map for you, which continues for quite a long time to allow you to continue progressing and exploring on the way to your destinations. You can also get around the game much faster than it initially seems due to the eventual introduction of a quick travel mechanic, eliminating a lot of pointless backtracking. Save points are generally positioned well and are used to prepare you for a boss so that you have a minimal run to get back to a boss. There are very few exceptions to this.\n\nThe amount of optional content in ESA is also very impressive. There are secrets hidden everywhere, optional upgrades you can find, and with the introduction of a recent patch an entirely new area to explore. On top of this, once you've beaten the main game and reached an ending, you may have some questions about things you have found in the past that seem to have had no effect. This is where your postgame starts, and there are plenty of clues about how to progress postgame that can be found simply by continuing to investigate each unfilled square on your map. The secrets of ESA are not like a missile expansion hunt you would experience in a Metroid game. They are targeted and explained if you look carefully. There are only a scarce few entirely self-contained bonus rooms having little to no indication of their existence; almost all the things you want to find have a directing point somewhere. The postgame secrets are handled in an entirely different way than the traditional metroidvania style and require a different mindset to continue delving into each step in the chain of hidden information, which is a wonderful changeup so late into the game.\n\nThe soundtrack was also handled very well. Every track fits into the area it belongs in and helps set the mood particularly well. The instrumentation used in ESA's soundtrack really goes well with the style of game and manages to call up memories of old SNES titles while not being some shameless ripoff. There wasn't a single instance where I felt \"Oh, this track is obviously inspired by another game\". My single complaint with ESA's soundtrack is the lack of variance in boss music. There's one track used for almost every boss in the game, and it became noticeable after a while. I definitely would have appreciated a bit of variance in the boss music, even if it was just one extra track on some bosses. Luckily, this isn't a huge issue, because most bosses are intense enough or go down quick enough once you know their patterns that the music doesn't feel repetitive.\n\nThe graphics are the only point where it starts to break down for me a little. For the most part, ESA functions visually, but there were definitely times where I felt that the player character was blending into the background a bit too much. The low-pixel style also impacted how enemies and environments appeared, and more than once I was a bit confused as to what I was looking at until I took a second to inspect it. This isn't a major issue, but I would personally have appreciated more pixel density for ESA so that I could better interpret what was going on in each area. It's easy enough to tell what you're looking at in 95% of the game, but that other 5% is what I wish had more to it. That said, each area in ESA is quite visually distinct and the environments never felt samey or repetitive. Each room, even, is visually memorable, which is pretty impressive.\n\nHempuli's put a lot of time into making ESA great. Any time a bug has come up, it's been fixed as soon as possible. There's still a persistent issue with some people running the Mac version where the game runs at decreased speed or lags, but from what I understand this might be fixed soon with a change in the Wine/Wineskin wrapper and is a result of a recent Mac OS update. Linux, unfortunately, does not jive with Multimedia Fusion. At the time of this review, your best bet is going to be playing this on Windows or using a dual-boot (which I guess people might have anyway because of Linux?), and the Mac version may be improved pretty soon to have few or no issues. There's one issue in particular where the Mac version will not support a controller natively, but using Joy2Key or any other program you like is a very quick workaround for this, and the keyboard controls function totally fine on their own. As far as the content of the game itself goes, bugs that have been reported to be negative for people have been ironed out pretty quickly, and nothing currently stands out as being broken. This is a game which has been examined and improved upon consistently since its release, and I really can't recommend it enough. Hempuli knocked it out of the park and has done all that was required of him as a dev, plus a free update with an entirely new area and its own secrets. Some people seem put off by ESA because of how it looks and from the apparently intimidating difficulty, but I promise that even a little patience goes a long way. I hope those who pick this up decide to keep at it even if a boss initially feels impossible or exploration feels initially unrewarding, because it is ultimately worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1450644412, "timestamp_updated": 1490737958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865704", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19783143": {"recommendationid": "19783143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042210663", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451361898}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely brilliant Metroidvania.

This is a perfect example of it doing almost everything right.\n\nThe controls are straightforward, the artstyle is crisp and the exploration is very fun. There's still a bunch of secrets I still haven't figured out - while others may find this offputting ('cryptic' puzzles as another review mentions) it's personally what i enjoy and not intergal to the main 'stpry'. I also enjoy the \"difficulty\" that others have brought up, i didn't think it was too hard and unforgiving and requires good timing and patience, and mostly just being careful of your surroundings. The boss levels are pretty challenging and I died quite alot but it felt pretty good beating them eventually. \n\nIt doesn't break the mould too much in terms of upgrades, but the physics-based grappling hook is really fun and and allows for some small sequence breaking if you're precise and patient. Also, plenty of little secrets and stuff to find by the same means. \n\nOverall, it took me roughly 20 hours to complete the game with 90% of the map (but im really slow), and from the top of my head there's at least three puzzles I haven't solved - maybe i'll look up how to solve them. Surely there's a couple more hours behind these. \n\nI sort of bought this because I needed something to tide me over so i didn't burn through Axiom Verge too quickly, but i found myself pacing this game because i was enjoying it too much.

In the end... I was left wishing the lore was fleshed out a little better, the game just felt like the rooms were big, the world was wide.... but small.\n\nOn metroidvanias.com, I saw a blurb for ESA and immediately bought it, and pounded through it for 40 hours to finally uncover the massive secrets within. La-mulana levels of hardcore riddles, translating an alien language by hand, all this insane post-game lore and insanity leading up to some amazing stuff. This game just felt MASSIVE, and just recently, the developer added a bunch more content for free, just a free expansion with tons of new awesome stuff that ties into everything, and it's amazing. I've got some 71 hours in at this point, and I'm pretty sure I missed some stuff.\n\nIf you like platformers, if you played axiom verge and enjoyed it, or metroid, or castlevania, you MUST purchase this game. immediately. Sell an organ if you have to, i cannot stress this enough - this game is solid gold. This game pounds everything awesome I've played since la-mulana, and probably pounds that in that it manages to perfectly present the challenges and post-game riddles in such a way that they are solvable - and never feel obtusely confusing or lost in translation to english.\n\nPurchase this game now, if you are looking at it, just do it.

many great titles in the past such as Cave Story, Aquaria and more recently Axiom Verge.\n\nBut enough about history this game is everything I could ever want in A metroidvania style game. It's got a great 8bit feel complemented with great boss design, Perfect controls and an amazing soundtrack. Exploration is a joy with terminals scattered around to lay out a storyline and point you in the right direction.\n\nThe main game itself will probably take you around 8 hours to complete BUT and its a massive but the amount of content to discover after you've finished the game is outstanding so many puzzles and even a new language to decode will give you hours of extra content moreso if you don't use a guide.\n\nConsidering the price and the content theres literally no reason for you not to give this game A go it's probably one of my most enjoyed game for 2015 and despite being a fan of Axiom Verge which also released around the same time and had a much bigger budget and even exposure on Playstation I actually prefer ESO and Hope Hempuli the developer continues with this level of quality for his next game!", "timestamp_created": 1445973027, "timestamp_updated": 1445973027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515571", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18711742": {"recommendationid": "18711742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254161421", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465527446}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game.

I've been through nearly 5000 games on my recomendations queue, and I've only been barely interested enough in 200 of them to put on my wishlist.\n\nIf you're like me, and completely jaded by misleading tags, lack of gameplay in trailers, early access games that have been abandoned, ( A flood of RPGMaker, visual novels, poorly drawn anime dating sim, choose your own destiny, point and click, simulation, \"survival horror\", etc.) games that you are unable to filter out!!!  (seriously steam, why the **** can't I filter this trash out?!)...  Then your poor brain deserves this.\n\n**Edit:  Dear LORD of ALL that is HOLY and good in the universe, they've added a filter to the recommendations queue!!  Thank you Lord Gaben!  \n\nThe point is, this game is a deep breath of fresh air in an ocean of complete excrement.  \n\n+tight controls\n+FULL controller support, even allowing you to use the D-pad or the left thumb stick for movement. So I don't understand the \"Partial controller support\" on the game's features.  (And you bet your *** I'm using the XBox One Controller's D-Pad)\n+rewarding discoveries\n+brilliant and appropriate music\n+awesome boss battles\n+extended end game content\n\n-there aren't enough talented people making games for Steam\n\nBuy it at FULL price, because it's already being sold short!", "timestamp_created": 1445935648, "timestamp_updated": 1469676297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 92, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822741", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18706783": {"recommendationid": "18706783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976751881", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481509151}, "language": "english", "review": "I recently completed the last (I think) of many, many endings this game has to offer and I have to say I've thoroughly enjoyed this game.\n\nAt a glance the graphics might come off as too pixelated. I assure you, starting out, everything is laid out clearly, and there is never a question of what anything is. In fact, I'd go as far as to say some of the areas are beautiful. Somehow the artists managed to build a lot of different environments with a wide range of moods that will make your experience engrossing.\n\nI'd been looking for a solid followup to Super Metroid since I was a little kid, and I can safely say this is it.\n\nMy only complaint is that some of the post-game stuff is too cryptic. I mostly want to explore and prod around on my own, I don't want to have to decode an alien language and do a lot of translating. That's a lot of work.\n\nStill, there IS post game, and with recent updates there are whole new areas being added for free. Can't really complain about that.\n\nSo yes. Buy it.

I quit at the part where some enemies were following you on the Y axis in the Volcano area, next to a room with fireball spitting Piranha plants.\n\n=============\n\nIts [b]good[/b] aspects:\n- It is aesthetically a nice game, very loyal to the 8-bit graphics I liked with NES games.\n- It has a nice soundtrack and atmosphere, it really felt like a Metroid inspired game.\n- The boss battles I did were fun, you may need to learn a pattern, but they were fun to play.\n\n=============\n\nBut, its [b]bad[/b] aspects:\n\n- It is a difficult game, you dont have a lot of health. The enemies and the environment tend to do a lot of damage later in the game. You can crank up your HP by editing the game's config, but I think the ingame upgrades should do this.\n\n- It is a cryptic game, I often did not know what I had to do in order to progress. At first the game helps out with messages on ingame computers, but later on I often had the feeling I was missing certain items in order to progress like a vertical boost jump. I spent a lot of time looking for a fourth energy source in the Temple area, it turned out you had to move through a wall to get to it. I had to look on a YouTube video to figure this one out, that area just looks too much like a plain wall. In Metroid, a Zoomer (enemy) would have crawled along the wall and disappeared inside the hidden part to give a hint. If it were for a secret item like the disks, it would be fine. But not in order to progress in the storyline.\n\n- It is a hard platformer, where you really need to master the hookshot jumps to get where you need to go. Too often I get knocked off by Rinka enemies, falling stalagtites or projectiles and drop into acid or lava. It just becomes annoying after too many times. However, some people may think this is where the challenge of the game is and consider it a good point.\n\n- It is not very rewarding, I think it would have been better if boss battles rewarded you with upgrades rather than having to search for them. Also the heat suit kind of disappointed me, I need it just to get through a few areas. The Metroid Varia suit, deducts damage done from enemies and allows you to walk in lava. Also, killing enemies become a bit of a chore, they do not drop anything usefull like health.\n\n=============\n\nBecause of these points I do not recommend this game to other players. Im just a casual gamer however and people with more skill and patience probably will find this game enjoyable.\nI really wanted to like this game inspired by Metroid, but it just became too difficult and cryptic  for me to keep up with it.", "timestamp_created": 1437352209, "timestamp_updated": 1439022187, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17127275": {"recommendationid": "17127275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065854351", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499567782}, "language": "english", "review": "As pretty much everyone has stated the first thing that comes to mind is Metroid. Very concise. You're in space. There are familiar figures, but with alien colors and features. Looks like Metroid. Feels like Metroid. Styling and rich art. I'm a big fan of the realistic figures they have designed with such a limited pixel pallette per figure. It looks and feels like a tight old school NES game, which as I'm sure you already realize is a phenomenal thing. I have to say, I was equally impressed to see the limited number of people accredited on the dev team. I believe it was four...my apologies if I am wrong. This game feels like a high quality 8-bit era game, so all praises due to the limited number of people who developed it. The controls are tight, like you would hope in this genre. But. just to specify there are a heavy amount of platforms elements, which for me is a good thing. It's something I personally find synonomous with Metroid or SOTN, but they also have a heavy combat element. And, Metroid in particular uses a blaster. Of course, there are combat elements in this game, and they are fun (see epic boss fights). But, they are closer to something like Alucard in SOTN, because of the limited range on your weapon. A meaningless distinction to some, sure, but I think it has weight to others. If only, stylistically. Ahh, yes. The boss fights. So far, I have participated in what I would deem a thorough amount. About one per hour. Granted, I have only played several hours. So, if this is isn't true in later stages, I apologize. But, I suspect it will be. Boss battles are HARD! Not impossible, but don't expect to get through it on your first time. Most of them have taken me about a half dozen times if not more. It's not just learning the NPCs patterns either. You have to be pretty dynamic with your strategy if you want to beat them. I have been playing on Normal mode for reference. All in all. This is one great Metroidvania style platformer, and highly suggest it at full price, if you're a fan of the genre. And, if you're not ABSOLUTELY try it out on sale. Great game. Excellent so far. And not to SPOIL anything. But, the story about a rogue AI has not been cliche yet, nor predictable. Which, in this day and age is an impressive thing.\n\n\nTLDR; This rules!

Much of the game feels like Metroid. It's atmospheric and doesn't give much in the way of guidance. Exploration is key here. There are plenty of options for exploring without being overwhelming. Even when I felt like I had no idea where to go, it didn't take long to get back on track. The world's reasonably large and varied. Upgrades are interesting and fun, even if some are tricky to use effectively a first.\n\nThe combat in this game is difficult. The gun has a pretty short range and it doesn't get a whole lot better with upgrades. This isn't generally a problem while exploring, but bosses get to be very difficult. Later bosses can be tricky to damage and have attacks that are hard to avoid. I played on normal, but there is an easy mode if the difficulty is too high.\n\nFor how long the game is... it depends. The first/main ending was 7-8 hours. There's a lot of optional stuff - upgrades, bosses, collectables. There's also a 'postgame' that leads to a few more endings. There are a lot of vague hints / riddles about where to go and what to do. It's sort of similar to Fez or La-Mulana, but generally less obtuse than either of those. Finishing the postgame could take as long as the main game, but depends on how fast you solve things.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend if you want a pretty good Metroid style game.

So I was looking at the Axiom Verge reviews right when that came out and saw someone bring up this game as a better version of what Axiom Verge was trying to do. I don't know how Axiom Verge is, I still haven't played it, but I do highly doubt it'll be able to absolutely blow me away like this game did.\n\nThe controls are tight and the movement abilities are great and useful. You're given a lot of power and even still the game remains consistently challenging from beginning to end. Unless you break it with one of the last two powerups, that is. \n...though, even then the game can still find ways to challenge you.\nThe game map is pretty decently sized and very dense, making it quite fun to explore and find all the hidden nooks and crannies, secrets and powerups. There's a lot of variety too, I don't really recall any rooms that felt wasted or pointless, each brings something new to the game. The bosses, too, are pretty diverse, basically every type of boss you can imagine is here and there are no repeat bosses at all. And some of them are damn hard, the hardest parts of the game for sure.\nBut? The difficulty is always fair. Never did the game present me with a challenge that seemed completely unreasonable. Every boss can be defeated without taking a single point of damage if you learn their patterns and how to dodge their attacks while still taking them down quickly. No secret is so obscurely hidden that you wouldn't possibly be able to figure it out. It's all fair, just challenging. It makes you think outside of the box to progress or find all there is to find, but everything makes sense.\nThere's a lot of content, too. Simply playing the game to completion should run you 8-10 hours if you're exploring around and looking for secrets along the way, and completing the postgame can easily run you another 5-8 depending on how good you are at puzzle solving. And boy, the postgame puzzles. Very reminiscent of La-Mulana in the way the main game is reminiscent of Metroid, but much less cryptic without making things too obvious. I hope you were paying attention to the station's layout and rooms while playing through if you want to complete the game, though.\nI'm just.

They all come to mind when diving into this simple yet great platformer. Its not your fancy colorful artsy game you see out on the market now a days but this package will trigger your childhood memories of playing 1 of the most influential game ever made. Its your standard Metriod platform with only your blaster to start off with and a space station to explore. Im not going to get into the details about a metriod game because chances are if you interested enough to read these reviews you already know the formula for this kind of game. Yes the bosses are tough and big but not without their weakness. They will frustrate you as they get increasingly harder and it will take a couple of tries to figure out their attack pattern but hitting that last chunk of health sure feels satisfying as you watch it explode. The station is surprisingly big with tons of secrets that gracefully won't seem obvious and make you explore every nook and cranny if stumped and not sure what to do next. It may get tedious depending on how good your luck is in figuring it out but for the most part it just takes a little extra time looking for a masked block or a hidden path you just so happen to walk into. The art design of the game really puts those who like exploring weird or out of place objects revealing something useful feel at home. With that in mind the gameplay mechanics is where it gets juicy. The mobility and shooting of the hero is solid. Jumping is swift and consistent but shooting and hookshoting may take a little getting used to. Especially since the your blaster doesn't have much range for merely the entirety of the game and your hookshot(once obtained) can stick to almost any surface but swinging will need to be practiced. As you progress, each powerup fall in place and provides its usefulness. nothing revolutionary but none the less gratifying when obtained. Old school never gets old especially when enhanced with cleaner gameplay mechanics and puzzles to solve. The only downer of the game is the map. Although VERY useful (because you'll get lost often) but not very detailed. Good enough to see which direction to go but Dots and Color can only inform so much when you don't remember what the room looks like. other than that its a great Metriod replica and vast amounts of hidden secrets to uncover.

If I hadn't already explored literally everywhere else I would have though (not for the first time) that I was sequence breaking and meant to go elsewhere.

It's a Metroid-inspired platformer with retro graphics, so from premise alone it doesn't really have that \"wow\" factor that really compels me to play some games. After having played through it, I'll say that it wasn't the most inspired of games out there, but what it did, it did pretty well.\n\nOf course, one of the most important parts of any Metroid-derivative game is the sense of exploration. At first, I was worried that the world seemed really small, given that the map at the time didn't seem exactly large. However, there's a lot within this map, and even by screen count alone, there's over 800 screens in the game. Even though it is a pretty big map, the map is very dense; there's a lot to do in this world, and even though it did get tiresome having to backtrack all the time when exploring the western side of the map, at least the rest of the map is very easy to explore. After a while in game you also unlock teleporters, which as mentioned in the previous sentence are pretty evenly placed with the exception of the desert and water areas.\n\nAnother big part of any Metroid style game is to have really cool powerups. I found 14 throughout my playthrough (although I've heard rumors of a soopur sekrit 15th), and while a few were either completely unnecessary (the rough map, for example really shouldn't be a powerup) or just served as an arbitrary gating mechanism (the keycard that unlocks golden blocks), there are a lot of really fun powerups as well. You've got standard things for a Metroid-esque game like the Heat-Resistant Suit and the Charge Beam, but there's also powerups that let you dash around all over the place, as well as a grapple hook which is easily the most fun powerup in the game.\n\nThis game also has bosses, and these sure are some bosses. While some of these bosses could do with either not having as many phases or having one health bar so that you know how many phases the boss has, almost all of these bosses are very fun to fight. There's only two bosses in the game that I would consider bad, and those are one boss where the only way you can damage the boss is to kite its projectiles back at the boss (a lot less fun than it sounds TBH) and a boss where it's impossible to defeat it without a certain powerup and stupidly easy to defeat with the powerup. However, for these missteps there are more than a few bosses which definitely make up for it.\n\nFinishing the game for the first time took me about seven hours, but that's far from when the game is over. You can either choose to leave the game there or go on and play the post-game which can easily take you as long to beat as the main game does. While the mystery of unlocking pillars which are hitherto unknown to you is very cool, after a while the postgame turns into an insane amount of tedious backtracking and puzzles which are almost certainly way too obscure for their own good. I've played La-Mulana; I'm used to obscure puzzles, and while the now infamous Clock puzzle is cleverly structured, actually executing what has to be done to finish the puzzle just isn't worth it to me. As such, that's where I stopped playing.\n\nEven though the post-game does get incredibly long-winded after a while, the main game is still a whole lot of fun, but one thing that concerns me is that, much like La-Mulana, all the magic is gone after the first playthrough once you know how to do everything and where to go. While the bosses are a load of fun, that's really all any subsequent playthroughs of this game are gonna be about. While unfortunately this game may be a \"one-and-done\" for me, at least it was a pretty solid one-and-done. 8/10.\n\nStory: While I never got the third ending for completing the post-game (yes, this game has multiple endings), I did quite enjoy the writing of this game. It's written in a very sparse way, with some humor from time to time, but mostly detailing the crew attempting to survive from whatever the hell happened here on the station. While it does get a little overdone with its 2spooky-ness from time to time, it's still pretty well presented, and it leaves just enough for you to start filling in the gaps yourself. Not bad. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Well, you can tell from the store screenshots that this game is an 8-Bit pixel style game, and while that's far from anything terribly original, much like the gameplay it is at least done pretty well. The spriters made good use of their palette and screen royalty to give you some pretty damn awesome looking areas and enemies. Also, given that this game makes use of pixel art, you wouldn't expect any lag. Thankfully, I never had any lag throughout the entirety of the game. Resolution is a bit of a tricky spot, though; the game fullscreens by default, but renders as a square, leaving some pretty unsightly black bars on the sides. While this is something of a nitpick, I kinda wish they had done something like what La-Mulana did and have some graphics to the sides to at least make the screen feel a bit more full. Still though, the area, monster and boss designs are more than enough to hold your attention. Great job for the visual artists here. 5/5.\n\nSound: This game does have a tendency to feel a bit confused as far as the sound direction goes. Even though the game was \"8-Bit,\" the OST feels like it would be more at home on an SNES. The sound effects feel pretty out of place from time to time as well; some of the sounds are realistic and some of the sounds are chippy. Even though this is pretty weird given the game's staunch insistence on looking like Metroid, at least the OST gets one thing right: ambience. While a couple of the songs get tired due to having to backtrack through a couple of areas (*cough* desert and water areas *cough*), each of the songs make the area feel like its own. It may not be the catchiest of OSTs, but it does its job well for providing atmosphere.

One can imagine, with the passage of time, these game genres have evolved.

Traveling through the decrepit station is a mostly enjoyable experience, with the occasional difficulty spike.  There's a fair amount of content here, or at least there was for myself and my subpar platforming skills.  My final file complete time was around 10 hours, but due to bad process management and numerous deaths/reset, I likely completed the game in around 20.  That is all the content of the game, including the fairly meaty end-game, which proves a real challenge in both skill and, to a lesser degree, intellect.   One of the devs has been very active in the Steam forum, and has released several patches based directly off of feedback. \nUltimately, if you're looking for a decent, challenging metroidvania, I would recommend this game.  Some of the mechanics take some practice, and some of the bosses require a bit of trial-and-error, but the overall package feels polished, and the minimalist pixel-art remains consistently eye-catching.

The controls are very responsive, and other then the fact that the default controller scheme mapped shoot and jump to non-adjacent buttons, I found it fairly easy to get into (easy fix with third party software or new drivers, etc).  The music and level design are reminiscent of the NES, but enhanced in subtle ways that make the feel very modern (no slowdown, no visible refresh, etc).  Guys and Gals seriously the SECRETS in this game and the AMOUNT of THOUGHT that went into its design are the work of an eclectic genius channeled from the 6502 assembly days who truly understood what it was to make a metroid game.\n\nI still think calling these types of games metroidvanias is a little over generalized (I really think the vania implies some RPG/Hack n Slash elements) but who the $&%# cares, this is the best game I have played on steam sinse I launched D2 through the ui.

The game is the definition of a \"metroidvania.\"  You are given a large, maze-like station to navigate, filled with puzzles, monsters, and bosses.  You expand your ability to reach areas by obtaining powerups, which primarily change the way you move through the game, although there are also weapon upgrades and the like.  \n\nIn terms of gameplay, this game does it right.  You are given the right amount of control over your character, and the movement and abilities feel good and work the way you expect them to.  The bosses have a great variety, and each fight feels and plays out differently.  Each new boss is an interesting and satisfying new experience.  The station is very well constructed, with a pretty good mix of dungeon and maze.  The station is also solid; there are no empty rooms or spaces inside the station itself, so there is lots to explore, and tons of hidden rooms to find.  \n\nGraphics and Audio really shine in this game.  The graphics are charmingly done pixels.  Most of the environments are interesting to explore, and many are downright pretty.  At many points I was struck by the direct visual influences taken from Super Metroid, and they are done wonderfully.  The soundtrack is also fantastic, giving the right mix of mystery, hostility, creepiness, and alien strangeness.  \n\nThe main story premise is simple:  You are a robot sent to find out why the station went dead.  The story is advanced in small ways throughout the course of the game, given through some dialogue but mostly through computer terminals and logs.  The story is heavily one of mystery, however, so don't expect answers to all of your questions.  The game boasts multiple endings, and they are fun to unlock and see.\n\nThe game has a couple unique features to be mentioned.  First of all, once the game is completed, new objects and events appear in the station.  You are then able to undertake a new mystery (one that might take you beyond the station itself.)  This is done very well, aside from a couple frustrating moments, and it is absolutely worth completing.  Once this is done, you get an interesting little spin on the New Game + system, which you'll have to see for yourself.\n\nIt should be noted that this game is challenging.  I personally think it got the challenge level about right for most of the rooms, monsters and bosses.  However, players who are not experienced in some of the older and more challenging metroidvanias might find it a step up in difficulty from what they're used to.  Its a good kind of challenge, though, and anyone who enjoyed the original Metroids, Castlevanias, or more recent games like Cave Story should find the challenge level reasonable.  The mystery and extended end-game is tougher, but worth your time (and the forum is full of helpful posts by those who managed to puzzle most of it out first to help get you through.)  \n\nThis review got long, but only because the game deserves to have its virtues extolled.  It was a pleasure to play through this game, particularly as a lover of Metroidvanias (real ones, at that.)  Its also not very expensive, which is always a plus.\n\nThis is a genuinely great metroidvania.  It might be the best Metroid since Super Metroid.  The creator has produced a love letter to the genre that firmly deserves a place in it.  Its just that good.

I will come through and edit this review as needed when I finish the game, but off the bat there were so many good things that I liked.\n\nEnvironmental Station Alpha was introduced to me through a Metroid community, by someone who claimed that it had a very much Metroid feel to it. It becomes very aparent that this is incredibly true. The isolation and exploration are two huge giveaways, and the boss fights just add to it. As a massive Metroid fan, and someone who plays games that try to replicate the Metroid-feel, I can say for sure that this is one of the games that manages to pull it off exceptionally well.\n\nESA, at least the very very early game (Pre-second boss) is a lot like the classic Metroid in that it is very unforgiving. Health is pretty sparce (as far as I know, only save stations replenish), which made each encouter much more tense because I could only afford a few hits before I was killed.\n\nThe game tells a lot through the use of color, but some parts are missing a bit of color. I found myself constantly falling in the green water (acid?) and not realizing it until my character exploded. The acid is only showing as a collection of green pixel waves at the top of the liquid. I think possibly filling in the pools with even a light, almost completely transparent green, would make them a bit more visable to the player. So far I've seen a lot of use of cool colors for the backgrounds. Dark blues, greys, purples, and blacks dominate the colors, with a bit of red accents. Most interactable machines are easy to pick out because they generally use brighter cool colors, and machines such as the save station feature a lot of contrasting red to really pop out. Walking in to an environment with a new color palette than before really adds to that exploration factor because you feel like you're finding new things, new places.\n\nThe bosses are the right amount of hard from what I found. Without doing any sort of walkthrough I could easily see myself taking no more than two tries on the bosses that I faced. You just need to take time to learn their patterns and find a way to hit them without hurting yourself.\n\nWhen I first saw the store page for this game, I noticed multiple developer announcements, many regarding patches. So I came in expecting a bit of a buggy game, but not in a bad way because it seems the developers are hard at work fixing everything they can. Great job guys. I personally only had issues with enemies being stuck in vertical 'doorways' to another level, which really just made them an easy target, and I also had some framerate issues (Intel i5 4200H, GTX 860m) occasionally, but both issues were nothing to really get upset about. I should also add that my Xbox 360 controller didn't seem to be picked up by the game, launched through Big Picture and regular mode, nothing on either. It was set to controller mode in the settings, on Windows, but again, nothing to really fuss about.\n\nI'm excited to spend a day going through this game and seeing what it has to offer, and I hope that others take the time to enjoy the mood and atmosphere that the game has to offer. As I said before, I will edit this review as needed when I complete the game.\n\nUPDATE 1 (Minor boss fight spoilers, although no specific bosses mentioned, just mechanics): I still have yet to complete the game currently I have just unlocked the teleporters. The bosses get very tough, very fast. The boss fights are all about learning the boss' paterns, but some bosses require attacking parts of the environment and even their own projectiles to defeat them, but the game does nothing really to help the player (generally environmental things turned on if they were computers, but it wasn't something pointed out). Now you could attribute this to the game's exploration factor, where you keep trying until you find the right way, but it does get a bit frustrating after a while. I have already found myself playing just until I beat the next boss, then stopping to cool down for a while, but the \"just one more boss...\" mentality does start to set in.\n\nI can't help but feel that I have completely missed some crucial health tanks though, because I have fought three or four bosses now, but have only found one health upgrade, which increased my health by a measly (yet suprisingly life-saving) four points. I cannot tell if I am completely missing them, or if the game just doesn't have very many very often, but it's been interesting fighting bosses who take almost a quarter of my health with every hit.\n\nMy review still stands though. If you enjoyed Metroid and Metroid-style games, if you enjoy exploring a world and learning through the environment, then you will enjoy ESA.\n\nI should also add that for my entire time spent in-game, controller input doesn't seem to be recognized. I use a USB wireless Xbox 360 controller reciever. I'd love to try the game out with a controller, but I am unable to.\n\nUPDATE 2: (A boss fight spoiler, and story spoiler in the last sentence, you have been warned)\nThe Serpent fight really needs to be looked at. It is incredibly inconsistant and has become quite a frustrating fight. I discovered that I missed at least one health upgrade back in the hookshot area, so fighting the boss with only 14 health is pretty rediculous, especially when I believe that I would have defeated the boss if I had had the extra four units of health. So why don't I just go back and get it? I can't. The charge shot room has all exits that don't lead to the boss completely blocked by currents. I am stuck fighting a boss that I cannot beat with the amount of health I have.\n\nThe fight has some pretty rediculous parts. The hitbox of the wave attack is very misleading near the back, and I seemed to notice that I took damage even after I was one block from the back of the wave, but this damage only happened sometimes, making it pretty hard to judge when it would and wouldn't happen. In some fights the serpent very nicely hops out of the water sprays a rediculous amount of shots, and then drops back into the water. Other fights the boss hits me once so that I take no damage temporarily, moves into the center of my character, and begins very quickly spinning, damaging me until I die. This is completely unavoidable, and seems to happen about sixty percent of the time. In a game where you learn to beat the bosses by learning their attacks and patterns through constant fight attempts, this sort of inconsistancy just doesn't belong and only ends with a frustrated player.\n\n The boss also has multiple phases. I'm all for bosses with phases, but, as the writer of 'Wot I Think' said in his ESA review, having no way to regenerate your health mid-fight makes the game much more frustrating. ESA could really benefit from small health packs that maybe restore two or four points of health, instead of relying on save stations and health stations (which there are very few of in the water area). I hate having to run back through my last five to ten minutes of progress just to recharge at a save station.\n\nRight now I'm in a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. I love Metroid, and this game reminds me so much of it. But the constant frustration from so many factors (the biggest being a constant feeling that I'm going the wrong way) limits me to around half-hour sessions that generally end with me angrilly mashing alt-f4 on the \"Continue?\" screen. I want to play this game, I really do, but I can't help but think about how frustrated I will be very soon.\n\nThe difficulty and frustration now makes me fear the sudden difficulty spike that so many players have ranted about once the AI is reactivated.", "timestamp_created": 1430200187, "timestamp_updated": 1431246587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15582997": {"recommendationid": "15582997", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994666064", "num_games_owned": 2643, "num_reviews": 545, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429637833}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Amantes de Super Metroid v\u00e3o adorar isso!\n\nEsse \u00e9 um jogo que parece um baita de um demake de Super Metroid, mas isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 ruim, \u00c9 MARAVILHOSO!

It relies on your skills since it has very few weapon upgrades and scarce health upgrades. But it presents the story in the style of Metroid Prime in the sense that it gives you a little exposition on what you are doing and why you are there but everything else is discovered throughout the world by messages left on computers and data disks. The Bosses are rather difficult at first but have a clear pattern to them and require your upgrades you find through out the game. The environments are well designed but a little cliche but excused since they are nice to look at and have great music to go with. Speaking of music, its kinda like 16 bit music but it sounds a lot better. Only complaint about the music is the fact that there isn't a download for the sound track.

I have done not much else since yesterday morning but play this game. It really is that good.\n\nI have 24 hours play time. 18 or so of those hours were a blast. At least 4 of it was being stuck in some area or another, not knowing how to proceed. And another 2 hours or so trying a boss for the 20th time. The bosses can be quite tough.\n\nAnd I'm ok with that. I like tough bosses. What I don't really care for is having to run back 2-3 screens to try again. I rage-quit more than once but kept coming back. \n\nOne particular boss appears after you activate something that causes new mobs to appear throughout the whole game. I finally beat him with 5 hp and promptly got killed on the next screen by the new mobs (that I didn't know were there now.)\n\nThis is bad. LET ME SAVE after killing a boss. Having to repeat a boss is incredibly frustrating, but I repeated it and moved on.\n\nAnd on the flip side, don't make me have to go through 3-4 screens of tricky jumps and a tough mob fight to get to a boss with no opportunity to save. This is what finally did me in on the next boss. I will not be finishing the game because I don't have the patience to keep repeating this. \n\nWith over 500 games on Steam and another 200 on my shelves dating back to the '80s, I'm not what you'd call a newb. This game kicked my ass.\n\nBut, it was still a lot of fun while it lasted, and if you are a hardcore player or they eventually add an easy mode, it's well worth the money. Even if you don't finish it, there's a lot of fun here for $8.\n\nEdit: I couldn't let it kick my ass. I did go back and finish it. Everything I said above still applies.

Many people seem to compare to this Metroid but I don't feel this is very Metroid like. For me this is more closer to Jill of the Jungle and such DOS platforms. And I really prefer those DOS games.  As a developer myself I can understand the graphical style being low low res. It is so low res because then the artist doesn't have to spend as much time drawing each sprite but can still use his or her's graphical skill well and spend more time creating more varied sprites and tiles. This is good idea if you have small team and have to share multiple jobs to one person.

Judging by how it is designed, ESA borrows heavily from Metroid Fusion/Zero Mission in style, two games which I enjoy and own. However, ESA plays more like a puzzle mixed with a \"Souls\" game when pertaining to the memorable sections like the boss fights and punishing deaths.\n\nThis is compounded by the initial weapons given to the player and after the third or so boss dealing any significant damage to bosses falls short. In addition, weapon upgrades are hard to come by, but things like the Charge Shot come in too late and feel more like keys rather than an upgrade. The Triple Shot and Supercharge module are optional, but again come in too late and, with the Supercharge module specifically, aren't worth the effort put forth to obtain them. They really should be obtained from the bosses themselves, rather than in some out of the way zone on the map. However, both are optional and aren't needed to complete the game proper, but it hurts the player to not obtain these items as boss fights are punishing without the proper equipment. \n\nIn lieu of that and a few other hiccups, like some bosses being able to hit the player during a room transition, I finished the game. In the end, I don't hate or have cause to bad mouth ESA. It's fun and enjoyable up to a point, but it falls flat and only serves to shoot itself in places where it counts. If you like the overall style and aren't bugged by the shortcomings I found, then it's a worthwhile buy.\n\n[b]Update:[/b]\n\n<Coming Soon>", "timestamp_created": 1430006146, "timestamp_updated": 1431155185, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658804", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15543902": {"recommendationid": "15543902", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989682598", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432567356}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!!

It is a game about a space station. You as the protagonist is tasked in figuring out what has happened to it and its survivors. And that's about it for the story. Quite honestly, the fact that things are like that is fine for me. Although it does seem a bit same-y in terms of the sci-fi genre, the story is placed well not only with the various logs and computer terminals that are scattered about, but the environment and the atmosphere that each unique area presents.\n\nThe gameplay is [b]good[/b], and the item progression [b]solid[/b]. It feels similar in pacing to [i]Metroid Fusion[/i], but it [b]doesn't handhold you[/b], nor are there long lengths of dialogue or exposition (okay, maybe it's more similar to [i]Zero Mission[/i]). Enemies are distinguishable and have their own behaviours. All the bosses have their own strategies so you can't simply tank damage, and each battle a challenge to defeat. Each upgrade you get feels worthwhile and rewarding.\n\nThe sound effects of this game are [b]great[/b]. From the various bits and pieces of the station that are still running, the pitter patter of water in the caves, to the heated areas that is the Volcanic Sector--all of it combined with the soundtrack brings its own feel. The soundtrack is closer to the 16-bit era of music instead of the blippy chiptune noises you get from the current nostalgia-hype of 8-bit music, and it's [b]refreshing[/b] to hear it.\n\nThere's plenty of secrets to be had even if you finish the game. It doesn't pull the move of locking you into a predefined end-game path; the world remains quite open for you to explore. Health upgrades are pretty important items to find as later bosses take more hits to kill and find more ways to damage you, but that's not the only secret hidden on this station. I thought I'd seen everything, but then another one popped up.\n\nIt might be a while before I truly can consider myself 100%ing the game, but I can say that this game is [b]great[/b], and I recommend that you [b]buy it[/b].

I almost want to beg the developer to add that.  It's a bit harrowing getting health only from Save points.  You can be in that room just before the save with 1 health and BAM, a bug touches you and you're back at your last save.  Have them drop a pellet worth even 1 health every now and then.  Please.

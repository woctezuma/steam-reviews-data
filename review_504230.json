Er f\u00f6rdert die Individualit\u00e4t des Spielers. Etwas, das jedes Spiel anstreben sollte. F\u00fcr alle, die nicht im Bilde sind: Celeste\u00b4s Entwickler haben nach der Kontroverse um Cuphead und dessen Schwierigkeitsgrad, entschieden, einen gewissen \"Assisst-Mode\" ins Spiel zu integrieren. Dieser Assisst-Mode bietet Spielern, die nicht unbedingt jede Herausforderung schaffen m\u00f6chten, die M\u00f6glichkeit sich das Leben leichter zu machen. Man kann damit die Spielgeschwindigkeit einstellen, sodass Projektile und sich bewegende Gegner sich langsamer bewegen, sich selbst unendlich viel Ausdauer verpassen, sodass man unbegrenzt an Klippen h\u00e4ngen kann, sich die Anzahl der Sprints in zwei, oder unendlich an der Zahl einstellen, oder sogar Unverwundbarkeit.\nUnd ich LIEBE \"Matt Makes Games Inc.\" f\u00fcr diese Entscheidung! Der Assisst-Mode ist das Sprachrohr der etwas schlechteren Spieler. Der Spieler, die keine Lust haben auf frustrierende Tode, die letztendlich auch Zeitverschwendung sind. Denn damit verbringt man einen gro\u00dfen Teil des Spiels: Sterben und seinen ehemaligen Fortschritt in einem Areal zu wiederholen. Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass jemand gerne stirbt. Und seien wir mal ehrlich. Das ist Zeitverschwendung. Ja, ich bin auch einer derjenigen, die sich den Assisst-Mode zunutze gemacht haben. Und ich sch\u00e4me mich nicht daf\u00fcr, denn ich WEI\u00df, dass ich gecheatet habe. Allerdings kann ich den Leser beruhigen. Ich habe das Spiel vollkommen normal und ohne Assisst-Mode beendet, doch Dinge, wie die blauen und goldenen Herzen, die goldenen Himbeeren und die erneute Suche nach Erdbeeren habe ich mit Hilfe des Assisst-Modes [i]errungen[/i]. Wer sich das antun m\u00f6chte, im Falle der goldenen Himbeeren, einen gesamten Kapitel, ohne Tod zu \u00fcberstehen, bitte sehr. Ich halte dich nicht davon ab. Nur habe [u]ich[/u] keinerlei Lust darauf. Letztendlich, so sagt es das Spiel selbst, beeindruckt man damit nur seine Freunde.\nCeleste\u00b4s Geschichte beruht auch indirekt auf der Nutzung des Assisst-Mode. Es hei\u00dft immer wieder: \"Der Berg wird die wahre Natur Madeline\u00b4s offenbaren\" und somit auch die des Spielers selbst. Nutzt man nun den Assisst-Mode, oder nicht? Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe ihn voller Desinteresse einfach mal angestellt \"K\u00f6nnte ja n\u00fctzlich sein.\", dachte ich mir. Und ich habe mich nicht get\u00e4uscht.\nAuch wenn Celeste\u00b4s Schwierigkeitsgrad hoch angehoben ist, ist es vermutlich sogar m\u00f6glich das Spiel komplett ohne Assisst-Mode zu schaffen. [u]Ich[/u] pers\u00f6nlich h\u00e4tte das wohl nicht geschafft und das hat einen ganz simplen Grund: Man kann nicht verschnaufen. Nehmen wir als Beispiel mal den \"wei\u00dfen Palast\" aus Hollow Knight. Ein recht schweres Jumpingareal auf einem Niveau, das man vom bisherigen Standpunkt des Spiels nicht gewohnt war. Man hatte im wei\u00dfen Palast, in Hollow Knight, zwar sehr schwere Jumpingpassagen, aber man konnte sie sich in sicherer Umgebung anschauen und studieren. In Celeste hingegen hat man Areale, die nicht einmal komplett auf dem Bildschirm passen. Hei\u00dft: Man spielt sich durch bis dorthin wohin man blicken konnte und muss improvisieren. Oft klappt das nicht. Also muss man die Bewegungen verinnerlichen. Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe dies oft nicht hingekriegt und verlangte sehr viel Schwei\u00df, Tr\u00e4nen und eine gewisse Belastung meiner Stimmb\u00e4nder, aber irgendwann hab ich es geschafft. Wie gesagt es ist vermutlich m\u00f6glich das Spiel ohne Assisst-Mode zu beenden, aber daf\u00fcr braucht man Nerven aus Stahl und viel Geduld, sowie Zeit.\nIch hatte dennoch sehr viel Spa\u00df mit Celeste. Haupts\u00e4chlich deshalb, da ich auf Sammlersuche gegangen bin, denn das Spiel weckt wahrlich den Sammlerdrang des Spielers. Und um alle Secrets und Collectibles zu finden muss man viel Neugierde und ein Auge f\u00fcr Details mitbringen! Ich kann es wirklich auch nur jedem ans Herz zu legen: Auch wenn man nicht wirklich eine Herausforderung in Celeste sucht, so sucht man nach Secrets! Vorzugsweise mit dem grandiosen Assisst-Mode!\n\nKommen wir f\u00fcr die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:\n\n[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]\n\n+ Der Pixelart ist wundersch\u00f6n und knallbunt! Wirklich eine Augenweide!\n+ Auch die gezeichneten comichaften Bilder sind allesamt wirklich niedlich gezeichnet worden!\n+ Celeste wird mit einem tollen Soundtrack untermalt! Es gibt sogar noch Remixes der jeweiligen Tracks.\n+ Die Soundkulisse von Celeste ist FANTASTISCH!\nHier einfach mal ein kurzes Video dazu:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMZ_jXrxQoI\n\n+ Es ist tats\u00e4chlich m\u00f6glich nach oben zu gucken! Ein Feature, dass seit Super Mario World ein Muss f\u00fcr jeden Platformer sein sollte! Selbst wenn es keinen Nutzen hat. Es f\u00fchlt sich halt einfach falsch an, wenn man nach oben dr\u00fcckt und nichts passiert... Zumindest ergeht es mir so.\n+ Sollte man sich in der Kapitelauswahl befinden und sich einen Kapitel und einen Abschnitt des Kapitels aussuchen, so ert\u00f6nt ein kurzer Ton, welcher zum Soundtrack bei der Kapitelauswahl dazu passt. Ich finde das wirklich faszinierend und man kann so ganz am\u00fcsante Eigenkompositionen erschaffen.\n+ Ich pers\u00f6nlich bin kein Freund von Absp\u00e4nnen in Videospielen. Anders als in Filmen beendet ein Abspann eine mehrst\u00fcndige epische Reise und dies ist auch in Celeste der Fall. Allerdings liebe ich es, wenn ein Spiel diese \"Wartezeit\" mich erstens vorzugsweise \u00fcberspringen l\u00e4sst, sofern der Abspann langweilig kreiert worden ist, oder, vorzugsweise, den Abspann kreativ gestaltet. Dies ist wiederrum auch in Celeste der Fall. \n\n[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]\n\n- Das Gebrabbel w\u00e4hrend der Diskussionen nervt stellenweise extrem.\n- Es gibt keine Verschnaufspausen, w\u00e4hrend der Jumppassagen. Etwas, das mich pers\u00f6nlich wirklich extrem st\u00f6rt.\n- Grafikeinstellungen sind nur sp\u00e4rlich vorhanden. Sollte jemand FPS-Einbr\u00fcche haben. Viel Gl\u00fcck. Am besten vor dem Kauf die Mindestanforderungen checken.\n- Steuerung mit dem Stick auf dem Gamepad oft ziemlich unpr\u00e4zise. Vielleicht sieht das ja mit Maus und Tastatur anders aus, aber das Spiel wirkt einfach so, als w\u00e4re es f\u00fcr ein Gamepad geboren worden.\n- Hitboxen einiger \"Stachelpflanzen\" und \"stacheliger Hindernisse\" ist manchmal nicht nachvollziehbar.\n\n[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]\n\n+- Es gibt bedauerlicherweise recht viele \u00dcbersetzungsfehler. Auch die fehlende Leerstelle zwischen zwei W\u00f6rtern l\u00e4sst sich \u00f6fters beobachten.\n+- Sollte man einen Kapitel erneut starten, so wird man wieder mit der Geschichte konfrontiert. Zwar sind alle Filmsequenzen vorspulbar, aber irgendwie nervt selbst das vorspulen.\n+- Viele Passagen k\u00f6nnen nur mit perfektem Timing \u00fcberwunden werden. Beispielsweise gibt es Wolken, dessen Funktionsweise ich zwar verstehe, aber ich kriege das Timing nie hin und das liegt daran, da man nicht das Momentum ausnutzen soll, sondern am h\u00f6chsten Punkt der springenden Wolke erst springen soll... (Leute die das Spiel noch nicht gespielt haben, wissen jetzt nicht was ich meine, aber wenn man das Spiel gespielt hat, wird sich der Schleier l\u00fcften)\n+- Das Spiel hat wirklich STARKE Probleme das Hauptmen\u00fc zu \u00f6ffnen, w\u00e4hrend man gerade an einer Klippe klettert. Probierts mal aus, das Spiel ist damit wirklich \u00fcberfordert.\n\nLetztendlich kann ich Celeste vollkommen empfehlen. Es ist zwar kein perfektes Spiel, aber meine Sucht nach Secrets und Herausforderungen wurde durchaus gestillt! Der Normalpreis von 19,99\u20ac ist durchaus empfehlenswert! Ohne den Assisst-Mode kann man allerdings bestimmt 30 bis 35 Stunden mit Respawnen besch\u00e4ftigt sein!\n\nIch danke f\u00fcrs Lesen und w\u00fcnsche sehr viel Spa\u00df beim Spielen!

This game is great to be played on a keyboard.\n\nHowever, if you're like me and you just can't get enough fun on a platform game without a controller, you'll be in for some trouble. First, you have to know this game is hard. The entire story is based around pushing your limits and discovering how far you can go. So that's cool, I like hard games.\n\nThe problem is, if a game wants to push you to your limits, they have to be [i]fair[/i]. My major problem with this game is that, on a controller, the diagonal movement was just too rough. Unless you aim your left stick perfectly at 45 degrees, you just won't get a diagonal dash. You will either get a vertical or a horizontal one, no in-between. While indie games aren't expected to have the most amazing graphics and physics, The roughness of the diagonal dashing makes most of the runs that require it too luck-based. A simple tweak on the directional control during dashes would make this game a lot more fun to be played on the controller. It just feels like they lazily adapted the keyboard buttons to a controller without testing it whatsoever. It is very frustrating to build your skill for 2h on a controller just to find out that it won't do and you have to reset your muscle memory so it works on the keyboard, from scratch.\n\nI desperately want to give this game a positive review.

It's gameplay difficulty is going steep if you play the more difficult sides of the first few chapters with only the first minutes of experience and such.

She climbs a mountain (omg spoilers oops) and breathes a whole lot.  Just some good solid platforming with enough variation to basic mechanics to keep things interesting while not overstaying its welcome.\n\nBut I will admit that sometimes I didn't have fun and it basically came down to whether I was doing a b-side chapter because those things are collectively The Devil and some areas made me want to dropkick children off of houses.  Some places in the game require a certain level of precision and timing that I simply can't perform consistently.  I could know exactly what I needed to do but my stupid fingers wouldn't be able to quite pull it off and that sort of failure leads to a level of frustration comparable to what I will describe as punching my soul in the [Strawberries].\n\nStory-wise, the game has a simple premise with a strong heart.  It leans heavily on the hero's journey template though I think it uses it well.  The characters are good and cool.\n\nThe music's really good, though I wouldn't put it in like... Undertale or Nier tier for music.  It does get very close at certain moments (like the prologue).  I like the noises that the game uses in place of voices.   Works out really well.\n\nThe UI is simple and does exactly what it needs to.  I do want to give kudos to the developers for implementing some sort of dialogue system in the game.  Unsure if it's gold plating or a feature that was mostly cut out of the game except for the one place that it's used... either way, I appreciate that it's there.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and do recommend it but with the disclaimer that it does require a certain level of manual dexterity and, due to the nature of the game, failure can be very punishing in that it can be very frustrating.",

Having said that, Celeste currently holds the record for getting me the closest.  The story is awesome, the soundtrack is god-tier, the art is very pretty, and most importantly, the gameplay is solid and satisfying while everything else is going on.  It's an experience.\nThe platforming gets really hard, but one key thing about Celeste, at least for me, is I can feel myself getting better at it with each attempt at a difficult room.  Going back through some of the earlier levels, rooms that stumped me for legitimately 15 minutes can now be completed in one attempt.  And I'm someone who generally is not very good at difficult games.  Cuphead is too much for me.  And while I've thrown my fair share of curses at Celeste and even ragequit a couple of times, I keep starting it back up and enjoying my time overall.  I've competed the main storyline (took me about 8 hours and 2199 deaths, which the game counts for you) and am currently working on the higher-difficulty B-side levels as well as getting more of the collectible strawberries that the game tucks away in tough-to-reach places.  I'm probably having more fun now than when I started.\nAnd, as I said, the story is amazing.

You're character's motivation is to climb a mountain because its a hurdle and she needs to prove something to herself that she can do it. The character motivations feel incredibly real to me, that the mountain exists to be conquered, and while it is easier to give up because the task is daunting, accomplishing the feat is a reward on its own. \n\nCeleste features high quality platforming and very original designs when approaching each segment. The controls are simple but the challenges are numerous and the environment makes the game fun. I cannot sing the game's praise enough. Namely because I haven't found a game that really resonates with myself for a deep need to conquer something if only to say that you did it. \n\nAs a challenge goes, the game offers a core story path, and additional optional challenges and challenge levels that up the difficulty if needed. I wont say that going straight to the goal is particularly tough or easy if you dont collect strawberries, but the strawberry collectibles make some easy segments much harder, and while they don't really do anything they are fun to search for. There are B side levels to each of the main levels you can play. I can only say that I both love and hate the developers for the hell that they created in those levels. Every death is a learning experience and the levels are very completable, but you measure progress in baby steps. Its frustrating, but eventually you overcome the hurdles to achieve your goals. Its hard to explain, but it feels like raw satisfaction to overcome the challenges you face. \n\n\nThere are times that I feel like giving up when I am doing a challenging segment, but I take a pause, a deep breath, and verbally tell myself \"I am capable of doing this\" and I resume. The main character is adorable and relatable on so many levels as to why she is conquering the Mountain. I can only sing the developer's praise for creating such a lovely masterpiece with motivations so simple to evoke such a complicated emotional response in me. \n\nI highly recommend Celeste as a beautiful game, with compelling characters, great level design and mechanics, snappy and responsive controls, great music, and honestly I feel like there is more to love about this game. Its a simple platformer, but you must learn to be tenacious to reach the end. Its a solid 9/10 (personally 10/10).\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520965578, "timestamp_updated": 1520965578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504405", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40791681": {"recommendationid": "40791681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243788790", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 797, "last_played": 1521222870}, "language": "english", "review": "its a really great and challenging game and even gives you a mode where you can slow down the game or get more than 1-2 dashes for those who really arent good at platformers or just dont get any further. so if you like games like well \"super meat boy\" or \"you have to win the game\" then this is perfect for you ! there are plenty of secret ways to be found and collectibles to be collected !", "timestamp_created": 1520960938, "timestamp_updated": 1520960938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40788795": {"recommendationid": "40788795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003895814", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 544, "last_played": 1521202882}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubc8c\uc368 1000\ub370\uc2a4 \ucc0d\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uac13\uac9c\uc774\uc5d0\uc694.\n\n\ubaa8\ub450 \uc0ac\uc11c \uace0\ud1b5\uc744 \ub290\uaef4\ubcf4\uc544\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1520952268, "timestamp_updated": 1520952268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40788211": {"recommendationid": "40788211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125735811", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "last_played": 1521536607}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub098\ub984 \uad1c\ucc2e\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d,\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac,\uce90\ub9ad\ud130,\uc77c\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\uc874\ub098 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4..\n\uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \uc5f4\uc2ec\ud788 \ud558\ub2e4\ubcf4\uba74 \uae70\uc218\uc788\uc9c0\uc54a\uc744\uae4c?\n", "timestamp_created": 1520950723, "timestamp_updated": 1520950723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40786483": {"recommendationid": "40786483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162012556", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 145, "last_played": 1521694160}, "language": "schinese", "review": "IGN\u8bc4\u520610\u5206\u7684\u795e\u4f5c\uff0c\u60a8\u8bf4\u5462\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1520945556, "timestamp_updated": 1520945556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40777221": {"recommendationid": "40777221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317662768", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 349, "last_played": 1521116897}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96be\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5341\u5206\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u5c31\u7b97\u662f\u624b\u6b8b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4eab\u53d7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e5f\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u6ca1\u6709\u90a3\u4e48\u5f3a\u7684\u538c\u6076\u611f\n[spoiler]\u9664\u4e86\u67d0\u5173c\u9762\u3002\u3002\u3002[/spoiler]\n\u5267\u60c5\u4e0a\u4e5f\u633a\u52b1\u5fd7\u7684\n[spoiler]\u83dc\u9e21\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f1a\u6709\u6781\u5f3a\u7684\u4ee3\u5165\u611f[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1520903781, "timestamp_updated": 1520903781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40775378": {"recommendationid": "40775378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030125340", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 644, "last_played": 1521336497}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun platformer reminiscent of Super Meat Boy, albeit with much less of a vindictive spirit.

The soundtrack for this game is incredible and one I am listening to at this very moment, probably while you are reading this too.\n\nOverall, Celeste is an incredible game that everyone should at least try to play once if not more. An incredible experience that I had no idea I needed in my life so much and one that I will forever love throughout my career in gaming. 10/10 would speedrun again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1520820863, "timestamp_updated": 1520820863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40755872": {"recommendationid": "40755872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349318408", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "last_played": 1521157537}, "language": "english", "review": "Best platfomer", "timestamp_created": 1520817461, "timestamp_updated": 1520817461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40753583": {"recommendationid": "40753583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037915942", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 269, "last_played": 1520807585}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck this game", "timestamp_created": 1520808039, "timestamp_updated": 1520808039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40748175": {"recommendationid": "40748175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198446458013", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 446, "last_played": 1521690436}, "language": "english", "review": "I just buy the game today.I download the game but I cant launch it.

It is very symbolic.\n\nIt will challenge you enough to make you want to quit, but the reward of overcoming such an obstacle is enough to fuel your adrenaline rush. I'm only just now getting involved in the B sides, and while I know that the C sides will make me want to die, I am fully ready and willing to take that risk.\n\nThe score is beautiful.

Heartwarming, heartfel, painful, yet encouraging...I lost count of the emotions running through me when I was playing this game through for the first time. \n\nPlease, do yourself a favor. Play this game. It helped me contextualize my own emotional issues and really put them in prespective in terms of what is important in my own life, what isn't important, what needs to be cut out, and ultimately, helping me come to terms with my own emotional issues as a whole.\n\nI proudly gave this game a 5 in my review on Youtube. I encourage anyone who hasn't played this to stop what they're doing and to play this game.  \n\nIf you're interested in my review, you can check it out here. I don't usually post links in these types of things because I feel like it sort of taboo, but I want to spread the word about this wonderful video game.\n\nYou can find my review by heading to my channel.

I have decided to deviate from my standard template to give a special review on this very special game. At its essence, [i]Celeste[/i] is a [b]story-driven[/b], [b]challenging[/b] [b]puzzle platformer[/b], and I'd like to break down each element of this characterization to give a full picture of what this game is about.\n\n[h1]Story-driven[/h1]\n[i]Celeste[/i] is deep. You play as Madeline, a young girl suffering from depression as she struggles to find her life's purpose. Temporarily leaving her fears and worries behind, Madeline sets out to climb Celeste Mountain, as she feels that reaching the summit will provide her a sense of accomplishment and direction. However, unbeknownst to Madeline, Celeste has the power to reveal people's true natures, and Madeline will have to confront and conquer her inner demons to reach the top.\n\nWhat makes [i]Celeste[/i] so brilliant is the analogy it draws between Madeline and the player, both of which have embarked on a journey in which their spirit and perserverance will be put into question. But more on that in the next section.\n\n[h1]Challenging[/h1]\nYou should probably know that [i]Celeste[/i] is a difficult game. Fitting well with its story and theme, your skills, patience and determination will be put to the test. You will die a LOT. However, everything in [i]Celeste[/i] is completely achieveable, with quick respawns and forgiving checkpoints that encourage attempt after attempt.\n\nThe game is well tailored to fit multiple skill levels. The main game, while tough in its own right, should take the average gamer roughly 5-7 hours to complete. For those willing to challenge themselves, there are optional collectable strawberries throughout the game that require more from you to obtain. For those who want to go further, each stage has a \"B-Side\" that will kick your ass. And if that still wasn't enough, there's a little something extra for the most determined players. On the flip side, assist options are available to help ease the difficulty if needed, though I highly encourage playing without them.\n\n[h1]Puzzle Platformer[/h1]\nSo why is this a puzzle game? [i]Celeste[/i] is more than just jumping from platform to platform; each room has been carefully crafted with a definite intended solution that, more often than not, isn't immediately obvious. Beating this game requires complete understanding of its many mechanics and how they interact with each other... and some trial and error. If you're having a hard time completing a stage, you're probably not doing the proper sequence of movements. I feel that this aspect of [i]Celeste[/i] separates it from many other platformers, leading to a wonderfully unique experience.\n\nAnd for those who are interested, there is plenty of speed-running support built in. The game will keep track of your fastest time and fewest deaths for each individual stage, as well as each complete run of the game. There's also a basic in-game clock so you can keep track of your run while playing.\n\n[h1] My Personal Opinion (Recommendation Reflects This) [/h1]\nIf it wasn't obvious, I can't recommend this game enough. Intense puzzle action platformer with tight controls, excellent music, and a great theme. What more could you ask for?

The story was executed well, and includes one of my favorite twists to a formula I've seen, but, despite it being a large part of why I love Celeste, I feel like I should let people experience it for themselves.\n\nGameplay wise, you're climbing a mountain, armed with a jump, limited wallclimb, walljump, and a dash. Some of the harder levels are comparable to a Super Meat Boy level, but none of them are required. The use of the dash and the exact movement mechanics make the game less about momentum and more about agency, which I feel reflects the story very well. It also means that certain jumps will require more control than setup, and it can require more skill than SMB at times. It plays decently fast, but not too fast for you to require special knowledge at any point, so there is no memorization. Most of the challenge comes from secret B-Side levels, so casual audiences can still play the game. Still, if it is too challenging, there is an assist mode, where you can change how you play the game to help with your problems. You can slow down the speed, give yourself extra dashes, and some other features I don't remember. \n\nAll things considered, there isn't much of a barrier to entry in Celeste, so there is no reason to not play the main story at least once.", "timestamp_created": 1520706310, "timestamp_updated": 1520706310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40717352": {"recommendationid": "40717352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160546209", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1729, "last_played": 1521712147}, "language": "english", "review": "The overwhelmingly positive reviews speak for themself, and I couldn't be happier that this game got the recognition it deserves.

Everything is great and polished (nintendo grade). The pixel GFX are beautiful, I mean _really_ beautifull for pixel GFX. The music conveys the peculiar atmospheres of each level, not to mention the quality of sound effects. The background story unfolding is so good, you will get attached to the characters.

I died around 9500 times by the end of the game.\n+ Level design is just perfect. Each room in each chapter is unique, you'll never see a room that feels similar to another. I also love how most rooms are small -- this is a pro because you'll die a LOT in some rooms, so by making each room small it makes the experience way more worthwhile than in a level like in SMB for example. You can beat a level faster, but the difficulty is scaled up a notch when you go from chapter to chapter.\n+ The soundtrack is just beautiful on every level. One of the very few soundtracks I'd actually consider buying.\n+ Tight controls & game mechanics. I really loved how the game handled each movement in a perfect way. The controls are just as tight as Hollow Knight's and Ori and the Blind Forest's. \n+ Pretty graphics. Pixelated graphics that just look stunning. \n+ Adding the strawberries as a side challenge was a great idea. Perfect for completionists and players looking for an extra challenge.\n+ The story was alright. I grabbed this game thinking it wouldn't even have a story at all. More on this below.\n~ Underwhelming ending. I won't spoil it, but it was certainly underwhelming to me. They did a great buildup of each character, but it didn't unveil correctly in the end. \n- Absolute lack of story on the extra levels (b-sides/c-sides). This killed one of my expectations when I finished all the extra levels. Those are the hardest levels in the game, one can easily make an experienced player be stuck during one or two hours throughout it, and for there not to be any story development at the end is a punch to the gut. I only saw two extra levels with some dialogue: [spoiler] b and c-side of chapter 7 [/spoiler]\n\nOverall this is a great game. Don't get it if you get angry easily or can't tolerate dying many times. This game will test your patience and plataforming ability. Other than that I definitely recommend it for plataformer enthusiasts. \n", "timestamp_created": 1520633877, "timestamp_updated": 1520633877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40689647": {"recommendationid": "40689647", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971311882", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1520763327}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing.

I haven't felt that rush for a long time.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520619774, "timestamp_updated": 1520619774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40688014": {"recommendationid": "40688014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069997743", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 994, "last_played": 1521287773}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u6b3e\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u80fd\u505a\u6210\u8fd9\u4e48\u60ca\u8273\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u60f3\u4e0d\u5230\u3002\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f53\u9a8c\u5341\u5206\u6d41\u7545\uff0c\u7528\u952e\u76d8\u73a9\u4e5f\u5f88\u8212\u670d\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4f18\u7f8e\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e5f\u6b7b\u7684\u5f88\u5f00\u5fc3\u3002\n\n\u771f\u7684\u662f\u592a\u9177\u4e86\uff0c\u592a\u7f8e\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1520615755, "timestamp_updated": 1520616065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40687620": {"recommendationid": "40687620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096465427", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520614936}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ec0\u4e48\u53eb\u5e73\u53f0\u8df3\u8dc3\uff1f\n\u8fd9\u5c31\u53eb\u5e73\u53f0\u8df3\u8dc3\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1520614854, "timestamp_updated": 1520614854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40685646": {"recommendationid": "40685646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396982863", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 399, "last_played": 1520689594}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u96be\u5ea6 \u9002\u4e2d\uff1aD", "timestamp_created": 1520610003, "timestamp_updated": 1520610003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40684675": {"recommendationid": "40684675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262687569", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2297, "last_played": 1521640826}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\uc774\uc6cc\ub108\ube44\uc5b4\ubcf4\uc2dc, the end is nigh, \uc288\ud37c\ubbf8\ud2b8\ubcf4\uc774 \n\n\uc774\ub7f0 \uac1c \ub625\uac9c \ud50c\ub798\ud3ec\uba38\uac8c\uc784\ub4e4\uc744 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uace0 \ub2e8\ub514 \uc900\ube44\ud588\ub294\ub370 \uadf8\uc815\ub3c4\ub294 \uc544\ub2c8\uc5c8\ub2e4.\n\uc544\ub2c8 \uac13\uac9c\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud558\uae30 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ub808\ubca8\ub514\uc790\uc778\uacfc \ubcfc\ub968\uc740 \uac10\ud0c4\ud558\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud588\ub2e4.\n\nrpg\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ud50c\ub798\ud3ec\uba38 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7f0 \ub808\ubca8\ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud588\ub2e4\ub294\uac74 \uac8c\uc784\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uba87\ubc88\uc774\ub098 \uac10\ud0c4\ud588\uc74c \u3147\u3147\n\n\ud2b9\ud788 A-side\uc758 \ub77c\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uacfc B-side\uc758 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc720\uc800\ub4e4\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud560\uac70\uac19\ub2e4.\n\n9.5/10 \ucd94\ucc9c", "timestamp_created": 1520607908, "timestamp_updated": 1520607908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40679731": {"recommendationid": "40679731", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970826061", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1416, "last_played": 1521216432}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai pass\u00e9 deux heures \u00e0 y jouer.

It tackles these topics with care and finesse, and you can tell that they knew what they were talking about, probably from personal experience. The characters are flawed, but very relatable and charming, and you want to help them succeed.\n\nAdd the tight controls and lots of variety to the platforming gameplay, and you have an excellent game backed up by a great soundtrack.

While the game itself is not easy for the casual gamer, its painstaking challenge repressents the character's internal struggle to come to peace with their inner demons. Celeste isn't a game that pokes fun at your mistakes as a player (unlike some other mountain climbing games *cough*), but rather tries to have you learn and grow from them. Although it's difficult, you'll see that it is SUPPOSED to be hard. And if the game is really too difficult for you, there is an Assit Mode to help you out.\n\nBesides the difficulty, the game provides an interesting experience. Most of the level mechanics were fun to deal with in their own ways, although a few were annoying (mostly thinking of the wind and clouds because they were finnicky to control imo). I found myself wanting to go back and take on the previous challenges too hard for me to make before, so the replayability is definitely there. Along with the tight gameplay, the small cast of characters in Celeste gives the game more character and life overall. While the story is sort of vague, you slowly but surely can understand the plot of the game. Honestly, I wish the story had a kick of something more, but I can understand why the creators left it as is.\n\nOverall, would I recommend Celeste to someone looking for a challenge?

The controls are smooth, especially considering the machine i'm running on. The story was good for this kind of game.\n\nThe eh : it doesn't...bring that much new to the table? It's a nitpick really, because while mechanically all that Celeste does has been done before, Celeste brings together for a really good platforming experience.\n\nThe ugly :\n- The ledge dropping is wonky. like, really wonky, counterintuitive. This might be a personal nitpick but ledgedropping was always a matter of chance for me, never managed to get it precisely. Maybe i'm not good enough, but such a simple mechanic shouldn't require skill.\n- The level design truly fails on one big point : viewing the whole level when it's too big. Now, this isn't often a problem in other platformers, but this one knows it can be one and gives you the option to look ahead with some \"fixed binocular\" thingies to spot traps or think on complicated areas before attempting them. The problem is that those binoculars are poorly placed, very often there in long but intuitive, trapless levels, and absent in complicated, full of choke point ones. Knowing that the mechanic could be there but isn't is even more infuriating that not having ever had the \"look ahead\" possibility.\n- The overarching, zone design, fails on another big point, and all because of one thing : there are one way ledges that stop you from going backwards in a zone. This is a problem with exploring : you often will explore, take one path that stops you from seeing what is in the other path.

Il gioco di per se \u00e8 estremamente semplice nelle meccaniche (ed \u00e8 chiaramente ispirato al sempreverde Super Meat Boy nel sistema di movimento-controllo), e su questo non ci piove: strutturalmente parlando infatti il gioco \u00e8 estremamente semplice come controlli e come gameplay, e oltre al classico tasto per saltare e per sprintare, con la pressione del trigger sinistro, potremo anche aggrapparci alle parete e scalarle (ma non potremo scalare le pareti all'infinito, a meno che non rimaniamo fermi immobili). La progressione diverr\u00e0, livello dopo livello, sempre pi\u00f9 difficile, con schemi sempre pi\u00f9 complicati, ma mai troppo frustranti: la difficolt\u00e0 \u00e8 sicuramente tarata verso l'alto, ma non \u00e8 frustrante, e tende ad accompagnare il giocatore cos\u00ec da aiutarlo a prender mano con il mondo di gioco; il trial and error \u00e8 alla base di [i] Celeste\t[/i], quindi aspettatevi di morire tante, tantissime volte (anche pi\u00f9 di un migliaio), ma non sar\u00e0 mai eccessivamente pesante, e vi invoglier\u00e0 a migliorare le vostra abilit\u00e0 e a correggere, salto dopo salto, ogni minimo errore. \nE fin qui tutto  ok, descritto cos\u00ec questo gioco sembrerebbe un platform di qualit\u00e0 \"standard\", niente di cos\u00ec eccezionale, direte voi. Ed in parte \u00e8 vero, ma questo gioco in realt\u00e0 ha dalla sua una delle art direction migliori che io abbia mai visto in un gioco di questo calibro. \nMadeline, la nostra protagonista, dovr\u00e0 scalare una vetta per molti insormontabile, il monte Celeste, attraverso un lungo percorso che la porter\u00e0 a conoscere nuove persone...E sopratutto, se stessa: la montagna infatti ha il \"potere\" di rivelare il vero te stesso, portando quindi la nostra eroina a compiere un viaggio ancora pi\u00f9 difficile per riuscire ad uscire dall'oscurit\u00e0 (oscurit\u00e0 rappresentata da una malattia, ma non andr\u00f2 oltre..). La narrazione va a pari passo con gli umori di Madeline, con momenti spensierati raccontati con una dolcezza e una famigliarit\u00e0 unici e momenti drammatici e cupi, volti a rappresentare le sofferenze della protagonista. La soundtrack poi \u00e8 perfetta, ogni traccia \u00e8 perfettamente adatta ad ogni contesto e livello. Graficamente poi la pixel art \u00e8 bellissima, mentre le tavole che rappresentano i personaggi sono molto simili ai volti disegnati dal famoso Bryan Lee O'Malley, celebre fumettista americano autore di Scott Pilgrim vs The World. \nUna vera e propria perla che va assolutamente vissuta, che sapr\u00e0 unire chi cerca un gioco dallo storytelling profondo e chi cerca una sfida appagante ed impegnativa (grazie anche ai livelli bonus e ai numerosi collezionabili presenti nel titolo).

Its similar to SMB and other platfomers where you can grab ledges, double and even triple jump, filled with hidden secrets and collectibles for you to find that unlock additional challenges called B-Sides. Also you'll need to find at least 4 hearts to be able to progress to the final chapter which is insane in difficulty though not really necesary since the story ends before it. \n\nThe story is basically conquering your fears and emotions in the face of challenge, which in this case is climbing the mountain and facing different challenges. There is some mystery throught the game though its clear from the start where this was going. Dont expect some amazing detailed written plot, its not about that. \n\nAtmosphere, though pixelated which I would've preffered a more modern take, is still pretty good to look at. There are some really nice places you'll go through, from a Hotel to a mysterios temple, and some other not so good looking environments but decent overall. \n\nThe soundtrack is one of the best parts of the game and if you loved Super Meat Boy's style of soundtrack, then this is similar to it. You'll need to listen to it to understand/experience how it fits so well with the game. it truly adds to the quality of the game.\n\nOverall its a near perfect platformer, a game I would recommend regardless of price and a contender for 2018's GOTY awards. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1520428187, "timestamp_updated": 1520428187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555940", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40625041": {"recommendationid": "40625041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074801643", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1552, "last_played": 1520798973}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1520409029, "timestamp_updated": 1520409029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40624425": {"recommendationid": "40624425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102158363", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 245, "last_played": 1521630202}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u884c\uff0c\u96be\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e0a\u624b\uff0c\u6253\u5230\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u4e5f\u5c31\u6b7b\u4e863000\u6765\u6b21\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520405927, "timestamp_updated": 1520405927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40623770": {"recommendationid": "40623770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167086614", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 679, "last_played": 1521695166}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5404\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u662f\u6ee1\u5206\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u5c01\u795e\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u662f\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520402793, "timestamp_updated": 1521621746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40623686": {"recommendationid": "40623686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076477206", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520402221}, "language": "schinese", "review": "25\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e867500\u6b21\u901a\u5173\u7684ABC\u9762\uff0c\u7eaa\u5ff5\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u4e86\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adfIGN\u6d4b\u8bc4\u6ee1\u5206\uff0c\u548cI WANNA\u6bd4\u8d77\u6765\u753b\u9762\u66f4\u6f02\u4eae\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u4e5f\u5f88\u597d\u542c\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u6ca1\u6709\u7a81\u5982\u5176\u6765\u7684\u9677\u9631\u3002\u6b7b\u4ea1\u540eBGM\u4e0d\u91cd\u7f6e\u66f4\u662f\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u6296M\u73a9\u5bb6\u5343\u4e07\u4e0d\u8981\u9519\u8fc7\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520402490, "timestamp_updated": 1520402490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40623143": {"recommendationid": "40623143", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965982733", "num_games_owned": 810, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 432, "last_played": 1521509934}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is nothing short of a masterpiece.\n\nThe visual style is beautiful, retro enough to be nostalgic but highly artistic.\n\nThe controls are tight and reward precision, without feeling oppressive like many platformers do.

A word on the extra content: Its fantastic but not for everyone. The strawberries are wonderful challenges that I highly suggest going after.

Not only because it was less difficult, but it was far more cohesive and didn't feel like a chore to get beyond every section.  Not to mention, I felt that the A-sides built off of each other, whereas the B-sides felt more like trial and error toward the later parts, and the C-sides were just hell on Earth. \n\nBeing the completionist I am, I felt myself getting frustrated at times due to a \"what the hell do they want me to do exactly\" mechanic, but once I figured it out, it became progressively easier.  Like on Chapter 5, where you are carrying Theo on the B-sides, I didn't know you could wall jump while holding the crystal above your head, so I died countless times in frustration before I finally realized this was possible. (It is very counterintuitive).  Overall, I would recommend the game if you like challenging platformers, but there is some wonky directional controls at times when exiting bubbles and air-jetting, where you swore that you were holding that directional button, just to find that it propelled you in a direction unintended.\n\nOverall, I'll give the game an 8.3/10, not my favorite platformer of all time, but it did have an enchanting story and certainly scratched an itch for a difficult platformer.

Some unlockables give harder levels which in turn give you something to show off to your friends.\n\nThe graphics style fits in with the gameplay pretty well. I don't think I ever saw an asset in the game and said to myself \"Well, that doesn't fit here.\" The developers actually make the pixel style look better by adding neat weather effects or coloring. There's also various mechanics that shine on their own and even similar mechanics feel unique in their own right.\n\nIf I had to say something negative about this game, it would be that I don't have notches on my controller, so it was annoying when I would dash in a cardinal direction instead of diagonally. That was more my fault than anything, and when I used the d-pad, I would nail it every time. Just need to pay more attention to where my stick is when I'm dashing.\n\nAnyway, great game.

There usually isn't a lot to comment about except for the level design and in some cases its soundtrack. Celeste brings in a new element to the genre by adding a rather emotional and compelling storyline centered of-course around the main character and protaganist Madeline.\n\nThe story is not for everyone, as is with all games. But even if you are not the kind of person to play a game for its story, Celeste presents, what is in my opinion, *the* best platformer experience available on the market right now. There are the main storyline levels which also contains a handful of secrets as well as present some level of challenge to the experienced platformed. Then there are the B-Side levels, these levels are unlockable ones that present a very much harder version of the storyline levels and an incredibly fine-tuned level design and a revamped soundtrack fitting for the current progress along the main storyline.\n\nThe soundtrack overall is absolutely glorious to say the least, subjectively speaking one of my favorite ones out there. Of-course it's not a full on Dark Souls orchestra, but that would not fine this game regardless.\n\nAs for the storyline, I would never have expected this kind of emotional attachment to a character in a pixelated platformer such as Celeste and in my opinion, even disregarding the absolutely amazing level design. The story and character development would be enough for me to recommend this game to anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, as we don't disregard that level design; this game is an absolutely well-polished masterpiece. If you're reading reviews right now to decide whether or not you want to purchase the game and you happen to come across my review I have but a simple few words for you: Buy this game, it's worth twice what they're asking for.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1520054378, "timestamp_updated": 1520054378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40524951": {"recommendationid": "40524951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089649554", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520138546}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u771f\u7684\u662f\u5341\u5206\u4f18\u79c0~\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1520048721, "timestamp_updated": 1520048721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40524741": {"recommendationid": "40524741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287980564", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520136046}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\n\n\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u7684\u624b\u67c4\u8001\u662f\u5206\u4e0d\u6e05\u524d\u51b2\u4e0a\u51b2\u548c\u659c\u51b2\uff1f\uff08\u6012\u7838\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1520047885, "timestamp_updated": 1520047885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40523240": {"recommendationid": "40523240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283483896", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1521236428}, "language": "spanish", "review": "pfff banda sonora 10/10.

The main character almost perfectly matched the feelings I have, self worth and all, so climbing this mere mountain wasn't just a game to pass the time, it was an experience, and a lesson that I can take home and learn from, even if I am still having trouble taking the first step of making myself better.\n\nEven if you aren't a fan of hard/Super Meat Boy-esque platformers, I still believe you should try the game out for an hour or two.", "timestamp_created": 1519936597, "timestamp_updated": 1519936597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40494929": {"recommendationid": "40494929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032899401", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1110, "last_played": 1521602494}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \ub193\uccd0\uc120 \uc548\ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \uc131\ucde8\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \uac8c\uc784.", "timestamp_created": 1519934491, "timestamp_updated": 1521601892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40490587": {"recommendationid": "40490587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321385080", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1521475019}, "language": "english", "review": "Story/lore:\nYou're a girl called madeline and all you have to do is to reach the summit of mount Celeste\n\nPros:\n+Amazing Gameplay\n+Gorgeously pixel art\n+Amazing soundtrack\n+Memorable characters\n+Well made story\n+Balanced Difficulty\n+So many game references\n\nCons:\nnone\n\nVerdict: 10/10\nCeleste is without a doubt the most beautiful game on steam i've ever found.

The mechanics were not only brilliant, but unlike other games I never felt like I was wrestling with  the game's mechanics or UI, it all felt so smooth and polished, and even though rage games aren't anything new, this game was made to perfection. There was rarely anything or any time I felt \u201coh I can't do such and such because of stupid game\u201d. In a nutshell, you get a jump, a dash, the ability to climb walls and various things like falling blocks and springs, and all of it feels amazing to use.\n\nAs well as this, other aspects like art, story and music are good as well. The well-told story, although a sad one, was also a hopefully one, and I loved all the characters to an incredible degree. The music was also really good but also fitting. Things like how the B&C side themes seem to understand that I am failing a lot and don't annoy me almost ever. My favourite tracks were Golden Ridge B Golden Feather Mix and Summit A \u201cReach for the Summit\u201d. The art is very pretty and although there is a mixture of like three different art styles they never seemed to fight with each other and they flowed very well. Everything just looks so smooth, especially the main character's movements.\n\nThe main thing this game did well though was how it made things that should annoy the hell out of me extremely fun. The main culprits for this are level design, art and music. Even though its genre is \u201crage game\u201d I did anything but rage when playing. (except for one stupid part in Summit B). For almost all of it, no matter how many times I tried a level I would still be enjoying myself, and when I finally beat it I wouldn't think \u201cfinally got that shit over with\u201d but more \u201cdamn that was fun, let's do it again!\u201d.  On the same note, Some aspects of this game, namely wind levels, I just avoid and hate. When I first did Golden Ridge I thought \u201cgddmt there's a wind level..\u201d but then 10 seconds later I was already enjoying it.\n\nSo in a sentence, Celeste is like other games of its genre, but better, and with an incredible amount of polish.\n\nP.S. There are, as we all know, two painfully awful parts of Celeste. The bit in Summit B where you have to use the cloud to jump through the spikes then dash the other way and back again, but mostly the bit where the game ends. Celeste handles this bit very well, considering its high replayability and the fact that it took me 26hrs to complete the main game, but it's still annoying.\n\nSo my suggestion is having a level editor like Geometry Dash where people can make their own levels then post them up online for other people to play. Hopefully some people would make some very cool levels for others to have fun with. Celeste is already absolute 10/10, but if you make this a feature I will love you forever, and on the same scale it will be at least  15 (as long as it doesn't just fill with mario maker esque bullshit which hopefully it won't).", "timestamp_created": 1519901469, "timestamp_updated": 1520024955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40482062": {"recommendationid": "40482062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031205864", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519894149}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start by saying I think the first part of the game is great and well done. The challenges are fun and mostly fair and there's a good sense of satisfaction when you first get through there.\n\nI think the game has some large problems later in the so called B-sides (the harder versions of the levels) that you can unlock.\n\nThe main thing is that skill becomes secondary to actually getting through a level. What I mean with skill is as set of inputs you can learn to do and pull off consistently. Stuff that may be hard at the start, but once you get used to it you get better and you can use that learned behaviour to get through levels more easily and consistently.\nNow the problem is that the levels demand such high levels of precision I don't think any human can pull that off consistently based on learning to do the inputs precisely enough. Stuff like 2-5 pixels worth or error margin when jumping/landing. Timings that are within 2-5 frames (assuming 60 fps). This is simply not stuff you can learn to do.\n\nSo the only way to get through a levels is by repetition, because at some point you'll have the muscle memory built up and you know ahead what is coming and then sooner or later you get lucky enough that you get through. And while you DO need a certain minimum level of skill, it's mostly just muscle memory and luck at that point. This is also obvious by the fact that once you DO get through a section the next section is not gonna be easier (because you didn't learn anything or got any better in any significant way)\n\nThe difference is also one in how you feel when you get through a section. Half the time it's \"ugh, thank god I don't have to do THIS again\". Whereas if you feel you mastered a new set of movement skills it feels great and like an accomplishment.\n\nNow that's NOT to say the whole B-Sides are like that, it's about half and half when it comes to skill based challenges vs repetition/muscle memory based challenges. So overall you can still enjoy it, jsut expect there to be really annoying frustrating parts regularly as well.\n\nAlso the IDEAS of the challenges are often great. Because part of getting through a level is also figuring out what you need to do, which is cool. It's just that the demanded execution is just a bit too tight to be enjoyable (or fair for that matter, unless you aim at making a game for robots who CAN input frame exact button presses).\n\nThere's also the occasional \"gotcha\" parts, where you just run into things you can't foresee or react to, which is also very frustrating, especially after doing an already difficult section, getting through it for the first time only to find yourself dying to something you can't possibly react to.\n\nNow death isn't that harsh here, since your estart at the same screen, but trust me after doing the same 10 second section 30 times it will still get annoying to die to stuff that isn't really your fault.\n\nBut anyway, I'd still say the A sides are awesome and well worth playing. B-Sides, might still be fun, if you enjoy that kinda stuff, I just figured I give a fair warning for people who like to complete everything (Oh and there's C-sides too, good luck with that lol)",

But this game is special.\n\nAs a big fan of pixelesque 2d platformers and rogue-lite dungeonexplorers this game fit my taste pretty well to begin with. that is what piqued my interest to buy it in the first place. \n\nWhile playing it though, I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of this story. the game introduces several characters and these characters really start to get to you personally. Some aspects of this game actually hit close to home for me as it actually made me emotional at times. when you feel that a story is important for you to enjoy a  game, then by all means, give this game a shot.\n\nThe gameplay is great. When I say that I died 1,700-ish times before completing the story you might not think this game is very inviting. (mind you, i have to rerun several levels being the completionist that I am) But, the continu\u00efty of this game really \"eases\" the pain and annoyance of dying. You respawn fast, there are a lot of checkpoints, there is no unneccisary gore involved(not that i don't like gore) and the background music keeps playing. All this, makes dying not so much of a hassle. you just try again, and again. until you get it right. And boy, when you do get it right it is so very fulfilling.\n\nThe controls can be a little confusing at first, but 10 minutes into the game you should be getting used to it. I read another review recommending a controller. I have to say that this game is perfectly playable with a keyboard, and my recommended settings are:\nW-up\nA-left\nS-down\nD-right\n\nJ-jump\nK-Dash\nL-Hold (for climbing)\n\nbasicly these are the same controls the game has as standard, but then swapped around so that your left hand controls the directional movement instead of the right hand. \n\nSpecial shoutout for the background music and soundeffects. Damn. \nThe great soundtracks really help make this game so much more immersive. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1519855434, "timestamp_updated": 1519855434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40471261": {"recommendationid": "40471261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417820496", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519831976}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr mich eines der besten Spiele, die ich bis jetzt gespielt habe!\n-Super Grafik\n-Tolle Story\n-Anspruchsvolles Gameplay,was aber nie unfair wird und richtig viel Spa\u00df macht.\n-Extrem hohe Abwechslung in den Leveln", "timestamp_created": 1519851613, "timestamp_updated": 1519851613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40468120": {"recommendationid": "40468120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096224947", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1521235223}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00e9 massa", "timestamp_created": 1519843164, "timestamp_updated": 1519843164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40467579": {"recommendationid": "40467579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054880309", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519933902}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u043b\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440.", "timestamp_created": 1519841747, "timestamp_updated": 1519841747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40466412": {"recommendationid": "40466412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346375167", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "last_played": 1520825673}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e5f\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u4e2a.....\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u597d\u7684\u952e\u76d8\u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u4e0b", "timestamp_created": 1519838673, "timestamp_updated": 1519838673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40465892": {"recommendationid": "40465892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054936854", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520858447}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u548c\u6e05\u723d\u7684Chiptune\u914d\u4e50\u3002\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u5173\u5361\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5f53\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7a0d\u6709\u4e0d\u614e\u5c31\u4f1a\u8dcc\u5165\u6df1\u6e0a\uff0c\u5374\u53c8\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0d\u5931\u575a\u6301\u6311\u6218\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u300210/10\u3002\nB-side\u5173\u5361\u771f\u4ed6\u5988\u7684\u96be\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1519837216, "timestamp_updated": 1519837216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40465370": {"recommendationid": "40465370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011037049", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 662, "last_played": 1520941384}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5341\u5206\u68d2\uff0c\u624b\u611f\u5341\u5206\u723d\u5feb\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u4e00\u70b9\u6211\u60f3\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7206\u7c97\u53e3\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u662f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6293\u5899\u8981\u6309\u4e00\u4e2a\u952e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1f\u5929\u5802\u7684\u5723\u5c4e\u554a\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u591a\u5c11\u6b21\u60f3\u7740\u722c\u5899\u5782\u76f4\u8df3\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u6309\u7740\u722c\u5899\u952e\u98de\u51fa\u53bb\u4e86\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u8fde\u51b2\u523a\u90fd\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u5730\u6309\u7740\u722c\u5899\u952e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e48\u53cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7edd\u4e86\u3002\u5f39\u5c04\u4e91\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u624b\u611f\u5c31\u662f\u5c4e\u3002\nHoly crap!

This is a game where an 8-bit minigame of the main game is just as difficult and absorbing as the main game and can easily sidetrack you - not to do the main game a disservice at all. The gameplay is designed around one core concept - the dash that can be used once before having to touch the ground before using it again. This concept is built around as the game progresses, and more objects in the levels are introduced, but the movement roster always stays the same (as far as I've played).\n\nI haven't got far enough in for the story to really throw me loads of curveballs (just finished the hotel) but the hotel level and the guy who runs it actually made me feel an emotion, which is very rare for a platformer. The themes in this game are pretty obvious from the get go, and if you didn't figure out the symbolism of the 'dark' version of the main character being her inner doubts and negative temptations early on, I don't know what to tell you, but the story is still well told - especially for a platformer, let me re-emphasise.\n\nHighly recommended and a fairly obvious candidate for GOTY early on.", "timestamp_created": 1519579793, "timestamp_updated": 1519579793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40394392": {"recommendationid": "40394392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280796041", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521422064}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it and I can't stop playing.", "timestamp_created": 1519579047, "timestamp_updated": 1519579047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40394128": {"recommendationid": "40394128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324919968", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1521260683}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u592a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u4e86 \u867d\u7136\u6709\u70b9\u96be \u4e0d\u8fc7\u771f\u7684\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1519578470, "timestamp_updated": 1519578470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40393796": {"recommendationid": "40393796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063896429", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 276, "last_played": 1520627433}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Medo, determina\u00e7\u00e3o, empatia, solid\u00e3o e compania.

Which is to say, it's a game about controlling the momentum and angle of your jumps, dashes, midair flight, and so forth--with a lovely bit of climbing and pretty-consistently tight physics puzzles for good measure. The best part is that it manages difficulty by allowing you to perform optional side courses, reminiscent some of the puzzles in Super Metroid or Metroid Fusion.\n\nBasically, if you're the type who liked collecting every last missile tank, doing all the weird dash stunts and sequence-breaking tricks and stuff, you're going to like this game a lot more.\n\nEach stage sort of has its own unique mechanics to teach, as well as an optional, hidden unlockable 'B-side', which revisits the story stages with a much harder set of courses. Did I mention there's a story? Including classic Prince of Persia-esque bits with your reflection coming out of a mirror and trying to fuck around with your life and shit?\n\nOne brief quibble I do have, is that, for the challenge of the content, it's not very good at pacing itself, and the levels are all quite drawn out. It can also be easy to miss all of the optional challenges in any given map, as there are multiple hidden rooms in each level. Make sure you have more than a little time on your hands for all the precision platforming, as some of the later stages get... rather merciless.\n\nIn retrospect, the Mountain Climbing theme was aptly chosen, as Celeste can be quite tiring, at times. I do wish there was a little more story and exploration, to soften up some of Celeste's puzzling sequences. There's a reason, in retrospect, that games like Super Metroid were one part exploration, one part side-scrolling shooter, one part extreme wall-jumping platform puzzler, and it's that the puzzle segments on their own can get quite fatiguing stringed back to back to back, like Celeste's are. Moreover, unlike titles like Super Metroid, Celeste's Strawberry optional rewards don't really contribute to the gameplay experience in any way, so even succeeding at puzzles, at times, can feel like getting busy work out of the way, and the temptation to opt out of them grows greater as the puzzles' difficulty increase without any clear reward aside from collecting what are the fruit equivalent of Mario 64 stars.\n\nBasically, it's Super Metroid's dash boot segments meets Prince of Persia's navigating with switches and spikes, and running from evil things trying to catch up with you, and the air-control of a TFC or TF2 jumpmap, except in 2d. Hectic with moments of story progression, and lots of crashing into spikes and retrying. Yeah.

[/h1]\n\nMatt Thorson of Matt Makes Games developed a game called [i]Towerfall Ascension,[/i] a game that I've put 40+ hours into and love to death. I was ecstatic to discover that Matt Makes Games was putting out another game and I am happy to report that I have been blown away by it. It is so easy to see the influences from Towerfall Ascension in Celste and I love seeing how the mechanics and ideas from Towerfall translated over into Celeste. Before I gush too much about Celeste, let's dive into the nitty-gritty details.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+Soundtrack[/b]\nThese past couple of years have introduced me to some of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time. Titles like Undertale, VA-11 Hall-A, and Nier:Automata blew me away with how much I enjoyed their music. I'm proud to say that Celeste has now joined this list of video game soundtracks that I purchase and will listen to on a regular basis. The soundtrack in celeste has a chill chip-tune vibe to it and yet absolutely knows how to amp up the intensity when it needs to. \n\n[b]+Story[/b]\nUsually these sort of 2D Platforming games I don't go into it expecting much of a story (if one at all). However, Celeste was able to shatter this expectation and deliver a story with lovable characters and with well written dialogue. \n\n[i](Side note: I love the sound effects that the characters make while their dialogue is being read. Their chrips and squeeks really match the tone and facial expressions of what the character is saying. It's a really nice touch.)[/i] \n\nI don't want to get too much into the story because I don't want to spoil anything. But I will say the game touches on topics like anxiety and depression and it does so in a very tasteful manner. The game also ties these topics into the gameplay perfectly. As Madeline is trying to overcome these hurdles in her life, so too is the player trying to overcome the challenges and obstacles that the game throws at them. \n\n[b] +Balanced Difficulty[/b]\nI personally find the difficulty in Celeste to be [i]juuuust[/i] right. I love a good challenge, but if a game is overly difficult just for the sake of being diffult, it usually doesn't hold my attention for long. Celeste however, strikes that perfect balance of difficult yet rewarding. Some parts may take quite a few tries, but it's easy to see yourself improve. After completing a level, Celeste shows you your death count for the total number of tries it took to complete that level. I challenge anyone to go back and play a level right after beating it. More often than not you'll be able to cut that death count roughly in half your 2nd time through.\n\n[b]+Assist Mode[/b]\nSome people may be turned off a bit by more difficult platformers or may want to just experience the game for its story. I get that, and Celeste gets that. That's why I believe the way Celeste handles Assist Mode is excellent. Mark Brown put out a great video going into more depth about how Celeste handles Assist Mode and I highly encourage anyone reading this to go check it out [url=https://youtu.be/NInNVEHj_G4] here. [/url]\n\n[b]+Strawberries![/b]\nCeleste has collectable strawberries hidden throughout each level. Usually these can be found in little side rooms, hidden off the main path. These rooms pose an extra challenge for the player and are completely optional. They are tied into the game so seemlessly and the challenge rooms are designed so well that I feel that I'd be doing the game a disservice by skipping them! \n[i]I've personally gotten 90 strawberries so far, and I plan on going back and getting any I that I've missed ;][/i]\n\n[h1] Cons:[/h1]\n[b]-The length of B-Side Levels[/b]\nIn celeste there are bonus levels that can be unlocked that are harder versions of levels in the main campaign. These levels really amp up the difficulty for players looking for that extra challenge. However, I do feel like some of them go on for too long. Some B-Side levels I'd rack up close to around 700 deaths and would have to Save and Quit to come back to it later just because it was so exhausting. I would have liked for them to be shortened down a bit. However, do keep in mind though that this is a very [i]very[/i] very minor gripe about the game as the B-Side levels are completely optional.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy Celeste? [b]Absolutely.[/b] The game is a delight and is a game that I replay over and over again. Everything about the game is so lovable.

You run, jump, climb, and also have the ability to dash in any direction. What I like about this game is that every chapter has a new mechanic to play around with using those simple controls. This is good because the game is quite challenging, and thanks to the instant refresh after death, you can try to master it without interruptions thanks to the game's solid controls.\n\nThe game also has a simple 8-bit visual design that provides some nice backdrops, and the music is nice and refreshing. However, considering the subject matter it concerns,  the story is quite lackluster. I know what you are thinking, \"who plays platforming games for the story?\" Here's the thing, the main theme is about believing in yourself and battling doubts, so I wished this, as a story, was better told because something like that could have had potential.\n\nOther than that, there's isn't a lot about the game that has wowed me. It's not that unique of a game and I wasn't really drawn to it fully. But, as a platformer, it plays well, it's fair, and it has some great level design.\n\nOverall, it's good but not amazing as a lot of critics and possibly a lot of users are saying. When you compare this to somethig like Super Meat Boy or Braid or Shovel Knight, it can't compete. I daresay this may be the first indie game to be overhyped by critics. If you are looking for a good 2D platformer, you can pick this up, but there are much more superior indie platforming titles that easily take the crown.\n\n+ Good music\n+ Simple, tight controls with cool dash mechanic\n+ Good level design\n+ Challenging, fair platforming\n- Story really lacks depth\n- Does not do anything spectacular\n\nScore: 8.0 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1519429182, "timestamp_updated": 1519429182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40341060": {"recommendationid": "40341060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152274812", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 219, "last_played": 1521607388}, "language": "english", "review": "it's cool how they're a restart chapter option\n\nit's cool how easy it is to do it\n\nit's cool how easy it is to do it accidentally\n\nit's cool how i have to play chapter 3 again just after reaching the end", "timestamp_created": 1519428900, "timestamp_updated": 1519428900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40340552": {"recommendationid": "40340552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084111951", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1521719943}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu tr\u00e8s exigeant qui rappellera Super Meat boy tout en ayant bien sa propre identit\u00e9 et ses propres id\u00e9es de gameplay, une difficult\u00e9 progressive et juste, a quelques d\u00e9tails pr\u00e8s (j'y reviens dessous), une histoire simple mais touchante et une musique... oh mon dieu la musique <3\n\nMention sp\u00e9ciale au dernier niveau qui offre un vrais \"best off\" de l'ensemble du jeu, aussi bien niveau gameplay que niveau musique : ils te font sentir que ton objectif est l\u00e0, tout pr\u00e8s.\n\nOn retrouve ce truc g\u00e9nial des Die and Retry : Ce n'est pas le personnage qui progresse, c'est toi, le joueur !

Smooth and quick, just how a difficult platformer should feel when you get a level right. However, that excitement fades fairly quickly as you press on.

A large amount of thought and care are clearly put into the first 8 story levels, but the other 66% of the levels, known as B-Sides and C-Sides, are considerably less well-made. The level designers take the most frustrating and annoying- sometimes even the mechanics that just dont seem to work like they'd be intended to work- parts of a level and turn them into their own, brand new level. To make it worse, a \"runner-up\" soundtrack (hence their clever use of the term 'b-side') is slapped on for you to listen to while you spend a considerable amount of time trying to beat them. This is done again for C-Sides, except it's the second worse soundtrack for a level and the mechanics are even more cancerous.

Pular, escalar, superar dificuldades a cada cen\u00e1rio, apreciar a arte que \u00e9 o jogo, a atmosfera e etc.. Eu senti logo que Celeste \u00e9 muito bom no que quer ser. Quero dizer, nos pontos em que esse jogo procurou se destacar, ele conseguiu.\n\nO meu problema com ele foi o fato de que eu gosto de jogos que exploram caracter\u00edsticas que Celeste p\u00f4s em segundo plano. Por exemplo, a quest\u00e3o dos vastos upgrades que a gente v\u00ea na s\u00e9rie Souls com os seus equipamentos e magias... A quest\u00e3o dos bosses: eu assisti \u00e0s speedruns e vi que at\u00e9 existe algo do tipo, mas, como eu disse, n\u00e3o \u00e9 o objetivo-foco nesse t\u00edtulo.

Celeste wants you to fall, and you just have to get back on your feet and try again. The fundamentals of the game are built up from 3 simple movement mechanics: jump, dash and climb. Together they make the perfect sets of skills that will help you get to the top. They might be simple alone, but together you have some advanced movement abilties that feels rewarding to execute. The levels are laid out in front of you, and it doesn\u2019t take long to figure out how you should effectively maneuver thru them, but doing so is the challenging part. And you can\u2019t even blame the game! \nThe movement is fluent, simple and responsive. If you fail, it is your own doing. can\u2019t blame the game for this one bud. The developers actually went out of their way to make the game as speedrun friendly as possible, which is something more speedrun focused games should be encouraged to do. The gameplay is truly were it shines the most, and will be the one of the main reasons you continue playing. It never bores you, it always challenges you with new and exciting abilities, and you keep learning and understand your own capabilities.\n\nArtstyle\n\nWe have barely reached the top of the iceberg of what this game has to offer, such as it\u2019s great ambient audio pieces combined with pixel tones which matches perfectly with its cute artstyle. I was kind of weirded out at first by its artstyle, blending a cute cartoony artstyle with pixelart at first sight looks a little off, but it\u2019s done so well in its execution that I can\u2019t even complain. Every gameplay related element is pixel art, this makes it easy to perform pixel perfect jumps, while keeping the visuals simple and easy to follow. Other parts like cutscenes and hub world are more centered to focus on the Cartoony style, which is a lot more expressive than pixel art, so it works perfectly, and adds another charming factor to the game.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music has a surprisingly similar style of what the artstyle was going for, blending to very different music genres, which is Ambient music with 8-bit tones. This creates a relaxing environment to minimize frustration. I actually had a lot less frustration in the game when I focused on my victories rather than my failures. Anger can make it harder to focus which than makes the game even harder, so try to have a calm head when going in, understand that all your deaths are the building stairs to your victory! So keep on dying!\n\nStory\n\nTypically, games like these don\u2019t have any deep or interesting stories, and they usually rely on people getting hooked on the gameplay. But this game is different. The gameplay seems to have overshadow a really interesting abstract story that I think we can all relate to. The whole game symbolizes our inner problems. Talking about emotions and understanding them is very relevant to the game and the one playing the game, as most people usually give up on these games because they just can\u2019t handle the frustration. I don\u2019t believe you need to be any good at platform ragegames to beat Celeste. All you need is a bag of determination and patience, and with the right mindset it will become enjoyable and failure will barely faze you anymore (though I do recommend having some experience with platformers) We explore these struggles with our main protagonist Madeline who is not a climber, but yet here she is. I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you as the story can be interpreted in many ways.\n\n10/10 I\u2019m not a masochist I swear (\uff1b\u30fb\u2200\u30fb)", "timestamp_created": 1519244545,

It tells a somewhat serious story by being earnest and with a surprising lack of pretention. The story is all framed by a TOUGH AS NAILS 2D PLATFORMER but fear not. Celeste is about facing your problems, learn from them and move on to the top, not punishing yourself further. \n\nI truly enjoyed Celeste far more than I expected. The controls are smooth and precise. Like other \u201chard\u201d games you level up but actually getting better at the game. It\u2019s a masterclass in learning-by-doing. When you die you respawn instantaneous and most jump-puzzles are just one screen. You will die, a lot, but that is just a part of the learning process and the game makes no deal at all for failing a task. Try again, fail again, fail better. Reach the top if you can, that is all. \n\nThe design is nice and functional retro. No clutter and sharp pixels. Quite beautiful but clearly not the selling point of the game. Music is brilliant. Also retro but really enjoyable and even gives ques how to clear certain puzzles. \nThe characters have their own stories and are all chiselled out and rememberable. Even if the game deals with themes of depression and bad self-image it somehow does this while being charming and not too on the nose (even if you are LITTERARY trying to get over your own problems).\n\nSo, a surprize hit for me. Come for the game-play, stay for the story, or vice versa. It\u2019s meticulously well made in every aspect and I have really no complains what so ever.

The entire main arc of the \"Part of Me\", culminating in the final two chapters where you battle her and ultimately conquer your fears and become one with her, is a powerful metaphor not just for mental health but for any feelings of fear and anxiety. Conquering that fear, becoming one with that part of yourself, is an extremely healthy thing to aspire to and the game really brings that struggle to life. As someone who struggles with mental illness myself, I found myself relating to a lot of the messages and struggles of the protagonist, and was brought to tears by the end of the game - if only because it reminded me of my own struggles a bit too much.\n\nLike I said, this game is well worth getting, and I hope it tops the \"Must Play\" lists of reviewers and game journalists for months to come. Not only for its smooth gameplay experience, challenging yet rewarding difficulty curves, and beautiful design work (visual + audio), but for its underlying message.

escalar.\n\nEl personaje femenino al que controlaremos,\nquiere escalar la monta\u00f1a pero sus motivos\nno est\u00e1n claros en un primer momento.\n\nConforme vamos superando capitulos iremos\ndescubriendo a ciertos NPC's que nos pondran\nlas cosas complicadas excepto Theo con el que\nentablaremos un cierto vinculo de amistad y\nnos ayudara.\n\nEn el segundo capitulo conoceremos al otro lado\nde Celeste,en otras palabras su depresi\u00f3n,con la\nque iremos formando otro vinculo de forma que\nservir\u00e1 para desenra\u00f1ar la raz\u00f3n de porque\nqueremos escalarla.\n\nLLegados a un cierto punto la histor\u00eda nos deja\nconocer m\u00e1s fondo que esconden y cual es su\nverdadera naturaleza para comprender a fondo\nel juego.\n\nLa protagonista se percata que necesita de su\notra parte para coronar pico y sentirse realizada.\n\nEste juego de corte indie se caracteriza por su\njugabilidad al igual que su narrativa y pixel art.\nLo desarrollaron los mismos que Towerfall\nAscension.\n\nEsta claro que la narrativa es importante en su\nmayor\u00eda aunque dentro de este g\u00e9nero no es\nnecesario definitiva ni que estuviera tan bien\nelaborada.\n\nEse dialogo en la monta\u00f1a con Theo esta muy\ncompleto en todos aspectos,llega a transmitir\nun compendio de emociones con las que me\nhe llegado a sentir identificado...sobre todo\ncon las de Madeleine.\n\nDejando a un lado el aspecto narrativo vamos\na centrarnos en su jugabilidad...que considero\nexcelente rozando la perfecci\u00f3n.\n\nPodremos movernos con las flechas y ejecutar\nun dash se\u00eds direcciones hacia todos los lados\ny dos diagonales,al principio solo dispondremos\nde uno.\n\nPo otro lado la mec\u00e1nica de escalada,seremos\ncapaz de ascender y descender a nuestro\nantojo a demas de apoyarnos en las paredes\npara superar pantallas.\n\nTeniendo ya eso en cuenta el juego cuenta\ncon un mapamundi interactivo,en el que\npodremos ver nuestro progreso actual,\nasi como los distintos coleccionables.\n\nExisten una amplia gama de coleccionables:\n\n-Fresa:se consiguen en zonas secretas y de\n  dificil acceso,cada area cuenta con un gran\n  numero de ellas y como dice el juego cuenta\n  sobretodo para fardar con los amigos.\n\n-Cassetes:existe uno por area y desconozco su\n  utilidad.\n\n-Hay un tipo de ellos que sirve para conseguir\n  m\u00e1s dash,es decir aumentar el n\u00famero para\n  desplazarnos m\u00e1s rapidamente.\n\n-Corazones celestes,hay cuatro a lo largo del\n juego y su uso esta marcado a la hora de entrar\n en una zona mas avanzada del juego...\n\n-Pico8:es un ordenador o pc de sobremesa retro\n que emular\u00e1 nuestro ascenso final a la monta\u00f1a\n en forma de minijuego,es un secreto que esta\n esta escondido en el cap\u00edtulo del hotel.\n\nEl g\u00e9nero de este juego es claramente plataformero\npero tiene un aire a vieja escuela,muy dificil,duro,\ncomplicado como pocos muchos lo comparan con\nSuper Meat Boy pero considero que este es \u00fanico\nen su especie.\n\nUn juego con una gran historia,desafiante en todo\nmomento,dejandote respirar en algunas areas pero\nante todo justo...\n\nUna muy buena alternativa a un juego de su \u00e9stilo\nsu precio es correcto,cuando lo compre no estaba\nseguro pero ahora lo aseguro al 100%.\n\nSe me han escapado algunas cosas pero creo que\nde momento hay suficiente material para su compra...\n\nRecomendado!!!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1519020698, "timestamp_updated": 1519020698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

There's not a lot more to it than that. The controls are tight, the challenges are creative, the environments are varied, and each level will pit you against a new gimmick that's around just long enough to be fun without overstaying its welcome. It even has a cute story with some light subtext and an emotionally satisfying payoff at the end.\n\nMost of the complaints I have about Celeste are nitpicks; things like the real-world story about a girl climbing a mountain feeling disconnected from the air-dashing, spike-dodging gameplay, or the slight unevenness of the pacing in some areas. On my initial playthrough I was slightly perplexed to learn that the final chapter could only be unlocked via rare collectibles, something I'd been uninterested in going after since the game made the optional challenges sound truly optional. Going back to grab these after the fact was very forgiving, however, thanks to a generous chapter select that allows you to hop directly into mid-level checkpoints and exit as soon as you grab what you're after. The final chapter also has next to zero story significance, and it's only there as a bonus for those who want more gameplay.\n\nMy only *real* criticism is that obtaining some of the special collectibles required for the final chapter is esoteric to the point of absurdity. I'm talking things you literally cannot figure out in game without bringing in external knowledge. One of them makes no sense unless you're familiar with a secret in Super Mario Bros. 3. Another requires remembering a secret from an earlier level (which you might've missed) and noting down the colours of birds in order to plan out specific dash patterns. These kinds of borderline ARG-esque puzzles are fine in isolation, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who had fun figuring them out, but I don't agree with gating off big chunks of gameplay behind them. The people who just want more awesome Celeste platforming action probably don't overlap much with the crowd who love solving puzzles as esoteric as these. Thankfully google is a handy out for the ones you get stuck on, but I still found these puzzles to be immersion-breaking, flow-halting annoyances, especially when discovering that their solutions were things I had no way of figuring out based on the knowledge the game had given me.\n\nEven that complaint is a relatively small one in the grand scheme of things, however, and since there are easy workarounds it's hard to get too hung up on it. It does stand out as a misstep in an otherwise immensely polished game, however.\n\nCeleste is a great example of a game that polishes and iterates upon a solid formula while being a consistent 9/10 in every area, sometimes even going above and beyond. The final level of the main story is particularly worthy of note, providing an awesome emotional climax that meshes with the gameplay elements to create a genuinely gripping experience. While it didn't quite blow my mind enough to shoot straight into my own personal game of the year shortlist, it's hard to imagine any fan of hardcore meatboy-esque platformers not being satisfied with this one.\n\nWhether you're just going through it once for the story or unlocking all the bonus challenges and collectibles, Celeste is just great fun.

Einzig f\u00fcr Neueinsteiger im Bereich der H\u00fcpfspiele k\u00f6nnte es ein wenig l\u00e4nger dauern, bis das Eis gebrochen ist und Celeste seinen Zauber entfacht. Aber selbst in diesem Fall gilt eindeutig: Es lohnt sich!\n\nWie f\u00fcr traditionelle Jump\u00b4n\u00b4Run Spiele \u00fcblich, teilt sich Celeste in mehrere Levels mit unterschiedlichen Themengebieten auf. Ein Level umfasst dabei \u00fcblicherweise mehrere, in etwa einen Bildschirm umfassende, Abschnitte. H\u00e4ufig gibt es dabei die M\u00f6glichkeit unterschiedliche Pfade zu nehmen und versteckte Bereiche zu entdecken. Jeder Abschnitt stellt f\u00fcr sich eine ansprechende Herausforderung dar. Daher kann es auch mal zum h\u00e4ufigen Ableben kommen. Doch dies bleibt immer frustfrei, da der Spieler unendlich viele Leben hat. Au\u00dferdem vergeht nach einem Fehlversuch nur ein kurzer Moment bis man erneut loslegen kann. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad steigt im Verlauf des Spiels angenehm stetig, aber sp\u00fcrbar, an. Jedes Level bleibt dabei aber durchgehend fair. Dies ist enorm motivierend, da man stets vor Augen hat, wie der Abschnitt zu bew\u00e4ltigen ist. \n\nEher genre-untypisch gibt es in Celeste eine interessante Story, die von den liebevollen Charakteren des Spiels profitiert. W\u00e4hrend man durch die Level voranschreitet wird die Handlung hin- und wieder von kurzen Cutscenes vorangetrieben. Wer sich davon gest\u00f6rt f\u00fchlt, kann diese aber problemlos per Pausenmen\u00fc \u00fcberspringen. Man sollte der Story allerdings auf jeden Fall eine Chance geben. \n\nNeben der Standardversion aller Level, auf denen sich auch die Story abspielt, lassen sich noch sogenannte \"B-Side\"-Varianten freischalten. Diese stellen nicht einfach nur die normalen Levels mit mehr Hindernissen dar, sonder bestehen komplett aus neuen Abschnitten. Dabei werden die in den jeweiligen Leveln eingef\u00fchrten Mechaniken durchdacht weiter ausgereizt und kreativ eingesetzt. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad des Spiels steigt mit den B-Sides deutlich an und d\u00fcrfte auch Genre-Veteranen alles abverlangen. Aufgrund des fantastischen Leveldesigns und den extrem abwechslungsreichen Herausforderungen lohnt es sich aber, sich durchzubei\u00dfen. \nWem das immer noch nicht reicht, darf sich \u00fcber die C-Sides der Level freuen.\n\nCeleste gl\u00e4nzt durch sein \u00fcberragendes Leveldesign mit viel Abwechslung und durchgehend fairen Herausforderungen. \nDabei richtet sich das Spiel nicht nur an Jump\u00b4n\u00b4Run Freunde, sondern auch an die, die es werden wollen.\nWer an anspruchsvollem Gameplay Gefallen finden kann, wird mit Celeste gro\u00dfen Spa\u00df haben.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1518978514, "timestamp_updated": 1518978757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572040", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40200631": {"recommendationid": "40200631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005649979", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1768, "last_played": 1521591640}, "language": "english", "review": "A perfectly-crafted platformer with a solid learning curve and some really fantastic level variations and challenges.

I don't play much plateformers and thought i would never have a chance in hell at the B-sides but the controls and platform is quite fair. A-side is difficult yet not to time consuming even for mediocre players, however the B-sides are were the magic happens. Sometimes youll cruise through sections of B-side no problem and then got to a screen where you spend 20 minutes on with countless deaths and when you finally nail it nothing compares to how that feels. 10/10 Must buy havent heard such catchy and thematic good music in quite some time. Great gameplay that adds new tweaks each level to make every level truely unique. A surprisingly fantastic story that is short and non intrusive enough to not bog down the game but truely enhance it.

I will be putting this with the modern greats of platformers amongst Spelunky and Hollow Knight. From a gameplay perspective this game is excellent. The core of your mobility is simple and versatile and as you progress thoughout the game new \"gimmicks\" are introduced at a perfect pace. And I hesitate to say gimmicks because they are such wonderful map based mobility that perfectly synergize with your base kit and are most importantly fun. This game knows exactly how to create fun. It is very difficult in a fair way. The maps are such that you can be endowed with great mobility and still be challenged and every single iota of content in the game they asked how can this be more entertaining. The best way I can descirbe the game play is it becomes quickly evident what you are meant to do then I find myself laughing and smiling at my failure to do so as I die over a thousand times. And if this game only had the game play I would love it. But what made this an ethereal journey laced with ecstacy is the excellent story to go along side it. It is one of my favorite stories of any medium and it has dialouge that will make you laugh and maybe cry as well depending on how hard it hits home. It's story is such that your emotional investiment in the characters makes you need to complete the game for them more than for yourself. All of this coupled with beautiful pixel art and charming painted pictures throughout make this game nearly perfect.

It's kind of like Super Meat Boy where you play many individual small areas at a time and whenever you die you immediately get set right there at the beginning of that area. So dying doesn't feel like a setback as opposed to a learning experience. I never felt frustrated dying because every time it was like \"oh ok, so that's how to do it\" or \"why in the world did I dash up instead of right?\" So all the deaths feel like they're your fault and not the game's. \n\nIt felt satisfying to get to the top of the mountain at the end and in my opinion this was easier than Super Meat Boy but not by a huge amount, so if Super Meat Boy was too much for you then you may not like this game. It's also easier than Cuphead which is a better game in my opinon. I would also say it's easier than the fantastic Ori and the Blind Forest (at least the original edition that is.. the enhanced version apparently nerfed the uber difficult boss escapes because of outcry that they were too difficult), but it's definitely a difficult game so check out Celeste on sale to see if it's for you and return it if it isn't. In a sea of \"meh\" platformers that get released all the time I look for the greats among them and this sets way above the pack right up there amongst the best of them as one of the most fun 2D platformers of the last few years.

Having experienced and completed all of these levels, some of them taking 900+ deaths for one chapter, the feeling of accomplishment when you finally finish a screen on that 901st try is super addicting. The music also deserves special mention, it is so perfectly fine tuned to be relaxing and tense when it needs to be. The main story's soundtrack is more dynamic to the changing environment and story sequences, whereas the b-sides are more jamming tunes that loop painlessly while you die forever on whatever challenge before you.

Celeste is an experience.\n\nAs an avid fan of 2D retro platformers, I was initially wary of this title as I've heard about it's unforgiving difficulty, and I typically stay away from rogue-like games.  But, after seeing all the positive reviews, I decided to give in and glad I did.  The game is gorgeous, with plenty of secrets to find, mechanics to master, heart felt story and charming characters.  And the soundtrack is incredible.  Just as I thought, Celeste is brutally hard and unforgiving where you will die repeatedly until you finally overcome it's incredibly challenging levels.  Dying over and over again and learning from those deaths and mistakes is part of the experience, but eventually you'll find yourself getting better and more proficient with the platforming.  This game demands perfection.  But instead of feeling daunted by this, I found myself wanting to come back and try again.  Yes, this game is hard, but also incredibly fun.  \n\nI loved and hated Celeste, but in the end, this was truly one of the best games I've played.  I really can't rant and rave about this game enough.  Do yourself a favor, and experience this gem.  Big thumbs up from me!\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1518800184, "timestamp_updated": 1518800184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504405",

con un mando,mi caso)me ha sorprendido como esto lo lleva a una de las narrativas mas bonitas y sinceras sobre dos temas bastante mas complejos de lo que parecen,la depresion y el auto-descubrimiento y esto con personajes de lo mas carismaticos y que tendre en el corazon por el cari\u00f1o que les he cogido sin duda\n\nMirad,casi nunca compro un juego por su precio completo,pero puedo decir 100%

Exploring is greatly rewarded and you are encouraged to do it often, though sometimes it can hover on the 'well how was I supposed to know that???' with some of the more hidden collectibles.\n\nEven the story, the goddamn story of a 2D platformer about a girl climbing a mountain is an emotional experience that most people can probably relate to on atleast some level. I saw plenty of myself in Madeline and it made me just that much more determined to climb my way to the summit.\n\nThey spent years making this game and it shows.\nAbsolutely a must buy for anyone

He's funny and caring and personally I don't know why do you get the option to ignore him and sleep. Personal bonding over difficulties is pretty awesome.\n\n- Loved the inclusion of the original game as an easter egg, same for the achievement from beating it. (it was hard! D:)\n\n- Actually came here for Inlovewithaghost if you've a change, give them a try. (: \n\n- The mechanic to learn the new \"method\" every level is funny and doesn't force you to repeat a long part.\n\n- Does that mean the learning curve is actually okay?\n\n- I heavily dig 8/16bit artstyle, so I liked it, it's very colorful\n\n- When Madeline starts \"growing\" as a char, she becomes relatable, as well as \"a part of her\", she was also one of my favourite characters.\n\n- Actually gives you some advice about life, don't fight with yourself, don't blame yourself, you're all a team, with pros and cons, that could be worked on, improving your life. Love yourselves guys (:\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n- Story and Madeline character take way too much time to actually progress.\n\n- I even disliked her for being so stuck up. (And that might be a problem for most if you don't interact more with the NPC's)\n\n- It was until you rescue Theo that her char starts up growing into you. (at least into me) And that's half of the game.\n\n- Sometimes controls won't work properly whilst on Keyboard dashing you into oblivion when you wanted to go up, etc.\n\n- Mr Oshiro deserves more development, man, he was a dude so dedicated to his job, he actually haunts it after his death, he's got potential, outside from being a \"boss\" and a insecure dude. (also frick that level, frick that level in particular)\n\n- The special assist is too much, imo. (At least you'd try enabling them by \"up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, \ndash, jump, enter), if you don't care about strawberries, tapes and crystal hearts, you mostly won't need those.\n\n- I think character design could be improved, they looked awesome in \"cutscenes\" and those square character thingies, but in gameplay.... we could get a face or at least some dots and a smile, nostalgia shouldn't be a synonym of plain.\n\n\nIf you want charm, a warm fuzzy feeling game, and a gud challenge, you'd try it!\nI personally enjoyed it very much and became a lil bit better in touch with myself.\n\nDon't give up! \n", "timestamp_created": 1518601711, "timestamp_updated": 1518601711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40064380": {"recommendationid": "40064380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198439725695", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518690767}, "language": "english", "review": "FOR SPEEDRUNNERS\n\nIf you can repeat intricate jump-and-run patterns with pixel resolution and sub-0.1 second accuracy, then this game is for you.

"playtime_forever": 2482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 296, "last_played": 1521529871}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to play this game the way it's meant to be played, then you had better enjoy masocore games, because unless you're some kind of god, the difficulty eventually escalates to that point. That said, Celese is not a rage-tier game. There's no RNG bullshit, no hidden variables, and the controls are - if not intuitive - completely consistent in their response. I think I've died three times feeling it was the game's fault, but so far, I've died over 4500 times, and 4497 of those, I felt like it was my fault for making a mistake.\n\nIn other words, it's a very fair game. Also, if masocore itsn't your bag, the game has \"assist mode\", which allows a pretty fine-grained control of the difficulty. If timing challenges are a pain, then you can slow the game from anywhere between 90% to 50% of full speed, in 10% increments. You can also turn of fall deaths and damage from obstacles, the depletion of stamina (a mechanic that limits how long you can hold onto walls, climb, and walljump up instead of out), and even increases the number of times you can dash in the air, from 1, to 2, and then infinite.\n\nEnabling every asist option to the maximum makes the game impossible not to beat, even for a young child without much coordination. Though ndividuals with significant biological or neurological issues might still difficult, I think that it makes the game *literally* as accessible as this sort of game can possibly be without compromising level designs. \n\nOne thing that has caused \"hardcore\" gamers some umbrage is that using assist mode does NOT disable achievements. I don't really care, because, hey, if I had nerve damage that made normal difficulty impossible, I'd want to get the achievements so long as I tried my hardest - but you might have a different opinion.\n\nIn terms of difficulty curve, Celeste requires a moderate amount of skill even at the first (real) level, but this is offset by the fact that the game is cut into small rooms. If you die in a room, you respawn in that room. Additionally, levls are cut into chapters, so if you want to leave one level so you can go back to a previous one to polish your skills, and gain collectibles, your progress isn't entirely erased: you can go to the most recent chapter. The game uses visual language to tell you when you've reached a new chapter - in the environment, a large autosave icon is chisseled into a wall. If you see this, then you're guaranteed to be able to choose to rtespawn there.\n\nCeleste has three sets of levels. A sides, B sides, and C Sides. A sides are where the story of the game lives, along almost all of the collectible items. B sides (unlocked via a collectible in A Sides) are uniformly harder than the hardest A side level, and each level contains only one (impossible to skip) collectible, tied to an achievement. I have not yet unlocked the C sides, but youtube videos and 30 hours of gameplay experience lead me to believe that they'll be about as hard as a rage-tier masocore game (though more fair, because C sides DON'T contain any RNG-based mechanics) - expect them to demand high-speed, nearly pixel-perfect precision. C Sides are unlocked by completing all A Sides and B Sides.\n\nThe music for this game is excellent, and it conveys the atmosphere of the level and the main character's mood well. It's a soundtrack that I consider good enough to buy on its own merits, but musical taste varies between people, so I can't say if that will be true for you. If nothing else, nobody being honest with themselves will be able to say that the music is bad on a technical level (eg, missed notes, broken chords, bad timing, poor melody), even if they don't like the style in which it was composed, which is synth-heavy with a side of classical orcestration.\n\nThe story was... small scale? It's a game about a normal person with normal problems climbing a weird mountain. Don't expect global consequences or epic scope. Or, really, answers about the \"mystery\" of the mountain - while you'll definately learn \"what\" is up with Mt. Celeste, you never learn \"why\" or \"how\". That said, the character interactions are if not the most gripping I've ever been exposed to, adequate and realistic.\n\nOverall, it's a game worth playing, and paying for. I don't regret that I bought it at the undiscounted price.", "timestamp_created": 1518466105, "timestamp_updated": 1518466105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40029464": {"recommendationid": "40029464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008186680", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518459711}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are looking for hidden gems on steam...

The fact that Celeste has a $20 price tag also made me reluctant to buy it. After playing a solid 20 hours I can happily call it an incredible game and recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in platforming games.\n\nProbably more than any other platformer I've played, Celeste adds mechanic after mechanic that just feels fun. I found myself constantly saying \"oh that's cool\" or \" yoooo that screen was sick!\" and the gameplay/level design really needs to be commended. As with last years The End is Nigh there is a puzzle element to the game, which is even stronger here, and the game really rewards being observant and thorough. The Mirror Temple is my favourite world/chapter/level in any platforming game period and is an absolute joy to play through.\nThe diverse soundtrack also deserves a mention for some amazing tracks and, as is becoming more common, is implemented into the game fantastically. Having the music rise and fall as you proceed through the chapters just adds that extra layer of enjoyment and helps push you through the challenging segments.\n\nThe difficulty with a platforming game is the main factor in whether a lot of people will enjoy it or not and I would say that the main story should be approachable and challenging for most people but the extra content may be a bit much, if you got through Super Meat Boy you'll be fine with this. To say much more would ruin a fun and satisfying experience, definitely not a platformer that you want to spoil for yourself.

Celeste doesn't indulge in an abundance of mechanics, instead opting to perfect something much more simplistic. You jump, you dash, you climb. Later levels do introduce environmental mechanics, but they're mostly versions of those three. You jump, you dash, you climb. It lulls you into a rhythm, making you persist even through death after death. You jump, you dash, you climb. For a while I thought that was all it was going to be.\n\nSee, I started Celeste expecting nothing more than a neat little platformer and I impatiently button-mashed through the dialogue trying to get back to the gameplay. Around the 4th level I realised I'd been skipping some of the strongest indie game writing in recent memory. The story is surprisingly simple and heartfelt, melancholy and triumphant, crushing and soaring. There are themes in the main character's arc that I don't want to spoil by mentioning but that are searingly relatable. Celeste made me tear up twice, once because I could feel Madeline's pain and struggle, and once again because I was so proud of her progress. By this point, the platforming I've previously lauded praise on had become a backdrop, a perfect interstitial between the cutscenes that managed to elegantly mechanically reflect the themes of the current story.\n\nCeleste is nothing short of brilliant.", "timestamp_created": 1518285930, "timestamp_updated": 1518285930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39982717": {"recommendationid": "39982717", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999056177", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520033886}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what a masterpiece feels like.", "timestamp_created": 1518285273, "timestamp_updated": 1518285273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39982197": {"recommendationid": "39982197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006605270", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520033379}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite frankly, Celeste is near perfection. Before I start, just buy it, it really is something special.\n\nThis game is one of the best, most complete 2d platformers of all time. I went into it with a hint of skepticism. Lately there's been an absolute deluge of 2d indie titles, with some sort of renaissance happening with the medium right now, so for a game like this to hit me this hard, it really means something.\n\nAt first glance it's a simple masocore platformer in the vain of games like super meat boy: that rough 2d look and insanely tricky platform puzzles, requiring twitch reflexes and astute timing. But once I booted the game I immediately realised that a super meat boy clone this was not. Right from the get go this game has context, a proper story about a young woman coming to a mountain to do something, to either prove something to herself or escape from something. And the game reflects this throughout, both with the setting of the mountain and of the difficulty curve itself. As you ascend close to the top, more and more revelations happen in the story and the challenge gets harder, but so too does your determination (Undertale reference not intended). As Madeline struggles yet perseveres, so too do you, overcoming the rising challenges and ascending the mountain. \n\nThe story hits on some deeply relatable themes. Both Madeline and Theo have a reason to climb the mountain, and both are believable and understandable. You can skip some of the dialogue throughout the game, but I feel you would miss out on a lot of the context and the message it's trying to tell. Some of the problems facing Theo I myself have had to tackle, and likely a lot of you will too. I really wasn't expecting that from a game of this ilk. \n\nIn all, the ascent itself isn't astonishingly difficult, with the climb being more about the representation of Madeline's realisations as much as it is about pushing the player to their limit. However the additional content and optional areas are what really dial the game up a few notches. You can find bonus strawberries throughout the game which reside within some fairly difficult platforming challenges and hidden areas. These are strewn all throughout the different levels of the game and tempt you to test yourself every time you find one. Though non essential, you constantly find yourself yearning for one when you see it, unable to leave it behind for fear of \"failure\". The theme of the game really drives you on here. But these are only minor obstacles once you unlock the alternate sides of levels. For every level there are B sides, amped up versions of the level where your skill will be tested on another tier from the main game. These alone can be totally daunting, with some of these taking me around 40 minutes to complete, even as a fan of tricky platformers. And lets not even start with the later sides you can unlock, where being merely human is not enough.\n\nIn all, Celeste is an experience aswell as a game. It's the perfect ratio of story and gameplay combined to form a genuinely fulfilling experience that i'm glad I had the chance the complete. To some degree, I hope the developers will release some form of additional content to expand further on Theo's character. The game quite rightfully focuses on Madeline from start to finish, but I would like to follow some of his own challenges throughout the game. Honestly that's my only request, the game does everything else right. The difficulty curve is perfect, the optional content is as as hard as you want it and the game strings it all together with a story and theme that really makes you want to see Madeline succeed.\n\nFor the sake of good games everywhere, buy this.

What's so great about it?\n\nIn a word: polish, in every way.\n\nYes, it's at heart a pretty simple 2d platformer, but the difference between a great game and an average game is rarely in the big picture stuff; it's in the details, in how well it's all put together and how refined the result is. And Celeste scores absolutely top marks on that front. It's not groundbreaking, or genre-bending; there's not a massive living world for you to get lost in; it's just simple, 2d platforming that's been polished until every surface is smooth and clean. \n\nThe controls, as everyone has no doubt heard a thousand times, are tight and responsive, and just feel good.

Some people may find this overwhelming, or have low stress tolerance, so the game offers a option that allows you to go easier, and enjoy the journey to the top of the mountain, without the stress. But in overall, I just loved how the levels were fresh and the challenges, exciting. The mechanics are simple, yet, they are sharp in response like a well-tempered blade. This is a watershed for me that defines if I'm gonna love or hate a platformer, and the game exceeded my expectations. The soundtrack was another thing that stood out. It's been a long time since I noticed myself completely stopped in the middle of a map because I was too distracted contemplating such beautiful BGMs.\n\n   Regards story, the game also tackles and brings attention to an important topic, yet often ignored by a lot of games: mental illness. It shows the viewers what feels like to have depression, or panic attack, in a lot of different languages (visuals, texts, etc). Since I've been on a fight for years agains't these mental illness and worse ones, some dialogues definitelly made me shed some tears, and I'll take the things I've learned from Celeste for the rest of my life. I can say for sure that this game is more important to me now than any triple A has been so far because of this.\n\n   If you're not sure if you should play this game, you already should bought this game weeks ago. If you already played, you should be playing it again.\n\n[Edit]: Found out about the B-Side tapes (Secret harder levels you can unlock to challenge yourself) and the death count is now five thousand.", "timestamp_created": 1518154947, "timestamp_updated": 1518413765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39946036": {"recommendationid": "39946036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024876271", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519798501}, "language": "english", "review": "***UPDATED*** I've been playing this game for about 8 hours.

Now, the content aside from the main game is generous to say the least, there are strawberries that test your platforming skills before you get to collect them, B-side tapes that offer you remixed and more challenging variants of the regular levels and then there are other secrets that I'd much rather have people find on their own.\n\nAll in all? Best platformer I've played in years, the levels are beatiful and introduce new mechanics before the old ones even feel old, the characters are cute and endearing, the story is engaging without hour-long cutscenes and the soundtrack by Lena Raine is to die for, which I expect you will do plenty of, die, countless times and love every second of it.", "timestamp_created": 1518113136, "timestamp_updated": 1518113136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39932890": {"recommendationid": "39932890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053285010", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518711618}, "language": "italian", "review": "\u2022 Minimalistic and always changing gameplay mechanics\n\u2022 Really well balanced difficulty curve (huge spike after the main story line)\n\u2022 The challanging factor is really what makes you keep playing it\n\u2022 Wonderful OST\n\u2022 Crazy smooth pixel art\n\u2022 Plot is deeper than it should be for a game like this: it's not just about climbing Mt.

To get her head free you sets out for a journey. As experienced hiker Madelaine wants to climb the legendary mystical Mount Celeste, this is the story of her finding herself.\n\nThe Game Introduces itself with a a short prologue and the basic controls (which i highly recommend you rebind via the settings or use a controler to play) and setting up the mood that this journey is bound to become a very special one. \n\nAfter that you'll dive right in. There are Strawberries you can collect and there are a ton of hidden secrets (and achievements)! Its also very nice that the game tells you that you wont get anything from collecting strawberries and you should collect them only if you find fun in collecting stuff :D\n\nThroughout the levels you will find diverse NPCs you can interact with, further getting information about Madeleine and Mount Celeste. You will find that you are indeed not alone on this trip! After every Level and during some conversations you also get beautifully handdrawn cutscenes which help conveying the plot very much!\n\nEach level will also introduce a new movement  technique for you to learn, which it then utilises in the separate rooms and builds the difficulty on it. (for example to do a dash in midair) So this means, while some rooms are definitely very difficult, you'll always know what to do you just have to find your way around them! Some rooms are only there for you to get through, some are little puzzles who are fun to solve!\n\nAs stated above Madeleine goes thorugh a difficult time right now, and so this game is also about fighting/surviving your inner demons; topics like dealing with depression and self counciousness play a heavy role in the story of Celeste.\n\nSimilar to Dark Souls you cant lose while playing Celeste. The only way to loose is to give up.\n\nConclusion:\n-----------------\n\n[list]\n\n[*]+ Wonderful Pixely Graphics, which wont get boring and greatly contribute to the beauty of this game\n[*]+ Absolute Stunning Soundtrack! Music will determine the tone and mood of each level heavily and ranges in variety from adrenaline inducing fast paced songs, over calm moody ones, to creepy/sad ones and then there is that one song in rooms with switching platforms that      apparently is just there to mock you xD\n[*]+ A very well written Story for the Protagonist that is also very relatable! (YOU WILL learn something, that you can apply to your own life here!)\n[*]+ Very fluid and forgiving controls\n[*]+ A variety of levels all with different themes (city, medieval, forestry)\n[*]+ Rewarding secrets!\n\n[*] B-Side Cassettes: practically Bonus/Alternative version of the level you are in \n     SUBSTANTIALLY HARDER THAN THE LEVEL ITSELF! \n[/list]\n\nCeleste is a great platformer with a very well written Protagonist and a stunning soundtrack that truly will make everyone happy. Newcomers to platforming and Pros as well.\n\nIts Price may seem a bit high at first, because you can Speedrun this game in 4 hours. but if you are into collecting stuff and not just into speedrunning the game and like to take in the scenery and explore (which i strongly recommend) you will have substantially more fun during your time playing it.\n\nThis game is very well made and another example for why small indie studios often make better games than AAA-Studios.\nIt is worth every penny and I gladly supported its developers.\n\nIf you are short on money, you can wait until its in a Humble Bundle or in a Sale on Steam, but YOU HAVE TO GET IT! ASAP!\n\nThanks for Reading.", "timestamp_created": 1518104241, "timestamp_updated": 1518104560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519704", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39931841": {"recommendationid": "39931841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153219341", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520118810}, "language": "english", "review": "Great graphics for Pixel art lovers, however...It's a tough game!

That is scientific fact, I have research to prove it, and has absolutely nothing to do with the emotional bias introduced by this game's wonderful story. Which it did introduce. In great quantities. Seriously, this game has a genuinely meaningful and interesting story.\n\nConcerning gameplay, these kinds of games tend to be frustratingly challenging, and this one can be too, but I feel this game does absolutely everything in its power to ever let that hinder your enjoyment of it. Oh hey a list:\n\n-1) The game never ever ever demands ninja-level finger dexterity & timing from the player. In fact, it's wary about even approaching it. When I ever thought the game was asking me to make a crazy jump, I was mistaken - I eventually found a much better way to go. Because of this, there's no part of this game I would dread replaying; a genuine feat with this kind of platformer.\n-2) The controls are so unbelievably well polished. Not just to be responsive, but more importantly, all actions are easily repeatable & thus consistent. This applies to even the most complex techniques in the game. Again, this goes back to finger dexterity - anyone can play this.\n-3) When concerning fast-paced games, if you would describe yourself as an intoxicated sloth with severe bladder issues, fear not! You can still play this. There's an \"assist mode\" which lets you tweak some core rules to make everything easier. You can turn it on at any time - please don't be too stubborn to use this. Consider it a 'safety net' if this game does turn out too hard, and you want to actually keep enjoying yourself.\n\nThe game is simultaneously tuned to please the high-effort players too - the amount of optional challenges in this game is unreal. And every last bit of it brings something brand new.\n\nNine-billion out of ten, buy it", "timestamp_created": 1518071840, "timestamp_updated": 1518071840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39923657": {"recommendationid": "39923657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267520045", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519518139}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good.", "timestamp_created": 1518069743, "timestamp_updated": 1518069743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39923367": {"recommendationid": "39923367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048020085", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518835944}, "language": "english", "review": "By and far one of the most purely enjoyable platforming experiences I've had to date, with some solid music, a plethora of challenges to overcome and secrets to find, with a very comfortable and well-tuned difficulty curve.

It seemed forced at the end, and it ended up being a little awkward, but the dialog is top-notch and the story is touching anyway. But the thing that really kept me coming hard was the difficulty. I just finished the main levels, and I will try to get every strawberry before attempting the B-Side.\n\nAnother awesome thing about Celeste is that even though it's challenging, you can choose how hard you want it to be. You could decide not to get any strawberries (the most challenging jumps are for collecting the straberries) or turn the assist mode on. The assist mode can make the game up to 50% slower, give you infinite dashes and other things. It is not the way it's meant to be played, but it's nice to have the option to make things less frustrating.\n\nIn the end, Celeste is an awesome game.

There's a fair amount to cover here, so I will arrange my review into \"bullet points\" for ease of separating things into pros and cons.\n\n+++ TIGHT CONTROLS: This is extremely important in a precision platformer like Celeste, and the game nails it. Never once when I played did I really feel like I had died to the game misinterpretting a control or not doing what I wanted it to. This made it a lot less demoralizing to die, since I knew that it was my own fault and if I did better next time I could succeed. The only controls I have a tiny bit of trouble with are the golden feather controls being a little difficult to get used to (but I feel like that might have been the point).\n\n+Good Story: The story isn't exactly subtle or incredibly unique, but it does offer an interesting and metaphorical look at the nature of anxiety and belief in oneself. The story is also unobtrusive to gameplay, and all cutscenes are skippable if you don't want to watch them again when replaying a level.\n\n+Collectibles: There's a vast swathe of collectibles in the game and enough content to facilitate at least 20 hours of gameplay (assuming you try to find things on your own without looking them up). With the exception of a few to enter the final level (4 out of the 16 total of a certain type), all collectibles are also strictly optional.\n\n+Difficulty Settings: Not true difficulty settings, but there are quite a few ways that Celeste offers different difficulty levels for different players. Baseline, the game offers an \"assist mode\" for players who feel the game is a bit too challenging, which can enable things such as infinite air dashes or even incincibility if you just want to see the story. As for the default settings, the game can still be fairly easily breezed through by a competent player in a few hours without going for any collectibles. Players interested in a greater challenge can go for collectibles (which are often challenging to find and even more challenging to acquire once located), or the brutally punishing B-side levels (harder variations of already-completed levels).\n\n+Graphics: While graphics don't matter so much, Celeste is legitimately one of the most beautiful 2d games I have ever played. Seriously, just look at the screenshots. Gorgeous.\n\n+Soundtrack: This game sports an amazing soundtrack, rivalling other games with famously great soundtracks such as Undertale and Hollow Knight. Lena Raine is a phenomenal composer and artist, and it shows through in this game.\n\n-Unfair Collectibles: This is a very minor complaint, but some of the collectibles in the game are rather bothersome to find. They will sometimes be hidden in a fake wall, and while many of these have a crack or somesuch to indicate that they are something else, a few don't. It left me frustratedly jumping at any open wall I could hoping to locate that last strawberry when I had exhausted other options.\n\n-Arbitrary gating: Another small complaint that only really applies when going for collectibles. Sometimes the game will lock you out from going backwards without any real warning when you go from one screen to the next. This makes it rather annoying when collectible-hunting, checking an area for a strawberry only to have it prevent you from going backwards again without any warning.\n\nOverall this game is absolutely amazing, and one of the best games I have ever played. It should serve as an example to future platformers of how to make a game that truly shines without having overly complicated controls or arbitrarily punishing levels. If I had to assign a numerical score, it would be at least a 9/10, maybe even a 10/10, and I would highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1517953109, "timestamp_updated": 1517953109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39895950": {"recommendationid": "39895950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074950520", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520119459}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just amazing.

I miss the old days when game developers could hide secret areas in a fun way, rather than behind DLC. As the game says in the description, this is a game \"The way mom used to make it\". You can tell that this game was made to be enjoyable and with love and dedication, rather than made in as little time as possible for as much profit as possible. \n\nMy only major complaint about the game is that they actually included a feature where you can look through binoculars to see further into the level so you can plan ahead, but these are missing in some of the areas where they are needed the most. It was infuriating trying to complete the B-sides and getting hundreds of deaths just because I was having to try and figure out where to go in the middle of the action. I feel like if you are going to include a feature like that, it should be used more often in those kinds of places.\n\nOther than that, I really liked it and will probably keep playing for 100% completion", "timestamp_created": 1517919842, "timestamp_updated": 1517933334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39884775": {"recommendationid": "39884775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398061197", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521106349}, "language": "schinese", "review": "10/10 for no reasons.\n\nBest game in 2018 so far <3", "timestamp_created": 1517913418, "timestamp_updated": 1517913418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39884718": {"recommendationid": "39884718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320161913", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519641450}, "language": "english", "review": "amazingly fun gameplay and has a good soundtrack and has good level design and this game is fuckin amazing", "timestamp_created": 1517913159, "timestamp_updated": 1517913159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39884096": {"recommendationid": "39884096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058159692", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518702382}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is great, the soundtrack is great, the story was good\nbut it's pretty hard\n\nimo easier to play with a keyboard than controller\n\n9/10 ?\n", "timestamp_created": 1517910105, "timestamp_updated": 1517910105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39883929": {"recommendationid": "39883929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056264254", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 139, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519929248}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the kind of game you get once in a generation. This damn game. In an area of the genre that's historically dried itself out with some real samey stuff riding off the coattails of a game like Super Meat Boy, Celeste breathes some incredible air into how you can make that game all at once accessible, challenging, and relaxing. Because on top of Celeste's ridiculous, inspired level design are some seriously gorgeous and charming environments and character illustrations, varied and soothing soundtrack, and a fucking admirably clever sense for theming and writing. Because not only does the dialog in Celeste communicate its characters well, but the levels themselves tell the story in a way that is, honest to god, kind of breathtaking to experience.\n\nCeleste is a game anyone can play, it's a game that doesn't taunt you or mock your failures, it doesn't even contextualize death as \"failure\"; it just sees it as learning, a way to keep track of how far you've come. You're never pressured to finish a level, because the game's always willing to save your spot for you if you want to just take a break and try again later, which saves even the challenge levels from being frustrating and instead just makes them feel long and a bit exhausting, but always gratifying and never a pain. I haven't liked a 2D platformer this much since Rayman Origins, and I might even consider Celeste to be a step above that!

The game ingeniously continues to expand and expand on this one mechanic, offering a vast variety of possiblities, from momentum-based jumping puzzles to fast-paced, adrenaline filled platforming challenges.\n\nThe story is servicable, and works perfectly for the type of game. The characters are what makes it truly shine - the general plot of climbing a mountain is extremely simple, but allows these fantastic characters to grow around and with each other and have genuniely fantastic and heart-warming interactions between each other. This especially becomes apparently later into the game, and without spoiling anything, this game tackles several aspects of human personality that you wouldn't expect to see from a game like this.\n\nThe spritework is absolutely incredible. Top notch animation, absolutely breathtaking visuals, and all of the colors imaginiable mesh together to create a truly incredible world for you to explore. This is compounded by the game's absolutely stunning soundtrack, featuring very soothing piano pieces with traditional videogame synth, as well as a host of remixes for the hard-mode versions of the levels.\n\nThe game finally has a great sense of accomplishment in finding secret areas and goodies. From collecting strawberries to the elusive Crystal Hearts hidden in every level, you will always feel satisfied either in your technical ability or brain power when finally collecting them.\n\nIn summary, this game is absolutely fantastic, and as a lover of 2-D platformers for my entire life, this is not only one of the best in years, but has an absolutely stunning amount of replay value and potential for speedrunning.

In hopes of shedding her routine existence, she\u2019s decided to challenge herself to a climb of Celeste Mountain, completely unaware that Celeste Mountain tends to bring out the best (and worst) in people \u2013 literally. Madeline suffers from anxiety and depression  - something that is not often depicted in video games, especially platformers. Celeste does a good job of representing what that\u2019s like, rare for a video game \u2013 even rarer for a platformer.\n\nThere are 8 worlds full of challenges, secrets and strawberries to collect. Run, jump, climb, and dash over obstacles with each world full of unique environmental hazards and assists all rendered in a gorgeous pixel art style.  B-side challenge levels increase the content AND the difficulty, presenting some truly nefarious challenges.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with Celeste and I definitely recommend it.\n\nCheck out more of my Celeste coverage on 3CR:\nhttps://thirdcoastreview.com/2018/02/05/game-review-celeste/\n", "timestamp_created": 1517849952, "timestamp_updated": 1517849952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545573", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39869780": {"recommendationid": "39869780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023162438", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 2233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518745842}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Obra maestra de las plataformas, desde Super Meat Boy que no me enganchaba tanto con un juego as\u00ed.

Each level brings a new theme to the table, but keeps to itself, allowing the level design to be about the level and not about loading the player with more and more things to have to interact with as the game progresses. \n\nThe base game on its own is not a cake walk, but it's not crushing either, the rate in which you respawn after a death will barely give you time to consider giving up. The game tracks how many times you die on each level, but actively reminds you that your death counter is an ode to your persistence and not something to be ashamed about. \n\nFor the masochists, each level has a \"B-side\" which can be unlocked via secrets in the main level. The B-side remixes the level to bring out the potential difficulty in the mechanics of that environment and then further adds to that by pushing the player to make precise, fast movements. \n\nThe game also has a story that more or less just follows the main character pushing herself to climb the mountain, and along the way she discovers that not only is the mountain unique, but that it forces her to also challenge the worst of herself. \n\nSadly there are a few negative points with this game:\nFirstly joystick controls on the controller can be tempermental and having the stick pushed a few degrees to the left or right of a cardinal direction can cause you to instead air dash diagonally, which will usually always kill you. \n\nThe Camera shake function is triggered by dashing, camera shake is fine on some environmental objects but when tied to dash it gets spammed constantly and can be a headache.. I recommend turning it off for challenge levels because the shaking will throw off precision jumps. \n\nIn a few levels the secret hearts are located by finding extremely obscure hidden paths that would require you to blindly dash at walls which can be very boring since you are basically replaying old levels with no hints as to the general area you are looking. You need to find the secret hearts to be able to do the final challenge. The puzzle based secret hearts are very well designed and a challenge to figure out. \n\n\nOverall this game has been given a lot of love, and it has been pushed to give those wanting a story driven experience something to sit down to, and to give difficulty junkies like myself something to feel accomplished about.", "timestamp_created": 1517844203, "timestamp_updated": 1517845712, "voted_up":

Just wow. I never expected to love a 2d platformer as much as I love Celeste. Celeste easily falls into one of my top ten games of all time. So, if you are looking to buy this, I give it a definite yes! Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. The levels are masterfully designed. Not one level have I looked at and thought to myself how bad of an idea it was to set up that way.\n\n2. The controls are crisp and fluid. Going from a dash to grabbing onto a wall and performing any action feels satisfying in every way.\n\n3. It is challenging in just the right way. The base levels are very fun and pretty hard, but if that doesn't scratch your itch, then there are plenty of b-side levels to try your hand at (these levels are BRUTAL).\n\n4. I actually enjoy the story that follows the game, it isn't huge or complicated, but simple and heartwarming. The characters are cute and loveable.\n\nMUST BUY", "timestamp_created": 1517734535, "timestamp_updated": 1517734535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39837385": {"recommendationid": "39837385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056247846", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519193776}, "language": "english", "review": "BUY THIS GAME.\n\nWhile the movement options in Celeste are minimal - you only have a jump and a dash - the extent to which the developers push these mechanics is mind blowing. There were multiple times where I thought a secret was impossible to obtain, but a slight variation in movement revealed a nuance behind the movement that had existed since the beginning of the game, but only became necessary now. Celeste's ability to repeatedly teach these nuances through level design rather than explicit instruction is thoroughly impressive.

From the moment I took my first jump, I fell in love with the satisfying way its protagonist, Madeline, feels to control; soon after I fell just as hard for the charming world she inhabits. But Celeste also caught me off guard with a relevant and emotional story about the pressures of modern life. What\u2019s remarkable is that the story isn\u2019t told in the background or overlaid on top of the action with constant interruption, but seamlessly and thoughtfully blended into the level design using both subtle themes and overt conversations.

The story is really good? Not going to spoil it but yeah I enjoyed it a lot. Great characters and pretty relateable, and pretty surprising for this kind of game as well. The atmosphere is pretty dang fantastic? Like especially in level 5, geez, but just in general the levels each have a lot of personality to them. And the music's great too, personal favorite is the B-side track for level 5 but there's so much good music here.\n\nOkay anyways onto the gameplay. The core movement mechanics alone support a lot of interesting level design and then each level has several extra mechanics on top of that, almost all of which work great with the basic movement mechanics themselves. The game plays smooth as butter and the level design is smart, rarely having instances where you'd have to wait or stop moving at all. No bosses, no autoscrollers, just constant enjoyable platforming challenges. There's maybe a small handful of rooms I wasn't a fan of (level 3 b-side and a few rooms in level 7 b-side come to mind) but so much of the game is good and has a great difficulty curve throughout that the small nitpicks hardly matter.\n\nAnd on top of that it's got a great exploration aspect to it, the levels are not necessarily linear to begin with all the time but have a lot of secret rooms hidden away with various collectibles, including some really devilishly hidden ones that make interesting use of the game's mechanics or have some unique puzzle surrounding them. And this is kept strictly to the a-side of the level where exploration is most encouraged, leaving the more demanding levels as straightforward tests of skill.\n\nIt's just... a really great game all around, reminds me a lot of Dustforce even though they don't play particularly similarly, but it's definitely as smart as that game and maybe even better on the whole, who knows.

They're so tight you can't even use them. At least not with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nKeybinds are seemingly possible to change, so I changed the movement keys to WASD instead of the arrow keys. Gripe #1: I had to change every key individually because the devs didn't think about usability. \n\nI didn't get to play more than 2 minutes (including gripe #2:  2-3 annoying and infantile cutscenes that you have to press escape AND another key to skip) before an in-game tutorial told me to click \"sideways arrowkey + X to dash\". I don't know about everyone else, maybe they have some alien keyboards but I have never seen a sidesways arrow on a keyboard in my life. Nevertheless I tried every combination imaginable, both intuitive ones and the most retarded ones I could think of, but nothing happened. Gripe #3, as I couldn't dash, I couldn't get past the level and continue the game.\n\nThis is where the real shitshow started. So I went to the in-game keyboard settings yet again to change back to the arrowkeys for movement. I figured they couldn't program properly and maybe changing back to default movement keys would make it work. \n\nSomehow, changing to default movement messed everything up and I couldn't use the 'down' function anymore. Which means I couldn't navigate the menu or do anything. Which means gripe #4. It seems like the 'x' key is now bound to the down function as well as the back function, and the back function is the only one that works. I have no idea how this is possible, the only thing I know is that the devs didn't add failsafes.\n\nSo I uninstalled the game, and reinstalled. I did this 4 times until I realized that the Steam Cloud would not let me completely uninstall all game files, and the game would continue to load the messed up keyboard settings everytime i reinstalled the game. \n\nSo I tried disabling the Steam cloud. And tried playing offline. That seemed to work (just tried navigating the menu again and it worked), until I went online again and Steam forced me to sync to the old cloud files even though I disabled this function.\n\n\nAlso, gripe #5, everytime you start the game, the credits are rolling. That's pretty arrogant, but makes sense seeing  as everything else about the games is dev-centered rather than user-centered.  Speaking of usability, you have to click a key to get to the main menu after starting the game. I guess the devs wanted to be different just for the sake of being different, or never played a game in their lives. Maybe the didn't know how to make the game menu appear as soon as you started the game.\n\nTLDR: Controls don't work and there's no way to fix it because the developers didn't add failsafes, and Steam Cloud sucks ass. Devs obviously don't understand the importance of usability and didn't think of the end user when creating this game. So I assume it's a case of: No great loss.", "timestamp_created": 1517676562, "timestamp_updated": 1517676562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.213126", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39819728": {"recommendationid": "39819728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079346740", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517882209}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy 2D platformers or speed games, you shouldn't pass this one up. Hell, you should consider it even if you're only looking for a good story, because this game has it all. It's difficult, but almost never feels unfair, and you learn the mechanics of the game by playing, rather than by tutorial screen. Although Madeline's moveset may feel small at first, there is a lot of depth to your movement options, and each level has a unique mechanic to it that expands on your moveset in interesting ways.\n\nThere are lots of collectibles to find in the form of strawberries, and while they are technically optional, this where a large amount of the gameplay comes from. In this game, when you find a secret area, you are rewarded with a challenge for a strawberry, rather than just a strawberry. It feels rewarding to prove your skill at the game, rather than your skill at finding secrets. Deaths don't feel too punishing, either, quickly putting you back into the action at the start of the room your were in.\n\nThe pixel art is wonderfully done, and the music is incredible. I don't really know how to describe it well, so just go watch the trailer if you don't believe me. And there's also a good story in this game, which is uncommon in 2D platformers in my experience. It's deeper than a \"save the princess\" story; there are real and relateable themes in Celeste.\n\nTL;DR: Amazing gameplay, great story, wonderful presentation, and rewarding collectibles. 10/10.\n\nOh, and I should mention that the devs have been awesome about interacting with the community. Speedrunners have been finding small issues all over the place, but the developers are quick to fix them and have been listening to our suggestions.", "timestamp_created": 1517675234,

a masterpiece. It is very obvious that the creators of this game put their heart and soul to create something that could only be described an experience that is well needed. The mechanics are incredibly tight, everything feels fluid, and throughout the course of the game there is constant stream of new mechanics that are being effortlessly sewn into the game. \n\nStory- This genuinely came a surprise to me, the story revolves around madeline, who is determined to reach the top mount celeste. She initially comes off as a character who has likely climbed a mountain or two in her day, and this is just mountain that she wants to tackle. But as you progress through the game you see Madeline's character develop into something that is heart wrenchingly relatable, and this mountain is more to her than saying that she climbed that mountain itself. The game also features a lovable cast of supporting characters that are very well written, everyone is lovable from the start\n\nMusic- The OST for this game is absolutely outstanding, every part of the soundtrack sets the perfect scene for whats going in the game and amplifies it ten fold. I was finding myself wanting to progress through the game not just because it was fun, but because i wanted to hear the next part of the soundtrack. It was obvious from the get go that Lena Raine poured her heart and soul into this OST, and even if you were to decide to not pick up the game, at least listen to the soundtrack.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517653485, "timestamp_updated": 1517653485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39811362": {"recommendationid": "39811362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984170060", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517651883}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a difficult game but it makes life a bit easy for you - one of the features I appreciated the most was how the game saves at each new screen.

Each chapter is broken down into a bunch of mini sections that all have a checkpoint at the very beginning, meaning that no matter how challenging each section is, you can keep trying over and over again until you beat it. The game is very forgiving in that regard.\n\nThis game is like someone teaching you how to write sentences, but before writing sentences, you first need to learn the alphabet. In the first third of the game, each section is teaching you a different letter of the alphabet. \n\n\"Oh, what is that 'E'? That doesn't look like 'E' at all. You better keep practicing writing that 'E' until you write it [i]perfectly[/i].\" \n\"Finished perfecting that 'E'? Good! Let's move on to 'F' next!\"\n\nSometimes, if you were an excellent letter writer, the game trusts you enough to begin forming words before you finish mastering the alphabet to give you a harder challenge. Sometimes you'll fail to make words, and that's okay. You're still learning, after all.\n\nOnce you master writing the alphabet, you've beaten the main game. The second third of the game has you putting together letters of the alphabet to form words, but you better make sure you wrote all those letters [i]perfectly[/i], or else you gotta to rewrite the whole word. \n\nAt this point, Celeste doesn't trust you to write sentences by yourself. This time, you need to master writing ALL the words in the dictionary before you can begin making sentences.\n\nFor beginners, this game is a masterful teaching tool. [b]Celeste makes sure that you're good enough at its mechanics before letting you try a level that uses said mechanics. It makes sure you know how to write the necessary letters before writing the words that uses those letters[/b] This is the heart of its design. However, this design didn't work for me.\n\nI already know how to write letters. Maybe Celeste has some new words for me to write, that's fine. But when can I start writing sentences? What was that? I can't yet? What do you mean I need to write all these words [i]perfectly[/i] first? I don't care if I'm not ready to write sentences. Sometimes I just want to try something difficult every once in a while.\n\nWriting words all the time is boring. Some words are challenging, sure, but I don't feel rewarded for writing it correctly. They're just words. \n\nSentences is where the fun is at, and that's exactly what the last third of the game is. After FINALLY mastering how to write every word in the dictionary, Celeste lets you write all the sentences you want, and it's a blast. I've never had more fun writing sentences in my life. \n\nTL;DR Needs more sentences mixed in with the words. Words are boring.\n\n\n\nCeleste fails to properly reward you for completing its challenges in the first 2 thirds of the game. The majority of the challenges are too short to feel like an accomplishment, and the infinite and VERY frequent checkpoints makes most of them trivial. This is what makes this game perfect for beginners to the platformer genre. It properly tests you to make sure you've learned the necessary mechanics before letting you attempt a more diffcult challenge that uses those mechanics.\n\nThe last third of the game has brutally difficult challenges with practically no checkpoints, and that's what makes it so great.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to everyone.

My other favorite parts is how the game motivates you throughout the experience to cheer you on as you get through it knowing well that it's hard and the advanced moves that the game teaches you throughout the experience.\n\nThe game is getting a lot of praise from reviewers recently with a 90 on metacritic and Overwhelmingly positive on steam, is it really worth the hype?  In my opinion I feel so but as is for most games don't set your expectations to the moon and expect it to deliver.  What you see is what you get but what you're getting is a competently made platformer.\n\nWhile the game is hard the majority of it is solving simple puzzles to discover how you're supposed to tackle a platforming challenge instead of pixel-perfect-precision which is reserved for some of the unlockable challenge levels (there's an assist mode in which you can bypass any insurmountable challenge if need be).   I also love how the game handles strawberries in which an average player can find all of them without having to look them up.  However, some of the crystal hearts tend to suffer from being very cryptic to unlock but if you're a great problem-solver (aka not me) you should be fine.\n\nIt took me 6 hours to beat the game and 22 hours to 100% the achievements but considering how fun the advanced moves are and how you progressively get to be very good at the game I can see myself returning to this in the future.  There's even a late-game incentive towards doing the levels deathless for a true challenge, I wonder if it changes the game's ending?", "timestamp_created": 1517608262, "timestamp_updated": 1517608262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528986", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39799394": {"recommendationid": "39799394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118141511", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519694987}, "language": "english", "review": "A difficult platformer with amazing music and gorgeous colourful pixel art.

Okay, where to start. Well, first I want to say spoilers ahead for anyone who hasn't played it and/or hasn't beat it.\n\nSo, what I have been hearing are about the controls, they are actually quite fluent for me, since I am using a controller and not the keyboard. The game is better if you have a controller, it's much easier. This is basically the only gameplay problem I've seen.\n\nFirst off, the character design is great, funny and lovable the same, [spoiler]especially the supposed, villian of the game, she actually turns good and helps throughout the near end of the game[/spoiler]. I know people really don't care about the story or the characters when they are just speeding through the game just to get it done, but I just wanted to take a sec to just want to applaud for what this game offers.\n\nThe level design is wonderful, even if you are or you aren't going for the strawberries, cassette tapes, and/or crystal hearts in each level, they use each thing you have learned from each level throughout it, even the teaching new things along the way. Like in the first level, it teaches you easily that springs restore a dash when bounced on, dashes can be only used once, and for the second half (or the third level) about the momentum of the platforms launches you farther than a normal jump. But most people already know that.\n\nKnowing this is all I can spout out, you'll have a fun time with this game, it's just when it comes to getting to the final level of the game, it's kind of need to collect a few more things.

Your only moves are to jump, to dash and to climb, and with it you will conquer a multitude of dangerous levels and pitfalls. The game also features optional B- and C-Side levels and strawberries to collect. The graphics are charming, and the soundtrack is a masterpiece.\n\nI completed the entire game (collecting all collectible strawberries except the golden ones which you can only get by completing a level without dying, as well as completing all B-Sides), but the C-Sides are what broke me in the end, particularly the Level 7 one - an ungodly amount of hard, for sure, but only if you seek the challenge. The actual story areas are in the range of easy to slightly difficult most of the time, which is perfect.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that some rooms require almost \"too\" much precision. That can make the difficulty of those rooms feel almost cheap, though this is a rare occurence. The controls are very precise and spot on, but aligning your character with the smallest of holes can often feel like luck, as your hitbox is kind of hard to make out sometimes when you dash across the room. Additionally, swerving your character left and right can sometimes feel very imprecise. That is especially an issue in some of the C-Side areas, the hardest areas in the game.\n\nGet this game if you enjoy a lovingly crafted platformer with a large host of optional, difficult challenges.\n\n[b]Personal Rating: 8.5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1517557100, "timestamp_updated": 1517557201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39785228": {"recommendationid": "39785228", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999092994", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517988340}, "language": "english", "review": "yo this game is legit. mechanical precision and fluidity of SMB with a heartfelt story and great music to boot.", "timestamp_created": 1517556830, "timestamp_updated": 1517556830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39784315": {"recommendationid": "39784315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071559383", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519324853}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6c89\u8ff7\u6536\u96c6\u8349\u8393\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u62d4", "timestamp_created": 1517552548, "timestamp_updated": 1517552548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39783405": {"recommendationid": "39783405", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999665575", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517632593}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the atmosphere of the game, quite challenging, great mechanics.

Controls are tight and snappy, visuals are soft and pleasing and the soundtrack + SFX are phenomenal.\n\nA lot of other platformers have the tendency to reward the player with more challenges, whether by unlocking bonus stages or reaching a new area but with Celeste you get so much more than that. You get introduced to a small but memorable cast of characters that progressively develop and push a narrative that gives the stages and challenges you face a lot more meaning.\n\nWithout going into specifics for the sake of keeping the game as spoiler-free as possible, Celeste reflects upon hurdles we all face in day-to-day life, how we cope with them and how we overcome mental barriers. It's a game of patience and persistence that encourages you to observe and explore your surroundings.\n\nWith an inbuilt assist mode, options to remove screen shaking and even a speedrun mode to better streamline the play experience, Celeste has taken great steps toward making itself as accessible as possible to a wide audience.

However, if you've never heard of this game but love tough platformers, GET TO KNOW IT! It's an absolute masterpiece in multiple ways. \n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story itself isn't insanely big but the story that's there is pretty much perfect for the setting. You're thrown into climbing a mountain without knowing truly why. A mountain..? Seems normal right? NOPE nothing about this story is normal and that's exactly why it's so good. It picks up nicely and every stage makes you more curious about the next. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nI mean, I am a huge lover of pixel art in general... but the atmosphere set in this game with the graphics alone is a tremendous feat alone. It's absolutely adorable, pretty and very clear. I'd give this a 10/10. Just wait till you get to the third stage before you set your opinion. (:\n\n[b]Characters[/b] \nNot much to say, the main character is super adorable and possibly for some relatable as well. The other characters are equally adorable and interesting. Amazing character progression for how small the ''actual'' game is. More about the ''actual'' part later.  \n\n[b]Music[/b] \nBest music i've heard in a long time for games. First time I am tempted to actually buy the soundtrack. 10/10.\n\n[b]Controls[/b]\nInsanely tight. Can't be better, feels fluent and fun. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nOh boy, where do I even begin? The gameplay is if I had to describe it in one word '\"Satisfying'' every single move you do is deliberate snappy and good. There's a good sense of progression and the game ramps up in difficulty quite nicely. I HIGHLY recommend to avoid the extra stages if you're more of a casual player because they can be extremely difficult. \n\nThere is a TON of collectibles to find in neat little puzzles/secret stages and other crazy stuff. They are not required for finishing the story, but add a lot of gameplay and replay value to the game. There are STILL secrets out there nobody has found out about yet and it's crazy fun. Everytime you think it's over or something can't surprise you any more.. it does. HARD. \n\nNew elements/mechanics introduced in every new stage you play. None of them feel gimmicky or forced, they're all incredibly fun to try out and play with.\n\n[b]Overall score for me[/b]\nA definite 10/10 but certainly NOT for very casual players. Be aware that this game is quite a challenge. \n\nOne last note, there's an assist mode in the game which you can't turn off... but if you're unable to beat the game you can enable it and basically give yourself ''cheats'' to experience the rest of the game that way. So in the end, it's still approachable by all if needed.  \n\nBUY IT!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517496002, "timestamp_updated": 1517496002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

platforming fan, but still.\n\nThere's no combat, no upgrade system, no huge save-the-world plot. It's just you, the mountain, and whatever obstacles you may face while attempting to climb it, including yourself.\n\nFirst of all, the art. It's mostly pixel art. Yeah it's 2018 and everyone knows indie devs here and there use pixel art as a cheap and effective way to represent their game. C'mon, everybody knows it's not to \"evoke feelings of nostalgia from the gud ol' days\". This game though, despite using pixel art as well, does it right. Everything is beautifully drawn and animated. Maps feel alive and hazards stand out fairly well while still not looking out of place in the world itself. When I said it's mostly pixel art I meant the creators actually used different artstyles in a few places: The world map in completely 3D, and menus and speech bubbles are a more modern, smooth-edged 2D artstyle. It all matches up pretty well and looks very good. \n\nThe story is nothing huge, nothing innovative, but I feel it is worth mentioning. While not being the main focus of the game, it still manages to deliver a very good cast of characters, each with a different and interesting personality(ies hehe). Some minor characters are simply mentioned, but you still feel that the fact they're even there is what builds this world as just a place that exists and your character happened to be at, which I feel is also kind of the point of the story. Not much to say about it, to be honest, but like everything else about this work of art, it's well thought out and had some, if not a lot of work put into it.\n\nThe SOUND is fantastic. Celeste has a lot of music in it, and it always matches the mood of the situation it's played in very well, enhancing it. The sound effects don't fall short either, with footsteps and \"climbing sounds\" that differ based on what kind of surface your character is on, down to places where you'll probably walk on just once for a second or two in the whole game. All other sounds are fantastically in place as well, not feeling unpleasant to hear or repetitive, especially considering you'll hear some of them A LOT (the dash and the death SFX come to mind).\n\nThe looks may catch your eye, the story might make you want to keep going, and the sounds and music may want you to just keep listening to them, but you'll stay for the gameplay. Featuring a very simple system of 8-way dashes, wall jumping and stamina-based wall-climbing, that's all you have in the beginning of the game and is all you'll have all the way until the end. Don't underestimate this, though, as the map itself provides you with creative ways to use those abilities, with everchanging mechanics that are introduced on every new level. The map design is impeccable. I was sure no one could come up with interesting level design for platformers anymore, as they have been around for so long and so many platformers have already come out, but they did it. The feeling of having gotten a little bit better at the game after every screen you manage to platform through is something that games that are also this challenging and fast-paced rarely manage to deliver nowadays. It's also worth mentioning that Celeste has plenty of accessibility options. If the controls feel too limiting or a section is too hard, there are optional toggles that make life easier for those who are having trouble, being introduced without feeling condescending or blocking you from getting achievements which, in my opinion, is great. You can go through the main game and have a lot of fun, but also search in every nook and cranny for secrets that give you more challenging platforming sections, not to mention the \"B-Sides\", which are much, MUCH harder versions of the levels they mirror.

It's not even close. I know it's not really fair to compare these games because they all do very different things and will appeal to different people individually but for me, Celeaste blows every 2-D platformer out of the water. Hollow knight will appeal to people who prefer combat and boss fights, while Ori will appeal to more people who prefer puzzle solving. The gameplay in Celeste is most similar to Super Meat Boy because it only has very few movement abilities but the game just continues to build on them in brilliant ways which will continue to suprise you in every level.\n\nThis game also has a pretty good story, which is something that I didn't expect at all.

It's a game about overcoming personal challenges, both in gameplay and in story. The difficulty of the game lies not in imprecise controls, like with Human Fall Flat, but with varied and interesting level design. In most games, deaths feel like failure and are portrayed as negative, with Game Over screens and perhaps some blood and gore, or maybe a bit of waiting around for things in the level to move into place. This game treats death differently. The animation for dying is quick, and you respawn quickly. Moving elements in the level are reset so you can immediately start moving again, without having to wait for things to line up. The music in the background doesn't reset, which is important for feeling a sense of continuity. Frequent checkpoints make death less painful, and death becomes an opportunity to practice platforming skills rather than a punishment for sub-par gameplay.\n\nStory-wise, the player character deals with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and low self-esteem. A character she meets on her way up the mountain copes with the passing on of a loved one and the search for a meaning in existence. Yet another character faces... faces a sort of kodokushi, and the bittersweet feeling of seeing a treasured thing fade from its former glory. He's hard for me to describe, but he is no less realistic than any other character. They all have unique situations that they need to personally handle, and the writing recognizes that. I like this game because it does that, and does it well. Entire chapters or sequences of them are themed around these characters, with their own color palettes, sound design, music, level design, and game mechanics.\n\nIf the platforming itself is too difficult, as it likely is for many potential buyers, you can go into Assist Mode and change the game speed, number of air dashes, or invincibility. This changes the game from a difficult platformer to an exploration game, but doesn't trivialize gameplay or level design. Despite the fact that death can be rendered impotent, there are still puzzles that need to be solved in order to progress through a level, switches that must be pressed and collectibles to be found. That is my favorite part of this game; even when one of the central mechanics is removed, this game is still enjoyable. This game can fit into two genres, that of difficult platforming and of leisurely exploration. This duality mirrors the physical and mental representations of the mountain that the characters face in the story, and makes the game accessible for more casual or less able players. This game isn't just about difficult platforming, and I commend it for that.\n\nThank you for reading my review, and I welcome any criticisms or comments you may have.", "timestamp_created": 1517431277, "timestamp_updated": 1517431277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810877", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39755070": {"recommendationid": "39755070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024933857", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 253, "last_played": 1520786648}, "language": "german", "review": "Habe erst wenig gespielt, bin aber bislang sehr Fan.

Why is she climbing the mountain?\nTo hug the mountain. To envelop that mountain. Why is she climbing the mountain? Because she's in love.\n\nI think this game is my new obsession. We'll have to see, it's only been two days and I've ended up putting things I thought were pretty neat before back on the shelf well before finishing them. But something about Celeste feels really special. Usually games at this difficulty level have me wanting to throw things before too long, grimly bearing my way through challenge after torturous challenge. But somehow, here, I find myself really getting into the \"challenge accepted\" mindset. Failure doesn't feel like failure, it really feels like learning. Every death leads naturally to introspection on what went wrong, corrective plans to to make it better, and a slightly refined execution. Until eventually, success, exhilarating success! Every time, I really feel like I've overcome something, not just survived it. But the real magic starts happening when you try the level again.\n\nI remember approaching my first B-side with a little bit of dread, I heard they were going to be really hard. They ARE really hard. But at the end of an hour and several hundred deaths, my feeling wasn't \"ugh I'm so glad THAT's over\" but \"holy crap I can't believe I just did that, some of those platforming sections were INSANE!\" And then later today I realized I wanted to play it again. It was much easier the second time, still incredibly difficult but now difficulty with familiarity. I could see just how much better I'd gotten at the game for having played through it (and B-side 2 in between, which was thrilling), and all this just in the course of an afternoon and evening! As difficult as Celeste is, it also really wants you to become good at it, because it is so enjoyable to be good at.\n\nPart of this is down to really tight controls. With a limited amount of verbs and a high degree of responsiveness, every death feels like a place where YOU made a mistake and can do better next time. But this really comes through in the Assist Mode, which is basically a built in trainer. The game doesn't want you to feel ashamed of not being good enough, whether just for now or ever, so it doesn't lock any content behind skill, and you can fine tune the assistance to whatever level you need. My wife, who died several times in the prologue section, can and possibly will play through this stupidly difficult game all the way to the end. And even for me, wanting to prove to myself I can surmount any challenge, sometimes it's fun to relax and just explore a level without worrying about dying.

There's Strawberries, Hearts, and B-Side tapes. The Strawberries are just personal difficulty markers and have no added benefit for the game besides satisfying your pride. There's one Heart in each stage and each one is very hard to obtain. Getting them will unlock a post-game bonus, but it's not required so don't worry too much on your first playthrough. There is also one B-Side tape per stage, and they unlock a harder version of the stage you're on. You can play these from the menu after beating the stage, and each B-Side Stage has a remixed version of the stage theme.\n\nAll in all I think the game is well worth the price.

What I didn't expect was the game ost : it's phenomenal. The last things that got me was the story, I won't spoil anything, but it's interesting, and beautifully told. I have a hard time finding a bad thing to say about the game, so I'll just imagine what people could dislike about it:\n- It may be too hard for some people (I died 1200 time on my first run, it's that kind of game, it was really fun to play but I know people who aren't into die and retry games)\n- it may be a little short for the money for others, I don't think it is, but most modern games have to be 60+ hours for people to be happy about the length. As for me I'd gladly pay 20 euros for 10 hours of gaming, if those 10 hours were as intense and fun as this game.

I completed most of the b-sides (unlockables that let u play a way harder version of the level) and i finished part 8 aswell (play the game to find out what it is)\n\nGraphics are amazing. it really gives you this retro feeling and the colour choices and backgrounds are stunning. sometimes i even had to stop and just admire it.

Today I will be reviewing Celeste, let\u2019s get to it.\n\nThis game kept its promise. By providing the upmost of challenges after playing games like Super Meat Boy, Celeste felt more like it and I was able to get to the controls with ease. Plus, they are rather simplistic, which makes it easier to play, but for some people, hard to master.\n\nThe game is for mixed players in my opinion , which means it has some beginner elements, but as the game progresses, it deffinetly gives you a punch in the chest if you fell or you perished like the million of users playing this addicting game. It is however the magic of learning after each and every death you have, that gives he most satisfaction after completing a section or an entire level, The game doesn\u2019t seek to punish you, at least in its base storyline level. But it does a great job teaching and refining things like strafe jumping and precise timing, reflexes and to analyze. \n\nNot to mention, I can\u2019t begin how to describe the soundtrack. It is honestly the best thing I\u2019ve heard since ages. from calm classic piano, romantic guitar and chill-thrilling intense retro music that makes your heart bump the second you hear them. Of course depending on the dialogue, the game pushes it soundtrack to the dark side or with the piano, giving it a creepy aspect with feels that of a visual novel. Truly the best thing about Celeste, without a doubt.\n\nThe game, it is definitely fun for everyone, especially those who love platformers, here\u2019s why. The game provides a balanced amount of challenges, starting from the main story path, to optionally set yourself on a detour apart from the main story levels with the purpose of collecting Strawberries and unlocking secrets.\n\nThe game really surprised me in its mechanics and the storyline, it was written so well, I got deep feelings when I reached certain parts because of how beautiful and how it\u2019s hidden meaning lies within the purpose of the climb. It is quite the pack over the hundreds and hundreds of levels this game has and its great level designs. It was consistent, and it pushed me to not only do better in the game, but to find out about the ending, not giving up in each Chapter. I enjoy every second playing this game. You can also replay chapters in the many different scenes to easily advance through your favorite levels.\n\nWhen I first saw the game trailer back in December, I knew this game was going to be hard, but I did not know how great the story, characters and more like the ambiance and level designs was going to be like. it was not hard, it was Satisfyingly difficult. I love how the game developer in one of the postcards about the Death Counter, he tells you to be proud of it. but I realized that I had underestimated him and that I was wrong. Since you respawn quickly, you wont have a hard time trying to apply what you learned from your previous mistake, whether it is at midway, at end, or merely at the beginning of a Chapter, you don\u2019t lose progress either thanks to the handy Auto-Save Feature within the game. I was also surprised me with the boss fights. I thought these were going to be simple, but they were challenging, and I like that. if you know your peripherals and know your reflexes, you\u2019ll be okay. However, sometimes it takes A single frame to mess up if not timed correctly.\n\nI love the moral of this story and it\u2019s lesson. This game.. funnily enough.. this game taught me how to breathe. To not let my anxiety or my desperation by all means not get to my head, and to think straight, to keep my cool. And to think that I can make it, to set a determined goal.\n\nI love the personality of the characters, even one of them had a Pop Culture personality and I\u2019d say Madeline is pretty much relatable with most teenagers. Another character had me searching up the definitions of words because I wouldn\u2019t understand their philosophy, but once I did search up the words, I understood clearly what they meant and followed up with the story. \n\nI invested around 10 hours to beat the game, and despite my timespan, It is honestly quite impressive of me making through. I had also finished it with a total of 63 Strawberries and more than 1465 deaths using a DualShock 4 Controller. Honestly, for being my first run, I was really proud of that, however, my journey doesn\u2019t end there, I still have yet to make it through the B-Sides. And the Infamous C-Sides which are much harder than the original versions of the levels.\n\nSo, as for Ratings, this game by far.. the best indie game I\u2019ve played, it is a masterpiece for its story, soundtrack and overwhelming level designs. So what do you think?

That may sound weird but it works very well in practice. All of it looks nice and manages to fit together.\n\n[h1]Music and sound design[/h1]\nThe music is simply amazing and I would really suggest buying the soundtrack on bandcamp. The sounds are satisfying and never get annoying. I also love the voices of the characters.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nIt's interesting, emotional and integrated perfectly into the gameplay. The characters are likeable and they all feel natural.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nTight and responsive. Very simple yet effective. Haven't had any problems with them myself, no death felt like the controls were at fault. I've been playing with keyboard. I did rebind almost all the buttons immediately because the default layout seemed weird to me.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe levels are very fun and well-designed. They can get pretty challenging later on but they are always fair. The different gimmicks of every area are creative and interesting.\nThe difficulty of the late-game content is very high but there is an assist mode for players who want to have it easier.\nAbout the length of the game: There are 8 chapters and it should take the average player about 8 hours to complete these (the main storyline). However, every chapter also has about 20-40 collectible strawberries and each one offers a small extra challenge or puzzle to complete. There is also something called a \"B-Side\" for every chapter. An unlockable set of more difficult levels that usually takes quite a bit longer to complete than the A-Side. There are some other extra challenges and collectibles as well (I won't spoil them) which probably brings the overall time you can get out of this game to 18+ hours (not including the ridiculously hard to get golden strawberries). I myself acquired all the achievements within 22 hours.\n\n[h1]Minor complaints[/h1]\nOne aspect I don't like is that using assist mode doesn't disable achievements, though that is just my personal opinion.\nSome may not enjoy having to redo chapters or parts of them to collect everything they missed the first time through. I don't mind this that much personally because that's just how it is if you wanna collect everything in a game.\nThe boosted wall jump is not explained very well but the devs also acknowledged this and apparently plan on improving it.\nOther than that, there are a few bugs and crashes here and there as with every game but they are minor and uncommon.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nDefinitely an amazing game and I can only recommend it, especially if you're a fan of these kinds of games.

If you're a fan of difficult platformers then I cannot recommend it enough. It features:\n1) Awesome level design (very pretty, but also fun and challenging)\n2) Really tight controls \n3) A high skill-cap (there's a LOT of movement tech that you learn as you play)\n4) A nice soundtrack \n5) A TON of extra challenges available for those who want them. The main storyline took about 6 hours for me to get through, and at the time I thought I had collected most of the extra stuff (about 140/175 strawberries). Turns out I wasn't even close to clearing all the content. There's a bunch of extra levels with harder and harder challenges.\n\nA couple downsides:\n1) To unlock the coolest stuff you have to do a bunch of exploring and solve some riddles. I was pretty uninterested in this, so I just looked it all up online. It took maybe 30 mins or an hour to go through it, which was kind of annoying.\n2) There's some pretty bad screen shake. It makes sense to have the screen shake a little to emphasize big moments, but this game goes overboard. Especially for the green crystals that recharge your jump. It can get really disorienting and cause some frustrating deaths.\n\nOverall: This is my favorite game in years.

It actually has a bit of a parallel with Silent Hill 2, minus the evil cult energies and whatnot. The hero is called to a mystical place where they are tormented by a manifestation of their inner demons and must look inward to ultimately confront and defeat them. Of course, Celeste is much more light-hearted than Silent Hill. [spoiler] Without wishing to spoil, it's a tale about depression and the main character's decision to defeat it.

If you are anything like myself you spend the time going through reviews and whatnot and trying to determine if it it's worth it. I did the exact same with this game and let me tell you, the $20 was VERY well spent. I'm 23 hours in as of writing this review, and have completed the main game and 170/175 strawberries (little mini-challenges within the levels, I'm sure you know how that works.) and am currently going through the b-sides (challenges unlocked by finding cassette tapes within each level, which grants a second level, called a b-side, that's almost 5 times as difficult as the original level. These levels are based purely on getting through, and there are no strawberries, but they are still incredibly difficult) For a platformer, this game has a surprising amount of content in it, and it controls so smoothly that I can't logically not recommend it to anyone who likes platformers. And even if you DON'T typically like platformers, I still recommend this game. I'm in the same boat of usually not liking platformers, but after seeing dunkey's review I decided to pick it up. This is one of the first platformers I've ever played (Super mario games in my childhood make up all the rest) and I still fell in love with it, although I've been unable to appreciate any platformer before it. Definitely going down as one of my favorite games. The only downsides to it I've found were mechanics within chapters 4, 5, and 6 (out of 7 total, with 1 bonus, and b-sides for all of them) which were wind, annoying chase enemies, and an annoying block mechanic, respectively. But even with these mechanics which I didn't enjoy all that much, I still enjoyed the chapters, and will still remember the whole game fondly.\n\nTL;DR\n-\"It's good\" - person who doesn't usually like platformers\n-\"It's good\" - Dunkey\n-\"It's good\" - Pretty much everyone with a brain except that one dude in the reviews who was hella salty that it was some feminist sjw bullshit, and spent $20 just to say that.

I hesitate to say whether the gameplay or the story is the highlight here, because the two are so inseperable that it's hard to tell which compels me to keep climbing the most.\n\nTo clarify, that's a good thing, because on their own both elements have struck an amazing balance. This game is all about dying until you get it right, which might be offputting for some but rest assured there is a distinct lack of frustration attached to this game. Each level has this difficulty ramp-up within the individual chapters, culminating in a very steady difficulty curve leading up to the final level's big finale. It feels very natural, but you're still going to die a lot.\n\nAnd if the base game wasn't enough for you, there are also hard mode versions of every major chapter which seriously put your skills to the test in a completely remixed version of the vanilla map - without all of the collectibles (thank god).\n\nMusic is a 10/10 - it does exactly what it needs to do and then some\n\nSound design is a 10/10 - Nothing sounds out of place and all of it is unique from level to level\n\nGameplay is a 9/10 - Lowest score here - only because of a couple non-intuitive aspects of character movement which don't become apparent until very late game. Extremely solid other than a few minor gripes of mine\n\nArtstyle is wonderful. You'll be drawn in by the uniqueness of every level.\n\nStory is, surprisingly, wonderful.

The levels are designed with the mario philosophy of introducing mechanics in each chapter, slowley building off of it with more creative and unique twists, then discarding it to be replaced with the next chapters gimmick, keeping the whole game fun and interesting. not once was I bored when playing the main story of celeste, and also when doing the post game content. The main stages have brilliantly designed challenges, focusing on creativly using your moveset, instead of cheap pixel perfect jumps. The stages are a lot of really tiny rooms that are connected to form the chapter. you will never loose a large amount of progress when dying, so it encurages risky play, and experimentation. the game even reminds you in one of the loading screens to be proud of your death count, because everytime you die, you learn somethign new. The game is also very long, with 7 chapters, a bonus chapter, bonus \"B sides\" of every chapter, including the bonus chapter (kinda like dark levels), as well as over 100 strawberries to collect by doing bonus challenges in hidden rooms, as well as crystal hearts in every chapter that were a joy finding. not only that, there are also the super secret \"C side\" chapters that I have heard are incredibly challenging. \n\nCeleste is one of the best games in the genre, with very few flaws (I wouldn't be able to name any). anyone who likes platformers should get this game, and will be more than satisfied with the amount of content you will recieve for only 20 dollars.

This is the best $21.99 CAD I have ever spent! What a fantastic game!\n\nThe story is surprisingly good for what is present. The dialogue is well written and clever. But we all know, story isn't why you'd buy a game like this.\n\nThe platforming is very polished and smooth. The movement and reactions are instantaneous. The level design is perfect out of 10. There are enough levels to compliment every skill level from the most casual player to the most hardcore masochist.\n\nHaving just finished clearing 100% of the game, every achievement, every collectible, every secret, and clearing every stage, I am genuinely impressed! My thumbs are a little tender from 2 or 3 of those levels, but it was definitely time well spent.\n\nI am so impressed with this game! If the developers make any more like it, I'll be keeping a close eye from now on.\n\nMusic: 9.5 / 10 (only topped by Undertale and some classic RPGs)\n-The music is original and nostalgic, superb composition skills and theme matching for making it blend in with the game in every area.\n\nSound Effects: 9 / 10 Crisp and high quality, some are even very nostalgically recognizable. You better get accustomed to that death sound though, because it's loud and it will be happening a lot!\n\nArt: 9.5 / 10 Almost as good as it gets for 2D spriting and animations. The stages, backgrounds, UI and dialogues/portraits are all perfectly suitable for this game, the only thing I would nitpick on is the people sprites, including your character (not the portrait, the sprite you control). I'd like to see a little more detail in the character I'm controlling, while playing. The special effects are very modern and expertly executed.\n\nDifficulty: 9.8 / 10 Keeping in mind it doesn't have to get this difficult, in fact I'd say just beating the main story levels casually would rank around a 4.5 / 10 difficulty, but should you want to complete every stage and collect every item / achievement, this is what the difficulty would be rated.\n\nGameplay: 10 / 10 Polished, clean, responsive, nothing short of perfect. Every death is your own fault and a learning experience to improve your inputs the next time around. Constantly trains you.\n\nReplayability: 6 / 10 Once you beat it, there aren't very many reasons in-game competitively to keep you playing, since it is single player and the only global scores kept are deaths and strawberries collected, but these are measured as \"Steam Global\" and not best records or anything. It has some replayability as this game is a perfect candidate for speed running. Provides speedrun clock timers in-game and everything! Also a good game to race your friends in, as deaths are pretty much guaranteed unless you're some inhuman TAS bot or need to get a life!\n\n[b]Overall Rating: 8.96 / 10[/b]\n\nHaha, well thanks for reading. Trust me if you are into fun platformers with tight controls, this game is worth every single penny! Had I known what was in store when I was going to buy it, I would pay up to $34.99 CAD for it, easily. I very rarely buy games when they're not on sale but this one called out to me.

It's a beautiful game, a masterpiece, true work of passion. \n\nIt's a great achievement to get so much out of such minimalistic design. Celeste is full of surprises, it has pretty low entry point and it builds up new ways to use it's dashing mechanic till the very end. Levels are wonderfuly paced and they ramp up the challenge but I never felt like it got suddenly \"too hard\". Even the hard sequences were fun to play and repeat  since I felt like a ninja master when I finally finished them. \n\nLevel design is outstanding - there are always few ways to traverse the screen , even if new mechanics can feel awkward at first (looking at you - feather) but after few screens you're natural at using them. If you want more challenge you can search for hidden or hard to reach strawberries. I didn't get most of them in my first run, so now after finishing the game I'm doing a second one to collect all of them. There are tons of secrets and collectibles - my first run took me about 9 hours to complete, I bet you can squeeze additional 20 or more if you want to collect all strawberries, B-side tapes (unlocking harder versions of levels in chapters) and finishing those, which unlock extra epilogue chapter. \n\nThe art is vibrant and full of character. Chapters varry visually in interesting ways. Everything is readible and works well in this fast paced game. All acompanied with beautiful music - with unusual composition of chiptune and life piano, and outstanding sound design. \n\nStory was the biggest surprise to me. I didn't expect such engaging and heartfelt story in a simple platformer about climbing a mountain. I cared about the characters and the mountain is an intriguing place to visit. It's by far not a regular  mountain. Story is very nicely fit together with gameplay, there were few \"WOW\" moments when I played created with very clever and out of the box thinking. \n\nI've waited a long time for this one (ever since playing the original PICO-8 version) and I had high expectations, and yet Celeste was able to blow me away. I can't recommend it high enough! It's by far the best game I've played in years. \n", "timestamp_created": 1517134705, "timestamp_updated": 1517134705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

The characters are loveable and very life-like. Platforming is super fluid, each chapter introduces a unique mechanic, and there are optional hardcore challenges for people who like to be tortured. 10/10.\n\nReview made with avoiding spoilers in mind! If anything, i may have left vague hints here and there (to maybe peak your interest i hope)\n\n---Game duration breakdown---\nMain story: ~4hours for me (I spent a great deal of time hunting 140/175 strawberries while doing the main story)\nCollecting Crystal Hearts/175 Strawberries/Red Hearts: 10 hours\nFinishing the rest of the game that unlocked after collecting all Red Hearts (Yes, there is more than just B-side as you'll soon discover): 12 hours 51minutes\n----------------------------------\n\n:::::::::: Game mechanics\nAs many will note, this game is akin to other hardcore platformers like Wings of Vi and Momodora.\n\nLet me first break the connection by stating: Celeste has no attacking/fighting (Unless you count running into/occasional goomba stomping).\n\nThis leads to a much less complex game as you don't have to constantly worry about optimal damage output while dodging & platforming. They make up for this lack of complexity by adding in a unqiue mechanic for each chapter (ex: A feather to allow you to fly). In the main story, I found myself not really being challenged all too often. It wasn't until I attempted B-side version of each chapter that things became challegning and fun. After you complete all B-side versions, you see another side (see what i did there?) of the chapter that is even harder! This final version of the chapters was beyond my expectations, it was challenging and \"fresh\". By that I mean, the developers were teaching you new mechanics for the game up until the very end ... Imagine playing Super Mario and beating it, but then discovering Kaizo levels and learning how to shell jump --- not a new mechanic, just something difficult you've never needed to do before, but now you're doing it over and over again to beat the challenge stages!\n\nBecause B-side and the final version are all optional to the game's story. A novice player can enjoy the main story without being pressured to play the challenging levels, while those seeking torment (like me) can pursue the challenge stages. This opens Celeste up to players of all skill levels.\n\n:::::::::: Story + Characters\nThe characters and the main story development kept me going even though the main story wasn't difficult because they were so well executed. The characters felt alive, they had feelings, they had dreams, they were relatable and someone you could connect to/understand. Not to mention, the way the characters talked (squeaking/squeals) was a very cute touch. Character development was well executed; as you climbed up the mountain you learn more about your character and their ambitions. You learn about a dark past (which btw, would have loved to learn more about the person on the other end of the phone call in chapter 2), about this mysterious mountain's powers, and your traveling buddy Theo.\n\n:::::::::: Soundtrack\nI love music. This game has realllly great tunes. If I had only 3 words to describe the BGM in this game it'd be: REPEAT PLEASE, THANKS.\n\n:::::::::: Overall\nI would have loved for this game to include some more complexity like how Wings of Vi had Flutter or Dash... not to mention you have to attack while platforming. Or Momodora which involved taking advantages of your two different forms to best manuver around the platforms... and attack as well! But Celeste made up for the lack of combat with an amazing story and implementation of unique mechanics within each chapter. \n\nDefinitely would recommend this game to novice, expert, and daring platform gamers --- 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1517124707, "timestamp_updated": 1517126232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39674673": {"recommendationid": "39674673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025077373", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 88, "last_played": 1521399162}, "language": "english", "review": "Celeste is a challenging pixel-style platformer, with several interesting mechanics, quirky characters (loveable though) and a fun story.

It's hard as balls, has a beautiful retro style, incredible music, a cute and fairly meaningful story, and more secrets than you can shake a stick at. While your character is basically only equipped with the ability to hold onto and climb walls - though not forever; you've got a hidden stamina bar - and an airdash that recharges when you touch the ground, the various mechanics with which you'll interact throughout the game will keep your jaw on the floor the whole way through.\n\nI can't stress enough how good this game is. If you're a fan of difficult platformers in which you'll die hundreds (and thousands) of times before finishing them, this game is for you. That said, the game does an amazing job of introducing mechanics and teaching you the ropes, and there is an assist mode which allows you to modify the game parameters and explore the mountain at your own pace.\n\nI'd gush more, but that takes away from time I could be playing the game.

I saw a clip of it on YouTube, and immediately bought this game.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n\nThe graphics for this game are delightful. They're simple, yet have so much hidden detail in them. Nothing seems forced, and anything that has an icon is a clear, directional hint to something important you need to know. Even the hidden areas aren't THAT hidden once you look closely. The overall atmosphere is unique with each level, and is such an incredible thing to experience.\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b]\n\nThe music for this game is impeccable. It boosts your drive to continue exploring, and even changes subtly when entering hidden areas. It doesn't overpower what you're doing or serve as a distraction, but rather helps you get into the rhythm of the level you're facing. Having B-Side levels include remixes of songs was an incredible decision as well, and just adds to the incredible soundtrack.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe controls for this game are very tight and responsive. The momentum is just right, and it truly feels like your character is doing what you ask it to. The tutorial is simple and interactive, and makes you feel like you already knew what to do before even entering it. Each level has its own unique mechanics, and does an excellent job of introducing each one.\nEverything feels very refined and intuitive.\n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\n\nYou are going to die. A LOT. Be well prepared for this. The difficulty factor is a gradual climb, but boy does it climb. By the end of the game, you are doing some very complex and precise maneuvers, and they can be very tough. The B-Side levels are extremely punishing. If you've played any other platformers that are \"iconic\" for being extremely hard or punishing, then B-Sides will make you feel right at home. That being said, at no point did I ever blame the game for what happened. There weren't any issues with hitboxes or non-responsive controls, it was always 100% me that was messing up. This game gets hard, but the reward is so worth it.\n\n[b]Final Opinion[/b]\n\nThis game is absolutely incredible. The story finishes quicker than I had expected, but still allows an immense world to explore. Can you blow through this game in a few hours? Absolutely. Can you 100% it? Eventually, but it's going to take a lot of time. Put away the guides for this one, because the rush of discovering things on your own is going to be your biggest motivating factor in this game.

They are there simple to put you under a test on how you use them or how crafty can you get with them. It's shame that there is only certain set of mechanics which are usable, but that's kind of given by the current chapter.\nCompletionists will have something to chew through here since there is quite a lot of optional objects to pick up.\n\nIt would be really awesome to have some kind of a chapter where there are most of the mechanics for you to use and get to fully try them all at one place.

When you are traveling on a fast moving object and you want to jump and land on the object again. Laws of this game are strongly against it by the way. If you hold a movement key and jump, it launches you ahead of the object and you better be careful how you get back on it or if you just jump, you slow down incredibly fast so you better be standing at the front of the object so you manage to land at the rear of it.", "timestamp_created": 1517109175, "timestamp_updated": 1517109175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39671300": {"recommendationid": "39671300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004716153", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1520595534}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game", "timestamp_created": 1517108652, "timestamp_updated": 1517108652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39671021": {"recommendationid": "39671021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134542868", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518649999}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a fan of TowerFall Ascension (having it be my favorite indie game), so I was excited for this game to come out. After playing through it, I can say this is one of the best platformers of the past few years and I recommend it above almost everything else.\n\nPros:\n- The level design is top notch. Each screen feels like something new, yet also builds on past ideas.\n- Even though the game is fairly difficult, it is liberal with checkpoints, follows a proper difficulty curve, and doesn't feel artificial.\n- The game is full of collectible strawberries. Usually, I would ignore them but they make up much of the meat of the game. The platforming challenges to get them are tough, but they feel rewarding to achieve. There were a few times where they were so difficult they stood out, but the game design was strong enough that it made me want to collect them.\n- There are a few new platforming ideas with each new area that are properly reinforced and used to their full potential while also not totally outstaying their welcome.\n- The soundtrack is pretty (almost as good as TowerFall's).\n- Each of the levels is aesthetically varied.\n- With the strawberries and more difficult versions of each level as well as an \"arcade version\" of the game and a secret eighth level, there is a substantial amount of content. Edit: This game actually as so much content that you'd still be at the surface of it if you just beat the game once.\n- For what it is, the story is surprisingly good and doesn't intrude on the gameplay.\n\nCons:\n- The controls take a while to get used to at first, so there can be frustrating deaths resulting from it.\n- It's probably more of my fault for being stupid, but there was one time I got stuck for unnecessary reasons. This happened I didn't realize how a game mechanic worked. This is probably more of a personal experience than an actual problem with the game, but it might be worth mentioning.\n- To get the B side for the 8th level, it's absolutely required that you have all the hearts before it, including the extremely well hidden secret ones. It is pretty fun to try to follow a guide and see what you missed, but it probably shouldn't be required.\n- It certainly felt good to beat, but was the final screen of the 7th C side really necessary?\n- For some reason the game crashes a lot on me.", "timestamp_created": 1517107516, "timestamp_updated": 1518369526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39670939": {"recommendationid": "39670939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132827134", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517121332}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally finished the main story and I'm working on the endgame content\n\nPros: \n- Great Music\n- Difficult, but not TOO difficult\n- Good amount of content\n- Secrets are actually pretty cool\n- Pixel graphics are on point\n\nCons:\n- I want the strawberries you collect to have some value", "timestamp_created": 1517107128, "timestamp_updated": 1517107128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39668368": {"recommendationid": "39668368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202287637", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518247132}, "language": "english", "review": "naisu", "timestamp_created": 1517096800, "timestamp_updated": 1517096800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39668199": {"recommendationid": "39668199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066325021", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 265, "last_played": 1521312762}, "language": "english", "review": "I actually am addicted to this game.

The world map on the menu screen is huge and beautiful showing you all the places of your journey. The characters during dialog show their personalities perfectly. The levels are all stunning with anything from vibrant yellows and pinks to dark caves filled with little to no light. I could not ask for more in art assisting the overall game so 10/10 for this category.\n\nMusic- Basically it's amazing. Chiptune tracks follow you throughout each level only to abruptly stop at a story event leaving ominous atmospheres. The tracks individually are all amazing and do nothing but make the trek up the mountain feel breathtaking. The characters voices are the undertale style of sounds designated to each character over spoken words (yes I know these are in more games than undertale, I\u2019m trying to be relatable) but this game adds a bit more to that aspect. Their sounds clearly show their personalities and it ends up as more meaningful than just scrolling text. 10/10\n\nStory- Now here is where I was extremely surprised with the game. This is a platformer, a difficult platformer, that tells an actually meaningful story. Is tells a very relatable tale of depression and anxiety but mostly how we can get over these things using the mountain you are climbing as a metaphor. I have never seen a platforming game with anything like this making this game truly unique. Even so the story never intrudes with the gameplay and every cutscene is skippable. 10/10\n\nGameplay- Now here's the main course. If you\u2019re looking into this game you're probably doing it for the challenging gameplay, right? Well all I can tell you is you are getting all that you could ever want from that department. The controls are super tight leading every death to be your fault. The levels are extremely varied as each introduces new obstacles and mechanics for you to play around with. Everything is so streamlined that you never once think about how you should have chosen such and such skill as there is nothing other than a dash and a wall climb. Excluding powerups you will be using these at all times. No pointless skills or items you have to buy. Just you and the mountain. If you end up beating the game then be ready for the huge amount of post game content. Each level has strawberries to collect and a cassette tape each. These cassette tapes open up much harder B-sides of each level. There are also much more special collectibles hidden deep within each level to find. If you happen to complete all B-sides be ready for the ultimate challenge that we must not even talk about here. So much content, amazIng mechanics, never boring. 10/10\n\nEnjoyment- I hope it is obvious to you that I enjoy this game a lot. The bar is set extremely high for platformers in 2018, I just don\u2019t know if it can be reached. I don\u2019t remember a time I liked a platformer this much and don\u2019t know if it will ever happen again. 10/10\n\n\nOverall- Most complete games always coming from indies these days.

I don't have a reason, I don't know if I can, I am my own worst enemy, but by the end of the day I WILL climb that mountain.\n\nCeleste features a multitude of mechanics you've seen elsewhere, mashed together in a perfect melody. It's not what they add but how well they add it and they did a perfect job. The regular story is acceptably difficult, tailored to teaching you mechanics and letting the average joe beat the game with a challenge. It also features berries to unlock that are reasonable hidden everywhere and provide an extra challenge through the regular mission. The remixes are brutal and amazing recreations of the levels for the platformer veterans. If you manage to break your way through all of that there is yet another final challenge waiting at the end.\n\nBut the best thing Celeste does is not belittle your time; after every level completed you get to see what berries you've missed, in what order they are in, and fast travel points through the level.\n\n*: Not including gold berries", "timestamp_created": 1517074912, "timestamp_updated": 1517461698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39659955": {"recommendationid": "39659955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080266495", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518922151}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay: Fair but difficult.

If they think you might enjoy this style game, same deal.  While tough, it isn't impossible, and the assist mode lets you dial down the difficulty if you're having trouble.  Many of  the challenges of the game are entirely optional, with no real change to gameplay because of it.  There are some uses for a super rare pickup, and B side cassettes to find, which unlock even harder levels, but both are for post-story content.  The game takes a thoughtful approach to difficulty and accessibility that makes it the perfect introduction to tough platformers.\n\nI've loved Matt's games for a long time and Celeste doesn't dissapoint.  The platforming's astoundingly good, walking a very delicate line between tough but fun and for masochists only.  Even though I died a heck of a lot of times (2864, I think) at no point did I look and think \"you know what, no.  That's impossible.  I'll never do that.\"  It builds your skills slowly, always at the edge of what you think you can do until you're pulling off some incredible moves at the end.  It's an intense experience, and I have a blister on my thumb now, but it was well worth it.\n\nBetween the awesome level design, incredible controls and fantastic presentation this is easily my favorite platformer I've played in a long time.

The gameplay revolves around your two main abilities: Wall climbing and dashing. It doesn't seem like much but each new level introduce new object interacting differently with your abilities (platform moving only when you dash, cristal allowing you to dash several times if you touch them in mid-air, etc...), adding to that the exponentially increasing difficulty and even with only two abilities the game doesn't feel repetitive at all.\n\nThe story is nice and can be finished really quickly (5~6 hours) if you don't explore any of the levels. Most of the content of the game is actually on all the additional stuff. First, there is the numerous strawberries scattered in each levels that are either hidden or way more difficult to reach than just doing the normal path. Then, each level has a B-side which is like a hardcore version of the level. Finally, add to that a final chapter after you finish the main game that turn the difficulty up to 11 and you get a ton of additional content.

The level design is impeccable, the controls are tight, but not unforgiving, the characters are lovely, the visuals are very pretty, the soundtrack is just beautiful and it all fits together really nicely.\nEach chapter takes just a small handful of mechanics and gets the absolute most out of them. The main path has, so far, been challenging, but not too difficult. However, look out for cassette tapes because the B-sides of each chapter take the same mechanics and make much more difficult levels out of them.\n\nAnd yet, throughout all that, it never becomes frustrating, at least not so far. Even if I die over and over again, I'm never more than maybe 10 to 20 seconds away from the last checkpoint. There are a few longer sections without a checkpoint to really test your mettle, but they are the exception and even then, there's maybe one or two per chapter and B-side. Regardless of that, the path is always perfectly clear.\n\nIt is a challenging game, but also has comprehensive accessibility options in form of the Assist Mode. Invulnerability, more dashes, infinite stamina or just slowing down the game. It's clear that the developers really want this game to be accessible to anyone without restricting you. I would personally recommend trying it without first, but the option is always there and the game locks absolutely nothing away from you for using it. Not collectables, not levels, not even achievements.\nBe aware, though, that activating it puts a big \"ASSIST MODE\" stamp on your save file and there is no way to turn Assist Mode back off again.\n\nIf you, like me, already like precision platformers (games like Super Meat Boy, Dustforce, N++, They Bleed Pixels and their ilk), then this is a no-brainer. If you haven't tried precision platformers yet, then this is a great introduction. And who knows, maybe you'll learn to love the genre on your journey up the mountain to find out more about Madeline, Theo and just what on earth you're even doing up there.

This dash ability creates for some challenging tasks which requires accurate button presses.\n\nThere are 8 chapters which have multiple levels in each, (with over 700 levels in the whole game!) and each chapter a new game mechanic is added. For example: In the first chapter there are platforms which move when you touch them, and then stop giving you momentum in order to cross a large gap in the level, the 5th chapter when you dash some platforms with move instantly and slowly return. Which can lead to some interesting level designs. \n\nCeleste rewards exploration. In each chapter there are multiple strawberries you can collect which don't really do anything and are usually far off the main story but it is nice collecting all the strawberries and feeling like you have beat that chapter 100%. In each chapter there is a cassette tape you can pick up called a B-Side which unlocks a far far significantly more difficult level, which can keep you trying, and trying again, and again until you give up and come back tomorrow and then smash that piece of impossibleness trash away with you're super amazing skillzzzzz you got.\n\nOverall the game is worth the $19.99 USD.\n\n\nYou get:\n-Amazing soundtrack\n-Beautiful pixel graphics\n-Unique chapter design keeping the game from going stale\n-Far far far difficult B-Side levels\n-And you get...

I can't say I expected a challenging platformer to also have one of the simplest, yet greatest stories in a game. \n\nThe controls of the game feel very tight. There's been very little times where when I mess up it isn't my fault completely. Controls are very responsive, and the levels are very well designed. There was never any point where I thought any one jump was completely impossible, and because the game respawns you at the start of a screen (a la super meat boy), it never ends up feeling frustrating as you can very quickly jump back in and try again. The game's difficulty stays challenging, but never reaches levels where you just get bored/frustrated like in common challenging platformers. Can't particularly speak for the post-game/B-side stages, but if the level design stays the same I have no doubt it will feel similar.\n\nThe game really respects the ability for the player to improve. No matter what screen, I never got stuck for more than a few minutes until I finally succesfully completed a screen. The game also rewards exploration, to an outstanding degree. I can't say I wasn't suprised when the first time I went through a level, I had only collected 13/20 collectibles even when I thought I searched everywhere. \n\nThe atmosphere is brilliant, blending the artstyle and the soundtrack awesomely. The soundtrack, by itself, is excellent. It always fit the area's theme, and even works great as a stand-alone for when you want to listen for some nice instrumental chiptune music. The sprite work is very reminiscient of common metroidvania games, which is well done, but nothing special. However, there's small quirks in the character portriats when speaking, and pictures that really give it a unique style, being pretty cute. \n\nThe story was what really caught me off guard, though. Maybe because it hits personally, but it was very heartwarming and had themes that everyone should at least try and practice. Don't really want to spoil anything, but I was really satisfied by it and enjoyed it. I completed the main story in ~8 hours, and still have loads of collectibles/alternate stages to go through. There's a nice amounr of content here.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best indie platformers to come out in a long while, rivaling (and maybe even beating) games such as Super Meat Boy, The End is Nigh, Shovel Knight, etc. If you have a spare $20 left over, I'd definitely recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1517038903, "timestamp_updated": 1517038903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39646786": {"recommendationid": "39646786", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972407912", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520139189}, "language": "english", "review": "An exceptional platformer with amazing pacing, beautiful areas, engaging characters, and a proper challenge to boot.

Each level has fairly branching paths, with one main path which progresses the story. None of these optonal paths are important to the story, and are just a way of getting extra challenge and strawberries, as well as occassionally a casette tape.\n\nThe beauty of Celeste comes in it's fun, well-crafted difficulty. It's not a game which will beat you over the head for missing pixel-perfect jumps, but rather a game which gives you the tools necessary to clear an obstacle before letting you loose to explore how to get around and over it. The strawberries don't count for anything (especially the ones in the Pico-8 minigame) but you tend to feel inclines to get them because the sense of reward for completing these fairly difficult challenges is incredible.\n\nThe casette tapes unlock the \"B-Side\" of whatever level you got it on after completion. The B-Side will push you and the level's mechanics to the limit as you hurdle past the nuttiest of obstacles. Despite the rediculous difficulty of these levels, completion feels not too time consuming and you get an extra reward for doing so.\n\n\n\n[b] SPOILERS [/b]\n\n[spoiler] The story features a villain, \"Part of You\" which behaves similarly to Shadow Mario from the Super Mario Galaxy games. She sometimes will be chasing you in your path and will kill you if you fall behind into your old path and touch her. She can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but she isn't featured in that way for most of the game. She drives most of the plot, and you get to whoop her ass in a really cool sequence towards the end of the game which is followed by your epic ascent to the summit of Mount Celeste, accompanied by an incredible, intense soundtrack.\n\nAfter completion, a bonus level opens up, but you can only enter if you collect four \"hearts\" which are aquired from beating each B-Side level. that bonus level also has it's own B-Side, so get ready for hell.

It's frustrating to pricely manipulate them so a lot of deaths feel unfair.\n\n- Whenever you hit a certain puzzle element that refreshes your movement, it does not take input for a very breif amount of time.  There should be an input buffer there if the game is going to pause for 1/10th of a second every time you touch it.  I've fallen to my death more than once because I tried to time my movement too well.\n\n- It seems diagonal inputs have an even piece of the thumbstick pie.  It's easier to aim a thumbstick top, down, left, right, than it is top-right, down-left, etc.  It would've polished the controls if diagonals had just a slightly higher threshold.\n\nBut these are all things that you have plenty of time to get used to, and since the deaths are much like super meat boy, it's rarely upsetting to fail.

From jumping to Air-dashing, its all really tight and responsive. You will feel in control of all actions. Each chapter has their own unique mechanic that starts with its own introduction through small experimentation that get more demanding and require full understanding of the mechanic to get through a screen.\n\nCeleste is not an easy game. Similar to Super Meat Boy, Death counts will easily hit the hundreds by the 1st playthrough. Most of the deaths will probably come from collecting optional strawberries which can be a pain to get. Their an optional side activity that is just there for collection. Hidden Cassetes tapes also  unlock B-side levels that are remixed and a hard version of the level (Like Super Meat boy's Dark world) that ramps up the difficulty and is for those that want an even greater challenge. I suggest leaving B-side until after the main game is finished as jumping from B-side to normal play feels jarring imo. Perseverance is key to finishing Celeste and success gives that satisfying feeling of passing a screen or getting a strawberry that gave you hell.\n\nIf the difficulty is too much for you, Assist mode is a feature that allows you to tweak settings such as Game speed, Invincibilty and having infinite stamina to make the journey more comfortable. I suggest having this on briefly if your not used to these type of tough platformers and taking it off when you feel your up to experience the full challenge.\n\nThe soundtrack is definetly a highlight as they were quite an enjoyable experience on their own from emotional piano scores to jazz and chiptune. Celeste has what i would call an \"Adaptive Soundtrack\"  ramps up or tones down depending on the sitation. Progressing through a level will add more layers onto the song and will tone down for story sequences. Overall, soundtrack absolutely nails the setting and vibes that are presented in Celeste and warrants a purchase as It is probably the best part of Celeste  imo.\n\nThe story wont be spoiled. Its nothing ground-breaking but it is a rollercoaster of different emotions that can invoke some thought and is definetly relatable to those that are going through a similar time in life of being unsure of what to do with it or how to move on from the past.\n\nCeleste is an amazing game that i suggest anyone that enjoys platformers or is simply interested in the game to buy at full price.

All new features on levels and your standart abilities getting full synergy across the game, nothing is wasted. Great thing about this game is it's pacing, content just keep coming in the way that gets you more involved, i'm not really into long game sessions, but this got me playing it for almost 4 hours without any distractions. \nControls is nicely put together and feels natural. Music is light and not brainsmashing, mostly piano based tunes, doing great with atmosphere. I guess controls and music (and ofcourse smart gamedesign decisions) is a key here to make you keep playing even when you can't beat some hard section of game. \nVisually it's clean   pixel art with simple but catchy graphics and design, rich backgrounds. However i had one issue with finding obstacle at the end of 3rd world, but it's completly not a big deal.\nOne more thing, i notice that for some reason characters, story, dialoges kinda reminds me of Nickelodeon era cartoons gets me some nostalgic vibes. \nIn conclusion i would recommend this game if you want to play some solid hardcore platformer game. \nFor me subjectively, as not much of a hardcore gamer Celeste gave not only challenge but managed to entertain me aswell.", "timestamp_created": 1517014401, "timestamp_updated": 1517014401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny":

Now, that's not to say the game is perfect\u2014the controls are a bit of a pain at first (although I later figured out that my INTENSE BUTTON MASHING actually managed to cause my right arrow key to stop working, whoops), and certain sections/mechanics outstay their welcome\u2014but save for a few hiccups, I was immersed in the game from start to finish. \n\n\nIt's just...a rad game. I've not finished all the B-Sides, or collected all the, well, collectibles, but even still, the game is definitely deserving of its $20 price tag.

New concepts and mechanics are thrown at the player with each new level, keeping a steady increase in difficulty and creativity. every bit of platforming revolves around Madeline's dashing ability, from special green crystals that recharge your dash when broken, to platforms that move when a dash is performed, every puzzle in Celeste is based on the dash. \n\nIf the game is too difficult for you, there is an assist mode with options like extra dashes or invincibility, You can still get all the collectibles with assist mode turned on which is nice, but it does feel a bit like cheating and therefore makes getting the collectibles far less rewarding. For the more hardcore fans of the genre, every level has a B-side tape you can find and collect to unlock a much MUCH! harder version of that level, after completing the B-sides you are given access to the C-side levels, which as you might have guessed ramp up the difficulty to the extreme.\n\nNot only is Celeste beaming with delightfully colorful pixel art and one of the most amazing soundtracks you may ever hear in a video game, but it also has a much more down to earth and relatable story than you would expect from a game of its genre, tackling such subjects as depression and anxiety.\n\nThe characters you run into during your quest to best the mountain are quite charming and full of personality, each with their own distinct synthesized voices making it quite easy to get attached to them. The dialogue is smartly written and genuine as well as funny at times, which adds to the overall charm of the encounters with these characters.\n\nWith more than seven-hundred screens, there are plenty of seriously challenging yet rewarding platforming puzzles to be solved, secrets to find, and a beautifully told story full of charm and personality to be experienced. There are plenty of good times to be had with Celeste, even though it can get frustratingly hard every now and then, it's still always worth coming back to.", "timestamp_created": 1516996925, "timestamp_updated": 1520982234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545980", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39635947": {"recommendationid": "39635947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099632696", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1520982655}, "language": "english", "review": "Good platforming, plenty of secrets and clever level design that challenges you to plan out your moves.

If you enjoyed games such as Super Meat Boy, The End is Nigh, N++, Hollow Knight, Super Mario Bros, and Shovel Knight, this game is right up your alley. It's fun, it's challening, and it's worth your money, so read no further and buy this game. \n\nCeleste is comprised of 8 chapters, each filled with unique mechanics and near perfect level design. The start of each chapter slowly introduces a mechanic, sometimes more than one mechanic, and slowly builds on it until the peak of the chapter where it truly challenges you, knowing you're fully equipped with the knowledge and understanding to beat it. This formula is persistent throughout the entire game, but it works very well and makes for a consistent difficulty curve that never feels too unfair or frustrating. If it does become too difficult for you, there's an option called \"Assist Mode\" that can make the game easier in many ways. Similar to the Simple mode in Cuphead. Levels are also filled with strawberries to collect, completely optional, however, they serve as some of the games greatest challenges and getting them all really fills you with pride and satisfaction. There are other collectibles to find, but I'll keep them a secret save for one: The B side. In each chapter you can find a secret tape. After completion of the chapter, you can select the B side which is basically a remixed, hard version of that chapter. These remixed chapters are tough as balls and if your platforming skills aren't adept enough you can easily spend hours trying to get through them. Again, optional, but beating them feels very rewarding.\n\nThe most important part of a platformer is arguably the controls. If the controls suck, the entire game falls apart on itself and simple jumps become daunting tasks. Celeste does not suffer from this problem in the slighest bit. Your movest is comprised of jumping, grabbing on to walls, and a one use dash that refreshes on contact with solid ground. Never does the control scheme feel slow or weak. It flows so well and feels so smooth. None of the mechanics (except the wind) feel clunky or hard to execute either, and are incorporated into the gameplay seamlessly. \n\nWhile many people lately seem to feel pixel art in indie games is cheap and just tries to be pixelated because that's so indie, I couldn't disagree more when it comes to celeste. The game looks great. The snow blowing through the air, the gorgeous sunrise, the abandoned hotel with remnants of the past, all of the environments just look fantastic. Each chapter is also accompanied by an outstanding soundtrack that never gets repetitous to listen to.The music in this game also helps set the tone the specific chapter is tring to evoke to a near perfect degree. If there were any complaints I had with the art it would be the text boxes and the map select. These are not pixelated and as a result look very jarring, and don't mesh very well in my opinion. There are moments where it allows for the characters to feel more animated and detailed facial expressions, but I think the differing art styles is one of the weaker elements of celeste.\n\nOn top of all these amazing qualities, Celeste has a pretty good story. Nothing revolutionary or mindblowing, but engaging and interesting nonetheless, and makes the player feel more connected to our protagonist, making you more invested in getting to the top of the mountain. Even if the themes and message of the story isn't very original, it's told well and does keep you interested.

The gameplay is structured into small rooms each different from the last, Similar in style to The End is Nigh. I love games with dash mechanics and this pulls it off in a very natural way, It doesn't feel like some \"special move\" or anything like that it feels smooth combing jumping, dashing, and climbing walls. The game wastes no time with tutorials simply telling you a button input and... well that's it, The game's level design is structured in a way that allows the player to figure things out on their own, discovering the subtleties of movement, thus respecting their inteligence. This is a constant throughout the game as each Chapter of the game introduces a new mechanic for that specific chapter, The game however never gives any explicit tutorials on these new mechanics, and let's the player, once again to, quickly learn and understand what this new mechanic does.\n\nThe presentation is simply phenominal, The music is an ambient chiptune, complimenting the game's atmosphere wonderfully.  And the pixel art is quite charming, having a nostalgic feel to it. I quite like the game's use Of text boxes as the background for each one is different depending on the character. I really like the game's use of character portraits, you can see them blink and move, it's a nice small detail. The art at the end of each chapter made me feel cozy and accomplished for my efforts. a cherry on top (of a mountain) in a way.\n\nThis game's plot is simple yet surprisingly enjoyable, The two main characters, Madeline and Theo are very likeable.\nMadeline swaps between being caring and being passive agressive and snarky. You progresively learn more about her as the game progresses which I won't spoil. Theo I have mixed feelings about, he's the stereotyplical cool nerd, using apps, taking selfies, saying things like \"Yolo\" that person who can easily be found on any college campus. His carefree attitude functions as a sort of foil for Madeline, making her flaws all the more noticeable. The dialouge for every character in this game is quite enjoyable from my perspective.\n\nOverall, Celeste is a charming adventure of self discovery, challenging you with difficult yet fair levels. If you enjoy simple and fun platformser that don't to anything too fancy, you will More than likely enjoy Celeste. I sincerely loved celeste, I will likely play through multiple times past writing this review, and I look forward to it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1516951562, "timestamp_updated": 1516953440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39622991": {"recommendationid": "39622991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124308434", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520493400}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u9519\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u4ee5\u4e3a\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u540e\u9762\u5c31\u5dee\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\uff1fnative\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\n\u516b\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fd8\u5dee\u4e00\u5806\u6536\u96c6\uff08\u5927\u7ea6\u6f0f\u6389\u4e8640%\u5de6\u53f3\n\n\u5c31\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\uff0c\u4e70\uff01\n\n\u56db\u5c0f\u65f6\u540e\u4f53\u9a8c\uff1a68 \u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u8d35 2018\u5e73\u53f0\u8df3\u8dc3\u9738\u6743\u9884\u5b9a\n\n\u52c3\u4e86\n\n\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u8d85\u7ea7\u8089\u8089\u7537\u5b69\uff0c\u7ec8\u7ed3\u5c06\u81f3\uff0cVVVVVV\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5404\u7c7b\u5e73\u53f0\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u8003\u9a8c\u624b\u6b8b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\n\n\u8bf7TM\u7acb\u523b\u4e70\u7206\n\n\u5173\u5361\u725b\u903c  \u624b\u611f\u725b\u903c  \u97f3\u4e50\u725b\u903c  \u5267\u60c5\u725b\u903c\n\n1000/10 \n\n\u4e0d\u6446\u4e86 \u6211\u53bb\u767b\u5c71\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1516950912, "timestamp_updated": 1517244781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701799", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39622724": {"recommendationid": "39622724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066891326", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518872131}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, i haven't had this much fun with a game in a while.\n\nThe game is essentially a platformer with a really nice story.

The dialogue is incredibly charming and tells a story about complicated feelings so elegantly and with so much honesty (I mean, you can feel it through the dialogue). The gameplay is incredibly fluid and its difficulty curve is perfect (However, I am a platformer afficiando, so take that with a grain of salt). I mean, seriously. Just jumping around and dashing in an empty space feels amazing, and there are so many collectibles to find using these amazing controls! You can choose to play on assist mode, or complete the game 100% and have an outstanding time no matter what. This game simply gets everything right: from skippable cutscenes to counters that help see what you missed in a level. The B-sides are just as fun as the main story and there's secrets hiding in every corner. No secret makes you want to use a walkthrough; they are well-hidden, but also well telegraphed. There are so many cool, inventive mechanics to come across while traversing through in this game... and the level design... Oh, the level design! It's absolutely perfect. This game is incredible and a great start if you want to start playing hardcore platformers. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1516916425, "timestamp_updated": 1517094362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39615583": {"recommendationid": "39615583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035353425", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "last_played": 1521249522}, "language": "english", "review": "This will easily be my Game of the Year 2018.\n\nEDIT: After spending some more time with this game, it's easily in my top 5 all time games.", "timestamp_created": 1516916056, "timestamp_updated": 1517261344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39615349": {"recommendationid": "39615349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051108941", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519297531}, "language": "english", "review": "I love everything about it.

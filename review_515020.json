I'v encountered a problem in several games, most recently The VR Museum..... The problem is that I am handicaped and confined to a chair. When I run TVMFA I find myself with my head, eye level, in the counter. with no way to move using the controllers.\n  When I spent the money to move up to VR, I had hopes of experiencing things, like this museum, even though I could not physically be present. \n Most of the VR games I have used expext me to be able to move physically (I.E. HEAD. HANDS) instead of providing controller, or keyboard, interface for movement.\nHope this helps to make your product more successful,  \nPS.. why not start a \"HANDICAP ACCESABLE\" label for your tours once they are fixed.

I just couldn't help thinking about the fact they weren't real. Also the freedom of movement isn't very good, making it hard to turn round in the Vive's standing mode using the teleport button. Getting the wires of my Vive tangled round the chair as I looked at the Mona Lisa was completely frustrating and now I'm likely to associate that with the Mona Lisa in future. It would have been helpful to sit at the location of a bench placed in front of the exhibit, and have that lock your orientation. Instead, the red benches obscure your field of view when you try to pretend you are sitting on them. The textures on the exhibits are quite good, but not very detailed. They look artificial, especially before they are fully resolved. It's quite hard to find the best location to view an exhibit from, so you tolerate wherever the teleport places you. It ends up being a bit of a compromise and you don't feel like hanging around as you might in a museum. In some ways, it feels like a boring video game more than a museum experience. Somebody with a short attention span and not much interest in fine art might decide that this is all there is to it, and that would be a shame.

It is let down by some odd design choices though.\nIf any of the concerns I'm about to list are explained in a menu somewhere, then I guess I just missed it.\nOnce I had picked up the brochure/guide, there was no way for me to hide or drop it. That in itself isn't a problem. The problem was having it swap between hands within a certain proximity and making a little 'swish' noise when that happened. I felt like I wanted to stand in front of the exibits with my hands by my sides, doing so left my hands just close enough together to get a 'swish,swish,swish,swish', as the brochure swapped back and forth between my two hands.\nSecond little gripe is similar. I couldn't see how, other than backing away from an exibit, to hide the exibits name and description, which appears as text within a floating box. In the case of the statue of David, it appears directly in front of the statue itself, obstructing the view from in front. This would not be a problem if I could turn these titles and descriptions on and off.\nLastly, I would say the lighting of some of the exibits is poorly placed. The Mona Lisa can't be viewed well from directly in front because there is a light reflecting off it's surface that washes out the entire face. Maybe move her to a room of her own with some upward facing lights that bounce off the ceiling? Not sure what engine this is running in but even unity does some pretty nice stuff with global illumination and bounced lights. \nMinor gripes.

So I figured a sandbox game based around getting to build train tracks would be pretty enjoyable, but sadly it just wasnt. I only played the game for around 15 minutes but even that was enough to see what this game was all about. \n\nI was immediately met with a confusing control scheme that did not allow for any kind of customization, and just feels frustrating to use. Traditionally games will have the player move with WSAD, jump with spacebar, and use shift, Q, and E for extra actions. In this game, you move with WSAD, use Q and E to adjust the height of the camera, and use space, ctrl, and alt for extra actions. It was painful to play with, and again, there are no custom control option.\n\nNow onto the gameplay. You can start in a blank void or a blank void with a few pieces of furniture in it, and then go on ahead to start building your track. But apparently you can only build in a straight line, because there is no way to build separate tracks branching off of existing tracks without looping all the way around what youve already built. It just felt like a dumb design choice. And a lot of the placeable objects need to be unlocked before you can use them, which I did not even have the patience or capacity to do after seeing the rough shape of this game.\n\nOverall, this game has potential but it is not enjoyable in its current state.

I have been making a little village for the past two hours and to see it all light up at night and drive the train through it its outstanding.

It's such a simple game, and for such a good price, who wouldn't want to have this cute little sandbox.

It has wonderful music, and it's well designed.\n\nAfter 90 or so minutes of playing, I'm just starting to get used to the controls. For some reason, I still don't know how to put the train back on the track once I've managed to fly it off.\n\nIt'll definitely help to get a bit of practice with this one, and give your undivided attention to the very brief tutorial.\n\nThe pieces are well designed, however there aren't many. Even I remember there being more thomas the tank engine pieces than what was given in this game. It's cute with all of the graphics and UI, but more content would be awesome.\n\nIf I'm going to give an honest rating, I'd say it's 7.5/10. I'm a little disappointed that the \"controls\" section isn't customizable, and that it's very lacking in information. It doesn't even tell you all of the controls (that's probably my issue about the train not going back on the track). I'm saying 7.5 because it's very simple, and it's a fun way to relax and unwind after a stressful day.

You see, my late Dad was a train enthusiast, with a video gallery of thousands of hours that he had filmed since the late 60\u2019s. That\u2019s not all, he made several N (size of the set) model train sets (his biggest one was eight by four meters) which we used to play together every fortnight. I think he would have been as proud as punch to see me having a go at Tracks \u2013 The Train Set Game!\n\nTracks \u2013 The Train Set Game is a wooden train simulator with a great building component for you to create your biggest and most imaginative train set.\n\nThe game is currently on Early Access and offers a few modes of play. Two of them are free play, plus a daytime and a night time setup.  With both of these modes you\u2019ll start with an empty canvas and a few pieces of track where your wooden train stands. From here, it will be all up to you and your imagination - you can build a set as big and as crazy as you like! Get the track to go up into a spiral, create lengthy straight lines with firecrackers along each side of the track which will alight as you pass through at full speed with your wooden train. That\u2019s not all; create villages with houses, trees, fences, benches, lights and many more buildings and objects. You might find that constructing platforms is a good idea, so that you can stop the train and pick up passengers, moving them to one of the other majestic destinations you\u2019ve created. Another fun thing to do is to stop the track with a pile of blocks, and then fly your train straight into it! Or just fly over it - lots of fun! \n\nThe passenger mode has objectives to complete and it is set in a room with furniture. Here you have to build the track, pick up passengers from a specific location and drop them at another one. On some occasions, you\u2019ll have to complete this within a certain period of time, which can become a bit challenging. \n\nIn regards to the gameplay, it is so easy to build tracks, add buildings and objects. The only aspect which might take a little time to get used to is when you take control of the train and you need to stop at platforms. Thankfully, you can reverse if you miss it. This is an excellent pastime which you can come back to whenever you feel like it and pick up on your last saved game. There is an upload option in the settings, but at this stage, I was unable to use it.\n\nGraphically, the game looks good and runs well. I really like the piano melody in the background which makes the experience even more enjoyable. It would be nice if we could customize the wooden train a little bit, add hills and tunnels. In any case, I look forward to playing the full version.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tNice Graphics\n-\tFew modes of play (free play & objective)\n-\tFun and easy to play \n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~  \n\n-\tIt would be nice to add hills and build tunnels\n-\tNo achievements or trading cards\n\nWell, most boys played trains in their early youth . . . Girls, come and have a look at what you missed!\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Everyone who grew up in the early years knew of these iconic train sets. I had them in the early 90s and even IKEA sells their own brand of wooden train set! Anyway, you have an engine to start and a single piece of track. The rest is entirely up to you.\n\nThe physics engine makes it fun to knock over blocks or boxes or just send your engine flying off the track. Build up or build down and then decorate it to make it your own. It\u2019s simplistic, it\u2019s relaxing, and it\u2019s fun. Lose yourself in the nostalgia gameplay as you build up your little train town.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou start with a single engine on a piece of track. From there, you can add as many tracks as you see fit. You can access the Toy Box by hitting G to see all the neat things that can make your little train town stand out. Or maybe you\u2019d rather keep it simple and prefer the look of the wood alone.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you. Building is super easy with Left Click to lay track and Right Click to remove it. WASD moves you around, Q and E raises and lowers the camera as well as the track elevation, and T let\u2019s you become the conductor! Control the speed of the train with W and S and track switching with A and D.\n\nThere are so many different buildings, structures, objects, and stations to put down with more being added. The developer is active on the discussion boards and the game is a blast to play in EA. I tend to lose myself just building and I do like that I get to ride in the trains and pick up passengers. The clear night environment is probably my favorite so far. \n\n[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]\nI love trains. I grew up on them with my dad building them in the basement. He\u2019d buy me these wooden train sets when he came back from deployment. So, being able to relive my childhood, playing with one of my favorite toys as a kid without fear of losing my pieces is fantastic. The game is simple in its design, but fun to play. Especially if you have an eye for design and a love for building. The music does get a bit repetitive, but I wasn\u2019t paying any attention to it since I was so focused on building.\n\nThe game controls well and as of this review, I haven\u2019t heard mention of controller support or it\u2019s limited at the moment. I\u2019m excited for this game and to see what it can become. There are talks to be able to customize the color of tracks or engines and different types of train cars. Guess we\u2019ll see! \n\n[code]This is an Early Access Report.

I'm sure there will be much more content as time goes on. Right now, if you're looking for some kind of sophisticated world-building game \u00e0 la Cities: Skylines or Cities in Motion, you're going to be disappointed. In its current state, this is more of a toy than any kind of simulator. It's the toystore wooden train set you wanted as a kid. There are a few dozen props to be added to the sandbox-style world, plus a basic set of wooden track pieces, and that's it.\n\nSecondly, it shows a lot of potential. Some of the items (loading and unloading points, for example) suggest that the devs are working on adding more complex mechanics to the game. New gamemodes and the ability to create scenarios for the Workshop seem to be in motion already.\n\nWith all of that said, what you [i]do[/i] get with Tracks in its current form is absolutely charming. The little wooden passengers bopping around excitedly as you pull into a station or roll up next to a platform are adorable. Driving your train is a smooth and enjoyable experience. Graphics are very nice. A lot of care has obviously gone into each of the little props, from stations and platforms to fountains. The \"Random House\" function is great, adding variety to your scenery automatically by placing one of three different sized houses randomly each time you click. The music is relaxing and pleasant. You can already build multi-level networks and multiple types of stations, as well as crossovers that allow you to decide between multiple routes while driving.\n\nAll in all, I think that Tracks is a wonderfully charming little toy. It's enjoyable and relaxing to play with and shows a lot of promise for what's to come in future updates. The devs are clearly putting a lot of care into making it a visually appealing product rather than just focusing on creating as [i]much[/i] content as possible, which is appreciated.

I forget how I found Tracks, but when I saw it I was surprised such a game even existed and bought it without a second thought. Playing with the infinite amount of track (and very lenient laws of physics) rekindled the nostalgic spark of imagination and wonder I always had when building my own tracks, and actually lets me live one of my childhood dreams of having just that: infinite track and more lenient laws of physics.\n\nThe Passengers mode even gave me an excuse to use my imagination a little more freely without feeling silly; they're actual little wooden figures that need to get from point A to point B, not invisible figments like what I'd played with as a child, so if you're concerned about this, don't be, although if you don't care, there's a completely clear environment where you can play to the heart's content of your inner child.\n\nThe gentle music in the background and the woodgrain of the tracks, trains, and passengers, as well as the design of the buildings and props, is all very relaxing. I've found myself sitting for [many {many}] hours on end just building, and being perfectly okay with that.\n\nI don't have many complaints with the game, and those I do mostly have to do with the turnout/switching system. My physical set had a few more types of switch tracks than the game has to offer at this point, and when actually playing the role of Conductor actually getting the train to divert to a branch line can be a little unreliable.\nAdditionally, the tracks won't join properly on rare occasions, especially when using the straight elevation changing sections, which will cause the train to derail and fall through a track that otherwise looks like a perfectly solid section of track.\nThe game at the time of this post, however, is far from finished, and even in this early state is not only playable, but also enjoyable, so it's easy to look past them and have an idea of the direction in which this game is going. A direction I, and many others, all say is a good one.\n\nIf you had or always wanted a wooden train set as a kid (or even a plastic one like one of my old sets) and don't mind the occasional hiccup, then I highly recommend this game. If those hiccups are too discouraging, then add it to your wishlist, wait a month or so, and THEN buy the game. If you have a friend or child that is even moderately into trains, then buy them a copy of this game and they'll love you forever for it.

Together with the wooden railway-building and train-driving, the experience feels relaxing and meditative. \n\n-The game's creator has been wonderfully friendly and open to the early adopters of this game. He's engaged and helpful and open to ideas...which is awesome.\n\n-The game has a wonderfully calming and cheering effect on my train-obsessed 8-year-old son. He has ADHD and is on the high-functioning end of the Autism spectrum (aka Aspergers, prior to DSM-V). We've been collecting wooden trains, tracks and destinations for 6+ years now; building tracks literally all over the house seems entirely normal to us :).\n\n-My son has been playing the Beta edition for a couple of months; he's become a great fan of the game. We happened to search for Train-related games on Steam on Sept. 28...on release day :)! He was ecstatic, and has been playing regularly ever since.\n\n-To my son, making up complex scenarios where his (very anthropomorphic) trains help each other, or (more often) intentionally crash into each other, fall off cliffs and become (friendly) ghost trains is a key part of \"playing trains\". As new features are developed & added, I hope the game creator continues to include features that facilitate this creative, sandbox style of play. \n\n(Cranes, tunnels, water features to interact with...a way to visually modify your engines, i.e. a related paint or basic 3D modeling program where you can add graphic details or even components to your engines and rolling stock...so many awesome possibilities!)\n\nHighly recommended, if you're looking for a game involving trains and sandbox-style play.", "timestamp_created": 1507948893, "timestamp_updated": 1507948893, "voted_up": true,

Presumably the developer saw the level of interest and took the opportunity to enhance the game and make a few quid at the same time.  No issues there!\n\n Gameplay\n*************\n(coming soon)\n\n Quick REVIEW\n*****************\n  Pros\n********\n- Fantastic Idea.\n- Beautifully represented.\n- Nice gameplay mechanics (transporting characters etc..)\n- Simple easy to use controls.\n- UI is reasonably intuitive as is the game itself.\n\n  Cons\n********\n- Early Access should be sold at a reduced price, especially when there is...\n- Almost no content and nothing much to do!\n- Bugs are present (I know EA).\n\n Overview\n*************\nAt this point in time (Early Access) the game is very limited, gameplay options are all but non-existent and there are a number of bugs in the game....but the promise it shows is very good indeed.\n\nMy daughter, who has Autism, used to play with her wooden train sets a LOT as a child, every morning before and after breakfast a new track had to be constructed and she would play for hours!!  \n\nThis game was recommended to me by a well know YouTuber and I grabbed it because I thought she might get the same level of enjoyment from Tracks.  The draw being that she could build whatever she wanted without the drag of having to put it all away again; and she did but only for a short while.  \n\nMaybe she has grown out of it now or maybe it is just the limited amount of gameplay currently in this title?  Either way I am sure I will be playing this game in the future if it continues to grow and add more content.  I very much like what I see but there is nowhere near enough content to justify the price at this time.\n\nI am a firm believer in the following approach: Early Access titles should have a reduced price to thank those early investors who take a risk.  Not sure that is how this game has structured its pricing......BUT great hopes for the future, a quality idea with very nicely designed features, just needs some content!\n\nLooking to turn this Not Recommended to Recommended as and when content is added or the price is reduced :-)\n", "timestamp_created": 1507458258, "timestamp_updated": 1507458258, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415255", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35559018": {"recommendationid": "35559018", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970171318", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513462403}, "language": "english", "review": "As a father who has been constantly thwarted in my train track construction by such annoying things as gravity, having less than a million pieces, and a child who keeps stepping on things, this is possibly the greatest game ever made.

added factor of having an infinte number of parts BUT it allows you to defy physics. \n\nhard core train enthusites that currently lack the funds for a new set or those that do but dont know what they want to make. BUY THIS think of it as a planning simulator the possiblitys are endless as to what kind of a set you can make because  it isnt just a track in a blank room you can add plants and people and housing along with signs and other details.\n\nfor the person that wants to relax with a creation engie but at the same ime feel like they are accomplishing something !? parts and sencary are unlockable havent figured out how but it is. (its not paid dlc)\n\nand the one thing i have to say is the simplicty of this game takes the mind of someone who is stressed out to the ends of time and can just give them time to relax i look foreward to being stuck in this game for hours. be me bulding my own town or city or village to me making ramps that go over buses for giggles.\n\nhighly recommend\n\nPros:\nsimple \nendless\npeaceful\nFUN\nits a toy\n\ncons:\nnone for thei genre of game\n\n\n\n\nalso its is workshop enabled", "timestamp_created": 1507209642, "timestamp_updated": 1507209642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35484601": {"recommendationid": "35484601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000082685", "num_games_owned": 890, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507158168}, "language": "czech", "review": "Tak tahle hra se mi zal\u00edbila hned jakmile jsem na ni narazil , v\u017edycky m\u011b ve hr\u00e1ch bavila volnost stav\u011bn\u00ed , budov\u00e1n\u00ed...

Building a rail networks, getting passengers is the name of the game. The game includes three modes; Free-Play, Passengers, and Frieght. Because it is in early access, I can see that there is a high ceiling of potential when it comes to creativity surrounding the community. I'll talk about that later on.\n\n[h1] Free Play [/h1]\n\nFree Play is the sandbox mode of the game, using unlimited resources, you can build a rail network that can be as big or small as you wish. While there is no objective, free play allows players to let their minds loose in designing their track layout.\n\n[h1] Passengers [/h1]\n\nPassengers is a small game mode at the moment where the player has to build a station platform near some passengers and build a track to get them to the station. It is a simple game, but it allows open-ended solutions to the 5-or-so missions it provides. \n\nPersonally, getting the train at full speed to stop at the platforms and stations perfectly has been a personal challenge for me.\n\n[h1] Frieght [/h1]\n\nAt the moment, Frieght is an unrelease game mode that has yet to be implemented. Other than knowing it as the third gamemode, I cannot delve further into it.\n\n[h1] Audio [/h1]\n\nThe music of the game ressonates the inner kind in myself, building layouts in the small kids' room of the house all day. I think it would be better if there were more songs added to the list so that there is a little more variety. Otherwise, I would have it off for an ambient effect.\n\nThe sounds for the train rolling full-speed across the tracks is very satifying. I would hope the developers add some hollow wooden clinking noises betweem the passengers, to placing objects, to the cars pushing against each other to really [i] emphasize [/i] the wood asthetic.\n\n[h1] \"Maps\" [/h1]\n\nTracks-The Game features two rooms to choose from and build in. \n\nThe first room is a pink-ish/beige-ish, featureless room (akin to Garry's Mod's \"gm_flatgrass.\" It is an open cube that allows the player to freely build layouts without any restrictions apart from the room boundaries (which in itself is well more than plentiful).\n\nThe second room called \"Modern Apartment.\" You can infer that this room resembles modern apartment that features furnishings, tables, chairs, TVs, pitcures, counters, shelves, flooring, and pretty much anything you would find in an apartment. This room restricts some track layout, but forces the player to get creative when building their layout in free play and Passenger Mode\n\n[h1] Miscellaneous [/h1]\n\n[b] Workshop [/b]\n\nI mentioned earlier that the game could benefit from a community-driven Steam Workshop if we were to take a page from Garry's Mod. Not only would some creative aspects be handled by the community, it would allow the developers to focus on other parts of the game. Maybe some of the more popular addons could be implemented as official releases by the Dev. team. \n\nPeople would be able to submit rooms, layouts, track pieces, trains, traincars, scenery, and themes that could spice-up an otherwise, normal wooden set.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Promising, high potential\n[*] For an early access game, it is decently optimized\n[*] The developers for the game are open to suggestions\n[*] Buying this game now for $10 will allow for further development\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] It [i] is [/i] in early access after all, not all features have been implemented yet\n[*] Limited Track, Train, and scenery pieces\n[*] Only two maps to build in to chose from at the moment\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1506790542,

Or trains. But for some reason, this game jumped out at me, and I bought it on release.\n\nSo, addressing the Early Access portion of it. It's still rather limited in terms of structured gameplay. At the time of writing ( Sept 29 2017 ) there is a 'Pick up passengers and take them to a station' mode, and there is a 'free play' mode. The 'Passengers' mode finishes after about 8 or so passenger drop-offs. So, there isn't much to that yet.\n\nBut the whole toy train aesthetic and ease at building track is so bloody enjoyable, that the sandbox, Free mode is where you'll spend the bulk of your time anyway.\n\nThere's an excellent tutorial that takes you though the very intuitive laying of the track, and then you're let loose to go crazy, creating little cute villages and rattling through them at full speed.\n\nThere's definitely work that needs done to the game, but so far, it hasn't crashed or glitched on me, and it's just been such a gentle, enjoyable toybox.", "timestamp_created":

Because if you press Back (+ any other button) it will do the thing that you've set up for (like open the map, or any action that doesn't need immediate reflexes, or changing the music track of your player, cut your mic from your stream or even launch any .exe you chose.\n\nYou can also play some FPS with the mouse emulation, only your movement will not be analog, of course, it's still WASD or ZQSD (for France). I finished Antichamber with that, for example, but don't wish to reach the leaderboards of something crazy quick like Quake III or SEUM...\nStill you can ^may any oldies or point 'n clicks.\nThere's also a shortcut to let you see what are the current bindings (that you can change for a specific game and it will go back to the default config automatically when you'll switch window).\n\nIf you need to write stuff you have three options, the built-in spiral keyboard, not as bad as it seems, really, the Steam virtual keyboard (Back + Guide) and the Xbox Chatpad.\n\nAnyway, buy it, it's the best, simplest and more affordable solution you got here, although there might be a thing or two that are missing compared to XPadder, like some different analog sticks modes, but I used Xpadder for like five years, and Controller Companion for 3 weeks, and I'm really loving it.\n\nIt's undeniably the most intuitive and practical solutions for what it makes, and that's a lot of things.\n\nAlso the price is just as amazing as its content.", "timestamp_created": 1516209155, "timestamp_updated": 1516209768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39412191": {"recommendationid": "39412191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256471816", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 612, "last_played": 1515595504}, "language": "english", "review": "The interface is a bit hard to get used to at first but you get used to it, works as promised.", "timestamp_created": 1516192805, "timestamp_updated": 1516192805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39402882": {"recommendationid": "39402882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052006705", "num_games_owned": 1044, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 144, "last_played": 1516476343}, "language": "english", "review": "What caught my attention with this app was the feature of disabling itself at the correct time but it really isn't that useful.

I have a driving sim rig near my PC. I found myself unable to navigate certain games without a mouse; so I hooked up a second mouse that I can use from the sim rig chair. Perfect! Right? Well I started playing online and realized I couldn't type in the server chat, reply to Steam messages, or type into a browser. \n\nAt this point I have hooked up a second keyboard and mouse to my PC in a ridiculously un-ergonomic fashion where I have to reach to type. It works, but I feel like an idiot, there must be better way! Then I remembered my old, yellowed-by-time-activates-3-simultaneous-inputs-when-you-press-Y-button Xbox360 gamepad with the coveted Chatpad attached, stored away in the closet.\n\nSo I check Google to see if it's possible to get the Chatpad to work and sure enough; multiple sources saying it's possible. I commit to the idea and decide the gamepad is worth trying to fix the malfunctioning buttons. I dig it out of the closet, dismantle, clean thoroughly with alcohol, scrubbing away the culprit dried up wine spotted near the Y button on the circuitboard. Reassemble and hell yes, it works perfectly! Now all I have to do is get those drivers online and I'm set!\n\nTrying to get a Xbox360 Chatpad to work with all the workarounds and un-signed drivers found in online guides would be a nightmare for your average user. Those who manage to figure it out have to live with running windows in test-mode, with driver signature enforcement disabled permanently. While that might be VAC safe, I play CS:GO on ESEA/Faceit/CEVO and their anti-cheat will ban your account for using windows test-mode. All games that use Battleye anti-cheat will also ban your account for using test-mode or disabling driver signature enforcement.\n\nHere's a quick list of games that can't be played if you want to use a damned Xbox360 Chatpad on a wired gamepad without this glorious software's signed drivers:\n\nAll CS:GO 3rd party clients\nPlayer Unknown's Battlegrounds\nRainbow Six Siege\nFortnite\nH1Z1\nDay of Infamy\nArma2\nArma3 + Operation Arrowhead\nDAYZ\nARK\nPlanetside 2\nSurvarium\nProject Argo\nUnturned\nInsurgency\nThe Isle\nLine of Sight\nConan Exiles\nBlackshot\nTibia\nBlack Squad\nPhantomer\nS4 League\n\nSince I play several of those games religiously, I thought my quest for an overall better way to control my pc from my driving sim rig other than doubling down on peripherals had come to an abrupt end. Until I came across this goddamn life saver golden gem of code bundled with the legitimate one-of-a-kind drivers that I desperately needed.\n\nI was ecstatic in a moment of pure euphoria. My quest had been completed and it only cost me $3.29 CAD. My gamepad restoration efforts weren't in vain.

I use it primarily on my Media Center PC in my living room to control my PC without a keyboard or mouse. It runs independent of Steam, running on Windows start-up, and has worked flawlessly switching control to full screen apps/games and back to desktop. Although the control customisation options are a fairly standard affair, it does have the ability to map a batch/shortcut file to a binding which was ideal for [url=https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/54809-how-to-configure-steam-big-picture-youtube-tv-with-emby-theater/]my Media Center setup[/url] to switch between Steam, Web Browser & [url=https://emby.media/]Emby[/url] all from the comfort of my controller. \n\nOutside of desktop support the control customisations are somewhat redundant within Steam these days as it offers full controller customisation support built-in, but it does have the advantage of allowing use for games outside of the Steam eco-system. For those looking for an in-depth way to fully customise your controls there are better suited programs like [url=https://xpadder.com/]XPadder[/url] that will offer much more, albeit at a higher price. I like the simple design of this app, it just works, and is easy to setup too. For a majority of use cases, features in [b]CC[/b] would certainly be more than enough to handle most requirements.\n\nA few improvements in mapping options such as modifiers [i](hold one button & press other)[/i] to complement the controller profile switching & short/long press button mappings would be welcome to give some greater flexibility customising. The ability to give your mappings a name/tag would be great addition, along with some different spiral keyboard colours [i](help visibility in dark app/games)[/i]. It doesn't support independent mapping of the four XBox One Elite Controller Paddles either.\n\n[b]CC[/b] may be a little limited in features, but its simplicity is also its strength. Efficient & easy to use, it\u2019s a great cost effective enhancement, adding [i]'native'[/i] controller support to any Windows Gaming or Media Center PC system.\n\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857016/]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]", "timestamp_created":

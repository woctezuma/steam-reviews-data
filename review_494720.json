And that's saying something about the tremendous depth that it has.\n\nOn the surface, it's a simple turn-based one vs all on a grid (sort of like fox board games). All positions have their basic ability (hammer, teleport, heal and a few others) that slowly level up as more enemies get killed on this position. I'm not sure if this upgrade system is its main draw (choosing which upgrade to get is hard, but in an interesting way), or the looming death at almost every turn. You see, you only have two lives. Get hit twice without healing inbetween, and it's game over. And you can push enemies off the board, but some can do this to you as well. So all the game comes down to is \"how do I avoid getting in a situation where I'll die?\". Weighing offense versus defence, ease of movement around the board versus weapons is a pretty complex task that really outweighs the simplicity of what is really ON the board.\n\nPerhaps equally interesting is what this game DOESN'T do/have. There's no music, only minimal sounds and visuals, no options or tutorials (okay: you can always check what tiles or enemies will do) and no other gameplay modes than the main one. There's no gamepad or keyboard support, and perhaps most surprising for a game with these credentials: no mobile version (seriously: this game would be awesome on android or iOS). So for the designers out there: it's games like this that prove that if your main mechanics are strong enough, you don't even need those things that are taken for granted in almost all video games.\n\nI got this game from a friend (so for free), but it's easily worth the asking price (to the point where I'd be hard pressed to find something as good for 5 bucks).

The concept is interesting, and it is implemented in a fun and easy to understand way. Gameplay feels very diverse, yet it still maintains balance. All in all it feels very well thought out. \n\nThat being said there are still a few areas I think this game lacks in. The main thing being replayability. There is only one game mode. In this game mode, you start off with a map/grid of sorts, and you complete waves. After completing a wave you unlock \"tiles\" from the map. There are different types of tiles, each of which do different things and interact with other tiles in different ways. When unlocked you have somewhat of a choice of which tiles go where. \n\nHaving such a range of different tiles that interact and do different things, and having the ability to choose which tile goes where is what gives this game such a diverse feeling. But after a certain wave, all the tiles are chosen, and that diversity slowly becomes a mundane and methodical \"survival\" game (albeit there are enemies that can destroy tiles which adds another level of depth to the game). \n\nBut there could be other game modes that add a level of replayability. A timed mode where you have a certain amount of time to get to the furthest wave possible. Or you have to reach a certain wave as fast as you can. And your scores are put up against other players. Or a gamemode where the tiles and enemies for each wave is predetermined and you have to find a way to survive, bringning out more of a puzzle-esque feel. Or some form of multiplayer gamemode. Even achievements or playercards would give it some sort of replayability.\n\nBut as it stands now, there is nothing about this games that shouts for me to come back and play it again, unless I have nothing else to do and am just biding my time with something else. Don't get me wrong, I do feel as though I got my money's worth so I will recommend it, but that doesn't mean this game couldn't be better.\n\n\ntl;dr\n[u]Pros[/u]\n[list]\n  [*]Fun\n  [*]Diverse Gameplay\n  [*]Easy to learn Game Mechanics\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n[list]\n  [*]Limited to one game mode\n  [*]Little to no replayability\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1496761963, "timestamp_updated": 1496761963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538235", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32165495": {"recommendationid": "32165495", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974471003", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496540225}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite game that is fairly challenging.

You start out on a hexed tile (hexed as in a description of the shape of the tile, not as in it has been cursed by a supernatural being) and your attack depends on which of the six different hexes you are standing on.  Some hex types allow you to damage enemies, while others let you heal, teleport, or strip enemies of armor.  As you gain kills with weapon hexes or kill enemies on top of \u201csupport\u201d hexes, they level up and you can grant them abilities based upon the hexes adjacent to them.  Since the board grows between rounds, prompting you to select one new, random hex before progressing, you are encouraged to think about which hex type you choose and to prioritize types of hexes in certain places.  As you are forced to choose a new hex each round, the board gradually grows larger and larger, pulling you further and further away from your upgraded hexes; this forces you to be continually strategizing and smattering different types of hexes throughout the board, rather than just relying on your one maxed-out hex in the center.", "timestamp_created": 1495373229, "timestamp_updated": 1495373229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31865920": {"recommendationid": "31865920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060772977", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502835600}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][i]Morphblade[/i][/b] is an amazing turn-based game about unlocking different tiles and defeating waves of enemies.

Anyway, it's highly addicting. I had to learn that the tile options change after each wave, so if a tile is offering an arrow and you want that tile to be a heal, you just survive the wave and see if the next offering is a heal. I like to make super tiles, where it has one of each all around it. Then when it upgrades multiple times, it \"inherets\" qualities of the tiles around it. Eventually I can kill anything I teleport to from it, or anything that tries to attack me on that tile dies, etc. It will have several qualities besides it's own. I've played this game for 9 hours in the past few days. Definitely worth the $5 they are asking. No, I wouldn't wait to find it in another bundle. That's months you could be missing out! Maybe you have a friend who gets the Humble Monthly Bundle but doesn't claim all of the games? It's worth asking around. My best so far is surviving 25 waves. They said that is \"Very Good\". I look forward to making it even farther on a larger grid. \n\nHint: There are explosive bugs sometimes, and whatever tile you destroy them on destroys the tile. Putting an acid tile next to another acid tiles allows you to upgrade them both to neutralize explosive materials if the bug lands on that tile (if he is chasing you perhaps). Mind you, the bugs seem to take the most direct route to you (they don't avoid certain tiles) so make it chase you until it crosses over that tile. Then you won't lose any of your upgraded tiles. Another hint: Two heal tiles next to one another allows them both to be upgraded where if you cross over it, it grants you a shield and you can take 2 hits before dying instead of one. VERY USEFUL. Each game I try to quickly acquire 2 heal tiles next to one another and 2 acid tiles next to one another. \n\nEnjoy the game to those of you who get it!! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1494102781, "timestamp_updated": 1494102781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522372", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31540929": {"recommendationid": "31540929", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967419832", "num_games_owned": 1133, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501704245}, "language": "english", "review": "A great coffee break game.

"I got this game as part of the March Humble Bundle and for around a month is sat in my library uninstalled. Finally I put on a podcast and played it. The game involves moving around a board where each tile transforms your piece into a certain variant. Each variant has a unique ability such as healing when you transform into it or being able to kill adjacent pieces instead of simply knocking them back. Much of the game's depth comes from its upgrade system, once you kill 6 enemies from the same tile you are allowed to upgrade it into a hybrid tile which adds an ability similar to another variant. For example upgrading a hammer tile (The one that lets you kill adjacent enemies) into a venom hybrid (Venom tiles remove enemy armor when they move over it) will allow you to kill armored units. It took me about 40 minutes of playing to fully understand the game mechanics and the goal of the game is to reach a highscore by surviving against enemies which gain new abilities with every wave.

It is one of the games which looks simple, but hides complexity. In this game, you control a Morphblade, and all you need to do is to try to survive as many enemy attacks as possible. In itself, the game is a bit of an experiment in simplicity, as explained here: http://www.pentadact.com/2017-03-11-morphblade-and-imbroglio-making-a-game-to-test-a-critique/ \n\nThe game takes place on a field consisting of hexagonal tiles. The core concept is that the Morphblade's abilities depends on the tile it is staying on. There are 6 different tiles. 3 attack tiles; The hammer (shoot one tile in any direction), the blade (move one tile and attack the tiles on the side) and the arrow (move two tiles in straight line, attack all in between). And 3 modifiers: Heal (heal the blade), Teleport (move to any tile on the grid) and poison (removes armor from armored enemies).. So far, so good. The complexity is introduced as the tiles can level up and combined with neighboring tiles. A tile can be leveled up when you have used it to kill 6 bugs. So a hammer tile can be combined with a poison tile, allowing you to shoot armored enemies, or two heal tiles can be combined into a shield tile. These tiles can be further leveled up again, adding more modifiers to them depending on surrounding tiles, resulting in over 700 tile combinations. \n\nThere are 5 different bugs - the normal bugs (takes away one life on hit, moves one square), flying bug (can move two tiles), pusher bug (can't hurt you, but pushes you one tile back, can push off the board), laser bugs (can fire a laser in straight line) and the elusive black level up bug (levels up the tile it is killed on). All bugs also comes in 3 'flavors' - red bugs (normal bugs), blue bugs (have armor, can not be killed) and green bugs (explodes when killed, removing the tile it is killed on). \n\nThe game is turn-based, and it is played in increasingly difficult waves (more and different bugs). The game starts with only 2 hexagonal tiles, and between each wave you can select a new tile to place from a selection of random tiles (though you can get \"wild tiles\" also). It sounds more complex here than it is to play, but it is one of those games that have the \"i need to get to next wave\" factor. It is relentless, but the turn-based nature makes it very fair, and when you loose it is always your fault for making the wrong move. \n\nIt is difficult to explain how it works exactly, but here is some videos explaining it much better than me: \nThe developer explaining the mechanics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNX6-j9Ca0 \nNerd-cubed playing the game - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux2myQ_Ch0Q \n\nand one who don't get it at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JSKnCG5bVg&t=42s \n\nIn short, it is brilliant... my Steam stats tells me that I have played it for 20 hours now... and I still have only reached wave 35...", "timestamp_created": 1491473749, "timestamp_updated": 1491473749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0,

Although the price may throw you off, don't throw it out.[/b]\n\n[h1]LONG REVIEW:[/h1] This game is [b]fantastic[/b]. Surface level it comes off as very simplistic yet the depth goes pretty deep with everything based off of a hexagonal format. The furthest I've gotten is [i]Wave 32[/i] after a bit of playing and shortly around [i]Wave 25[/i] is when things get pretty [b]real[/b] and you are tested fairly nicely and how fruitful or shallow your planning was get shown. The planning involved goes from superficial to [u]integral[/u] within [i]minutes[/i] and one false item unplanned will be your death knell and back to Wave 1 you go.\n\nHonestly It reminds me of Checkers with the simplicity of it. From the randomness of the generated grid, the tiles you can choose with each passing wave, to the placement of the enemies and your ability to upgrade and cross-upgrade tiles -- it starts accelerating [i][b]fast[/b][/i] from Checkers to Chinese Checkers to Chess and then something else. Bundle all those together... and you have this game; [spoiler]I fucking hate the developer for it cause I'm not going to be able to stop playing it since I got it.[/spoiler] I keep coming back thinking of different ways to go about progression and it turns out it's a neat little indie game and on a realistic level I hope the dev does more with this type of concept or the title itself, innovating this already innovative title with more specific grids, game modes or a timed mode of some sort could make it even more creative (and all the more addictive to boot)\n\nPrice wise, I believe the $4.99 pricetag isnt that bad but even for roughly $5 for how simple it is, the idea might make people a [b]LITTLE[/b] bit weary because you might not see the longevity in the title vs the price (although however small mind you) that they would be willing to pay. If this were a mobile game, [b][i]would it be worth the same price given the simplistic yet deep nature of the game and would you (or I for that matter) still pay the same price for it on the go?[/i][/b] I'll let you make that decision.\n\nFinally; I have to say though -- if you wish to purchase it, try and play Morphblade up to or past Wave 30 to test your mettle before you cast the game off. There are no achievements and the only thing to look forward to is getting further in the game, which it should be its own reward [which it currently is and I don't mind that] and that fills me with a sense of Super Hexagon or any game that presents you with the tools to play or adapt then says: \"Here, have it. Now progress.\" Games like this are slowly feeling like the odd-man-out in the Indie scene and it makes me really happy to see a new title keeping the faith.", "timestamp_created": 1490545702, "timestamp_updated": 1490545744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506121", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30739611": {"recommendationid": "30739611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279146059", "num_games_owned": 1200, "num_reviews": 255, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490435456}, "language": "english", "review": "Guess this is one of them games i just don't get...", "timestamp_created": 1490488489, "timestamp_updated": 1490488489, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.382522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30738492": {"recommendationid": "30738492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095730487", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488595357}, "language": "english", "review": "This gets boring quickly.", "timestamp_created": 1490483885, "timestamp_updated": 1490483885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.391561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30707924": {"recommendationid": "30707924", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970354032", "num_games_owned": 2018, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491254914}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple mix of strategy (plan your board) and tactics (win a round).\n\nAnd the conflict between the two an easy win might screw up your board, or the hunt for a good board may lead you to defeat.\n", "timestamp_created": 1490373737, "timestamp_updated": 1490373737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30699324": {"recommendationid": "30699324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114344279", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489491751}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e07\u0e23\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27\u0e19\u0e30 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a \u0e2a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 first look \u0e44\u0e27\u0e49\u0e43\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e43\u0e19 Youtube\n\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e47\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e32\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e43\u0e19 VDO \u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e30\n\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e14\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e07 \u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e14\u0e35\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 \u0e14\u0e39\u0e23\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27 \u0e21\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e19\u0e30\n\n[url=youtu.be/Ihpm6my3LeY?list=PLkLYyaCAXlGF__M7D_M18e43ZfUoOJUt3] \u0e01\u0e14\u0e14\u0e39 VDO \u0e15\u0e23\u0e07\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49 [/url]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1490336080, "timestamp_updated": 1490336080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30686838": {"recommendationid": "30686838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032273933", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490803711}, "language": "english", "review": "Every step matters", "timestamp_created": 1490282988, "timestamp_updated": 1490282988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30680039": {"recommendationid": "30680039", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968591202", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490246402}, "language": "english", "review": "(Got it in a bundle.)\n\nSimple to learn, difficult to master.

The basic controls and tactics can be found out after just playing 10 minutes, but to get really far and reach more waves needs planning and strategizing. So, the game is quite fun for what it offers. My first half an hour was more to learn the basics and i want to play more to get better. So i can definetely say it got me hooked for now.\nThe game works like this: You have 6 different hex types that you can develop on your grid. Moving on one costs you a turn, fighting does aswell. After beating a wave you are allowed to build one new hextype on your grid.\nSo there are grids allowing you to teleport, heal you, cause a debuff to enemies or give you one out of three attacks (arrow is a straight forward attack over 2 hexes, hammer is a shot at adjecent hexes and blade is an attack to the sides).\nWith killing enemies you can level hexes up and give them more abilities. So you give a weapon a knockback, vampirism or allow you to give it many more advantages.\nVariety is seems to be there and it gets more and more complicated as you progress.\nNew Enemy-types also get into the mix. \nWhat i also think though, is that with it lacking more motivation to get further into the game and reach higher waves, it could become boring too fast.\nI think it wont interest me to play it for more than 2 hours i guess.\nWhich is sad, since the basic idea, while looking \"empty\", is really well done. If the game got a bit deeper, and also gave a motiavation to progress, it could be a really good game. Also i dont know why it doesnt have multiplayer. Its design would offer enough variety in modes to play versus or coop. And if it would just be a \"who can survive longer\" mode or a \"enemies i push out of the grid, will appear on yours\".\n\n+seems basic, but is deep enough to stay difficult\n+enemy variety is there\n+gameplay can hook you to do \"one more try\"\n+combinations and therefor different strategies are there\n+price is quite low for what it gives\n+can entertain for at least 2 hours, probably more though\n\n-although it being deep enough to stay difficult and offer variety, theres no reason to keep playing it\n-challenging but no purpose, no unlocks (like different colourstyles or so)\n-no different modes\n-either it gets you hooked to play for a long time or you will hate it and be bored after half an hour\n-instantly throws you in the game in windowed mode without giving you a main menu first (or a tutorial), i hate when games do that\n\n* No Multiplayer or challenges (modes/highscore etc). It could be a great game with more modes and a multiplayer (coop and versus) could be incredibly fun and offer enough variety to have people coming back to play it even after 10 hours. I think its wasted potential there to not give it more modes. I cant really count that as negative though. \n\nIts a well rounded up and made game, it works fine and entertains. So a thumbs up from me. At this price recommended, even more on sale.

I love strategy games, and upon reading about this, and also seeing that it was inspired by Imbroglio, I knew I had to give it a try.  Glad I did, as strategy games like this are few and far between.\n\nAs you can gather from the game's description, the core mechanic of the game is that when you move onto a hex, your shape is changed into the shape shown on that hex.  And with these different shapes, comes different abilities.  So your attacks and powers are dependant on the hex you are standing on at the time... your actual \"ship\" has zero inherant powers of it's own.  None.  You are completely dependant on the grid itself to fight back against the unending bugs.\n\nThe true depth though, is where it then goes with that mechanic.  Each hex can gain experience.  For the three offensive hexes, they gain experience each time you make a kill when you started the turn on their position.  For the three special hexes, they gain experience whenever an enemy bug dies on top of them.  Hexes get one experience point at a time, and each time a hex gains 6, it can gain new abilities, however the abilities that you can add to that hex are entirely determined by which hex types are next to it.  For example, if a smasher hex (lets you attack an adjacent enemy without moving) is levelled up, and there is a healing hex next to it, one of the options available will be to give it the ability to heal you whenever you destroy an enemy with it.  However, these upgrades arent universal:  Upgrading a smasher hex only upgrades that one specific smasher... the others on the board are unaffected.  So each smasher hex could end up with different powers depending on what is next to it when it levels up.   This means that the board's structure is EVERYTHING.  All of the strategy is determined by it.  What's more, the strategy is deepened by the position of each individual hex in relation to other hexes, as the different powers each can gain really do make a huge difference.  And lastly, after each enemy \"wave\", a variety of possible new hexes appear on the edges of the board, and you can go and choose one, expanding the board further.  The bigger it gets, the more possibilities there are, but the complications multiply as the board keeps growing.\n\nThat of course isnt enough though:  the other half of the game is the different enemies.  At the start of each wave, enemies spawn in a group onto the board.  They take two turns to spawn:  for the first turn you'll see tiny versions of them on the space they are about to appear on (and they are invincible during this) and on the next, they fully spawn.  After that, they can act.  This means that you have a bit of time to look at the positioning of new monsters and can use that free turn to react to the situation.  This is good, because these enemies get pretty nasty.  Basic bugs are simple, just coming directly at you and dying in one hit, but things get really wonky when other abilities are added to them, such as armor, the ability to snipe, or explosiveness, which outright destroys the hex it's on when the enemy dies (losing a strong, upgraded hex to an explosive foe really sucks).  The good thing is, there are ways to counter everything in the game.  THose explosive jerks for instance.  Normally, they'll ALWAYS explode when killed.  But if you have an acid hex next to another acid hex, and level one of those up, selecting the acid-based power available to it, that acid hex will not only strip enemies that land on it of their armor (which is the acid hex's default ability), but it gains the additional ability to defuse explosive enemies.  There isnt really any all-powerful combination though; the enemy selection is designed as such that they can counter you as well.  Paying attention to enemy positions in relation to absolutely every other freaking thing is important.\n\nThe best thing though is that the game is very well balanced.  Of the 6 hexes, there arent any that are going to be rarely-used, all 6 are equally important.  The same goes for all the different abilities that can be gained by each type.  And there really isnt any single strategy that will always work.  One way or another, you absolutely will have to think your way through things anew every single time, and the situation just keeps changing througout each run.\n\nThe interface is nice too.  Everything is easy to read, easy to spot, easy to use... it's all very intuitive, clean, and efficient.  And you can right click on anything for more info.\n\nThe one disadvantage the game has:  There is NO other content than this basic mode.  None.  There's no unlockables, no \"campaign\", no other modes.... this even lacks a title screen, which I find moderately baffling.  This is effectively a game in it's absolute most purified form, and for some players, that could be an issue.  The game really is ENTIRELY about the core experience.  It reminds me of alot of older arcade games in that way:  those also had no seperate modes, no unlockables... it was just the absolute pure single experience and not a single thing else, with the goal being to score as high as you can (which is the goal here too).  So, this is something you need to keep in mind when deciding wether to buy this or not.\n\nFor me though, that's not even remotely an issue.  I play alot of games that have that aspect.  And one way or another, this is just a blast to play.  And with each run being not all that long yet still very deep, it has that \"one more go\" aspect to it, and I expect this one will keep me coming back over and over again.   It's fun, it's deep, it's challenging, it's the sort of strategy game I really like.\n\nI do wish/hope that this can get released on mobile, too.  I'd absolutely love to have this on my iPad.  It would work just as well there as it does here.   But for now, this absolutely will do.

You change into a shape corresponding with the tile you move onto, and your goal is to survive for as long as possible against endlessly spawning enemies. It is a turn-based game, and you can level up the tiles you are on as well as add to the size of the hex grid.\n\nMechanically, the game is extraordinarily simple. There are six tile types in the game \u2013hammer (shoot things in adjacent cells), arrow (jump 2 tiles forward, killing everything in your way \u2013 but if you only move one tile, you push them instead), blade (kill everything on either side of your line of attack), acid (strips armor from an enemy which moves onto it \u2013 armored enemies are otherwise invincible), repair (repairs you when you move onto it), and teleport (you can teleport to any point on the board from this hex).\n\nCells that can kill enemies gain one experience every time you kill an enemy from them. Cells that cannot kill enemies gain one experience every time an enemy dies on it. When a cell gains six experience, it levels, and allows you to choose a level benefit based on any hex adjacent to that tile. Acid cells can be made to kill enemies which are stripped by them if they choose the hammer benefit, for instance, or can repair you whenever an enemy moves onto them if the repair benefit is chosen. This adds more variety to the gameplay, and is really core to making it more than extremely simple (though it is still quite simple).\n\nThere are a handful of enemy types. All of them are called \u201cbugs\u201d, which move one hex towards you every turn (after spending one turn growing into adult forms), but they have various abilities \u2013 some just attack you if you\u2019re next to them. Some can move two tiles at once. Some push you instead of hurting you. Some can attack from range in a straight line. Some are armored, being invincible until being stripped by an acid cell. And some are explosive \u2013 they destroy the cell they die on. These can all be mixed, so you can run into a flying, explosive, armored, pushing bug, for instance.\n\nThe longer the game goes on, the more (and more complicated) bugs spawn in each wave. If you get hit once, you turn red; if you get hit twice, you die. Between waves, you can move around freely, so it is easy to heal yourself up between waves; in waves, every move is at a premium, and if multiple bugs hit you on the same turn, you take damage for each. It is possible to gain one bonus hit point if you upgrade repair tiles with other repair tiles, giving you a maximum of three hit points, and as every wave ends you get to add another tile of a random type off a side of the grid of your choice (you can see which tile would be added in which spot, adding some strategy to the game). Sometimes you will also be able to add wild card tiles \u2013 blank tiles that you get to choose the type of.\n\nSo far, so simple. So, what\u2019s the rub?\n\nThe problem is that this game is not only extremely simple, it is too simple. It just feels kind of pointless to play, like a throwaway mobile game or flash game, and after spending about 20 minutes or so with the game, you\u2019ll understand how it works and there\u2019s really nothing more after that. It is an endless game but in the end it is a rather boring one; there\u2019s no goal, no greater purpose, no achievements, nothing to aim or strive for. It isn\u2019t hard to get to wave 20+, and by that point, you will likely have fallen into a repetitive pattern which frankly just isn\u2019t all that fun to do over and over again.\n\nIn the end, I got bored with this game within an hour of picking it up, and see no real reason to ever play it again.\n", "timestamp_created": 1488643588, "timestamp_updated": 1488643588, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604256", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30317460": {"recommendationid": "30317460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101314634", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488652443}, "language": "english", "review": "Got in the Humble Monthly, but definetly worth the 5$. nice little puzzle game, that gives how ever many hours of game play you want.", "timestamp_created": 1488643000, "timestamp_updated": 1488643000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30316766": {"recommendationid": "30316766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003962357", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488640620}, "language": "english", "review": "Very simple control-scheme and user-interface both make it too ambiguous to figure out how to play.

With just a few attempts I'm able to reach 30 tiles, but surviving long term takes long term planning. And each wave of enemies spawn takes a careful approach to dispatch without dying.\n\n2 small complaints: I sometimes forget to repair myself with shields between waves and I feel really dumb when losing to that mistake. The other mistake I made was clicking on a distant tile several times to enable it only to have my bug auto-navigate across a different transparent tile along the way (ending up with the wrong new tile).\n\nOk, one more complaint. The audio is super flat and boring. Visually it communicates everything important, layering several components of enemies in a very natural way. And the design is really great! I'm constantly thinking, making tough planning choices, and feeling smart as I manage narrow escapes.", "timestamp_created": 1488600953, "timestamp_updated": 1488645467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30307056": {"recommendationid": "30307056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005833311", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488600571}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5360\u9886\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u5757\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u201c\u6b66\u5668\u201d\uff0c\u73a9\u4e86\u4e24\u5c40\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u6253\u5230\u4e8622\u3002\n\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bb2\u7a76\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6765\u8bb2\u533a\u5757\u7684\u79cd\u7c7b\u8fd8\u662f\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\uff0c\u8010\u73a9\u6027\u5927\u6253\u6298\u6263\u3002\n\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6298\u6263\uff0c\u4e0d\u5efa\u8bae\u539f\u4ef7\u5165\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1488600718, "timestamp_updated": 1488600787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30306049": {"recommendationid": "30306049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090843111", "num_games_owned": 4240, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488595244}, "language": "english", "review": "It was ON SALE on 3rd, March, and was included in the LATEST HUMBLE BUNDLE which was released on 4th. \n\nAnd I hated that I have to download & play it to leave a commentary.\n\nWhatelse can I say?\n\nOh, right.

There are a few different enemies that will cause problems and you will have to figure out a strategy to beat them. \n\n-GamePlay-\nEssentially each game you have to defeat every enemy and after that you choose a hex with a powerup that you want on and then the next wave begins, there are different upgrades you can get by defeating enemies on different hex's. I don't want to go into too much detail on how to play the game as it's best to figure that out on your own though it is very easy to get the hang of.\n\n-Worth \u00a34?-\nTo be honest it very much depends on whether you like repeating the same things over and over again without any \"Goal\", it's a very fun puzzle game which I'll definitely turn on every now and then and have a quick few games though I would love to see this as a mobile game. So if you can ignore the lack of \"Goal\" then Yes, if not then I'd say no.\n\n-Conclusion-\nA very fun but short puzzle game with random levels. I give it a 7.5/10 Just because it lacks content, such as an end goal (Campaign, Scenarios etc) which could have added more to it without feeling somewhat empty.", "timestamp_created": 1488565450, "timestamp_updated": 1488565450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721117", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40942502": {"recommendationid": "40942502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049568493", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "last_played": 1521001151}, "language": "english", "review": "Best use of steamtrailers Ive ever seen.", "timestamp_created": 1521567458, "timestamp_updated": 1521567458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40789893": {"recommendationid": "40789893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094803808", "num_games_owned": 1433, "num_reviews": 1253, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1520955384}, "language": "english", "review": "-", "timestamp_created": 1520955403, "timestamp_updated": 1520955403, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.355267", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40621690": {"recommendationid": "40621690", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981255414", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520393137}, "language": "english", "review": "GREAT game..

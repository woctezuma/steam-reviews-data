It\u2019s a weird game. It\u2019s a game I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t honestly know how much I like it. But I came away knowing one thing: Dujanah is utterly singular and unlike any other game I\u2019ve ever played. \n\nDujanah is a simple game with a simple premise. You play as a woman looking for her husband and daughter. The art is strange and jarring, and the music is bizarre and brilliant. You talk to NPCs who tell you long stories about their life, or maybe you get in a brief fight with a sand worm. It's a game about death, a subject Jack King-Spooner has dealt with intimately as well in Beeswing. But it's also a game about wanting, about vengeance, about grief, and about spiders.\n\nThe world and internal logic of Dujanah is so unique and surprising that I constantly felt on edge. Still, parts of Dujanah fall horribly flat; there are some mini-games that last far too long to be worth the process, and its attempts at humor can be truly awful, being needlessly obscene. Which is strange, because Dujanah excells at subtlety. There are sections of dialogue and little quips from characters that come off masterfully (a particular conversation in this game is one of my favorite moments in any game I've played). The game comes off as tone deaf at times. \n\nDujanah is like Trout Mask Replica or the art of Jean-Michel Basquiat; I don\u2019t know how much I like it or understand it, but it needs to exist. They say things that are unique and subversive in ways I cannot expect other art to be. They are polychromatic, shocking, often beautiful and repulsive in the same breath. Dujanah confuses me and upsets me, but I cannot help but respect it and look at it with utter fascination and respect.", "timestamp_created": 1515656952, "timestamp_updated": 1515656952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39079662": {"recommendationid": "39079662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324609647", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515148524}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful game about the inevitabilty of death and how to deal with grief set in the backdrop of a western occupied middle eastern nation.

Seriously, every little nook-and-cranny is beautiful. [b]The music is outstanding.[/b] But here is the weird thing - the highs for the sound/ambience/music are 10/10-best-I've-heard-in-a-damned-long-while BUT the lows for some of the screeching and babies crying (etc.) will induce ear bleeding. I had to manually mute it for some parts. [i]Sometimes[/i] this can be a good thing, but I think the envelope was pushed too far during certain moments here. The music is so good though, that I'm not sure why you have to go to Itch to get the soundtrack. Money left on the table.\n\nNow I'm not at the end of the story yet, because I'm not certain I will be able to finish the arcade games. Talk about hard-as-nails. I have the skill, but I'm not sure I have the patience. Why? Well, I mentioned that the story is abstract. I [i]want[/i] the story to compel me forward and suck me in. I wanted to fall in love with it. There are brief moments where I 'get it' and we start going that direction, but mostly it's like a mid-1960's Bob Dylan song - it sounds philosophical and awesome but doesn't really add up to much. In [i]Dujanah[/i] I get serious overtones of climate change, terrorists living in caves, the United States of America, to name a few. There is also a dab of potty humor, which kind of works. Kind of. \n\nI also mention the game is difficult at times. At one point an arcade opens up and you have to win 3 of the games. Let me tell you these are mostly full-blown games. The MetroidVania is better than some I've paid for, lol. [b]One of the games is called [i]Pie or Anus?[/i].[/b] You read that right. They slowly reveal a picture and you have to guess which it is. It's actually kind of traumatizing. Anyways I'm currently trying to win the two games, and they are decidedly difficult. I wish I had more story to drive me forward. I don't. These kinds of games work off of the mechanic of getting the player interested in trying to see the next weird thing around the next corner and NOT a difficult platforming section. Does that make sense?\n\nBut yeah, there is a lot of weird stuff around a lot of weird corners. Things like:\n[list]\n[*]A room full of pregnant naked ladies\n[*]A movie theatre with a movie of a dude putting something into a sex dolls mouth\n[*]You walk around on a crying face and listen to poetry\n[/list]\n\nAnd on and on. \n\nI also mention a grindy element to this game. Not grindy as you would find in an RPG when leveling up, but more things that take more time than they should. There are a lot of weak mazes that just have you wandering through to find people. It doesn't add anything other than time. Searching for stuff in the desert. In the [i]Mario Kart[/i]-esque minigame, why do I have to suffer 7 races? Why not 3? You achieve the same effect.\n\n[b]But even after all that complaining I just did - the game has some of the best music and artwork I've seen.[/b] There are tons of one-off philosophical quotes that really made me think, too. Some wonderfully written stories by NPCs that really made me think. \n\n[b]If you are interested in this type of game - you likely care less about sales and more about supporting artists that really propel video games forward [i]as an art[/i].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1509233539, "timestamp_updated": 1509233572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36037819": {"recommendationid": "36037819", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994900280", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509049552}, "language": "english", "review": "WHAT THE ACTUAL - in a good waay\n\nI wasn't aware of Jack's earlier works and I bought the game after seeing a brief peek in a czech videogame YT show.\n\nCouldn't be more happy.\n\nDunajah combines so many things, funny, truly subversive, profound and emotional in an exquisitely unique assemblage of clay-punk-magical-glitch-realism package (let's adopt the term, haha) and most importantly - PULSS IT OFF. \n\nCombining reflection on videogame stereotypes, archaic interfaces, geopolitics, references to Trump, other games, \u017di\u017eek (at least I think - the sniff sniff spider in the cave), philosophy (very thoughtful sequence discussing consciousness and death) seems like a recipe for disaster, but it comes out as coherent, and - importantly - emotional work of art.

a non-English-speaking person and I can't say that I'm very diligent, so I don't think I could understand the story of this game 100%.\nBut this is a special to me, so I decided to write a review.\nThis is a review written by a shallow understanding person, so it will not be very helpful. It's just dog's somniloquy.\n\nThe previous work by the developer(Jack King-Spooner), \"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/365580/Beeswing/]Beeswing[/url]\", seemed to be a very important work for him.\nCompared to the previous experimental work, there was a potential to surely reach more people on the commercial piece side.\nThen, this work, Dujanah seems to be a culmination of his, including works before \"Beeswing\". There are fragments of past works everywhere, and the previous attempts have been fully utilized in terms of technology.\nIn many cases, games that can be called culmination (or sequel) are very conservative.\nFor game developers, it is natural that they tend to be self-parody, forced to face their own phantom.\nNevertheless, \"Dujanah\" has a completely unknown experience, it has become an experimental and challenging work.\nFor the artist, I think this is a very good thing and I felt greatly the future possibilities.\n\nWhat can be felt superficially with this work is, cute and grotesque, pleasant music and unpleasant noise, revolutionary ingenuity and rough cutting gimmicks, old gods, and unknown ones. People who looks decent, people who do not look decent.\nThese conflicting elements do not become 1+1=2, exist as 1 and 1, as it is.\nHigh contrast. Water and oil.\nBut, there is no incoherent and disjointed impression.\nThat is probably because there is a unshakable core based on a very personal experience and thought. It is clearly felt.\n\nA ridiculous situation suddenly becomes serious. There is uncertainty / instability or a sense of tension that the child who was asleep suddenly screams.\nIt can be a weak point, but in the case of Dujanah, it is different.\nIt's a fragile balance, but apparently it works perfectly, this uncertainty leads us to wander this weird world for 2-3 hours.\nActually, I took a lot of screenshots but I can't believe that this is the world of one game.\n\nI wrote too much. That makes it much easier to just watch the trailer and look screenshots!\nEerie, grotesque, beautiful, don't know well...It is better to believe that intuition than the scream that I emit. It is surely all right.\n\nSo what should I say? Just a word.

An automatic reloading would not be bad either.\nPartly hordes of enemies came running towards me, so I had no chance, because I had to reload or lost the weapon.\nThe escape is sometimes difficult in the rush. Coverage options are few.\nPartly it is very dark - without a flashlight no chance.\nPlease build bright, exciting levels (like AS), I've seen good ideas to make the Gameflow different. It does not always have to be dark.\nI'm looking forward to the further development of the story and greet the developers.", "timestamp_created": 1515957610, "timestamp_updated": 1515962169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39340975": {"recommendationid": "39340975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006791429", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "last_played": 1515940249}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: Early Access Review! Subject to change as the game gets more polished.\n\nAllow me to start by saying that [i]A-Tech Cybernetic (ATC)[/i] is a worthy opponent for [i]DOOM VFR[/i], and I have played the hell out (pun intended) of the latter. For being an Early Access VR title, [i]ATC[/i] showcases a pretty polished experience in every single one of its gameplay elements and being the devs so responsive about their community feedback could make this title stand out among the very best of VR.\n\n[i]A-Tech Cybernetic[/i] puts you inside the body of a former scientist, and I mean that in a literal way. You will posess him, and he will complain about it being your \"conscience\", a voice in your head that will give you advice about your surroundings along with a balanced mix of complaints, humour, sarcasm, lore explanations, and sometimes 4th wall-breaking comments. Your objective is clear: Escape from the A-Tech facilities alive.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game is reminiscent of how [i]Doom 3[/i] should be if it gets a VR remake. [i]Doom VFR[/i] is a frenetic gun & run experience, something that [i]ATC[/i] is not, and I like it because of that. [i]A-Tech Cybernetic[/i] offers a slower pace version of its counterpart, where not every single room has to be a combat area. Also, [i]ATC[/i] features a set of jumpscares and unsettling moments that will give you goosebumps at certain times. As I wrote before, it is an atmospheric horror shooter, much like how the original [i]Doom 3[/i] was conceived.\n\n[i]ATC[/i] also features a nice set of different enemies and weapons. Each enemy has an attack pattern that you should learn in order to escape an ambush or a massive attack. Also, you will have a versatile arsenal that will make your life easier if you manage your ammo. Should you get a second gun because you have a lot of ammo, or maybe you will risk to take up a machine gun, despite its high-consumption bullet rate? Strategy is something to take in account inside a facility that is crawling up with monsters that want to eat your brains out.\n\nGraphics are gorgeous, even in their current state. Lightning and particle effects, combined with high-quality meshes and animations, achieve a futuristic, yet opresive atmosphere. Something that, for an Early Access title, is not an easy task.\n\nThe sound quality is also pretty good. The ambience music and the environmental effects perfectly fit the dark sci-fi mood of the game, and I have to confess that I found myself turning around more than a few times because of hearing something at my back.\n\nVR-related, it features both teleporting and a locomotion system using one of the trackpads. You can holster two weapons and take another two with you in each one of your hands, although you will have to drop one momentarily to pick up any other item. To reload, you just have to move your weapons to the ammo belt, making it a fast and intuitive way of managing your magazines. [i]A-Tech Cybernetic[/i] features close combat techniques and weapons, wheter hitting an enemy with your bare fists or with a metal bar is just a matter of choice. Finally, it also allows to launch grenades by picking up one, pulling out its ring and throwing it away, releasing a big ka-boom that might save your life if you ran out of ammo.\n\nI totally recommend this game for its current price, even being in Early Access. I am eager to see what the devs have in storage for us at the A-Tech facilities, because everything I have seen so far looks promising.", "timestamp_created": 1515943238, "timestamp_updated": 1515948571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39328149": {"recommendationid": "39328149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021766012", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "last_played": 1515897894}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udca9Man, Doom Who ?

(Early Access)\n\nA narrative-driven full locomotion/teleportation shooter available on Steam VR for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\n\nGreat voice acting.\nGreat asset/character design.\nAwesome graphics.\n\nLove the concept \u2013 trapped in the Antagonist\u2019s head.\n\nThe mild tongue-in-cheek humor brings balance to the scarier, more intense moments of the game.\n\nThe \u201cvoice\u201d assists with the current mission, directing the player in a humorous/aggressive manner.\n\nNavigate through a map, directed by a voice in my mind (or vice-versa, lol).\n\nEncounter a barrier of some sort, get directed by the \u201cvoice\u201d, fight monsters on the path, encounter a terminal and enter a puzzle mini-game, then proceed down the route to the next barrier.\n\nLooting is a vaguely strong dynamic in the game, as ammo and life can be an issue.\n\nYou must actively holster your weapons, and will lose your weapon if you drop it and walk away.\n\nYou can directly pick up, or \u201cforce-grab\u201d ammo, health, armor, and weapons.\n\nYou drop these items into your waist and leg holsters.\n\nCombat involves melee and ranged \u2013 no scopes, sticking to iron-sights on the weapons.\n\nI encountered an iron pipe, crowbar, shotgun, pistol, machine-gun, grenade, and \u201cdark\u201d variants of a few weapons. Time slowed down twice during my gameplay, but both times were narrative driven, activated by the voice in my head. There is no way to directly slow down time. It would be nice to do this as a power, perhaps.\n\nYou find yourself moving around a level, picking up ammo, finding and holstering appropriate weapons, and looking for keycards. The design on the key-cards is pretty cool.\n\nThere are scary and intense moments as enemy numbers can get overwhelming, or the area can get pitch black. The sound of a door closing is the spookiest thing in the world.\n\nThe game feels like a futuristic house-of-the-dead mixed with Doom.\n\nFeatures a Mission mode and \u201cSwarm\u201d (wave) mode.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nOverall, I recommend this game - it has a great creepy vibe highlighted by the narration to balance things out. I love the graphics and the theme of the entire environment. A very visceral journey into the bowels of some un-godly facility. I look forward to updates as they come, as the game is still in Early Access. Can't wait to master this game!\n\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/217671834", "timestamp_created": 1515751197, "timestamp_updated": 1516200059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39256591": {"recommendationid": "39256591", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983689849", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514872778}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid, and creepy, story based FPS that felt more Doom like than Doom in some parts. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/GDCrLgSFaS8\n\nA-Tech Cybernetic starts you off with a Solid tutorial that runs down the basics of the game. Not much to say here. It did its job.\n\nReloading mechanics were not as in depth as I was expecting however the combat was fairly arcadey. More Raw Data than Onward or H3vr. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just some of the wording had my expectations set differently.\n\nA-Tech Cybernetic uses both Teleport and Trackpad locomotion. Teleport feels a bit more like a way to climb over obstacles than a standard locomotion option however I didn't try to play pure teleporter. I do like both options available at all times though as there are situations where a good teleport can be extremely convenient or life saving.\n\nUnfortunately waggling seems to be at least partially effective with melee weapons however the number of enemies and the number of ammo drops you get make this somewhat of a moot point. Also, while I can technically waggle and do damage, a full bodied swing carries a lot more force with it. Enoug to lift enemies off their feet and send them flying. So while you CAN do it, you're not really rewarded for it. This seems acceptable to me.\n\nThe light play in spots was really well done and I would have liked to see more of this used. Dark tunnels and glowing eyes make for some creepy firefights.\n\nOverall the atmosphere of the game was very creepy and had me jumping at every closing door sound. Even managing to legitimately scare me when the teleporters showed up. I don't jump easily so props to the designer who placed that surprise there.\n\nI loved the voice acting and by that I mean I hated the guy stuck in my head. Which as far as I'm concerned is how you're supposed to feel about the guy so great job there.\n\nMy biggest complaint/request is that: Holsters need haptic feedback to inform you that you've placed your weapon in the appropriate slot for holstering your weapon. Too many times did I drop my weapon to the floor when i thought I should have holstered it. A simple, on enter volume, vibrate for a half second line of code would go a huge way towards QoL improvement.\n\nI would have also liked to see a two handed grip for the rifle. Even if it didn't provide a benefit. It just feels better.\n\nWhile very well done, the chapters feel fairly short. The current story content is on the light side at the moment. You're buying into the promise of future free content updates. This has it's pros and cons and depends on your past experiences... You're going to get about an hour and a half to 2 hours give or take depending on how much you rush vs explore. I tend to explore more and want to see all the things. Someone who just wants to rush the game is going to probably be able to clock in around an hour or so. Thus is the risk and drama of EA.\n\nThe swarm mode seems like it could be fun if they added a multiplayer component to it but I don't see myself spending a lot of time in there. I strongly prefer the story content.\n\nUltimately I had a hell of a lot of fun with this game. I can't wait to explore the rest of this story. XReal Games. More please.

Poco dopo aver preso familiarit\u00e0 con il sistema di controllo, che include sia il free movement che il classico teleport, ci ritroveremo di fronte ai primi scontri a fuoco, combattendo contro decine di temibili robot in un contesto a met\u00e0 tra il Terminator di Cameron e il terzo capitolo di Doom.\n\nNonostante il titolo si presenti come un FPS story driven, con mappe di discreta dimensione completamente esplorabili in cui dovremo trovare chiavi e risolvere piccoli enigmi, il cuore del gameplay sta chiaramente nei sopracitati scontri a fuoco. Questi ultimi si rivelano estremamente soddisfacenti grazie ad uno splendido gunplay dato dall\u2019ottima responsivit\u00e0 delle armi, un bell\u2019impianto scenografico ed una fluidit\u00e0 impeccabile, contando soprattutto l\u2019abbondante quantit\u00e0 di elementi contemporaneamente su schermo.\n\nLeggi la recensione completa su [url=https://www.vr-italia.org/a-tech-cybernetic/] VR ITALIA [/url].", "timestamp_created": 1515075466, "timestamp_updated": 1515075466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39035650": {"recommendationid": "39035650", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972427569", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1516064341}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic!

It's very easy to forget you're just standing / sitting there playing a game. The screenshots above make it look like a balls-to-the-wall action / shooter. They don't really do it justice. The trailers are quite a bit better, but still don't quite capture the feeling of actually playing it. The actual game is a lot creepier and more atmosperic than they would lead you to believe.\nAs far as the game itself, there's a lot of good things that can be said about it. Even the \"zombie\" type enemies are quite a bit more interesting as far as look and animations go. The controls are extremely precise, the guns feel great to use and the game preforms very well.\nIt should also be said that this is exactly what an Early Access game should be. It seems to be in constant, very active development. I guess they've even gone so far as to completely revamp all the voice acting for the story mode, and completely rebuilt large parts of the levels because some people prefer walking to the standard VR teleportation movement. The devs seem very active in the community and very open to suggestions and discussion.\nOverall, I really hope more VR games turn out to be what A-Tech is becoming. If you're on the fence, you really should try the demo. I think there's a good chance you'll end up with the full game, especially considering how low the price is for what you're getting.", "timestamp_created": 1514994507, "timestamp_updated": 1514994507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39001922": {"recommendationid": "39001922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202562568", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514963020}, "language": "english", "review": "This is for Doom fans.

Lots of good implementations. Overall feel and immersion is nicely done. With the amount of experiences out there, I have a few things I would personally like to see for me to fully recommend. \n\n\nFull locomotion. It\u2019s almost there! Would love to see an option (keep those who don\u2019t prefer it happy) to turn the right joystick from teleport to full locomotion. When you get rushed it would be nice to be able to pivot with full loco than have to remember to press the buttons for a turn. For me, its an immersion breaker. \nSounds from gunfire feel flat. Voice is yelling in your ear but gun shots seem muffled and unfulfilling. I had to turn down the volume to start with the voice over. Then maxed it out when I fired my first shot to max the sound out but it just wasn\u2019t there. \nBetter use of storage belt. Maybe I would see more in the full version but the storage belt seemed under utilized. I could add ammo to it but I never needed to take anything out. Also, things like a flashlight/grenade would be great to have another spot on the vest to store. I really wanted to carry the flashlight for immersion and to appreciate details of dark areas etc. However, I also wanted two guns and had to drop my flashlight and remember to pick it up when rushed by enemies. I wish I could place it (on my chest maybe) and reach for my guns and then holster my gun to grab it off my chest rather than looking for it where ever I dropped it. Same with picking up ammo. I would have to drop something to grab the ammo and then pick up what I just dropped. It seemed like more of a chore than it should have been. \n\nKudos to the developer(s) though.

The weapon handling is good, except for the missing recoil which makes the guns feel less \"big\". Melee is an option you always have (either using melee weapons or just your fists), but for the most part I just used guns. The locomotion system combines direct locomotion with teleporting allowing you to use both at the same time and it feels great. The only issue is that direct locomotion currently is always relative to your head, not to the controller. There are a few different enemies in A-Tech Cybernetic (I think I've encountered 5 different types of enemies) which is enough for the current 2 chapters, but for further chapters I'd hope for for diverse enemies.\n\nThe story mode is nothing special, but still enjoyable, even though the voice acting is a bit too loud and quickly gets annoying. The levels are built mostly linearly with a few detours for finding the next keycard, but you're never wondering where to go next (also because the direction of your next goal is always visible).\n\nThe biggest issue A-Tech Cybernetic currently has in my opinion is its inventory system. Each ammo pickup needs to be picked up and placed in your inventory manually and you have only two holsters available for the 4 different guns I've seen until now. Taking a shotgun, a rifle and a backup pistol with you just about works with two holsters and a hand, because you always need a free hand for picking up ammo and interacting with things. Dual-wielding the same gun is nearly impossible because there's not enough ammo to use only one weapon type and thus you need the inventory space for backup weapons. Melee weapons and grenades can't be holstered/stored in any way, so you're not going to be able to effectively take them very far when finding them.\n\nA-Tech Cybernetic is still in Early Access and it shows, but the developer is pretty active and the issues I've pointed out here are all currently being worked on. More chapters of the story are to come, but even right now for the current 2 chapters I feel like the 15\u20ac pricetag is definitely reasonable.", "timestamp_created": 1514316272, "timestamp_updated": 1514316272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38697599": {"recommendationid": "38697599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122849392", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514863032}, "language": "french", "review": "si vous aimer doom 3 ,  vous aimerez A-Tech cybernetic ,jolie et tres bien optimisee (pas de resolution dynamique ) il est aussi sympas que fear effect 2 ou doom mais avec un soup\u00e7on de frayeur par moment car vous serez parfois surpris ,il possede sa propre aventure qui est ajoutee au fur et amesure des mises a jour qui ajoutes des missions du scenario ,3 niveaux de difficultee ,le mode swarm ou on extermine les vagues successive a la maniere du mod zomby de call of duty , et a un prix tres bon vu la qualite du jeux ,les dev sont douees .pour voir ma video du test : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCagRv3bPFbY3ljfnIy4iARg", "timestamp_created": 1514296811, "timestamp_updated": 1514296811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38645143": {"recommendationid": "38645143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038714319", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514173592}, "language": "english", "review": "i now have over 2 hours playing A-tech. so,..i thought it would be a good time to write an early review.\nthere are some things you need to know about this game. first off at this point if you are expecting a complete polished product...well this isnt it....Dont get me wrong this is a good game..the level design is topnotch...the monsters look great..the weapon modles are near perfect..the locomotion gives you both walking and teleporting in an excelent format using one hand to walk and the other to teleport...they set the mood of the game using first class skill...and i cant recomend  getting in on a project of this caliber enough..as early as you can for 2 reasons first is to fund the development...the dev teem working on this game is world class and it shows in their work..the second reason is you will end up with a AAA title for durt cheep in the end.\nI am running an I7 2700k (OC to 5ghz) ..an invidia GTX 1080 founders {OC +100mhz) and 32GB DDR3 @ 1600mhz with a raid-0 hdd array {2 x 7200rpm)\nthe game loads quickly runs smoothly ..and doesnt tax any of my system resources more than 60% on max settings so it would probably run fine on a gtx 970.\nwith all that there are some bad things about the game...the holsters are easy to miss..the health bar would be better if it was lower on the hud or even movable..and the voice acting is sub par but starting to grow on me..also grenades dont belong in your holster lol..so yes the good far out shines the bad...and the game is still in development so some of this may change..(for the better)...so yes i recomend this to evryone looking to get in on the next AAA title because this is it.", "timestamp_created": 1514175800, "timestamp_updated": 1514175800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38625807": {"recommendationid": "38625807", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972090300", "num_games_owned": 987, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514146670}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow...

Here at VR Galaxy we were granted the opportunity to play and review this game for Free. We though this game was a total blast and a lot of fun. You can tell that the developers put in a lot of time and hard work to create the environments and make the atmosphere feel spooky and tense. You really feel like you are on a Outpost or base in deep space or on another planet. The lighting, textures and sound design are all top notch. The enemies are creepy and they run fast. There is a nice variety of weapons to choose from, including a pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, special weapon, grenades, etc. I like how there is smooth locomotion and teleportation support, so people who are prone to motion sickness can still enjoy this game, but those who can use locomotion feel more immersed. Right now there are 2 chapters to the game and a Horde mode. We played most of the 2 chapters, pretty close to the end. This game offers a lot of fast action and immersion and does a great job of keeping you entertained and on the edge of your seat....even though you're standing! There are a few things that we would like to see chnaged or added into the game. We would like to see a faster speed of locomotion movement, because when there are a lot of enemies chasing you, they can catch you too easily, especially if you run out of ammo. Speaking of ammo, we would like to see more ammo placed around the levels. Often times, it feels like you don't have enough ammo and you just die, because you are overwhelmed by so many enemies all at once. You might want to space out the enemies a little more. At times it feels like there are no enemies in some places and then there are a ton, all at once. Also, the big doors always close on you after you press the button to open them. They seem to be glitchy and enemies sometimes get stuck in the environments and \"clip\" out. Overall, these are minor issues and we would highly recommend this game.

It's a bit linear, in that aside from going up and down a flight of stairs, everything seems to take place ona level floor (kind of like Doom 1 & 2).  Having the ability to shoot from a different floor than what the mutants are on would be a welcome change.\nThe controls are very decent as it mixes both locomotion and teleportation. What the controls lack (for myself) is the ability to smooth turm (instead you press buttons to rotate in 45 degree increments).\nThe weapons, although pretty to look at, lack any 'oompf' to them; it just has no recoil/kickback to make you feel like  your handling a weapon that allows you you to go medievil on a mutant.  Whether you use the pistol or pulse rifle, it feels exactly  ther same.\nMelee weapons (pipe, crowbar) are as lethal as the guns, which should not be the case.  There were a couple of hordes to where only a crowbar was needed to get the job done.  The game also has grenades you can use, but I could not find a way to store them to use later, I just left them on the floor (the crowbar kicks butt).\nOverall, the default difficulty is very easy.  Only a couple of times did I take some damage, and at no time did I really feel threatened.  It took me around an hour to get through the level.\nWhile it seems all I've done is gripe, the overall presentation is solid, and I want to give the developer a chance with Chapter 2, before rendering a final verdict.

The devs have turned things around and we've got a very solid game building here. The graphics have been improved with more varied room designs and furnishings and excellent lighting. Flashlights now illuminate correctly and melee combat provide more damage.\n\nAfter replaying from the start I can tell the revised chapter 1 is an overhauled version of the previous design and it plays much better than before. And the new story does a good job at motivating you through the levels. I really enjoyed playing to the end of chapter 2, though I haven't managed to get past the epic fight at the end of this chapter which I'm finding pretty intense.\n\nI've changed my opinion to a thumbs up and now feel I'm getting a proper game for my money and definately looking forward to the next chapter.\n\nOld review:\n5.4 out of 10\n\nUpdated EA review, chapter 1 story mode:\nI've just completed the first chapter; indeed the only available chapter of the story mode as now. It's okay, not great in any respect. The environment is corridors, rooms, locked doors and cyber zombie hordes. Find the keycards to unlock doors to rooms, then find the next keycard, etc... While fending off the enemy along the way. There is a story, which you get an introduction to partway through the chapter.\n\nSo far nothing to blow your socks off, the level design is average, average visuals, average combat. And the story backdrop, well that's average too, backed up with average voice acting. No major bugs, some cyber zombie pathfinding stuttering when a group of enemy run into each other or the environment. The melee combat feels weak, but you'll generally avoid that as much as possible. Flashlights are useless, they illuminate nothing at all.\n\nI'm somewhat disapointed having previous high hopes of the potential before the first chapter arrived. The game has underdelivered, all the parts fundamentially work but all those parts feel just passible and lazily combined with just the most basic level of effort.\n\nWhat a shame!\n\nOldest review:\nMy EA impression is that the overall presentation, graphics and gunplay is outstanding. The game is gorgeous, however the actual meat of the content is lacklustre at this point in time as it's missing the real reason to play this game which is the story mode. As of now it just contains the wave based survival mode, and it's mearly passable. It's a worthwhile element to flesh out a VR shooter which has a story mode, but it just feels like a secondary element rather that the reason to own this game. The wave action is bland, it's challanging but repetitive, and certainly boosted by the exellent visuals.\n\nI picked this up when the price was reduced, which at least is more fair to match the content included right now. The promised roadmap from the developers is interesting and this 'could' be a must have title if the finished product lives up the potential you can already experience in the game so far.\n\nNot recommending now based on the actual playable content available, but will revise my review when we get the complete game.", "timestamp_created": 1494777471, "timestamp_updated": 1513548149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553823", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31648023": {"recommendationid": "31648023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293324932", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514490094}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely the game to get for the vive.\n\nExtremely fun to play, jam packed action and enemies from all directions.\n\nDespite being a wave-shooter I never felt like it, because I was immersed in a total action-horror world.", "timestamp_created": 1494342649, "timestamp_updated": 1494342649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31582138": {"recommendationid": "31582138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044896484", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494083700}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently it's like the good old Call of Duty zombie mode (not the crap new ones), just in VR and in Doom-ish style.

I enjoyed the gameplay a lot, and I think this VR title has great potential with future updates adding story-mode, challenges and more content. Check my first gameplay video of A-Tech Cybernetic and you may probably understand:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp9n3edzPDE\nMy thoughts:\nWell yes, so far A-Tech Cybernetic is far from finished as its in an Early Access stage, where only a wave-based mode is available together with a tutorial. But the wave-based mode is quite challenging after a while, and will probably take some skills to complete. There also seems to be a locked level that unlocks when you reach a certain amount of points in first level, I haven't reached so far thou, so I dont know what the locked level is about yet.\n\nAnyway, the developers are promising both more levels as well as a story mode, more weapons and challenges coming up during april-may 2017, so I guess soon we really can see this games real potential. If you want to buy it now, or wait until then - well that's up to you, but I think definitely you should give it a try at some point.\n\nThe graphics are stunning, and environment gives you that DOOM-feeling with good immersion and atmosphere. Bullet time feature is working nicely and adds a lot when the game becomes intense, and it also look quite neat as well! Big plus for the tutorial as well, that is well-made and appreciated by most people I guess, especially people new to VR. The physics seems nice, even thou I think it will be more polished in upcoming updates as well. \n\nAll in all, an entertaining Early Access VR experience that probably gets even better very soon!\n\nThe good stuff:\n+ Graphics are really great - good VR immersion!\n+ Sounds and music fits this game\n+ Good weapon handling and easy to aim\n+ Love the Bullet-time feature\n+ Challenging after a few waves\n+ Running smooth on High settings on GTX 980 Ti\n+ Nice tutorial\n+ Wave based shooter-mode not bad at all!\n\nThe bad/less good stuff:\n- Lacks content (but updates are coming up soon with story-mode etc)\n- No manual reloading with magazines/clips (hopefully added later)\n- Only teleportation movement, free touchpad locomotion would have been nice\n- The price for the content

I hope it may be valuable and can help make game better:\n\n1. Sometimes hard to holster a weapon, very easy to miss and drop the gun to the floor (larger hit area for the holster?) The same about reloading.\n2. Hard to look down at holster to actually see whats inside (yes, there is also an icon in a hud, but the weapon should be observable in a holster too)\n3. The very first level looks to dark with no reason. I am not talking about really dark areas where you have to use flashlight, but about regular rooms. They may look and play better if made out of light colors. And overall darkness does not makes game more scary (if that is the case).\n4. Shooting a pistol does not requires actual aiming??? Was pointing the gun very losely towards mosters and still get consistant hits.\n5. The game design as a whole feels outdated: going back and forth for keys is very demotivating. It may be OK to get one key to open one door at some point, but N keys in a row??! It is not 1993 - by today's standards it feels very dumb. It destroys the feel of progress and achievement. Ambushes and jump scares are not very good too. After a couple of times they just stop working on player: you see a corridor with doors and instantly know there will be an ambush. Very predictable. IMHO it is better push \"shooter\" aspect of the game, not \"horror\": it already got a lot of enemies and envolves a lot of combat - it is a shooter in a first place.\n6. The feedback of shooting the gun and killing the monsters is not very good: the sound of shooting is not \"crunchy\" and not loud, the impacts on monsters gives very basic feedback and no noticiable satisfaction. And this is not a small detail - this is one of a core part of fun in a shooter games!\n7. Melee weapon: wish there will be some indication the monster is knocked down, but still alive. For now it looks like it falls dead, but it is not. The knockdown mechanics itself is quastionable too.\n8. One click to grab item and one more to finally collect? It feels excessive and does not adds fun. Yet the ability to grab from a distance is awesome!\n\nI personally wish more open spaces, more situations when enemies walks from one side. There still can be ambushes and jump scares and they will work much better, if NOT happens in a row.

You've likely played with tilt brush and robo recall and job simulator and you are past the initital impact of a game whose market is \"people who are trying VR for the first time\". This is not a tech-demo. A-Tech cybernetic is a VR game that feels more like a \"game I boot up my headset for\", rather than the other way around. It feels great, it moves well enough, but more importantly its narrative is inclusive of VR. The gunplay feels great - like a box title rather than a pitch for the hardware.\n\nThe enemies explode and splatter in very satisfying ways - everything feels fresh and tactile. The game simultaneously offers both teleporation and locomotion ad hoc, rather than stashed in an options menu. I think this makes either option feel like a viable choice, rather than some sort of handicap.\n\nThe spooky moments rarely feel like consequences of VR and moreso come from well-placed situations that play into VR. There was a point in which I opened a drawer and found a human head inside. Despite there being no major motivation to grab and open the drawer, I set myself up for a scare with my own hands. Overall A-Tech Cybernetic is a hell of a game and I wish a few more games would sell confident VR games rather than excuses for overtly ambitious control schemata or high-concept 20-minute titles, especially considering the infantile state of VR as an industry.\n\nLet's talk downsides - The game suffers from a lack of objective variety. Most of the game involves collecting keycards with interesting sequences sprinkled within. There's a few gorgeous slow-mo sequences reminsicent of those \"breaching\" set pieces in last generation Call of Duty games. Melee feels great except when it doesn't -- hits seem to lack responsiveness and the same range of strike seems to inconsistently whack enemies. When a hit connects and a baddie flies across the room it feels great, albeit a bit more predictability of impact would be a big win.\n\nHolstering weapons is a bit of a chore. Sometimes I'll attempt to pull a weapon from holster and will instead grab a health pack from the ground at my feet. The issues with holstering and melee are probably more \"Early Access\" issues and are likely to be remedied by tweaks, not major design changes. The gameplay is fun and despite a lack of variety, the thing presented is a good thing, so it's unlikely to be exhausting even several few hours in. The narration is entertaining and often authentically funny, and it's well placed to help drive through some of the slower points of the game. Overall it is one of the most enjoyable VR experiences I've stumbled upon, and I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nPros\n+ Narrative-driven VR single player\n+ High Production Value\n+ Entertaining Narration\n+ Satisfying gunplay\n+ Doesn't patronize gamers - target market already owns a headset\n\nCons\n- Holster is hard to use in a pinch\n- Mission variety is sparse\n- Odd melee combat", "timestamp_created": 1519714207, "timestamp_updated": 1519714450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40428420": {"recommendationid": "40428420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013838194", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519697585}, "language": "english", "review": "--  Pretty good VR game.

Your job get out alive. There are two chapters to the game so far making it short time play, maybe an 2hrs on hard difficulty.\n\nSurvial Mode: (sure that is not the actual name of the mode but that is what it is to me, just survival) is a game mode where you just well survive as long you can through wave sections. Each wave mixes the different enemies to add a challenge. It has a buy item where you survive a certain number of waves you get to buy the next gun, There is also health, sheild and slow-mo drops as well. This is okay but if you save the slow-mo enough you could slow-mo 2-3 waves and be fine.  What is off on this mode is that there are more survival maps then there are story mode maps. You would think the developers would have more story then survival.\n\nThe graphics look good escpecially with the in-game super sampling setting allowing you change the graphics pretty easyily.\n\nThe sounds are great I am constantly looking everywhere from different sounds but I had to turn it off after a while because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss any diolog\n\nControls are okay I was/am having issues with the snap turing. The snap tern is also the teleport button as well so when you use the snap turn, you may teleport as well. You can click the very edge of the button to do it but I some times still teleprted. I would have liked to seen a move option so people can have 1 move system enabled instead of 2.\n\nWeapons are okay, mainly standard in games. The given pistol, the assault rifle and a shotgun. There are meele weapons and grenades as well. There is also a weird purple shotgun that acts...like a regualr shotgun. Also the ammo and weapons are placed way too much around the game. I never had to resort to a blunt weapon or my fists because the game just gave me enough ammo even on hard difficulty.\n\nCreatures: There are multiple creatures in the game which make killing a bit difficult and challenging at times.\n\nItems: There are only 3 items in the game. Ammo, health and sheild items.\n\nLogic: The logic is not that great in game. LIke headshots are not 100% instant kill or when I do a full aim exteding the gun floats out of my hand a few inches away. \n\nImmersion: The game has no immersion to it. There is no manual reload or double gripping. You can pick items up but the force grap is going to easyer instead. \n\nI am still in process of the game, trying to break it and stuff like that, also waiting on the co-op play to be released as well. This EA reciew is not my 100% review. It will changed and tweeked a bit after full game review. I say keep an eye on the game and buy it when it comes, for it should be better and bugs should be fixed and you can play with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1519594812, "timestamp_updated": 1519594812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40355656": {"recommendationid": "40355656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147186108", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519475907}, "language": "english", "review": "its great. but im not up for the frequent small jump scares. if you want constant goosebumps . go right ahead. its actually a great game. shooting, accuracy, ads, everythings great, but i dont have a strong mind to play this.", "timestamp_created": 1519475990, "timestamp_updated": 1519475990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40339849": {"recommendationid": "40339849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095271412", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519408670}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite all of this game's flaws, It is still a pretty good game.\n\nMovement controls could be improved, I often found that I would accidently teleport while shooting (Resulting in me being unable to shoot the \"things\" and unable to punch or hit them because the pistol is useless in that situation).\n\nI found grenades rather fiddly: I see a hoard. I grab a grenade. I grab again because the holdster keeps moving when you look down. I then pick up the grenade that I dropped on the floor while trying to grab it. I then pull the pin and throw. I then die because the grenade just dropped to my feet.\n\nThe issue with the holdster constantly moving around is still there. I look at the gun I am trying to grab and it keeps moving away. Also dropping the gun on the floor, because the the holdster moved.\n\nI often find that reloading a gun in a tense situation can often result in death. As in a tense situation, I tend to grip the controller tighter, which causes me to throw the gun behind me without me noticing. Which results in me standing there in the dark, frantically doing sign language at a monster, wondering why they arent dying.\n\nLove the addition of a grenade belt. Would also love a slot for the torch.\n\nI dont think there is enough time between rounds in swarm, I barely have enough time to grab 1 health pack before the round starts.\n\nFinally, those \"things\" which carry guns definitely need to be nerfed. A reduced range, a slower reaction time or made more inaccurate would be nice, as it is hard to aim at them when they are only a few pixels in size and protected by a wall of bodies and heavy machinery.\n\nI may sound nitpicky, but it is still an early access game.

For some reason it doesn't carrying the very flimsy sort of physical interaction you'd find in most VR games with melee and it makes melee extremely satisfying. The graphical quality of the game should also be mentioned - It's brilliant. Really, you wouldn't expect an Early Access title to so consistently uphold the visual quality on display herebut it does. Even the new Intro level/Menu level is brilliantly stylized and pretty awe-inspiring at the right SS level.\n\nI implore anyone looking for a good full-locomotion FPS with melee (or anyone burnt by DOOM VFR) to consider investing in this budding piece of tech - if it's this quality now, I can't wait to see how it turns out when it's done.

It felt alright, ignoring all the other assets in the game. It felt like an abandoned space base, albiet a poorly designed one. Problem is it felt like a poorly designed space base full of bland, non-memorable zombies and Jerry Seinfeld on my hecking back cracking jokes and treating me like a complete moron the whole ride. \nA majority of Doom 3 is completely unvoiced for a reason. It helps to set the atmosphere of being the \"Lone Survivor\" of the mars facility. It makes you feel alone, and builds more suspense for the spooks around. Having an open mic comedian following you around and screaming in your ears the whole time is irritating, and rips you out of the game way faster than the poor feel of the guns.\n\n[b]On the topic of map design[/b]\nSo for the most part, the map design is pretty good, it feels a lot like Doom 3's first chapter in the loneliness and being an abandoned space station, which is nice. But the actual layout of the game is... predictable. Open a door and 'oh no there's a surprise horde coming at you!' loses its effect after the second one, doing that again and again for almost every single big door is exhausting. Also, as mentioned before, it was very obvious that it was a video game when you looked at how the whole map was designed. Single hallways from room to room, no main paths that get blocked off and force you to go through spooky room 46, no. The main hallway leads THROUGH spooky exclusive room 46. There was only ONE exit in the beginning that required you to use maintenance shafts to get out of the hecking dorm room. Why was the hangar several miles and two loading screens away from said dorms? Imagine having to carry your luggage from the ship ALL THE WAY, through several spooky rooms, and high security offices, a cold storage, and several needlessly large flights of stairs that go absolutely nowhere... On that topic, how on earth did you get a forklift to do anything with all those stairs in the way?...\n\nFinal notes:\nThe game kills immersion with intention, has bland enemies, poor map design, and Gabriel Iglesias weighing you down.

Strange creatures trying to kill you, the dark sci-fi atmosphere it's all there. But it's also a bit different, more shooter orientated. Also you have  a \"companion\" that talks to you that provides a bit of funny banter. I myself enjoyed that quiet a bit, but i can see some people disliking it because it might break the horror ambience. The gunplay is satisfying and the \"Force pull\" mechanic allows for some interesting interactions with items.\n\nThe story mode seemed solid enough but i think where the game truly shines is the swarm mode. A kind of wave based survival mode, where you fight of endless hordes of monsters. Here you really need to plan ahead, since you don't find any ammo dropped by enemies. You earn a currency and can buy weapons with ONE mag. \n\"Now isn't that a bit akward?\" you might ask. I don't think so. You earn enought currency every round to buy several weapons. So use your time between rounds to buy as much weapons as possible. Set yourself up with your arsenal in a corner and make your last stand or spread them around the room and use a more \"Run and Gun\" gamplay style as you run around and force pull new weapons towards you. Oh yeah also empty weapons can be thrown as a kind of grenade. Awesome.\n\nSo all in all a pretty decent game and for that price i would say that's more than fair. What i would like to see in the future is multiplayer for Swarm mode. I could imagin it to be quiet entertaining.\n", "timestamp_created": 1517937236, "timestamp_updated": 1517937236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39888545": {"recommendationid": "39888545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344144570", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518368353}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5267\u60c5\u611f\u89c9\u975e\u5e38\u4e30\u6ee1\uff0c\u4e92\u52a8\u6027\u5f88\u5f3a\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8282\u594f\u5f20\u5f1b\u6709\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0a\u624b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u53ef\u73a9\u5ea6\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u3002\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5723\u5251\u62ff\u5230\u5c31\u71c3\u4e86\uff0c\u5b50\u5f39\u65f6\u95f4\u629b\u58f3\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u68d2\u3002\u4eae\u70b9\u662f\u62fe\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u6700\u7ecf\u5178\u7684RPG\u5f0f\u7ffb\u7bb1\u5b50\u67dc\u5b50\uff0c\u4e92\u52a8\u5f88\u5f3a\uff0c\u5f88\u6709loot\u611f\u3002\n       \u901a\u75c5\u8fd8\u662f\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u6709\u70b9\u5f31\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u65f6\u51e0\u4e4e\u542c\u4e0d\u5230\u5f00\u67aa\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u3002\u4f46\u7455\u4e0d\u63a9\u745c\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u5236\u4f5c\u4eba\u6b63\u5728\u5230\u5904\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u9988\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4e3a\u6001\u5ea6\u70b9\u8d5e\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1517927723, "timestamp_updated": 1518415211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39885791": {"recommendationid": "39885791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043581063", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518224453}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, this is by far the most fun of the EA games I've bought thus far.  Purchased this on 2/5/18, so my initial experience is based upon the content available at that time, for what that is worth.  I'm still in the campaign mode and loving it so far.  Playing on arcade difficulty and have managed to die twice thus far.  Most monster encounters are pretty easy...just a handful and easily dispatched.  A few though, mobs of them from more than one side, and panic sets in and I died  :)  In my state of panic I keep accidentally clenching my fist on the controller and hitting the grip button, which causes you to drop your weapon, lol....Oooops...that's not good   ;-)  \n\nPros: \n- Priced right for the content as of 2/5/18\n- Graphics are really nicely done, just beautiful artwork.  Doesn't appear to be cobbled together from common graphics that seem to pervade many EA games I've tried so far.  \n- Sounds and voice acting are great.\n- It's just damn fun!!\n- Scary at times!  You'll need that flashlight when it's suggested you take it, and watch your 6!  :-)\n- Nice variety of guns\n- Teleportation and trackpad movement.  I prefer trackpad, but there are a couple of instances where you'll need to be teleporting around pretty regularly to avoid monsters that keep spawning swarming you if you stay still.\n- Force pull items to you!  Love this.  It's futuristic so why not have some cool powers!  With current wired Vive rig, I dislike bending to try to pick stuff up off the ground, just force pull it to you  :)\n\nCons:\nMan, really none!  I guess, maybe just one...it's not complete yet  :-)  I'm at 2.4 hours at the time of this review and I'm sure I'll finish the single player content soon.  I'll be eagerly awaiting new content for sure! \n\nIn closing, GET THIS GAME!

In this review, I will be covering everything that A-Tech Cybernetic VR has to offer and why it\u2019s worth a purchase.\n\nHeard of Doom?, of course you have, who hasn\u2019t right?, well A-Tech Cybernetic VR has a LOT going for it to satisfy those who are seeking an amazing First Person Survival experience within a Scfi-Fi zombie/demon genre. The story goes that you awake within a facility with no memories but superpowers, you follow the story of yourself as the main protagonist as he tries to find himself again, whilst surviving a bio-medical outbreak epidemic and also trying to remember where he is. \n\nPro\u2019s and Con\u2019s \n\nPro\u2019s \nDOOM mixed with Killing Floor\nGameplay similar to DOOM and killing floor\nImmersive environment, Gritty atmosphere\nGreat level design\nGreat Sounding weapons and ambience\nWeapon and item pickup system is unique, comfortable and ties into story\nGreat background story with narration\nHas a bit more to it then shooting and moving through areas, (Keycards, manual healing through Healing stations and story progression. \nVarious enemies with their own damage and weapons. \nSeparate SWARM mode, Wave Shooting mode with weapons to purchase (Think Call of Duty Zombies mixed with Killing Floor)\n\nCon\u2019s\nWeapons feel great, however, they lack haptic feedback which creates a big part of immersion with gunplay for me personally. \nSometimes enemies can be overwhelming, (End of Chapter 2)\n\nPro-Con-Conclusion\nA-Tech Cybernetic is a great purchase for an FPS or, any VR owner that would love the thrill of a Unique Sci fi set story, a bit of cheeky humour, Great Gunplay, movement and Overall annihilation of biomedical demonic disasters. RIP THROUGH THEM! SAVE YOURSELF!..\n\nOFFICIAL REVIEW BELOW\nPsst. the rest of the review is down here for you enthusiasts. [Spoilers]\nOne of the coolest parts of the story mode in A-Tech Cybernetic VR is the Narrator that follows you on your journey, he makes remarks about your character, and he seems agitated as much as he is crazy. I personally think his involvement with the story ties in amazingly well and he fits the game and gives that sort of twist that you wouldn\u2019t expect in a game like this. It makes this game stand out amongst others. \n\nFrom the first chapter you\u2019re introduced to a great eerie and dark atmosphere which instantly sets the experience before you, It felt strangely calming to me personally. \n\n(Difficulty) Ending - Chapter 2\nPersonally I found the end of chapter two to be quite difficult, I had to replay it a couple of good times to finally finish it. The game can get quite difficult at times, but nothing matches to the ending. As a Gamer that's already quite familiar with FPS games and VR, I even found it difficult, so I\u2019m hoping that the ending\u2019s difficulty does not affect anyones overall experience with this awesome modern tribute to the DOOM and Killing floor franchises.  none the less as long as you persist you will be able to complete it, and when it comes down to it, that\u2019s exactly how the original DOOM game was. You had to persist with muscle memory and visualise where the largest threats of enemies were, to put it in perspective with A-Tech Cybernetic VR, the Riflemen enemies need to be taken out first, otherwise your going to have a hard time.  The satisfaction of headshotting enemies at your own pace or just mowing them down with an infestation of bullet hell feels great. I\u2019m very impressed with A-Tech Cybernetic, Mechanically, Visually and cannot wait to see what else lies underneath this games dark and mysterious background. \nMovement and Mechanics \nThe gunplay in A-Tech Cybernetic is Awesome, the only thing it lacks is haptic feedback for weapons when shot, which would definitely add the cherry on top and make it one of the best experiences on VR to date.\nThe Movement in A-Tech Cybernetic is like other games that feature locomotion controls and teleportation. I use the teleportation when I get stuck in sticky situations with undead hoarding me from every angle, so in that respect it can save you big time. Some people get motion sickness from locomotion but I handle it perfectly, and the reality is that as of now, there isn\u2019t a better way to go other than locomotion for an action game, especially FPS. \n\n\nGameplay\nOther than the movement and gameplay mechanics I wanted to talk a bit about what makes this game unique when picking up items. The \u201cSuperpower\u201d system the game uses is a really great touch , as you can aim your controller at an object, highlight that object and it force pulls it straight to you like a Jedi. I don\u2019t recall The superpowers being tied into the story a hell of a lot, but enough for it to make sense. Since A-Tech Cybernetic VR is Early Access, the more it develops im sure there will be more superpowers and explanation of story to back it up. \n\n\nThe enemies in A-Tech Cybernetic VR are great, they are well animated with the 3D Model and textures to back them up, they look as good as anything from the killing floor series, which is one of the series that came to mind once I first played this game.\n\nAs I said before, A-Tech Cybernetic VR is an Awesome First Person shooter and I definetely reccomend it for any FPS or Zombie Fan and anyone that seeks , Blood , Bullet hell carnage or any of the above points that I mentioned.", "timestamp_created": 1517616433, "timestamp_updated": 1517617351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39791832": {"recommendationid": "39791832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125330348", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517844994}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably one of the best VR games I have played, it is well optimized and REALLY Intense.

Great Hand models, and the enemies that I've fought thus far are look and move great!  I'm really impressed with a lot of the visual effects as well. things like mist/smoke and the distortion in the air from heat are super realistic and immersive!   The weapons look great and they feel really awesome when you are holding them.  like they are just there!  I love it!  lot's of great gore all over the place too which really adds to the atmosphere of the game.  \n\nSound: I really love the sound in the game as well!  the ambient hum in the hallways, and growls of what ever the heck those dudes are I am killing,. they are like cyberzombies I think.  The guns sound great as well.  The voice acting is a tad over the top.  It seems that the player is a conciousness stuck in this other guys body.  I'm not really sure why yet because I haven't gotten into the story that much but it definitely makes me want to continue to find out.  \n\nGame play:  This game does exactly what it's supposed to!  I chose free locomotion and it works great, except it seems to be a move where you look title.  I would prefer the option to decouple the HMD and point with my controller.  I'm not a gun expert or anything but the seemed to be right on when I aimed ad shot.  It was pretty bad ass to be able to see horde s of enemies coming at you and being able to pick out the faster guys and shoot them first.  haha.  The only complaint I would have is that there is no feedback when you fire the guns.  I would prefer to feel them kicking in my hands and also feel the enemies when they attack me.  Not a dev so don't know what it would take but haptics would take this game up another notch.   Like I said before it has a definite survival horror feel to it, not so much with puzzles,. from what I have played it's mostly, find the key to open the door, grab some ammo and shoot and some more puzzles would be cool but they aren't needed.  \n\nThis is a really solid game and the devs tell me more is coming so that is exciting.

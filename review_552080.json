Piloting the sub, where you need to balance speed with stealth, watching the skies for planes when surfaced and your battery and O2 levels when submerged. Targeting and taking out objectives using the periscope and authentic feeling \"computer\" for acurate torpedo shots. Loading the torpedos into the tubes, which feels like the actual process, draining the tubes, unlocking and opening the hatch, sliding the new torpedo into the tube, closing, locking, flooding the tubes. Taking damage from mines, enemy torpedos, depth charges, or planes, then having to grab the welder to repair the leaks... with your other hand on the O2 tank or bilge pumps in case the water comes in too quick \n\nSingle player is good, and I end up running around like a crazy person trying to do everything that needs to be done to succeed. Multiplayer is a total blast. Surface, send one person up to the top deck to man the anti-aircraft gun, one stays below to pilot and take shots with the torpedos. Total blast - and I get flashbacks to some of the best parts of Das Boot or U-571 - even find myself saying \"5 degrees down bubble\" when changing the plane of the sub.\n\nI do understand this is early access, but one costructive bit of feedback is it does need better tutorials. The ones in the game cover the basics, but it seems like they haven't kept up with the development of the game. There is a lot more to the game than the existing 3 tutorials cover. There should definitely be one for advanced targeting at the very least. That said, great game and looking forward to more hours of play time and future progress the developer makes. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511679601, "timestamp_updated": 1511679601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37590311": {"recommendationid": "37590311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092602349", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511648118}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastick and fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1511648102, "timestamp_updated": 1511648102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37584979": {"recommendationid": "37584979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017349280", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1514292640}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh my god....I was putting off buying this game just because I wasn't sure about it and the price is quite steep for a VR game (as VR games tend to have short-lived playability). \n\nEnded up buying it in the sale for 20% off but can honestly say it is easily worth the full price!\n\nReally polished, really enjoyable.

Das Setting in einem U-Boot ist die ideale Umgebung, um die engen Grenzen eines Room-Scale zu nutzen, ohne dass immersionszerst\u00f6rende Bewegungshindernisse oder Teleport-Locomotion  notwendig sind. Im Gegensatz zum \"Triple-A-Titel\" (zumindest in Hinsicht auf Preis und Promotion) \"Bridge Crew\" f\u00fchlt es sich, bei vergleichbarem kooperativen Gameplay, deutlich \"tiefer drin\", an. Statt durch Tastendruck an einer Konsole in das Geschehen einzugreifen, m\u00fcssen eigenh\u00e4ndig Schalter umgelegt und Torpedos nachgeladen  werden. \n\nWir horchen mit dem Hydrophon nach Beute, reduzieren unseren Antrieb auf Schleichfahrt, um selbst nicht geh\u00f6rt zu werden und erfassen dann auf Sehrohrtiefe das Ziel. Die kleinen Details hierbei, wie beispielsweise ein Wassereinbruch, nachdem wir die Torpedosch\u00e4chte \u00f6ffnen, ohne sie zuvor leergepumpt zu haben, erh\u00f6hen die Immersion noch weiter und geben auch repetitiven T\u00e4tigkeiten eine gewisse Ernsthaftigkeit.\n\nAus graphischer Sicht ist IronWolf VR absolut angemessen und insbesondere die Wasseranimation ist unter Ber\u00fccksichtung der Hardwarelimits beeindruckend. Das Spiel vermittel eine erstklassige, klaustrophobische Eleganz.  Wenn wir dann noch einen Zerst\u00f6rer \u00fcber unserem getauchen Boot vorbeikreuzen h\u00f6ren, das Schraubenger\u00e4uscht erst an- und dann abschwillt, wir das Boot so tief wie m\u00f6glich

You just die, over and over. The game is a good concept. It has a ton of work to do before charging more than $5 for it. You cant charge full price on a game thats a quarter of the way done -- or anything when its in such early beta. I dont even understand why devs release crap like this. You misunderstand the concept of MVP. You dont release fully featured functionality that cant actually be used because no one knows how to use it. You release small bits with training attached to those bits, then slowly release more and more. MVP is about releasing a small amount of functionality, getting feedback on it, iterating on that, then releasing more. etc. The UI is really bad too. Just feels like a Desktop port (add some sounds or more intuitive interactions that actually feel like it was built for VR).

Felt compelled to tell anyone who's thinking of buying what a great game this is, especially with a friend. Designed around minimum roomscale requirements and not requiring point and click teleporting makes a huge difference to the immersion. There's no faff, once the headset is on you never need to recentre yourself within the play area or look for chaperone because the walls of the room do it for you. It's quite liberating and one is left to concentrate on how uncomfy the headset is getting because you've been playing it with a friend for two hours solidly.\n\nAnd it really is great in two player co-op. It's initially disconcerting to have a friend up that close in a confined environment and I briefly worried I stank of booze, having had a glass or two before playing, but it soon becomes second nature and besides you're too busy working as a team. And that's when it becomes the most immersive game I've tried in VR, and I've tried a few. \n\nOne man on periscope duties and the other steering, or maybe one is on deck shooting the planes and the other is firing off torpedoes. Maybe you're both just staring at the radar and having a chat about what to do next. It's very easy to forget you're not there. \n\nThe big question is will this have legs? The levels lack variety at the moment and the end of the day there's only so much you can do with torpedeos and a gun up top. I know they're adding another room so we'll see how that pans out but I would recommend this without hesitation if you have someone to play it with.

We were surprised with the competent and relatively complete game we were presented with, considering the travesty of most early access titles, not to mention VR titles. The current sub is small, two rooms, but their aweesome room traversal method means the number rooms could be basically unlimited. As you leave one room, it flips you so you're facing the door, with your whole play area behind you, meaning you can now walk through that room. The graphics are nice, the skybox is actually really great imo and it's really easy to pick up. \n\n\nAs we played, we reminisced about Silent Hunter and hoped the devs would take this all the way. After reading their early access plan, we are not disappointed! Basically everything we noticed was missing is planned for the game, and from my point of view, isn't too far fetched. It doesn't feel like the dev is reaching, trying to make unrealistic goals to sell the game early. If you like Silent Hunter and have a vive and a friend or two, grab this to support the development. But be aware, it's not quite historically accurate yet, you're not in a full uboat and the devs are going for intuitive gameplay over pure simulation like SH5. I don't mind this.

I've got about 3 hours on it at the time of this review and have enjoyed the single player missions for the most part.\n\nThat being said, I would recommend this title.  It's a first of it's kind that I'm aware of at least.  The dev's seem active and if they forge ahead with the plans for this game, I think it would be even more fun and could have really good promise for MP fun.\n\nThings I'd like to see?  More options for MP.  For example, option to allow other submarines w/ or w/o a crew to help on missions.  As of now, your MP experience is just adding people to your submarine, would be nice to have options to have other subs, and more complex missions with coordinated attacks, etc.\n\nGame has lots of promise.  I hope the dev's stick with it.  Seems like more than a few of my EA purchases haven't been that actively advanced and left in their pretty much EA version.

I never felt overwhelmed by controlling the submarine playing by myself. Though having another player with you would probably make a world of difference.\n\nThe feeling of being inside the sub and then heading to periscope depth to look around on the surface is wonderful.\nWhen I was surfaced for a time I took a few hits from a plane, the sub very quickly begun to take on water. I panicked a little bit as the water went up and over my waist! \n\nUnfortunately at the time of playing there were no other players on any other server. I'll wait for the weekend to see if there are others online. Hopefully oculus support will be added in the future, that would bump up the player numbers.\n\nI think the game would benefit from having a few more submarine classesthough , and perhaps even being able to man a destroyer and hunt submarines.

It feels like you are operating the equipment of a real submarine. All the controls are available to all the players, you are not fixed in a specific role. Its up to the players (max 4) to divide up the work between yourselves. In a game I played yesterday, one manned the rudder, hydroplane (makes the boat go up or down), and ballast tanks. One was on the hydrophone (passive sonar) and one person manned the periscope.\n\nWe were fighting a destroyer, and during the fight we switched roles freely simply by walking up to a different set of controls. It is also possible to collaborate. For example, the person on the periscope aimed the torpedoes and then I fired them by flipping the torpedo fire switches. Its not pusing a button four times on a keyboard, you are actually flipping the switches on the torpedo fire computer.\n\nI played several games and really had a blast.

I couldn't click buy quick enough on this one. But from that point on it has been a slow spiral down of mixed emotions. \n\nLet me start, this game has a lot of atmosphere, giving you a sense of being in a confined space. Sure its not a realistic conning tower, control room or torpedo room. How can it be with VR being first GEN. Putting aside VR short comings, I just can't recommend this as is. I feel like I'm in the yellow submarine rather than ww2 killing machine. No Nav room with out a map to plot your destination. No hunt, this miss the biggest thing I'm feeling is missing. Time scaling until merchant ships spotted or receiving a wire on where a convoy has been spotted. This is what made Silent Service, and it's missing!

This game has so much potential. I am not a big submarine person and if this was a game without VR I wouldn't have played it. But VR changes the whole experience. I also know nothing about submarines and this game was easy to learn. (I had help with the developer's videos.) The experience of slowly drowning is also terrifying and horrible in a good way. It makes your heart pump faster as you helplessly try to find ways to stop the sinking of the submarine. This game is really fun and well worth $20.\n\nUpdate: I recently have played on the multiplayer and after playing multiplayer I don't want to go back to single player. Multiplayer makes the game so much more fun and easier as you have a team to work with and people to talk to. [strike]With multiplayer I have found one bug/glitch where I will join a game and then there will be no one in it and I wont be able to go back to the menu. [/strike]Multiplayer is a little difficult to get into as there are not many people playing but it is well worth the wait.\n \nUpdate 2: The recent torpedo update is amazing! It makes the game so much more fun when you are playing multiplayer and it gives players more things to do. It doesn't really affect the single player much because of the assist besides being able to speed up the process if you have the time.

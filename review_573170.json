(To clarify, this is a very high compliment, as Spelunky is probably my favourite video game of all time.)\n\nTruthfully though, both games really do share some familiar elements and design decisions. In this game, you play a cute little dog having to rescue Grandma from a dungeon filled with all sorts of baddies. You navigate through multiple, tile-based floors, killing enemies as you go, and leaving your leash trailing behind you, blocking you from ever stepping on the same tile twice. Where the similarities to Spelunky begin are in familiar enemy motifs such as spiders, snakes or flesh-eating plants. Further similiarity arises in a time-based ghost, the randomized rogue-lite nature of the game and the strategic, yet fast-paced gameplay that Fidel's mechanics enable.\n\nLet me elaborate a little on that last one. There is no fixed \"solution\" to each level here, but rather multiple paths are available. On most floors, your main objective is simply to make it to the end of the level. But if you want grow stronger, you'll need to squash a lot of enemies, build combos and pick up coins to purchase items (health potions and bombs) to help you out in tough situations. Your enemies will always take health from you (although exceptions apply), and so you need to plan out your path through the level so that you can alternate between enemies and health packs. You can always undo your actions and retread your path, to figure out your optimal route. If you're chased by the ghost after dying and rewinding your fatal mistake, maybe that optimal route is to get to the stairs leading you to the next level as soon as possible.\n\nFidel Dungeon Rescue also is one of those games that doesn't bother with unnecessary over-tutorialization. The undo mechanic encourages experimentation, allows learning by doing and enables surprises in hidden mechanics. Again, something that it shares with Spelunky. I don't want to give off the wrong impression that due the familiar mechanics or motifs the game is derivative. No, it feels wholly original and the absolutely gorgeous artwork and hugely catchy soundtrack do a lot to help the game feel fresh and unique. I really don't want to gloss over the artwork. This is some of the nicest, most lively pixel art I've seen in quite a while - and good pixel art isn't exactly all that hard to find in indie games. But all the designs and colors and animations here - they're just really excellent and a step above the usual quality.\n\nTo sum it up, Fidel Dungeon Rescue is an elegantly, smartly designed little puzzle game. It encourages exploration, experimentation and strategy. It's difficult, but not unfair. It plays fast and is perfect for short breaks and longer sessions alike. It looks and sounds wonderful, and all that makes it one of the best games I've played this year.", "timestamp_created": 1510529032, "timestamp_updated": 1510529032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36436974": {"recommendationid": "36436974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021118332", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487665511}, "language": "english", "review": "I was allowed to play this while in development but have made it to the finale and I think this is a very fun game.

Everytime you \"attack\" a monster you lose some health, and everytime you move over a health pack you restore health. As you collect experience while you progress through the increasily difficult dungeon floors, you level up, causing the amount of health you have to increase, providing an incentive to maximum the experience you gain on each floor. While this may sound like a simple concept, there are enough secondary mechanics, interesting monster behaviours, and challenging trade-offs you must make to keep the gameplay varied and interesting. If you lose all your health or spent too long on a level, the ghost will appear to keep you on your toes. This provides a very fast-paced gameplay, while forcing you to pay careful attention to every move you make, even if there is an undo command.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. The ghost can be an annoyance to those who want to take their time, or experiment without worry of having to start all over again. Furthermore I was unable to get my controller working with the game (although I suspect things like this will be patched in the future..?).

You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.\n\nThe randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There's also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can't be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you're 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same. Despite these gripes, each individual puzzle is still a joy to solve. I don't know if I'll ever be able to 100% this game, but I find that just loading it up and playing a few floors is satisfying even when I don't get very far.

There are 16 levels and each one has a different type of monster and different concepts. In order to survive, Fidel has to find the most efficient path. He cannot go back across his own trail and must try to get to the end whilst gaining as much experience and coins as possible so that later levels are easier, but with limited health and a lot of monsters in the way this can be a real challenge. Some monsters have different tactics that you need to get around them, for example the man-eating plants which need to have their flowers killed first, forcing the main plant to close so it can be killed or the three-headed turtles which can be attacked without taking damage from the tail. There is a reasonable range of opponents, with each level being quite different to the last. There are also buttons and switches, traps and walls to navigate.\n\nYou can take your time to try and find the most efficient strategical path to the exit and if you make a minor mistake you can go backwards and try again. If you die however, you have a very brief window before your ghost catches up with you to make it to the exit. Failure results in starting from the entire beginning, giving it that roguelike quality. As you progress through the level, you can unlock useable items (with coins you pick up) and level up, giving you more health - but nothing persists through death.\n\nIt's a quick game. You can play for a few minutes, die and put it down. Playing it in short bursts was the most fun for me - perfect considering I'm currently on maternity leave looking after a tiny angry human, so my choice in games lately is definitely more on the side of things that can be picked up and put down very quickly. I'd like to see this on the mobile market - I'd definitely pick this up on the iOS store.  The main downside I can see is that some people may not consider it amazing value and depending on how smart you are, this could be a fairly short game. At \u00a35.99 it's a little more expensive than I expected and some may prefer to wait for a sale. There are also no resolution settings; although you can change the size of the window.\n\nOther than that, this is a fun, fast, casual strategy game with decent retro music.\n\n[h1]My verdict - recommended to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a decent amount of brainpower. If I had to give it a score rating, it'd be a solid 4 / 5.[/h1]\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665 If you're a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

looking for a game that might give me a bit of the magic I felt playing Desktop Dungeons. I wasn't expecting a DD clone, just a turn based puzzle game with monsters to attack. \n\nUnfortunately FDR wasn't any fun for me. The biggest issue for me was that the levels have a timer, a ghost that forces you to start over if it catches you. There is a \"cheat\" (developers word) that lets you turn it off, but I don't cheat in my puzzle games. There is also suppose to be a level later in the game that allows you turn turn off the ghost timer.\n\nAlso, I dislike the \"good enough\" solution to the levels. DD was tough and it forces you to be creative in how you approach levels. FDR lets you wander around and finish a level without making much of an effort.

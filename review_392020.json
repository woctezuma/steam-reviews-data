It piqued my interest, being Super Hexagon-esque, but wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was a well crafted game with fast and smooth animations, snappy response, decent music, and (most importantly for this type of game) the ability to retry nearly instantly. I have a few nitpicks here and there, but ended up enjoying this game better than the other one I bought. Overall, a very enjoyable near-sighted bullet dodging simulator.\n\n[i]I will be making many comparisons to Super Hexagon, as that's the closest game to this style that does so much right.[/i]\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\n[b]Controls[/b]\nIt uses six buttons, escape, spacebar and arrowkeys/WASD, can't get much easier than that. Hitting one is satisfying, as your pentagon responds quickly and nearly instantly. What's also neat, is this game supports controller. Pretty standard, left stick to move, A and B to navigate menus. But this leads into one of my qualms. Only the left stick can be used for navigation, not the right. I would have preferred being able to use my dominant hand for movement. Another aspect about controller is that it's easy to accidentally move to a corner rather than straight to the side, leading to an untimely restart. That comes across as more of a limitation of a controller interface, and of course, can be avoided if you use keyboard. I have a gripe about the keyboard as well, though. If using the standard three fingers on the movement keys, you will need to have one of those jump between keys, most probably UP and DOWN. That action makes it easy to slip up in those directions. Normally I wouldn't remotely consider this an issue, but since this game relies on millisecond precision, something as benign as jumping between rows can slip you up. It comes across as a bit of an imbalance, rather than intentional difficulty jump, as LEFT and RIGHT won't suffer from that.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nGenre and selection is, in my opinion, perfect for this game. Fast-paced, electronic with some elements of chiptune, keep the blood pumping and usually go nicely with the difficulty. It looks like three different artists contributed music, Adhenoid, ForeverBound, and RollingFacade. The game starts out strong with a fantastic track. [i]Reignite[/i] by ForeverBound instantly became my favorite track in the game, followed by Adhenoid's [i]Machinarium[/i] and [i]Stepping into Madness[/i]. RollingFacade contributed two tracks, but I didn't like either one. [i]Laser Dragon[/i] works in the game, but I didn't find it to be anything exceptional. That's fine, I don't expect to like every track in a game. [i]Handicapped[/i] is the oddball out. It's tempo is noticeably slower than all the others, and that might make sense if it were for the easiest difficulty, but it comes with the next step up. Slower tempo, mixed with continually faster speed, doesn't make for a good accompaniment.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nRFLEX plays very similarly to Super Hexagon, as it's the same same vein of game. Start, dodge, restart. Good choice of clean and clear styling with no antialiasing or upscaling issues. The objects are either drawn vectors or very high resolution images. It has stylized scan lines and screen curvature, which you can even change the intensity of, like a CRT monitor. Nice bit of character to differentiate it from other similar styles. Everything is golden in the graphics department. \n\nAs for difficulty and progression, my experience has been good. The way each level seems to progress is that it starts slow and incrementally gets faster and faster until (I presume) it's humanly impossible to keep up, as opposed to Super Hexagon which seems to go a static speed for each minute. This means that it will get incredibly difficult to go for distance. My (current) personal best on the easiest difficulty for RFLEX is 88 seconds compared to around 5 minutes on Super Hexagon. At this time, the record for the easiest on RFLEX is about 170 seconds, so don't expect to be able to sit for a long (3+ minutes) single round. Transitions between levels goes pretty well, however something seems a little off with the last two. I find the second hardest difficulty to be the hardest. I've been able to get consistently further on the hardest than the preceeding difficulty. I don't know if this is frequent for others, but it's certainly not what seems to be intended.\n\nThis being said, difficulty between levels increases mostly fine. With each level, the blocks for each sequence are thrown from a variety of more directions and employ some other tricks to try to get you to slip up. There are some sneaky visual tricks up its sleeve, but lose potency with exposure, as any trick does. Also similar to Super Hexagon, is how the game handles each sequence of blocks. It picks from a random set of predetermined layouts and throws it at you from an arbitrary direction. This means that over time it's possible to memorize the sequence, basically guaranteeing that if you make it past the leading block, you'll make it past the remaining.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nRFLEX presents a highly enjoyable experience in the same vein as Super Hexagon. It's a fast paced, retro styled, dodging game that's easily picked up, difficult to master, and lets you retry milliseconds after you inevitably fail. It has a few flaws, but gets the core gameplay completely right, making this game a great experience.", "timestamp_created": 1483465575, "timestamp_updated": 1483466308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28796545": {"recommendationid": "28796545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146390613", "num_games_owned": 1049, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509565607}, "language": "english", "review": "Great warm up for competitive games!", "timestamp_created": 1483030305, "timestamp_updated": 1483030305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28561793": {"recommendationid": "28561793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040564498", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498837533}, "language": "english", "review": "tbh that actually pretty fun to play\nbut where can i find the music tho :(", "timestamp_created": 1482500585, "timestamp_updated": 1482500585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28463913": {"recommendationid": "28463913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148214188", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495444024}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy reflex heavy games such as Super Hexagon, the game is cheap enough that you should definitly try it.

Without them, you won\u2019t last 10 seconds.\n\nThe game consists of a few basic elements, they are \u2018dodge things,\u2019 \u2018don\u2019t let things hit you\u2019 and \u2018move damn it, that thing is going to utterly destroy you.\u2019 You use the arrow keys or a gamepad to move your pentagon out of the way of your lifeless enemies before they reach the end of their path, ending the round if they hit you.\n\nWhen I started playing the game my first natural assumption was that the projectiles flew at my shape in a random order, but a few minutes in I realised that that was clearly not the case. There are patterns that you can predict in order to stand a chance at dodging your impending doom. It\u2019s handy to know and has saved me several hundred times.\n\nAs you may predict based on what I have stated previously, the game is astonishingly challenging. After watching the trailer and maybe a few videos of gameplay, you may think \u2018this looks pretty easy,\u2019 but let me tell you, the game is a lot harder than it looks. There are five levels in RFLEX, they are Amusement, Challenge, Addiction, Lifestyle and Death Wish (the name scares me,) each with their own quirks and patterns and all very, very difficult.\n\nIf you would like to let everyone know you are amazing or are happy with telling the world you are terrible at the game, there are both global and friend leaderboards. Brag away!\n\nThe graphics are simple, just black on certain colours depending on what mode you have picked. Simple doesn\u2019t mean bad though. Having the same colours every match makes it easy on the eyes as they aren\u2019t constantly changing like in Super Hexagon (where you need the special glasses to prevent brain destroying migraines.)\n\nYou play the game to an awesome electronic soundtrack featuring ForeverBound, Valiant and RollingFacade. Oh and I couldn\u2019t resist to mention that there is a drunk mode.

However, I felt while playing this game that it had on edge on Super Hexagon due to more random obstacles than the same 7 memorizable patterns. Lets head to the pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nAmazing sound design, with a unique song for each level, made by brilliant electronic composers.\n\nSimple yet deceivingly difficult gameplay that successfully fulfills the neo-arcade design, complete with customizable screen curving!\n\nMinimalist graphics that focus back on to the gameplay rather than distracting you.\n\nExtra modes that affect the regular levels for more fun!\n\nCons:\nControls were a teensy bit weird to understand at the start. Instead of permanent twitch moves you use the arrow keys to hold the hexagon in place and then release to bring it back to the center. Ultimately not a problem but it takes time to get used to.

I knew it will be much harder that it seems to be. Anyway, it took me over 600 attemps until I finished third level. I don't know why, but I simply couldn't beat it. The feel when you finally beat the level is awesome, though. Also, your heart wants to break out of your chest, don't let it! ;)\nIf you like simple but hard games like this one, don't hesitate and buy it. Totally worths it.\nWhen you're tired and annoyed, because you can't get over 60 seconds, take a break for a few minutes. I had troubles from the beginning too, but as of now, I'm in the first places in the leaderboards and still keep playing next levels.\n\n+ simple graphics, catchy colors\n+ easy to play, hard to master\n+ 5+5 levels (it's enough, trust me)\n\n+/- decent music (does not impress, but it's not bad either; I mostly play with custom music)\n+/- I couldn't get used to the controls (maybe it was my bad habit from other rage games)\n\n- nothing\n\nAnd look for patterns. They're there, you just won't see them right away. They will help you pretty much.\n\n8/10\n\n\nUPDATE: I beat the game today (13. 12. 2016), incredible feeling of satisfaction.

Also the adrenaline that this game gives is unbeliavable, dodging incoming obstacles has never been so fun and never gives the anxiety that this game gives.\n\nControls are simple, you can move with WASD and all you have to do is dodging rectangles, trying to stay in the game as long as possible, that is not easy and simple as it sounds. \n\nRFLEX also is immediate and very quick to move from a scene to another.

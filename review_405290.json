It's just not a very cohesively designed one.\n\nIt's a beat-em-up, which is a genre that's very easy to do well if you just stick to the formula, but Charlie Murder tries to break that formula as often as it can and the resulting gamefeel is really inconsistent.\n\nFor example, there are empty sections in most levels. There is at least one very long, very empty backtrack. There is precision platforming (oh my god why). There are shops that you have to diverge from the main route to get to, meaning your party had better be exceptionally good at following the leader and the leader had better be exceptionally good at asking whether anyone needs shopping. There is a cellphone picture minigame in which you steer a massively zoomed in little window around like a tugboat and try to take a picture of an object within a one foot range of you to see if it might spawn an item into your inventory. There are long, atmospheric, but ultimately boring cutscenes.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a punk guitar-hero recurring minigame that feels perfectly dope (and actually pretty challenging) to play. There is a really consistent aesthetic throughout with some nice little flourishes in certain sections. The beat-em-up parts feel reasonable, and picking new perks every couple of levels makes for some interesting build diversification. You get specials often and they feel mostly good to use.\n\nAt its best, Charlie Murder feels like Castle Crashers. At its worst, it feels like an incoherent mess. In between, there's the plot and the atmosphere and the pacing, which all feel like they'd be better at home in something like Salt & Sanctuary (where the moodiness and slow unfurling of the story work perfectly).\n\nIf you've got a really cooperative group of friends who all like beat-em-ups, this is a reasonable buy on sale. \n\nIt's not Castle Crashers. It won't make you remember everything you love about the genre. But its high points and its low ones average out to a sort of middling experience.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're planning to play solo, you don't objectively love beat-em-ups, and you don't have a cooperative group of friends, give this one a miss.", "timestamp_created": 1509802124, "timestamp_updated": 1509802460, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36227342": {"recommendationid": "36227342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099861555", "num_games_owned": 676, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510074056}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best beat em ups ever.

The graphical style is unique, and the dark and moody levels are quite inspired. You play as a member of the band, Charlie Murder. I played the bassist (called the Shaman in game) and my co-op partner played the vocalist (called the Berzerker in game). You gain powers by getting tattoos in a tattoo parlor, and your collectibles are QR codes that you find and can take pictures of with your in-game phone. As you progress in the game, you gain \"followers\" and can upgrade your stats and acquire abilities. \n\nDuring most of the game you're throwing combos at different types of macabre enemies, using weapons and powers whenever possible. My favorite weapon was one of the giant axes or hammers, which delay on the swing and then offer a powerful and satisfying crunch. As the shaman, my favorite powers were an \"earthquake\" which created a zone of lava that did burning damage, and a cloud that I could summon that would hit enemies with lightning and acid rain. The game can get somewhat challenging towards the end, and kept us engaged.\n\nHowever, the connection issues in this game are absolutely awful. The one thing I can praise is that it was easy to get my partner in the game, and he was never booted for any reason. Whenever a character goes down, the other character can perform a CPR/revival maneuver to pick them back up. Nailing the button presses, this only worked for me perhaps once out of the ten times or so I needed to revive my partner. I'm not sure if this was due to me using an XBOX 360 controller, but it was absolutely a pain. Additionally, if I quit to the world map when this didn't work, my partner would remain dead and not show up on the screen. However, sometimes if I continued to advance through a level afterwards he would appear beside me. On a few occasions, my co-op partner was looking at an entirely different screen than what was visible to me, the host. Once, I had to tell him to move forward when his character was beside me, though he was staring at a loading screen on his end. The icing on this buggy cake was the final boss fight. I'm not sure if my co-op partner was supposed to be able to move during the final cutscene, but he moved forward and punched the boss during the exposition. When the boss battle began, the boss was trapped off of the screen on the right side. We just kept using attacks until we heard noises indicating success and saw the credits roll.\n\nSo, hopefully this game is much more stable in single-player. However, I bought it due to the online co-op feature, so it was a bit disappointing for me. It's a shame, because outside of the connection issues, I think the developer created something pretty special.", "timestamp_created": 1503946123, "timestamp_updated": 1503946219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34558355": {"recommendationid": "34558355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358236980", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511903326}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy excelente juego si alguien quiere jugar en linea que envi\u00e9 la solicitud xdxdxd", "timestamp_created": 1503942197, "timestamp_updated": 1503942197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34404517": {"recommendationid": "34404517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115169622", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510470275}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable beat em up online and offline co-op and slick controls \n", "timestamp_created": 1503357132, "timestamp_updated": 1503357132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34279299": {"recommendationid": "34279299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123377941", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504656066}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game on Xbox 360 so I was so excited to get it on PC.

You play as one of the members of the titular band, and then kill things.

It's an adrenaline rush all the way through with no stops. Trust me when I say you go off the rails on this crazy train.\n\nAnyway, the game kicks off with Charlie and company screaming into microphones as they plummet into Hell. Then they beat the shit out of some demons. This is all you get as a tutorial. It's all you need.\n\nAfter the game decides you've figured out how to break various parts of people's bodies, you get lifted back to Earth as some paramedics kickstart your heart. After this, it's just blood, guts, punk rock, and beating the everliving shit out of anything that isn't a merchant or someone you're playing the game with.\n\nStop reading here if you don't want to see the story.\n\nThis whole ordeal started with Charlie and his friends sitting around when he starts writing a song out of nowhere. Then some other stuff happens when he and his friend Phil go their separate ways. Phil gets angry and thinks Charlie betrayed him, while the latter doesn't have any fucks to give.\n\nPhil tries to be some kind of guitar hipster and goes indie for a while, but then he gets pissy again and goes to a church, where he grabs a scythe and becomes- no, seriously; Lord Mortimer. He then forms a metal band with some lady that looks like Raven from Teen Titans, a generic Norwegian, and a fat Satan. Then they go murder Charlie Murder, and the game begins.\n\nYes, I realize how redundant that sentence is.

And since friendly fire is on by default, griefing is incredibly easy.\n\nI am thankful we got this and Dishwasher on PC, as it is nice to see how the developers advanced along both games to Salt & Sanctuary.", "timestamp_created": 1495919418, "timestamp_updated": 1495919418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31996318": {"recommendationid": "31996318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158508520", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495890083}, "language": "koreana", "review": "Ska Studios \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ub2e4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub124\uc694.", "timestamp_created": 1495890148, "timestamp_updated": 1495890148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31989379": {"recommendationid": "31989379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187507514", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504038885}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0443,\u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c,\u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e,\u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f,\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b \u043d\u0430 xbox \u0441 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0439,\u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c.\u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0434\u0430\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043a,\u0438 \u043e \u0434\u0430!\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c!\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430:10 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432", "timestamp_created": 1495864955, "timestamp_updated": 1495864955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31967673": {"recommendationid": "31967673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262372552", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503054352}, "language": "schinese", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1495784909, "timestamp_updated": 1495784909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31963538": {"recommendationid": "31963538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157004720", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495907110}, "language": "english", "review": "if ur wondering to get this game get it.

Still has some issues that need to be fixed though, most notably connectivity in multiplayer, also players losing progression through a multiplayer setting. ie play through a level, finish the level everyone is level 11 except for 1 guy who is now level 9 again and it would appear as if he never joined us during the level in the first place. And something that is prevelant on your pc games is locking the mouse to a screen when you have a 2 screen setup. I know I can just turn one off, but (forgive me for advertisement) as a streamer it is impossible to play these unless you use a controller. ( Which sucks but so far it is what I have had to resort to.) I am not being a troll. I usually buy mutliple copies of these games because they are fun and cheap so my brothers can play with me too.

It's especially fun when you have a 4 man group and everyone has to hit their notes.\nTons of different team up attacks, unique depending on which character initiated it.\nExplosives, pistols, shotguns, machine guns, axes, knives, pool cues, the list goes on and on.\nCross platform multiplayer.\nLocal multiplayer.\nHas NG+ NG++ and NG+++, maybe more, never got that far.\n\nOverall this is the perfect beat 'em up.

It's set over a post apocalyptic theme, with punk and death metal undertones. You've got level progression with different characters to choose from, special moves (anarchi), armor/clothing (and shops where you can buy that stuff!), lots of gore, a nifty soundtrack, fluid combat with combos and all sorts of weapons (pick up and throw an enemies decapitated head!), an in-game cellphone where you can take pics of certain items that unlocks stuff, and the game also has a few other things I'm sure I'm forgetting about...\n\nThis game was a day one purchase for me on the 360 and here on Steam as well. I like beat'em ups and usually games that have RPG elements (equipables, level progression, unlockables) so this game is right up my alley. My only con is the difficulty, it's a bit on the easy side for me, but that may be because I have already played it a lot on the 360. \n\nIf you like beat'em ups, especially of the Castle Crasheresque nature, then CM is a must buy, seriously, for the price, and what you get, you will at the very least \"like it\". If you're not into beat'em ups, than I cannot recommend, even though it's more than most standard beat'em ups, it's still just a beat'em up at it's core. I still like CM a lot, but I it's not a game where I have spent a lot of time on.

I came into this game not really being a big fan of street brawlers like charlie murder is, but came out with it being my favourite game on the xbox *that was free with gold membership*\n\nOverall, without being blinded by nostalgia and whatnot, this game is good, honestly it's nice that it's 10 dollars but, for the devs sake i really want this to be a higher price so they can make more games like this.\n\n7.5 to 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1495008054, "timestamp_updated": 1495008054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31800650": {"recommendationid": "31800650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188515021", "num_games_owned": 1303, "num_reviews": 290, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499332722}, "language": "english", "review": "punk af", "timestamp_created": 1495007434, "timestamp_updated": 1495007434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31799729": {"recommendationid": "31799729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180838397", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504277475}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1495001276, "timestamp_updated": 1495001276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31797147": {"recommendationid": "31797147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059364959", "num_games_owned": 510, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495592673}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a punk rock Streets of Rage-of course im going to recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1494983447, "timestamp_updated": 1494983447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503448", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31794148": {"recommendationid": "31794148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130037730", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494870442}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review so quality may not be great.\nI used to to play this game on xbox with friends back in the day.

If you don't like gore, then you probably wouldn't enjoy this game, same goes for if you don't like the punk rock aesthetic. I highly recommend this game, it also has local and online co-op, as well as harder game modes unlocked after completing the game (like true vault hunter mode in borderlands 2).

A banda dos humanos \"Charlie Murder\" e a dos d\u00eamonios \"Gore Quaffer\". \nA lore do jogo \u00e9 mais complexa, mas contar mais detalhes estragaria a experi\u00eancia.\n\nOs pr\u00f3s sobre o jogo:\n-S\u00e3o apresenta 5 personagens jog\u00e1veis, com 4 varia\u00e7\u00f5es de sua skin e suas skills.\n-O jogo tem 3 dificuldades Normal, Caos e Anarquia, desbloqueadas ap\u00f3s voc\u00ea zerar pela primeira vez.\n-Tem modo Local, mas tamb\u00e9m Multiplayer, tanto privado como tamb\u00e9m p\u00fablico com o m\u00e1ximo de 4 jogadores.\n-H\u00e1 diversos Bosses e Mini-Bosses, que s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios para os finais do jogo.\n-O jogo cont\u00e9m 2 finais, o final Ruim, apenas matando os bosses, e o final Bom, matando todos os Bosses e Mini-Bosses juntamente com seu Loot dropado.\n-Cont\u00e9m uma \"\u00c1rvore de Habilidades\" e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de pontos em Status, como For\u00e7a, Velocidade, Defesa e Magia.\n\nAgora os contras sobre o jogo:\nComo o jogo lan\u00e7ou dia 12/05(ontem no meu caso), ainda pode vir patches para corrigir alguns bugs.

The story is remarkably simple yet very captivating and you cant help but fall in love with and choose favorite characters! Honestly this is a steal at  $ 9.99. You have two buttons so quick attacks and heavy attacks and you can combine various combinations to uppercut enemies, smash them in the ground, you can also parry and shoot guns. On top of this you level up and unlock new abilities and find relics ( small trinkets think like binding of issac, that change you stats slightly and give you bonuses ) There is segments of the game where you do mini puzzles and little guitar hero parts that are different based on what character you play as.

I get most games have that and not all games are perfect but this has it well. I say this is best with friends on the couch. It would be smooth gameplay for everyone and you would be able to play with your friends. I love this game's multiplayer because of friends.

Charlie murder is a punk themed 4 player coop beat em up brawler. It is a very gory game with a dark story.\n1  The game is a excellent port from XBLA to steam. Not much is different from the xbox 360 version other than more options, like rebindable keys, resolution options and video settings. The game still has 4 player local multipalyer it feels as good if not better than the xbox port as I have beaten that on the highest difficulty before years ago. \n\n2  The gameplay is excellent, if you have never played a SKA game before it is hard to describe but it plays like a RPG style brawler like Scott pilgrim saves the world and castle crashers but it has guns, throwable items, melee weapons and explosives. You also have abilities with cooldowns, this game is great fun with friends and has challenge but if you go around collecting the best stat items, maxing your level in every way getting all the best items it is really easy but it has 3 difficulties of challenge. If you know how to build up a easy multipilyer it does not take very long to level up your characters and since there are a total of 20 characters 5 and 3 reskins of each ice, Goth and horror I think that is a good thing that it is not hard to level up to Max level. \n\n3 This game has loads of content you start the game off with 5 different characters and if you get the golden ticket later in the game you can unlock multiple reskins of the same characters with different abilities and some look like animals and vampires. But one downside of the character system is that if two people in coop wanted to play Charlie they can't, even if they unlock the reskins. But you at least have 5 choices and not 4. \n   \n4 The game has lots of replay value and has a interesting unique mechanic of using your cellphone in game to take pictures of things like barcodes to unlock secrets. The game has many many collectibles and if you are an achievement hunter... Well good luck because s few of them will be a pain to collect all the items like in the \"I am thorough\" achievement by collecting all the relics, that will be a challenge for you.   \n\n5 The game is not just a typical brawler, it has a few guitar hero sections, it has some interesting puzzles, it has a cellphone camera in game as a way to find secrets, a very interactive environment, it has a place where you can take props throughout the game and if you use a item you can break a table and with that item it will make the broken table drop a prop that you can place in your house you get later in the game to show your friends. The game has many collectibles rare items for example the glitch like a boss relic and the game is great fun to play with your friends.  \n \nTo Conclude, Charlie murder is an excellent game and is an above average PC port of an xbox live arcade game, it has 4 player local multiplayer a feature welcome on PC, the gameplay is great and the theme is unique, the game has loads of content and some interesting mechanics and lots of replay value, fair challenge and a great game to play with friends locally or online.    \n\nDo I recommend you get this game? Yes, this used to be an xbox exclusive game but now it is out on PC and now you have the chance to try it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1494646703, "timestamp_updated": 1494646703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652360", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31714530": {"recommendationid": "31714530", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968963105", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494997783}, "language": "english", "review": "A punk versus zombie death metal take on the likes of the coin-ops like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that is crazy and out of control.

So I thought I would write something up on the PC ports of both versions. Vampire Smile version linked at the end.\n\nGetting into the gameplay briefly; Charlie Murder is THE Beat'em Up you don't want to skip on. Many people call Beat'Em Ups an inherently repetitive game genre and they aren't wrong. But games that are by nature repetitive can still be fun and Charlie Murder goes above and beyond to shake up the genre a by pacing itself better than other games through stage and enemy variety as well as a crafting system and ways to get equipment that effect your stats and the option to learn new special movies.\n\nOnto the port!\nCharlie Murder and Vampire Smile are very identical in terms of the PC port so what I say here is comparable to Vampire Smile. Charlie Murder has a ton of resolution options, some of which go beyond 1080p. The game also supports borderless windowed, fullscreen and windowed mode in addition to having seperate volume sliders for sound effects and music. The game was original an Xbox 360 Arcade title when it was released back in the summer of 2013 so it's not really a graphical powerhouse. The dirty, muddy art style actually holds up really nicely as it doesn't bring down the fact that this was once an Xbox 360 title. As a result there aren't any graphics options but the game doesn't need it. This will run on almost anything.\n\nYou also have options to rebind your keyboard and mouse controls. However, some of the defaults aren't exactly ideal and what's worse is that the mechanic involving controling your phone with an analog stick over on 360 has translated to using digital inputs on your keyboard rather than your mouse here. There are also segments that require cursor aim (and you still can't use the mouse) so it's best to switch to a pad all together which is a shame because the keyboard and mouse (while not having a cursor) controls while brawling is actually a lot of fun. Once again you do have the option to rebind all of them and having the mouse and keyboard use the same actions is pretty cool but it is finicky when first booting it up as there aren't a lot of good indications for KB&M prompts.\n\nThere is also an issue if you want to record gameplay with Radeon Relive (AMD's Capture Software). The game refused to be recorded if you start in fullscreen mode and if you change back to fullscreen accidently the software will bug out and break. The multiplayer also doesn't have any kind of lobby/server system to find games.\n\nOverall it's a pretty good port but you're better off getting Vampire Smile if you don't have a gamepad. The game is very accessible and it's a lot more enjoyable to me than games like Castle Crashers or Scott Pilgrim but it does have its issues. However, 9.99 is a great deal if you have a gamepad and want to try out a fun, unique, sidescrolling brawler.

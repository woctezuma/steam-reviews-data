Una banda sonora aceptable que nos acompa\u00f1a en los momentos \u00e1lgidos de la aventura.\n\nRecomendado desde todo punto de vista.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511413336, "timestamp_updated": 1511413336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36810898": {"recommendationid": "36810898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067139467", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421182172}, "language": "english", "review": "Ahhh, this brings back the memories....\nWhat an awesome game this was....", "timestamp_created": 1511385498, "timestamp_updated": 1511385498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36759311": {"recommendationid": "36759311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056886901", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511379405}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0445\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435, \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0432\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c?", "timestamp_created": 1511379444, "timestamp_updated": 1511379444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36480731": {"recommendationid": "36480731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040484691", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510524660}, "language": "english", "review": "Abe's Exoddus is an amazing platformer from the 90s, and the sequel of equally great Abe's Oddysee.

It will test your skill and reflexes, and will also deliver scenarios where you'll need to be clever to continue, which makes progress very rewarding. You control a humanoid creature called Abe who has no fighting skills at all, you only means to attack will be whatever the environment provides you (most notably mind control, but also grenades or even explosive farts :D).\n\nThe objective of the game is to save your fellow mudokons (creatures similar to you), who you guide by talking to them and telling them what to do; while staying out of the many dangers presented to you and them. It is a difficult game by today's standards, but the learning curve is balanced enough to let you learn the mechanics before becoming really challenging (secret areas are challenging from the very begging tho, so beware). Also the presence of a quicksave feature will make the journey less tedious.\n\nThe game is not very long (long enough for its price tag tho), but its packed with secret areas that are more challenging than the main game and will extend the playthrough time. Sadly there's little replay value (except maybe for saving them all / killing them all), but i enjoy playing it over again from time to time.\n\nRuns perfect in my low end pc, I haven't had any issue so far.\n\nA timeless classic, a sequel that improves its predecessor, and a must-have if you even remotely like plataforming or stealth games.", "timestamp_created": 1507116868, "timestamp_updated": 1507116868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35438473": {"recommendationid": "35438473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094703846", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507015462}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favourite games of all time.

Requiring stealth, timing, problem solving, possession of enemies and of course gamespeak, which is a mechanic that allows Abe to communicate with his fellow slaves to attempt to rescue them. \"Hello\" \"Hello\" \"Follow Me\" \"Okay\".\n\nFanastic visual art design all around.

They have got rid of the meat saws!\n\n... now it's bone saws.\n\nAbe's Exoddus is the sequel to the Abe's Oddysee; keeping everything that made that game fantastic, fixing anything that wasn't... and adding a truckload more content. It retains the difficulty but feels a lot more approachable, particularly where the Quicksave gives you an on-the-fly checkpoint you can go back to before pulling off anything particularly fiddly (believe me, you'll need it). There's more to possess, new problems to be solved (slap-wars between your comrades being one of the funnier ones) and a whopping 300 Mudokons to save. So suffice to say: An utterly masterful execution that enshrined its place as a classic on the PlayStation. If you enjoyed the original, then there's little reason you wouldn't adore this one too.\n\n... That is... if you can handle some of the annoying quirks from the port (same problems as Oddysee, I'm afraid):\n\n[list]\n    [*]Overall game speed is faster (maybe 20%?). Have you tried disarming a bomb at high speed? Don't do it.\n\n    [*]Controller mapping is shaky - We've lost the L2/R2 buttons where it doesn't recognise the triggers on most controllers. It's also a sod to configure as well, unless you know which is button 1, 2, 3, 4... Not unworkable, but fiddly and takes some getting used to.\n\n    [*]The game stretches to full screen... which [i]really[/i] doesn't flatter it. I'd personally prefer the option to let it retain its native resolution and run with the black sidebars (akin to the screenshots on the store page).\n[/list]\n\nIf these 3 could get sorted, then I'd recommend this game without hesitation.

Despu\u00e9s el devenir de la saga ir\u00eda por otros derroteros, pero esta segunda parte de las aventuras de Abe lleg\u00f3 como un regalo ca\u00eddo del cielo para los usuarios de PlayStation y PC.\nA nivel gr\u00e1fico se repite el mismo esquema que con su predecesor, preciosos fondos prerenderizados con sprites magn\u00edficamente animados para representar a los personajes. Pero ahora con nuevas animaciones, nuevas criaturas, y escenarios a\u00fan m\u00e1s ricos en detalles y efectos. Las escenas CGI vuelven a ser simplemente magistrales, logrando sumergirnos m\u00e1s todav\u00eda en la aventura y en este universo de seres tan sumamente especiales.\nTambi\u00e9n repite la soberbia calidad de la banda sonora, con sus temas ambientales y oscuros que nos acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1n en todo momento, siguiendo a la perfecci\u00f3n el ritmo de la aventura. Lo mismo ocurre con el excelente doblaje al castellano, tan bien adaptado como lo estaba en su predecesor para poder disfrutar al 100% del juego sin necesidad de saber ni gota de ingl\u00e9s. Algo que tambi\u00e9n se vuelve a aplicar a los letreros y mensajes que nos encontramos por el juego, reflejando una gran pasi\u00f3n y cuidado por el detalle.\nEl control es exactamente el mismo que el de su predecesor (tampoco hac\u00eda falta cambiarlo), pero ahora disponemos de nuevas acciones, como la posibilidad de abofetear a otros mudokons si se ponen algo tontos, o incluso a ciertos enemigos si es que no nos vuelan en pedazos antes. Un mudokon agredido no se lo tomar\u00e1 nada bien, por mucho que lo hagamos con toda la buena intenci\u00f3n del mundo. De modo que tambi\u00e9n habr\u00e1 una opci\u00f3n para pedir disculpas.\nAdem\u00e1s ahora podemos hablar a los dem\u00e1s personajes en conjunto o por separado, algo muy \u00fatil cuando hay varios implicados en pantalla y queremos hacer las cosas por orden. Tambi\u00e9n habr\u00e1 que prestar atenci\u00f3n al estado de animo de los mudokons, ya que adem\u00e1s de enfadados, tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1n estar chiflados, enfermos, deprimidos, e incluso ciegos. Estos \u00faltimos depender\u00e1n enteramente de nuestras \u00f3rdenes para no sucumbir a alg\u00fan peligro por el camino, de modo que nos tocar\u00e1 ser sus ojos.\nEl estado de \u00e1nimo de los personajes ser\u00e1 muy importante durante la partida, especialmente si queremos salvar a la mayor cantidad posible de mudokons para completar la aventura como es debido. Por ejemplo los mudokons deprimidos pueden autolesionarse hasta llegar al suicidio, por lo que m\u00e1s nos vale tratarlos con cari\u00f1o si no queremos perderlos.\nPosesi\u00f3n infernal\nOtro novedad importante a nivel jugable, es que ahora podremos poseer una mayor variedad de criaturas, como por ejemplos lo scrabs, los paramitas, o incluso los mal\u00e9ficos glukkons. Cada criatura ofrece sus propias caracter\u00edsticas y controles, y saber manejarlos y aprovechar sus capacidades ser\u00e1 vital a lo largo del juego. Tambi\u00e9n encontraremos nuevas versiones de viejos enemigos, como los sligs voladores que podremos poseer para surcar los cielos.\nFinalmente el arsenal de Abe ahora hace uso de algo que en la primera entrega simplemente serv\u00eda para darle un toque de humor al juego. \u00a1Los pedos! En esta ocasi\u00f3n las flatulencias de nuestro flacucho amigo se podr\u00e1n emplear, no solo para molestar a otros mudokons y hacer que se aparten, si no tambi\u00e9n como una mort\u00edfera arma que podemos poseer y hacer explotar despu\u00e9s cu\u00e1l bomba de control remoto. Para ello bastar\u00e1 con un sorbito de la nueva bebida SoulStorm, que produce efectos as\u00ed de curiosos en los intestinos de Abe.\n\u00a1S\u00e1lvalos a todos!\nEn esta ocasi\u00f3n el juego se extend\u00eda a lo largo de dos discos, lo que viene a ser se\u00f1a clara de una mayor duraci\u00f3n que la de su predecesor, y m\u00e1s cuando ambas entregas se parecen tanto en su mec\u00e1nica. Completar la aventura no ser\u00e1 nada f\u00e1cil, pero menos a\u00fan lo ser\u00e1 si nos proponemos salvar a todos los mudokons. En tal caso deberemos agudizar y mucho nuestro ingenio, as\u00ed como poner a prueba toda nuestra pericia plataformera.\nDiversi\u00f3n, carisma, jugabilidad, y todo un universo de criaturas fant\u00e1sticas os esperan en 'Oddworld Abe's Exoddus'. Una verdadera obra maestra a la altura de su predecesor que os mantendr\u00e1 horas y horas pegados al mando. Sin embargo tambi\u00e9n hay que advertir de su elevada dificultad, ya que se trata de un reto en toda regla tanto para nuestra mente como para nuestras habilidades de control. Si esto \u00faltimo no es problema para vosotros, no esper\u00e9is ni un solo segundo m\u00e1s para haceros con \u00e9l.\n\nNota 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1493906365, "timestamp_updated": 1493906400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31449090": {"recommendationid": "31449090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060722490", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431150055}, "language": "german", "review": ",,Richtung Genialer Klassiker!\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\u2122 Kann ich also nur Empfehlen* & nichts f\u00fcr Schwerf\u00fcssige Anf\u00e4nger! 3+4 Teil k\u00f6nnt ihr eucht echt sparen\u00b0\ud83d\udc7a.., daf\u00fcr aber wieder den 5 u letzten Teil der Sager\u2757\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09\n..bin auf Feedbacks gespannt^ viel Spa\u00df!\"", "timestamp_created": 1493499566, "timestamp_updated": 1493499566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502688", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31381549": {"recommendationid": "31381549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200189013", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492299287}, "language": "english", "review": "Insanely fun game\n\nBrings back memories\nPLUS U R A FUCKING ALIEN THAT POSSESSES  ITS OWN EXPLODING FUCKING FARTS\n\nGREAT GAME GET IT\n", "timestamp_created": 1493235417, "timestamp_updated": 1493235417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471698", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31335448": {"recommendationid": "31335448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021995207", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512331849}, "language": "english", "review": "Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a amazing game with a dark and horrifing story.

Every single type of enemy has different types of abilities and limitations and it's up to you to figure them out. Some levels even prevent you from using your powers so you will have to use your brain to find a way around.\n\nThe game also throws a challenge at you. Fellow enslaved people of your race are scattered around levels and it's up to you to talk to and lead them to portals that bring them to their freedom. You can either succeed or get them killed in the process, or even ignore them altogether and continue in your journey. You can command them using the talk system, unless they're mad or depressed, where you'll have to console them first, or smack the crap out of those affected by laughing gas.\n\nI personally think that's a very unique mechanic. Sometimes you'll have to clear a whole level then come back to the very beginning and escort your pals. Blind ones are also present and telling them to stop in their path is mandatory for their survival.\nYou'll be rewarded for saving many of your kind but punished for refusing to or saving too few.\n\n\nThe atmosphere of this game, like the first, is amazing. The story elements, the setting, the soundtrack and the characters make it up for one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever experienced. The graphics and the cutscenes are pre-rendered 3D sequences and they look just great for a game that came two decades ago. \n\nI should probably also mention that this game, unlike other titles on Steam that originally came during the 90's, fully works on both modern and old systems.\n\n\nI don't really have negative feedback about this game. It's one of the things that made up my childhood and replaying it was a lot of joy. I guess that there were a few annoying levels that felt a bit repetitive(the ones that feature fleeches for instance), but other than that, everything is godlike.

That or you can wait and see how the remake turns out, in which case you should just start from the first one instead.\n\nThe game itself is a highly pre-rendered puzzle platformer which takes place in a strange world with weird creatures. You're basically trying to save as many modokons (green aliens) as possible, in various ways.

This was my absolute favourite game when I was a kid and I still love it to this day.\nIt may be partly because I only owned about 3 games at the time but I must've sunk more hours into this game than any other.\nThe atmosphere and world are great, a dark story with just the right amount of humour. Abe is the last hope to free his enslaved people, who are forced to work in dangerous conditions by greedy slave traders who care only about profit, but if you get bored of all that you can press a button to make Abe fart, which causes all Mudokons next to him to take step back, and those further away to giggle. \nGameplaywise Abe\u2019s Exoddus is a puzzle-platformer with the emphasis on the platforming over the puzzling. Most of the puzzles are easy to figure out, but actually completing them is another thing. It manages to fall into that elusive sweet spot of \u201cchallenging but fair\u201d. You will die a lot but the game rarely resorts to fake-difficult instant-death traps. I remember playing some of these levels for the first time, I almost smashed my keyboard in frustration and yet every time I screwed up I knew it was my own fault. Each failure leaves you even more determined to finally beat this damn level.\nThis game seems to be less popular than its predecessor, Abe\u2019s Oddysee, (although that may just be my group of friends) but I definitely prefer this one. Partly because I actually played this sequel before the original but also in large part because of the addition of quicksave. There is nothing more frustrating than completing a particularly difficult section and then dying 3 steps from a checkpoint and the quicksave handily eliminates that frustration.\nThe graphics are somewhat dated but it still looks pretty good for its age, besides it\u2019s only $3 - or even less if you wait for a sale - what more could you want?

Just, this game.\n\nIf you're planning on getting this game at the moment, don't let anything put you off. When I was a lot younger, owning this game on the PS3 [Yes, I am still one of those little turds who still attend school], I didn't like it. But now? It's one of the best games I've played in a while.  So if you're new to this series, here's a review for you to settle you in. Well, as best as I can.\n\n[h1]The Plot[/h1]\n\n\nSo the plot is simple: Abe, the Mudokon who was formerly a floor-waxer for Rupture Farms before blowing it up, finds out of a despicable plan by the Glukkons through a group of dead spirits named The Three Weirdos. The burial ground of Necrum had been stolen from; bones were being mined by blinded Mudokons, as they were a required ingredient or the well-known beverage Soulstorm Brew. Upon finding this out, Abe sets out to Destroy the brewery and stop this new industrialist scheme. An okay plot, if I say so myself, despite being along similar lines as Oddysee.\n\n\n[h1] Controls: Movement, Gamespeak & Posession[/h1]\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is quite something. So let's get this out the way. Abe's normal controls, walking, running, rolling, jumping and all sorts are really smooth in a sense. They're responsive and flow well with the pace of the game, whether it be slow platforming or heart-pounding chases, and trust me, there are going to be lots of those. You're probably going to spend a lot of the time either walking, rolling or sneaking, as running is mainly essential for chases with Sligs, Scrabs and Paramites, which do crop up at just the right times. Jumping is precise and easy to do, y'just press the space button and you'll leap about two to three spaces forwards, which you learn and can pretty much master right off the bat. In fact, most movement CAN be learnt that quickly. And sneaking is just walking, 'cept Sligs can't hear you. Dead simple, and with a noise I can't get out of my head for some reason.\n\nGamespeak. This nifty mechanic allows Abe to talk to his enslaved race and lead them to bird portals. A lot are simple: Hello, follow me, all of ya', wait, all that stuff. However, replacing the whistling from the last game, there are now options to slap, say sorry, tell people to stop. This was because in this game, the Mudokons have several emotions to work around, going from sad and angry, the blind Mudokons who will follow the sound of your voice but not you, or sick Mudokons who you have to heal with ring powers. There isn't much else to say here. Nifty.\n\nPosession is something that got a direct upgrade adding even MORE experimentation. Unlike last game where you could only posess Sligs, the gun-toting cyborg henchmen of the Magog Cartel, you can posess EVERYTHING here. Well, except for slogs. Scrabs? Check. Paramites? Check. The Glukkons who you can use to order around Sligs to do your bidding? Checkedy Checkedy Check. These all have their own curveballs, own Gamespeak, and own uses. Even though there aren't too many times you can posess Glukkons, and Phleg... Oh god, that part in Bonewerkz.\n\n\n\n\n[h1] Music and pictures [/h1]\n\n\n\nThis is where the game gets sublime. And by sublime, I mean some of the best atmosphere, music and art direction you're going to see. The score matches your enviroment perfectly. A few I can list off the top of my head are Necrum, the Mines, the Mudanchee & Mudumo Vaults, and then FeeCo Depot. Be it tribal instruments clashing and meshing to get the feel of a sacred area, or the mechanical and almost oppresive sounds of industrial areas like Necrum Mines or Soulstorm Brewery. All these tracks accompany the backgrounds perfectly. The amount of detail put into these images, the sheer [b]blood and sweat[/b] clearly poored into this was worth the time, creating truly stunning pieces of art, such as all the areas involving the vaults or Necrum, which capture the sacred yet barren forest which has long been forgotten. This doesn't have to be the background either. Character animations, like the floor-wiping Mudokon slaves or even the mere act of climbing ledges or entering doors, are animated as smoothly and realistic as they possibly could be. \n\n\n[h1]The Negatives / Sadist Difficulty:[/h1]\n\n\n\nFor all the good things I've had to say about this game, there is at least one problem with the game, albeit not being a major flaw with the game. This game can be hard. Not just your standard quite challenging levels cropping up a few times, no. Each and every section of this game will have at least one finger-numblingly difficult puzzle or level or just segment. It can either be you can't figure a situation out or you're stuck in one of the game's many chases where you have to run from hostile wildlife and the slimy tentacle cyborgs with machineguns. Only a minor problem, but this will cause a lot of pain.\n\n\n[h1] My Verdict: [/h1]\n\n\n\nWell, what do I think of the game? It is timeless. A truly gorgeous blast from the past which will continue to amaze for quite some time, even if the newer games like Oddworld: Soulstorm flop! [Which I best will be nowhere near happening] If you're thinking about getting this game, go ahead.

Abe\u2019s Exoddus trouxe consigo v\u00e1rios pontos positivos em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 jogabilidade, hist\u00f3ria e atmosfera, tornando o passado e futuro de Mudos cada vez mais complexo, misterioso e emocionante.\n\nMudos \u00e9 o continente onde se passa a hist\u00f3ria de Abe\u2019s Exoddus. Por enquanto, s\u00f3 conhecemos uma pequena frac\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies neste continente. Abe \u00e9 um Mudokon, a esp\u00e9cie natural de Mudos; n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito inteligente, foi toda a sua vida um escravo, at\u00e9 que descobriu um segredo muito obscuro do local onde trabalhava, RuptureFarms. A companhia pretendia que os Mudokons fossem a nova iguaria do seu mercado alimentar. Foi ent\u00e3o que Abe, apercebeu-se que tudo o que tinha visto at\u00e9 ali era apenas a ponta do icebergue. Abe usa os seus l\u00e1bios selados para o lembrar do seu objectivo, salvar todos os escravos das garras dos Glukkons, os governantes e \u201csenhores\u201d das ind\u00fastrias de Mudos.\n\nTal como aconteceu com Oddworld: Abe\u2019s Oddysee, o coment\u00e1rio social sobre a riqueza de uns, a pobreza de outros; o facto de as produ\u00e7\u00f5es em massa serem um risco de sa\u00fade p\u00fablica, de serem um fardo enorme com a polui\u00e7\u00e3o que produzem; de existir esp\u00e9cies e tribos a serem expulsas do seu habitat natural, seja pela mat\u00e9ria prima que obt\u00eam, seja pelo dinheiro que podem ganhar com ela, tudo isto faz parte da hist\u00f3ria humor\u00edstica que o jogo tem, mas que se foca em coisas reais e obscuras, provocadas pela humanidade.\n\nUma das novidades em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 jogabilidade, \u00e9 o facto que podermos possuir as m\u00edticas esp\u00e9cies selvagens e industriais, tais como o impar\u00e1vel Scrab, o amigo perverso Paramite assim como os est\u00fapidos Sligs e os gananciosos Glukkons. Podemos tamb\u00e9m possuir gases. Sim, gases. No jogo anterior eram apenas uma piada de fundo, mas neste \u00e9 uma das novas mec\u00e2nicas de jogo. Existe uma sec\u00e7\u00e3o completamente feita a pensar em puzzles deste g\u00e9nero. Incrivelmente, funciona bem. Com o poder de possuir outras esp\u00e9cies, podemos tamb\u00e9m \u201cfalar\u201d. Anteriormente, apenas pod\u00edamos usar Abe e os Sligs, mas Exoddus torna poss\u00edvel comunicarmos usando qualquer esp\u00e9cie selvagem. Excepto os Fleeches.\n\nA jogabilidade principal \u00e9 muito similar ao jogo anterior, com apenas algumas altera\u00e7\u00f5es, mas esta adv\u00e9m do Prince Of Persia original e Flashback, sendo este \u00faltimo a derradeira inspira\u00e7\u00e3o. Abe pode andar, correr, andar pela calada, saltar, fazer salto em comprimento e um variado arsenal de actividades ol\u00edmpicas, sendo o mais importante a reza, em que ao rezar, Abe pode possuir as esp\u00e9cies que lhe apare\u00e7am \u00e0 frente.\n\nA mec\u00e2nica integral do jogo poder\u00e1 ser o Gamespeak, em que ao usarmos combina\u00e7\u00f5es de bot\u00f5es, Abe pode comunicar com o mundo \u00e0 sua volta, seja para ajudar os seus camaradas Mudokons, distrair os Sligs, ordenar as tropas com os Paramites, anunciar a batalha final com os Scrabs ou simplesmente pedir recados com os Glukkons. Os puzzles do jogo anterior conseguiam ser tediosos, pois ordenar cinco Mudokons para um portal conseguia ser um grande problema, mas fazia tamb\u00e9m parte de uma das mec\u00e2nicas centrais do jogo. Agora, com o comando \u201cAll a Ya\u201d, podemos chamar todos os Mudokons no ecr\u00e3 e despachar trabalho. Mas nem tudo s\u00e3o rosas.\n\nCom esta nova mec\u00e2nica, foi introduzida novas formas de a dificultar. Agora existem v\u00e1rios tipos de Mudokons: os doentes, que apenas com o rem\u00e9dio obedecem aos vossos comandos; os furiosos, que ter\u00e3o que pedir desculpa para eles vos seguirem; os \u201cfelizes\u201d, que por uso de g\u00e1s hilariante, tornam-se insuport\u00e1veis, e portanto, merecem uma boa chapada; os depressivos, que por terem visto um colega a morrer, apenas vos seguem se pedirem desculpa, sendo que podem tornar-se mesmo suicidas; e por fim, os cegos, que como trabalham nas minas, n\u00e3o devem ver as ossadas e t\u00eam que ser devidamente guiados durante o jogo.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria, muito resumidamente e sem estragar nada, trata-se de Abe tentar salvar os seus camaradas, enquanto desactiva as minas Necrum, onde est\u00e3o enterrados os seus antepassados. Mas Abe apercebe-se do grande plano dos Glukkons, de tornar as ossadas dos seus antepassados em bebida energ\u00e9tica. Ent\u00e3o, o objectivo torna-se em parar a f\u00e1brica Soulstorm, a todo o custo. E para isso, ele tem a ajuda dos seus amigos e dos tr\u00eas \u201cEstranhos\u201d, que guiam Abe pela sua nova aventura.\n\nA atmosfera de Abe\u2019s Exoddus \u00e9 mais colorida do que Abe\u2019s Oddysee, mas n\u00e3o deixa de ser intrigante, obscura e por vezes macabra. Os barulhos de fundo, seja o andar dos Sligs ou apenas p\u00e1ssaros, associados \u00e0 excelente banda sonora, torna a atmosfera ainda mais completa e rica. Este \u00e9 um daqueles jogos em que a atmosfera nos toma de surpresa e prende-nos at\u00e9 ao fim. A tecnologia usada pelo jogo \u00e9 uma mistura de gr\u00e1ficos previamente renderizados e sprites, tornando o jogo mais leve, pois a ideia original era completamente em 3D, mas a PlayStation n\u00e3o era forte o suficiente para tal, e teriam que diminuir a qualidade de apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o. Ent\u00e3o o projecto tornou-se 2.5D.\n\nO jogo tem um jogabilidade excelente e intuitiva, ambiente e gr\u00e1ficos mant\u00eam-se muito bem, mesmo ap\u00f3s quase vinte anos, e tem uma hist\u00f3ria \u00fanica e progressiva, em que apesar do jogo tocar nos assuntos muito levemente, s\u00e3o assuntos s\u00e9rios e reais, que cada vez mais tomam protagonismo no nosso dia-a-dia. E como tal, devem pegar nestas duas p\u00e9rolas e jogar do princ\u00edpio ao fim.\n\n\n\u2588 F.S.", "timestamp_created": 1477427538, "timestamp_updated": 1477427538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26170535": {"recommendationid": "26170535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004303349", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497136895}, "language": "german", "review": "best childhood game", "timestamp_created": 1477168984, "timestamp_updated": 1477168984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26163847": {"recommendationid": "26163847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081787922", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477146240}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1477144729, "timestamp_updated": 1477144729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26132331": {"recommendationid": "26132331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043463021", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476983676}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c !!!

I love it so much, I spent a month only playing this game and saved all the Mudokans. I didn't grow up with the Oddworld games, but earlier this year I picked up the first on PS1. I honestly didn't have much fun. The game is good, but I would rather play it on an emulator where I can save anytime I wanted. So when I heard Abe's Exoddus had the ability to save and quicksave where ever and when ever I wanted (and needed) to, I got excited. And to be perfectly honest, I perfer the keyboard controls over the controller. I feel it's better for this kind of game, where you have to execute a quick set of movemens in a quick succession (like when you have to run and then roll into a hole. I didn't like how my movements felt pretty clunky on the PS1 version of Abe's Oddysee.\n\nSome Pros:\nThe story is great (play the game to find out)\nThe Mudokans are the most adorable things I've ever seen (I don't think the blind guys are scary)\nThe controls can be changed to make movement fluid\nYou can possess almost everything (even your own farts after you drink some SoulStorm)\nThe cutscenes are great\n(This is just a little thing, but I love how some Mudokans' voices can be really high or really low)\n(Another small thing, but I like Abe's new voice)\n\nSome Cons:\nThe game is old, so the steam overlay and screenshot functions don't work\nSometimes alt-tabbing out would crash the game, and saving on one screen completely crashed everything (I'm guessing somewhere in Necrum)\nThe graphics are pretty low-res, and the cutscenes are pretty blurry(but I still love the cutscenes)\n\nTL,DR\nBuy this game and you will be happy if you're fine with quicksaving a lot", "timestamp_created": 1474690469, "timestamp_updated": 1474690665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553235", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25491989": {"recommendationid": "25491989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161170379", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498782948}, "language": "turkish", "review": "G\u00f6z\u00fcmde canlan\u0131r koskoca mazi..", "timestamp_created": 1473763635, "timestamp_updated": 1473763635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25486010": {"recommendationid": "25486010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059105031", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474411336}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un clasico, juegasoooooo!\n", "timestamp_created": 1473720952, "timestamp_updated": 1473720952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25454103": {"recommendationid": "25454103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135635361", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482295385}, "language": "english", "review": "> Progresses through game quickly\n> Goes down slope\n> Doesn't know where to go\n> Can't find out where to go\n\n13/10 not getting this refunded.", "timestamp_created": 1473558045, "timestamp_updated": 1498826197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25352754": {"recommendationid": "25352754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042503864", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473019749}, "language": "english", "review": "This sequel fixes most of the problems I had with the old game.

best value-for-money games I've ever seen on Steam, at least not including sales. It took me 20 hours to complete this game, so that's \u00a31 per 10 hours.\nThe game itself is a classic, growing on what made Abe's Oddysee so great, and while I think Exoddus lacks the atmosphere that made the original so enjoyable, the gameplay itself is much more varied (though I still prefer Oddysee). The cutscenes are better, the music is more complex (if not a tad generic), there are more places and environments to see, and there are more types of puzzles based on the emotion system with the Mudokons. They can be angry, depressed, wired (in other words happy), sick, and blind. This means a lot more is explored as to how the Mudokons interact with you, and especially trying to handle the wired Mudokons running about with enemies, bombs and motion sensors around can get very tense.\nYou can also autosave, another improvement from Oddysee that makes the game much less frustrating.\nI have 2 complaints, however; the first being there are a few ridiculous chase sections that force you to duck and react quickly with a movement system not internded for fast-paced action, rather slow-moving stealth. The game also overstays it's welcome a bit, getting dragged out for a few more hours than it really needed to last.\nSpeaking of stealth, once again every single enemy can make your palms sweat all over your controller, especially if you have some blind Mudokons you have to escort.\nOne more thing; the graphics, for 1998, are amazing.

You die from falling if you fall down 2 floors. sometimes you don't know how many floors you will fall since it's offscreen. You also die from 1 bullet, so do the slaves you are rescuing.

This game has some of the BEST cutscenes, if not THE best cutscenes for the PS1 and early PC era. Gameplay is smooth, and for me, It ran without errors on my windows 8 machine, with a medium graphics card. The idea for the game is AMAZING, you play as Abe, a mudoken hero who must free his mudoken pals from soul storm brewery, and other amazingly beautiful and well designed places. The difficulty is completely fair, and, If you die, it is completely your fault, not the fault of the game or any cheap enemies, like in the last game. This game also features quick saves, possibly the best thing lovely lorne luscious lanning has ever came up with. gamespeak has been changed slightly, and a new command was added to have abe say \"all a' ya!\" where all of the mudokens in the room would follow, even ones in the distant background.\n\nCONS:\nWhile in some rooms, the game makes the player throw rocks at mines that cannot be disarmed. This is extremely tedious, especially when you have long rows of mines to destroy. When you set off a mine, you would expect it to set off all the surrounding ones, right? well no. You have to hit EACH FUCKING MINE to destroy them, and once in a blue hand moon a mine might detonate another. You can also only carry 9 rocks, and you cannot refil your bag of rocks until you throw each one. pain in the ASS. in addition, you have to release the Z key (Throwing key) after each rock you throw. if you hold it, and choose which way you want to throw it, abe will walk in that direction, towards whatever mine or bone drill you are trying to avoid\n\nThere is laughing gas in this game. Which on paper is a good concept, but in the game it can be very frustrating and unfair. First off, if one of your following mudokens is exposed to laughing gas, they go apeshit. making you slap them to calm them down. But what usually happens, especially if you have a large following of gas-high mudokens, is you can accidentaly slap a mudoken that you have already slapped. pissing him off, and he slaps you back. then you have to go and say sorry to him to calm him down. and when you're finally done with all that, one of your gas high mudokens has already ran straight into the barrel of a fucking slig.\n\nBut when you put all the bullshit aside, you end up with one of the best games every made, and probably the best of the whole oddworld trilogy. but that is bound to change when Squeeks oddysee is released.\n", "timestamp_created": 1440438358, "timestamp_updated": 1440438358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17672991": {"recommendationid": "17672991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125740775", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512178823}, "language": "english", "review": "Played The Demo Of This Game For The First 5 Minutes...\n\n\n\nInstantly Wanted To Buy It.\n\n\nIt's Really Worth The $2.99 It Offers!", "timestamp_created": 1440313806, "timestamp_updated": 1440313806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17660997": {"recommendationid": "17660997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035419477", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512884186}, "language": "english", "review": "I can honestly say that this is my absolute favourite game ever, and I am happy that it's on Steam since my PS1 broke down. I really believe that this game gets heavily overlooked when it comes to naming the top games of its generation. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee gets mentioned quite a bit, but this one... not so much. Which is a damn shame, and I'll explain why in a minute.\n\nThe only downside to this was getting it playable was a little difficult. Resolution issues are the first big problem, though that was easy to fix with a quick download of a program. Now the only minor annoyance is that because its natural resolution was 800x600, stretching that to my 1920x1080 caused it to because a little more pixelated and blurry. You can still see everything perfectly fine, its mostly just distant objects or background things during the cutscenes that may be difficult to make out.\nController compatibility isn't labelled, but it [i]is[/i] there, to a degree. I was prepared to use my Xbox 360 controller, but the default mapped controls for it were a mess (chanting was the 'Back' button of all buttons). Honestly, it's easier and probably better to just stick with the keyboard. Any remapping you deem necessary is much less stressful.\n\nAs for the gameplay... If you've played Abe's Oddysee, then everything you saw there was improved on here, and for the better. Extra voice commands, emotions of the Mudokons to deal with, often in hilarious ways (particularly with the laughing gas). Possession of enemies ranges further than sligs (who also now have a flying variation). The wider range of enemies, the much more intimidating puzzles, the fact that the major bad guys are actually a within bits and pieces of the game and become a mechanic themselves rather than just be seen and death with via cutscenes... and at its worst, some areas just require careful timing. The game is incredibly simple for the things you can do.\n\nThe backgrounds for the environments are spectacular, the music... isn't the stuff of legends, but I have found myself humming or whistling a couple of the tunes here and there. But otherwise the only other major factor is the story, and it's just as weird and twisted as the original. It kicks off right where Oddysee ended (poor Abe doesn't even get time to rest).\nAnd here's a fun fact. Back in the late 90's when this game originally came out, most of this games cutscenes were turned into a short film. A short film that was nominated for an Oscar. A goddamn [b]Academy Award[/b]! Technically speaking, the first and (I could be wrong with this one) only game to have achieved that.\n\nBesides the questionable performance issues in getting the game going, majority of which easily fixed, I recommend this game and recommend it hard. While I'm at it, I also recommend Abe's Oddysee (or its HD remake 'New n' Tasty').

Besides the occasional drunk, blind, or just generally resistant creature, they all emote like mood rings, showing red skin when angry and an off-color greenish yellow and pale tone when sick. You have to find healing rings from Shaman Mudokons and apologize and shoulder-pat to make angry ones happy again so they'll follow you to safety. And blind Mudokons have a tendency to walk into drills and off of ledges if you don't guide them properly with verbal cues. On a positive note, you can use their blindness to your benefit. For example, if a blind Mudokon is on the level below you, notably the one with the lever you need to pull but can't get to, you can stand on the side of the screen you want the blind guy to walk toward, prompt him to follow you, and then tell him to \"work\" in order to turn the crank or pull the lever that allows you access to another level. Another excellent function is being able to guide more than one Mudokon at a time. In the first game, you had to rescue one Mudokon, then come back and get the other one. In Exoddus, you have an \"All o' ya\" command that captures the attention of anyone present. At points, you'll have a gaggle trailing behind you - sneaking, running, or jumping into the bird teleporters.\n\nBut perhaps even better than the hammed-up gamespeak is the fact that the developers fixed what could easily be called the number one problem with the first game: the inability to save the game wherever you wanted. Not only was Abe's Oddysee a tough game, you spent a lot of time redoing what you'd done because of the need to learn the hard way. Many of the puzzles in the original required some testing before you made it through, and when you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the path each time you fail, it's hard to stay inspired to push forward. In Exoddus, you have an incredibly welcomed quick-save option that allows you to quickly save your progress, anywhere in the game as many times as you want. And when you're ready to quit playing, you simply save to the memory card instead of a quick save, and you're set. This introduces an interesting dilemma, as the quick save certainly makes Exoddus seem easier, in a sense, but the game itself is actually even more difficult than the first one - it's just that now you finally have hope. And just when you think hope's lost, something wonderful like an invisibility power-up appears when you free Mudokon spirits.\n\nGraphically, Abe's Exoddus is the same 2D visual wonder, much like the original or, moreover, Interplay's Heart of Darkness. Yet the graphics seem much more brilliant, as there are more environments with greater diversity in design. And the cutscenes are not only gorgeous, they're entertaining and (can I say it?) funny. No, really. Besides that, the game is quite large, and the environments are expansive. You'll have to rescue the spirits of Mudokons past; battle the typical, yet enhanced cast of Sligs, Scrabs, and the excruciatingly annoying Fleeches (long live the quick save), among others; as well as roll through the mines in mine carts and such. And sound-wise, you really can't get much better without being downright distracting. The voices of all the characters are incredible, and the effects, from getting blown up by a mine to the echoey sound of falling to your death, really can't be beat.\n\nAbe's Exoddus also has a two-player mode. While the Exoddus mainstay is clearly the single-player game, the two-player co-op mode does have charm, as you and another player take turns working your way through. When you die, your partner picks up where you left off and so forth. A bit of advice? Pick a crummy partner, and you might have some fun with this. Otherwise, the waiting game just doesn't parallel the egocentric fun of keeping this title to yourself. In all, Abe's Exoddus is a great example of how a game can stay true to its conceptual pursuit while still improving upon the original, all while keeping its soul intact. If you loved the first one, you'll like this game more. If you didn't play the first one, you can start here. If you hated the first one, it's likely because of the lack of save points, so you should definitely consider giving this series another try.", "timestamp_created": 1425116455, "timestamp_updated": 1425116455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14665746": {"recommendationid": "14665746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044901797", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513530799}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a follow up in my abe review.

The reason why I wanted it, because I have the Demo1 disc of the first game & I final got the full copy of the game while sometime in high school when stores like GAME stopped putting them old PS1 games instore.\n\nI do have the copy of this game on PS1, but never expranice the full game, because the game froze when Abe jumped in the well the Scrab temple, but Paramites temple was pretty aswsome, then I never really bothered with cheat code books that my uncle from England sent over to me years before with a copy of Crash Bandicoot 3.  I did complete the game a few years later by using the the level cheat code.\n\nNow that I am 19 going on 20 & have a laptop that runs windows 8 that can play some games like Five nights at freddy's.  Seeing British youtuber Caddicarus doing a retrospective of the first three games & saying at the end of part 3 that the games are on steam.  Well I downloaded the demo of this one & worked fine, then I bought it.\n\n\nStory: \n\nOddworld: Abe's Exoddus takes place straight after the first when Abe saved all the mudokons from Repture Farms.  After having a fall & getting knocked out that laid him to having a vision of three ghosts telling him that the Glukkons are digging up there bones.  So Abe & five friends set off across the dessert to Necrum to put an end to it.\n\nAlong the way Abe finds out what why the Gulkkon digging up Mudokon bones for a drink called Soul Strom Brew that is made from there bones, whitch takes Abe to another journy to the burial vaults of Necrum and temples of Scrabs, Paramites & Fleeches to get the ablity to cure sick mudokons. \n\nWhats new:\n\nWith the character in game & in cutscenes sounds different from the first with, but with a deeper voice & then goes high when changes from saying \"Hello\" to \"Hi\" when using game speak as you progressing more into the game.  \n\nSome of the cast of characters from the last game are back including the gun crazy Sligs that can now fly & shoot granades & ones without pants & the Glukkons, Scrabs, Paramites & slogs return also.  There are some new characters like the blined mudokons, Fleeches, worm-like creatures that live in the Oddworld underworld that will take a few shots to eat Abe in one whole & Slurgs when stepped on will wake up the Feeches when sleeping.     \n\nWhat I liked:\n\nI like that I was able to us my PS4 controller to play the game like I did on the PS1 without having to use my keyboard on my laptop.  Getting to possess Glukkons, Scrabs & Paramites for the first time & using there very own game speak which is neat.\n\nThe game runs really well & has a faster loading time & at a good low price.  You can run this game on any PC.\n\nWhat I hated:\n\nI got nothing besides the D-pad not doing anything.\n \nFinal Thought:\n\nOddworld: Abe's Exoddus has a great  sence of humor, good voice acting & level design, including amazing art that shows in the games background & in cutscenes. \n\nIs this worth your time?  Yes.   Its still a great game to this day.

O jogo que eu sempre quis analisar. Eu cresci jogando isso, e n\u00e3o me arrependo um dia sequer de ter jogado.\n\nOddworld: Abe's Exoddus \u00e9 um jogo feito pela Oddworld Inhabitants em 1998. Por mais que o jogo pare\u00e7a uma sequ\u00eancia do Oddysee, na realidade n\u00e3o \u00e9, pois o Oddysee \u00e9 o primeiro da Quintologia Oddworld, e o Munch's Oddysee \u00e9 o segundo de acordo com os devs, ent\u00e3o o Exoddus fica como um \"jogo b\u00f4nus\". (apesar de eu consider\u00e1-lo uma sequ\u00eancia \u00f3tima)\n\nA hist\u00f3ria se passa diretamente depois do Oddysee, onde Abe, depois de voltar de Rupturefarms, tem uma vis\u00e3o de esp\u00edritos de nativos Mudokons mortos relatando roubo de ossos de Necrum, o \"cemit\u00e9rio\" dos Mudokons nativos, para produzir Soulstorm Brew, um tipo de bebida fabricada pelos Glukkons (sim, n\u00e3o basta tentar usar a carne dos Mudokons, agora usam os ossos tamb\u00e9m). Assim, Abe parte para as minas de Necrum com um grupo de Mudokons para tentar descobrir a verdade.\n\nD\u00e1 pra dizer que \u00e9 um \"Oddysee 2.0\", pois o gameplay, os gr\u00e1ficos, as m\u00fasicas e a tem\u00e1tica do jogo continuam os mesmos. Recomendo ler meu review sobre o Oddysee para saber como \u00e9. Por\u00e9m existem v\u00e1rias melhorias e coisas novas. Por exemplo, agora pode-se chamar v\u00e1rios Mudokons de uma vez, ao inv\u00e9s de chamar um por um como se fazia no Oddysee (e que foi implementado no New 'N' Tasty). O Exoddus tamb\u00e9m cont\u00e9m um sistema de QuickSave, marca agora caracter\u00edstica da OWI, onde voc\u00ea salva o jogo no lugar EXATO onde voc\u00ea estava. N\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 na mesma fase e na mesma tela, \u00e9 NO LUGAR EXATO onde voc\u00ea estava quando deu o save, ao contr\u00e1rio dos checkpoints invis\u00edveis do Oddysee.\n\nEntre outras mudan\u00e7as, o jogo agora possui Sligs voadores (parecem mini-helic\u00f3pteros), e tamb\u00e9m d\u00e1 pra possuir Scrabs e Paramites, coisa que n\u00e3o era poss\u00edvel no Oddysee (isso est\u00e1 fortemente ligado \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o d\u00e1 pra contar). O jogo tamb\u00e9m possui Glukkons para serem possu\u00eddos durante o jogo, enquanto no Oddysee eram apenas Sligs. Cada um tem seu pr\u00f3prio GameSpeak. O jogo tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 um pouco mais longo que o antecessor, possui alguas fases a mais e... ah, quase que eu esque\u00e7o de mencionar: lembra dos 99 Mudokons de Rupturefarms? Agora tem 300 Mudokons pra salvar nesse jogo. Boa sorte amigo, eu nunca passei de 250.\n\nN\u00e3o tem muito o que dizer, mas se voc\u00ea gostou do Oddysee, o Exoddus \u00e9 um must-have. Eu tenho at\u00e9 hoje o CD original dos dois, do Oddysee (no PS1) e do Exoddus (no PC), mas quando eu os vi na Steam, n\u00e3o tinha como n\u00e3o comprar.

The excellent level design, short-but-sweet story, and grand scope of it was hampered predominantly by its checkpoint system. Each portion of a stage would throw three or four challenges at you between each checkpoint, not counting any hidden mudokons. As a result, there were many cases when several parts of a particular stage were easy but fairly slow and time consuming, while later parts were significantly more difficult and led to multiple deaths. Having to replay the earlier, easier parts quickly became very tedious very fast. In some games, this sort of thing doesn't hurt the game, but here, where the gameplay is built around trial and error, and often demands a great deal of patience, it killed the pacing at several points towards the beginning and middle of the game.\n\nI'm mentioning this because Abe's Exoddus included a quicksave feature which circumvented this problem, and for that reason alone could be considered a better game. That's not the only feather in Abe's Exoddus' cap though. The inclusion of such a feature as quicksave can fundamentally change a game like this, and Oddworld Inhabitants clearly kept this in mind. The level design is more challenging than Abe's Oddysee, but more fair. Secrets, previously pretty cryptic and very easy to overlook without the help of a guide, are now found by some out-of-the-box thinking and creative use of the game's mechanics. The core gameplay and overall design have been tweaked to remove tedium. The mechanics have been greatly expanded upon in order to provide much more variety and complexity. The voice acted cutscenes lend the world much more character, and add a great deal of levity to a game that could very easily become quite depressing.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Abe's Exoddus is the better of the two side scrolling games (as of writing this, New 'n' Tasty is still PS4 exclusive, so I can't comment on it yet). It manages to correct the flaws of it's predecessor while also expanding upon everything that was good. It really is what every sequel should strive to be.

From talking to your fellow Mudokins, to possessing enemy sligs, this game has it all. Puzzle, platforming, and chase sequences.

Well for one, dispite being released a while back, it's still nice to look at it. All the backgrounds and levels are well made and pleasing to look at. The platforming is smooth and not clunky at all, though the controls for keyboard were kinda iffy with me. Then again the last time I played this game and Oddysee was on my PSX, however it is still a pretty solid game. It can also be quite the challenging game as well if you try to go for all of the Mudokons and the ultra good ending.

From the very first sounds of the opening sequence and game menu, I was instantly transported back to late 1990's, sitting in my older brother's bedroom, playing this on classic playstation and a tiny, heat-warped telly that we had to use a bit of blue-tac and a screw to keep the switch on AV (occassionally the screw would come loose and we'd suddenly be plunged into static mid-game!). My brother and I would take turns playing, switching every time we got Abe killed (which, on my part, was normally almost instantly), jumping out of our skins at the scarier parts (this game had the best graphics we'd ever seen at the time) and laughing our arses off at all the fart jokes. We had played through Oddysee pretty quickly, so we were excited to have a much longer game this time (TWO whole discs!), with slightly better graphics, and OH THAT REALLY AWESOME QUICKSAVE FUNCTION! Our mum even got in on the action, and played this with us on more than one occassion, helping us out with the more \"puzzle-solving\" sections that we couldn't work out (plus she is an x-files fanatic and loves everything to do with Aliens and weird shit like that). \n\nSo for me, this game is totally worth playing, even though it definitely wasn't designed to be played with a keyboard, nor on a 27\" HD screen. It brings back so many fond memories of the rare moments that my brother and I were working together to keep Abe alive and rescue all of the Mudokons, instead of at each others throats trying to kill each other. I still love the quirky nature of this game/universe - the artwork and landscapes are mind-blowing to me even now that the graphics are incredibly below-par. The characters and creatures of Oddword are so unique and terrifying. I love the 2D platform gameplay - I wish there were more games like this. Some of the levels are pretty easy, and some of them are infuriatingly difficult (for me anyway), which just makes completing them all the more rewarding :) Just don't be a dunce like me and forget that you've only been Quicksaving for the last 3 hours, decide to exit after completing a particularly difficult level and forget to do a proper Save... That shit is devistating.\n\nSo yeah, if you loved playing this game when it first came out, you won't regret playing it again :) It's everything I remember and more. \n\nIf you've never played it before, give it a go! It was ahead of it's time when it came out like 15 years ago, and it's still a unique gaming experience in a lot of ways. If nothing else, the story is fantastic. The implications and irony of the story is something you just don't get in many popular games. We sympathize with the Mudokons and their hero, Abe. But most of us, if we took a hard look at ourselves, probably fall into the Glukkon or Slig category... or the kind of Muddokon that just watches it all happen and does nothing.\n\nHD re-make coming soon???

These games are completely unique in their story, and perhaps the only games I have ever seen that could portray the entrapment of an entire species in such a humorous way. Abe's Exoddus is somewhat a platformer, but with many puzzle aspects. The point is to save all of your enslaved species because the spirits of your ancestors all tell you to, so Abe does just that.

It improves on things and introduces new gameplay mechanics, yet seems to take a step back in certain aspects. For one, they made an already incredibly difficult game, even more challenging. Clunky controls combined with trial and error gameplay where perfection is required leaves this as one of the most frustrating games ever made. The atmosphere, enemies, and art direction is great like the previous game, however I felt they took a backseat this time, with alot of the areas this time looking very similar in an even longer game. Also there were no elums this time around so that was disappointing lol. New gameplay stuff like controlling the Glukkons and invisibility were pretty neat. I always love seeing new enemies so the new editions were exciting as well. Overall, the game is awesome. It's just not the best to play. The game is unfairly hard and lengthy that you will quickly lose interest. Don't even bother trying to save all the Mudokons if you care about your sanity. Some are hidden so ridiculously you would never have found them on your own. Abe's Exoddus is a relentless experience with less variety this time around, which made it hard for me to stick with it. I still recommend it, though. It's cheap, fun, and is still a great game despite all my complaints. I love Oddworld's source material which keeps me playing despite my frustrations and i'm sure it will probably interest you, too.

Abe is out once again on a rescue mission to save his friends from an evil corporation.

Compared to Abe's Oddysee this game has a few sweet extra features though!\n\nOne thing I find really amazing about this game is that you can take control of more than just the standard slig enemies. You can also take control of various other creatures that you could only try running away from in the first game.\n\nYour buddies that you have to save have also decided to adapt more various personality. There are the overly happy ones that you have to literally slap back to reality before they'll listen to you. The sad ones that you'll have to cheer up ( careful, if they get too sad they might kill themselves!), the angry ones who will try to hit you or even kill you until you apologise to them and blind ones that you have to make sure they'll stop in time before they run into something that will kill them!\n\nThe game, just like the original, runs very smooth on any PC and is bugfree.

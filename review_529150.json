There are sometimes more than 1,000 ships on the map that all need to move and interact with each other. Just calculating the orbit for 1,000 ships at 90 FPS is a cool thing, but now add in that each ship must know at all times where the closest enemy ship is such that they can shoot. Without some incredible feats of efficiency, none of this would be possible at 90 FPS.\n\nI would never ask someone to change their honest review of a product, so please don't even consider it.

What is this game?  \nIt's a strategy game sorta like the board game RISK set in space (without the dice rolls and without having to choose your countries first). Actually it's more like an RTS, but the way you advance in the game is by sending your ships to take over the nearby planets.\n\nSo yeah, You start out with a few ships on a planet and it slowly increases the number of ships you have over time. You have a number of neighboring planets that are either netural (white) or an enemy (some other color).  So you can tell your ships to fly from your home planet to the adjacent planet, destroy the enemy ships there, and after you have the majority of the ships in orbit around a planet, a 3 second countdown starts before the planet changes to your color. \n\nNow you can make ships on two planets, and spread out from there.  Like RISK, you can attack with varying amounts of your forces with the risk of spreading yourself too thin and leaving it open for your enemy to come in and wipe you out quickly.  Alternately you can send a small amount of forces over to ensure the planet you just left is well defended, but if you go too slow, your enemy will have many more planets and ships with which to attack you.\n\nYou have to strike a balance between attacking quickly and making sure you're well defended against attacks.  You can also form a chain of planets so that as new ships are built they are automatically sent to the front lines (or sent on to attack).  I think the game has a limit on how many planets can be chained together at any one time though.\n\nThe Graphics are simple (a sphere representing a planet of varying sizes and small polygons for your fighters) but it's done well enough to get the point across.  Maybe one day someone will come in and add to the graphics to make it look nicer but it's hardly necessary, and with a lot of ships on screen it might just slow the whole game down.\n\nThere's a variety of game options for difficulty: (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Cheating AI) as well as other options that can affect the difficulty (more enemy players, more planets to capture, and faster moving ships which speeds the whole game up).  As a beginner I found the default easy level game to be pretty easy without being too simple.  Just the act of speeding up the ships made the game more challenging instantly, and if I had tossed in another AI it might have felt like hard mode right away...I don't know how much the AI would fight amongst itself.\n\nThere are also leaderboards for how many times you've beaten the game on each difficulty, as well as how many enemy ships you've destroyed.  Not so much a matter of skill as it is a matter of how much time you invested on the game to get there....still it's neat to see.\n\nThings I liked about the game:\n[list]\n   [*] Well, it's free! You immediately lower your expectations when the game doesn't cost you a dime to try out.\n   [*] As a strategy game, it's simple enough to pick up quickly while challenging enough to give you a reason to play after you know what you're doing.\n   [*] You can resize the playing area by using the grip buttons on the vive controllers. Zoom in or out\n   [*] You can still walk around the area and manually select your next target rather than teleporting everywhere.\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like:\n[list]\n   [*]The graphics are a bit too simple\n   [*] Some cool battle music would be nice but I did not remember any really good music.  \n   [*] I think even with resizing the play area, I eventually wound up close to a wall (where the tracking is the worst)   I don't think there's ANY kind of teleportation mechanic in the game. Even a button to \"recenter the play area\" would be nice.\n[/list]\n\nThere's really not much bad I can say about the game, and I think it has a lot of potential.  Sadly, this free game is worth more to me than some of the \"cheap as free\" games I've bought in the past (either in a bundle or on sale for 90% off).  It's a fun little strategy game.

You can also set continual pathways so newly spawned ships will move themselves to the battle's front or even circle between planetary systems in a patrol pattern.\n\nRather than gather resources, ships are automatically placed into orbit around planets and moons you control with each territory adding to your fleet maximum.

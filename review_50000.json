Con le frecce si muove la navetta, e con un pulsante si frena. Fine. \nIl resto (la velocit\u00e0, le planate, i rimbalzi, eccetera) \u00e8 dato tutto dalla fisica, e dai numerosi strumenti messi nei vari livelli, che hanno una curva di difficolt\u00e0 ben bilanciata e non risultano quasi mai banali, complici varie trovate (chiavi, interruttori, portali) che di volta in volta li rendono originali.\nHa per\u00f2 due difetti da menzionare:\n\n- il sistema di controllo in generale \u00e8 buono, ma diverse volte la navetta va un po' per conto suo, specialmente nei livelli in cui si cambia la gravit\u00e0 (e i controlli tipo si invertono) o in quelli (tantissimi) in cui bisogna prendere velocit\u00e0 per raggiungere aree lontane. Ecco, provare a controllare una navetta che viaggia a 300 km/h \u00e8 un casino. S\u00ec, poi ci si prende un po' la mano, ma non sono rare le volte in cui comunque si sbatte addosso a un qualche pixel, costringendo a rifare. \n- alcuni dei livelli pi\u00f9 avanzati hanno elementi (palle, soprattutto) da far rimbalzare/rotolare andandoci addosso con la navetta e robe simili, il che va anche bene, peccato che per\u00f2 spesso le palle vadano dove vogliono loro (e qui vi lascio ai doppi sensi). Ok, seguono sempre la fisica ben fatta del gioco, ma la sensazione di avere poco controllo su questi elementi \u00e8 alta, e a volte potrebbe risultare noioso. Fortunatamente i livelli cos\u00ec sono pochi.\n\nPer il resto, il grado di sfida \u00e8 buono, ci sono tanti segreti da scoprire e livelli extra che non sfigurerebbero in Super Meat Boy in quanto a madonne tirate gi\u00f9.

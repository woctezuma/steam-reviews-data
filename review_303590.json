Though half of the modes are barely any fun, the other 3 make up a very fun experience.\n\nYou should play this game with some house rules, since the built-in systems do not support some mandatory stuff.\n\nI recommend the game for the following:\n\nDeath Race: Extremely fun. Everyone is one of the about 20 characters on screen, the other being NPCs. You can only Press A to walk or Y to run and shoot with a crosshair on screen. First to finish wins, but if you are too obvious someone will shoot you and you are out.\n\nHouserule: sadly, the game does not give you the ability to get an extra shot if you actually killed one of your friends. So just set shots to 4, only have everybody shooting once, except they get a player kill, which gives them another one. WAY better that way.\n\nThief Party: Fun overall. There are 2 Teams, thiefs and snipers. the thieves are one of the otherwise NPC characters on the field, about 20. There are coins, which give a sound once a thief walks over it and they disappear a random time after that. Snipers have a crosshair and 3 shots to kill the thieves. You should always play 2 rounds, switching teams on each. The thieves which collect more coins win. If the snipers waste all their shots, the thieves win automatically and a new set of round starts.\n\nAssassins: Same as thief Party basically, but the assassins kill the NPCs instead of collecting coins. Same fun though and still quite different to play out.\n\nThe other gamemodes are quite awful though.\n\nNonetheless: MUST-HAVE. Extremely fun to play.

Hidden in Plain Sight is a collection of five minigames, all of which are best played with four players, right there at in the same room as you. They all insanely fun (Ninja Party is my favourite) and rely on you keeping your cool as others try to reveal and capture you, while at the same time, you're trying to capture everyone else. \n\nNinja Party, for example, has 2-4 players all as identical ninjas, amongst 30 other identical ninjas. Each player must either be the last one standing by eliminating the other players, or by touching 5 statues scattered around the room, which play a sound each time they're touched. Do you run straight for all the statues, aiming for a quick win but putting yourself in danger of being noticed? Or do you wait for an unsuspecting player to set off the statue, and slay them from behind?\n\nThis is one of the most fun, if not THE most fun local multiplayer games I've ever played, hands down. This is what multiplayer gaming was about: having fun with REAL PEOPLE, before it all became about leaderboards and strangers from halfway across the world. People that you know; friends, family, whoever. Anyone can play this game, from your pro MLG 360 noscopers to your filthy pleb casuals.\n\nAnd it's so refreshing to see local multiplayer games make a comeback, even if most of them are indie titles. Hidden in Plain Sight is a prime example of a simple and brilliant idea with simple and brilliant excecution. It doesn't fall prey to other indie game tropes such an annoyingly pretentious storyline or an obsession with \"unique\" and overused gimmicks.\n\nYeah, it might not look a treat, but the graphics really, really don't matter. Same goes for the sound, as most of the time you'll be yelling anyway. The gameplay is incredibly unique, tense, and just insanely fun. It's as simple as that. If you're looking for a local multiplayer game, then buy this. At $5 it's an absolute steal.

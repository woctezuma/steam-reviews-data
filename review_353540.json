There really are very few games like it. Stephen's Sausage Roll is an incredibly polished game. The controls and mechanics are simple, yet allow for an insane amount of variety in puzzle design and playstyle. Each level of the game is challenging in its own way, from the very first level to the last. I beat this game in 21 hours, and never once was I bored. \n\nThe insane thing about Stephen's Sausage roll is the way in which it utilizes its simplistic mechanics. While other puzzle games like Portal and Talos Principle will construct level packs around certain gimmicks (think repulsion gel and turrets), Stephen's Sausage Roll introduces next to no new concepts as time goes on. There are really only four new concepts that get introduced over time, but these concepts are mechanics that already exist with the character. An example of this is walking on sausages. The character has always been able to walk on top of sausages, but this move isn't required to solve any puzzles until the third \"world\". Stephens Sausage roll takes one simple concept of moving sausages onto grills, and really only does that for the entire game.\n\nHowever, this game isn't for everyone. It really is incredibly hard. Thankfully, the game includes a rewind button, so you are never really punished for making a mistake on a puzzle. Other puzzle games would force you to restart where stephen's sausage roll doesn't. If this feature wasn't included, I would have hated the game. The rewind button really allows you to not be afraid to make mistakes.\n\nOverall, I thought the game was really, really, really good.

It eschews graphics, music, and story in favor of difficult puzzle gameplay, and astonishingly, the end result is one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nThough it may start a bit slowly, every time a \"new\" mechanic is presented, it manages to do so in such an innocuous and natural manner that once you understand how the mechanic works, it seems impossible that it wasn't present in previous levels. And that's the real beauty of the game: everything presented WAS in the previous levels, but just slightly past the veil, out of sight. Even in the very final stretch, there are novel presentations of mechanics that aren't present in any of the previous levels. Playing this game feels like watching a magician pull objects out of a hat, or clowns coming out of a clown car; when you think there could not possibly be any more mechanics, it turns around and reveals an entire new category of possibilities.\n\nOverall, the levels are handcrafted to a degree of precision and exactness that I've never seen in any other puzzle game. The controls, though they're pretty clunky, are tightly integrated into the level design. By restricting certain types of movement, the levels are able to have a sort of maze-like progression of moves that can be fully mentally solved before even making a move. It's especially noticeable at the start of the game, where there's also a much smaller margin of error than in later levels.\n\nAn absolute stunning display of game design.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515654346, "timestamp_updated": 1515654346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39186836": {"recommendationid": "39186836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062072422", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 215, "last_played": 1515721076}, "language": "english", "review": "Being honest here, you probably won't like this game. So if the price point is making you second guess purchasing it i'd suggest you skip it... at least until it goes on sale.\n\nEven with that being said, i can whole-heartedly reccommend this game if a brain-teaser type puzzle is what you're looking for. This game is full of small puzzles (and a few intimidatingly large ones) that may have you stumped at first but soon after have you feeling damn clever for figuring them out.\n\nOverall, the most welcome feature in the game is it's simple control scheme.  Using W/A/S/D you can move forward and backward in the direction that you're facing and rotate 90 degrees to face another direction. Outside of that you have 3 other keys that allow you to quit the current puzzle with no penalty, reset the puzzle to start again, and an unlimited undo button that will allow you to undo each move that you've made all the way back to the point where you first boot the game up. But just because the control scheme is simple, that doesn't mean that the gameplay is simple. In fact, one of the first things you'll have to figure out is how to move about the levels effectively. \n\nAnd the simplicity of it all doesn't come without a few surprises. At first it may appear that the only puzzle of the game is to roll and push the sausages around to get them all cooked, but then your fork comes into play more and instead of just pushing them around you have to skewer them too, and now there's ladders too, and you're rolling around on top of a sausage? And how did this sausage end up on my head like that? It's a lot less of new and more complicated features being added, and more of encountering situations which, up until that point, hadn't even come into play. The game isn't teaching you anything new, you just happen to figure it out while looking for a solution.\n\nIf i had to give a comparison to gauge the type of gameplay you can expect from this game, I would compare it to those sliding block puzzles where you have to move all the other blocks around in the grid to get the one target block out of the gate. Its a lot of moving things around and seeing if you're any closer to a solution and slowly undoing your moves to see if you missed something somewhere. It's not \"exciting\" exactly, but it sure is satisfying when the solutions become apparent to you.\n\nAnd as always with cleverly designed puzzles, your difficulty may vary. Some may find a majority of the puzzles simple, others won't be able to make heads or tails of the first collection of puzzle the game offers them. Personally, i felt stumped for a good while before everything started clicking for me, and then a puzzle that i had stepped into earlier which i felt was far too challenging for me to ever complete suddenly became a playground to practice the new assortment of tricks i had learned. And as i rolled that last sausage onto the grill, i wondered why i figured it was too difficult in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1515432306, "timestamp_updated": 1515432306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39122633": {"recommendationid": "39122633", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965308213", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 396, "last_played": 1515369738}, "language": "english", "review": "it took me 37 hours to beat this game\n\nbest puzzle game i have ever played\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515254879, "timestamp_updated": 1515254879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39106063": {"recommendationid": "39106063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111571119", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 170, "last_played": 1515292112}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't buy this game unless you really love puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1515211787, "timestamp_updated": 1515211787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39089347": {"recommendationid": "39089347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234279036", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474639955}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game.

The graphics are extremely blocky and simplistic, the music is mostly procedurally generated and kept in the background, and there's initially very little in terms of story or any sort of context. There's no tutorial to ease new players into the fiendishly difficult puzzles - many people with only a passing interest in the genre will likely quit after seeing just the first few levels. The vague trailer, description and hefty price tag probably don't help either.\n\nStill, once you strip all of that away you're left with one of the best puzzle game experiences available on Steam.\n\nThe basic premise for each level is that there are some sausages, some grills, and armed with your fork you must cook every sausage and return to the start to complete the level. The levels are made of tiles, and sausages are two tiles long, have two sides that require to be cooked, and cannot be overcooked or dropped into the ocean. Every level plays around with this simple premise, and almost all of them manage to introduce a new twist or encourage a different method of thinking - the game has almost no filler or tedium. This applies to the levels themselves: each level is tightly designed such that almost every traversable tile or obstacle carries some significance to the puzzle, and the later puzzles introduce a surprising amount of verticality (the '3D puzzle game' description really doesn't lie). The puzzles start off difficult and only get harder from there - you can expect to spend upwards of an hour trying to solve a single puzzle. In fact, one potential negative may be that some puzzles do appear too early relative to the player's familiarity with the game ([spoiler]one puzzle in world 2 comes to mind[/spoiler]) and may prove extremely intimidating. However, the payoff of figuring out the trick to each puzzle and solving it feels incredibly rewarding, and it does convey a real sense of progression in terms of mastering the mechanics of the game.\n\nAn obvious game to compare this to is The Witness. Past the graphics and exploration aspects (for which The Witness certainly wins), the underlying idea is much the same. Both games don't explicitly reveal anything about their mechanics, instead leaving it to the player to figure the rules out. This concept is as essential to the game as the puzzles themselves, but Stephen's Sausage Roll does this more subtly, only allowing the player to experiment as much as the levels accommodate for it. Unlike The Witness, which have distinct types of line puzzles, it doesn't feel like new mechanics or abilities are outright introduced to the player; rather these abilities are discovered through normal play; sometimes even on accident. It's these discoveries that lead to the most mindblowing moments of the game; it's as though an entirely new layer of the game opens up, presenting multiple avenues for more complexity and teasing many potential applications of these mechanics. There's also the story element that The Witness has taken some flak for - here the story is simpler and told far more directly, but it still manages to be surprisingly endearing [spoiler](and perhaps a little disturbing)[/spoiler].\n\nSo all in all, would I universally recommend this game to everyone? Absolutely not - this is a puzzle game at its purest that would appeal to a very specific niche of players, and you'll need a lot of patience and perseverance to overcome each of its challenges. If you're willing to make that commitment, then Stephen's Sausage Roll is well worth the asking price, and it may well be one of the most rewarding experiences you'll have in a puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1511418609, "timestamp_updated": 1511418609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36930381": {"recommendationid": "36930381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035274163", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511411479}, "language": "english", "review": "Hardest sausage rolling game I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1511411530, "timestamp_updated": 1511411530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36877782": {"recommendationid": "36877782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977919348", "num_games_owned": 805, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495692763}, "language": "english", "review": "The greatest puzzle game ever made.  30+ hours of flawlessly crafted puzzles with simple mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1511398440, "timestamp_updated": 1511398440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36854094": {"recommendationid": "36854094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024380991", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504414240}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely genious.\nAbsolutely infuriating.", "timestamp_created": 1511392972, "timestamp_updated": 1511392972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36829210": {"recommendationid": "36829210", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994410605", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512894741}, "language": "english", "review": "The best puzzle game in years.

Period. (In my opinion, at least). \n\nIf you like fiendish (but 100% fair) puzzle games, this game is definitely for you. There are zero distractions or unnecessary elements in the game and every single block of every single stage has been very deliberately placed to create a marvelous collection of levels. Don't be discouraged by the, admittedly crappy, graphics. The game is just so much more than it seems at first glance (or even at the first hour or so of playthrough), [spoiler]with a buttload of complex mechanics that, however, arise naturally from the gameplay and will make total sense when you encounter them[/spoiler]. Completing even the very first level will make you think you have accomplished something, and that feeling will only get stronger the more you progress through the game. I am fairly experienced with puzzle games, and it took me about 35 hours to complete the game (some hours were lost while playing offline)\n\nIf you like profound puzzle games that will stick with you for a long time, buy this game! (and if you do buy it, for the love of god DO NOT look up the solutions, no matter how long you are stuck on a level!)\n\nA glowing recommendation from me!\n\nPS.

That is, at its core, what Stephen's Sausage Roll is. It starts off simple enough, almost like some mobile game, however even at that early stage many of the puzzles appear to have obvious solutions that just don't [i]quite[/i] work. The second area is where things start to really pick up, and for the first 5 areas, each area introduces another technique for puzzle solving. The neat thing is how these techniques come into play; the second area, for instance, introduces a trick involving an interaction between sausages and walls (I won't go into more detail because it'll spoil the surprise). However, in the first area you would never come upon this trick, as the first area has no walls. Areas 3, 4, and 5 introduce similarly game-changing techniques, giving the player more tools to attack the often fiendish problems the game poses. However, these 5 areas (comprising roughly 2/3 of the game in terms of sausages grilled) serve mainly as a tutorial for the final section of the game, which is filled with puzzles so original they could almost be new games by themselves. This section is reminiscent of the second half of Portal, in that the lines between individual puzzles become more and more blurred.\n\nThere is a narrative of sorts, although much like Portal this only really picks up during the final section, and it never interferes with gameplay in any way. I decided to wait until I finished the game before writing this review, and I'm pleased I did because the ending is both satisfying and conclusive (there are [spoiler]220[/spoiler] sausages in the game). In terms of difficulty i would say it is somewhere around the level of a Zachtronics game, however there's a big difference in style, as the puzzles in those games don't tend to have one intended solution and revolve around system design.\n\nIf you're still wondering about the price, I have two suggestions for you:\n[olist]\n[*] Try to get through the first area within the refund time (should be doable, depends if you're feeling smart) and go to the puzzle in the second area called \"The Tower\" (you'll know it when you see it). This is the first time the game gets really interesting, and should give you a taste of what comes later.\n\n[*] Watch an unedited playthrough ([i] not a walkthrough [/i]) of the first area, where someone figures out how to solve the first set of puzzles. Notice how many times they get fooled into thinking there's an easy option; only to find they've wound up in a dead end, and how even the smallest puzzles require quite complicated solutions. This should help with suggestion (1) if you think you need it, as well as clearly demonstrating the ingenious design of the game.\n[/olist]\nIn my opinion, despite its initial appearance, this is pretty much the best puzzle game there is at the moment, and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

I'm only 1/3 of the way through, and I can unequivocally say it's one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played.  It's also by far the most rewarding!  There is zero extraneous content: it's all puzzles, puzzles and more puzzles.  Puzzles are concentrated in smallish \"islands\" that are fairly compact, so there isn't the running-around-looking-for-more-puzzles issue that makes The Witness a chore at times.  All the puzzles are completely fair; there are no \"environmental\" or meta-puzzles included here (at least, none that I've encountered so far).  And yet, some of the puzzles are so brutal you will be very sorely tempted to look at a walkthrough.  DON'T!  If you do, you will ruin your entire enjoyment of the game.  The essence of the game is trying to solve a puzzle, failing, rewinding, trying again, and over and over until you finally figure out the trick that makes this puzzle doable.  You will be 100% certain over and over again that a particular puzzle is impossible, only to solve it later.  When you do solve a tough puzzle, you will feel like the smartest person alive!  Puzzles don't require brute-force trial and error but rather a way of looking at a situation with fresh eyes to see what you missed the last time.  Although I'm not a mathematician, I imagine that solving an SSR puzzle is a lot like proving a tough theorem, with false starts, lemmas (\"I just need to get this sausage here and then...\") and finally, enlightenment :-)  I woudn't recommend this game to anyone who isn't a hard-core puzzle fanatic, though, or it will drive you crazy.   If you do get it, my advice is to not worry so much about solving the puzzles at first and just concentrate on exploring the possibilities in a particular puzzle.  Sometimes you'll stumble upon the right approach right away, but other times you will beat your head against a particular problem for literally days until you finally get it.   One strategy that has worked well for me is to work backwards.  Imagine what the final configuration of the sausages could be, and then figure out how to get there.  Another tip is that you should try to figure out what every part of the puzzle is there for.  I guarantee that there is nothing in any puzzle that is not necessary, so if there is some unusual part of the puzzle, you can bet that there is a good reason it has to be there.\n\nAlthough this game is agonizing at times, I've never played a game that was better at making me solve problems logically.  If you are a serious puzzle game fan, you absolutely have to play this game.\n\nEDIT: Now I'm about halfway through the fourth world, and I'd like to add another bit of advice.  Sometimes, you get it into your head that a puzzle can only be solved if you get a particular sausage into a particular configuration.  However, a lot of the time there is another way to solve the problem, and if you don't let go of your preconception you will go crazy looking for something that isn't there.  I know this is vague advice but it will make sense when you are banging your head against a hard puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1508815062, "timestamp_updated": 1509338434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35880927": {"recommendationid": "35880927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063712963", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1515491250}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing work of art.", "timestamp_created": 1508561230, "timestamp_updated": 1508561230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35830501": {"recommendationid": "35830501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326873002", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509529723}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u76ca\u667a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u4f46\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u592a\u4e60\u60ef\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bef\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u597d\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u9000\u56de\u4e00\u6b65\u3002\u8c1c\u98988/10\u5206\u3002\u64cd\u4f5c4/10\u5206\u3002\u753b\u97620\u5206\u3002\n\n\u63a8\u8350\u7ed9\u559c\u6b22\u63a8\u7bb1\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1508378301, "timestamp_updated": 1508378301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35752281": {"recommendationid": "35752281", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965390332", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494748234}, "language": "english", "review": "WTF?", "timestamp_created": 1508084937, "timestamp_updated": 1508084937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.133083", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35708065": {"recommendationid": "35708065", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967138500", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507955526}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1507955544, "timestamp_updated": 1507955544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491228", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35668669": {"recommendationid": "35668669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062321405", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503102406}, "language": "english", "review": "The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest of spatial-planning puzzlers.

At least on the puzzle side.]\n\nThis game is a historic achievement in puzzle design.  The ground rules (the physics and the vocabulary of objects) are clear enough from early on, but their ramifications become clear only gradually as more complex situations arise.  The creator wrests a fantastic depth and variety of puzzles out of a simple ruleset, with endlessly surprising and novel solution techniques.  \n\nAs a result of this richness, there are (justifiably) a large number of puzzles.  You'll have to work long and hard to win.  (I think it took even longer than the 48 hours showing on my account, more like 60+.)  I felt there was a slight dip in variety/quality of puzzles in one environment---the animal-themed one---but that section was also easier than the surroundings, so it was a welcome break and not a big deal.  \n\nThe story-telling in this game is done by readable plaques. The story is very sparse and almost completely enigmatic for most of the way through; if you persevere, you'll eventually be rewarded with a final area that delivers a rich and satisfying (though still enigmatic) story.

It took me a good 5 to 10 minutes just to figure out where the first puzzle was.  The first one I happened to encunter had 3 sausages on it and I had no clue what I was supposed to do with them.  Eventually I gave up and found another one with 2 sausages.  Still clueless.  I gave up and found what must be the intended first puzzle, and finally ascertained what you're supposed to do with these sausages.  I then looked around and found each puzzle containing only 1 sausage and was able to complete them.  Then I started looking for the ones that had 2 sausages, and it started to get very frustrating again.  After my first hour, I completed maybe 5 or 6 total puzzles.\n\nThis game does NOT hold your hand, or explain anything to you, and there is only like 3 puzzles that are truly \"beginner\" level.  It ramps up in complexity and difficulty FAST after that.\n\nAt it's root, the puzzles are kind of like those sliding puzles you might have played before, where you need to move pieces around in a confined space, sliding them into empty spaces and pushing them against each other to complete the picture.  Only in this game, as you move the pieces around, there is a mechanic (I don't want to spoil it because I was legitimately shocked and had a \"eureka\" moment when I first discovered what exactly you're even supposed to do!) that \"disables\" your ability to move the pieces in certain ways into certain spaces.  Your movements are therefore more limited than you'd otherwise have in a sliding piece puzzle. So you have to get things lined up and make all the right moves from the very beginning of each puzzle, or else you make it impossible and have to rewind or start over to get it right.  Often you don't know that the move you've just made (could even be the first move in the whole puzzle) makes it impossible to solve, but you don't discover that until 20 moves later that there is no way to complete it, and even then you may do it 20 different ways before realizing that it was that very first move that you were getting wrong all along.\n\nThe game does have a rewind feature to undo moves instead of having to start over, but often it's just easier to completely start over.\n \nThere is a certain logic and tactic to doing these puzzles that my brain just isn't getting.  I struggled intensely to finish the easiest couple of levels in the game, and then hit a total wall and felt angry and feustrated for the next 15 minutes being unable to find another puzzle I could complete.

All of the really brilliant intuitive leaps are trapped beneath a wet blanket of time spent figuring out the particular sequence of moves that you more or less understand - you'll frequently find yourself working through a level, figuring out the \"trick\", and then sighing as you resign yourself to figuring out the particular sequence for the rest of the level.\n\nIt feels like all of the really interesting insights come at the cost of an awful lot of tedium. All of the new and intriguing concepts are stuck behind a lot of sokoban that is not particularly novel or fun.\n\nIf you enjoy sokoban, this game is probably an absolute delight.

I highly doubt it\u2026[/i]\n\n-----------\n\nAs a player, Steven\u2019s Sausage Roll gives me existential crisis (literally not metaphorically), I kept dwelling on the thought of whether would it be possible for me to encounter another puzzle game that\u2019s half as good as this Sausage Roll in the rest of my life, at least in the foreseeable future, the possibility is rather remote. For a puzzle enthusiast, this is really dreadful. \n\nSo here comes the only suggestion this pointless review is gonna offer, to prevent you from making the same mistake as I did: [b]If you do enjoy puzzle games and wish to extend your happy hour with this genre in general, you may want to consider postponing your first contact with Steven\u2019s Sausage Roll indefinitely. [/b] Otherwise, many other puzzle games you used to enjoy would either feel like chewing cardboard or simply child\u2019s play. Embrace Steven\u2019s Sausage Roll only when you\u2019re ready, ready to venture into the end of the world, the end of space and time, that kind of ready.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Steven\u2019s Sausage Roll is the hardest puzzle game I have played, considering how players these days mistakenly value difficulty over quality, especially within the puzzle genre. No, I have played harder ones, but never have played any puzzle this ingeniously and sophisticatedly made. \n\nThus, as a creator myself, I am completely overwhelmed by the shadow it cast. Its total supremacy was like an unspeakable existence that you can never imagine yourself to surpass or even come close with, even exhausted a lifetime of effort. Yet, it still exists there, silently and solemnly, like the Mount Everest, to frustrate you, to defeat you, to deprive you of all hope! And yet in the end, to motivate you\u2026\n\nAnyhow, its otherworldly excellence has far exceeded my verbal skill, I\u2019ll have to conclude this pointless review with this crude statement: \n\n[h1]Does the world need another puzzle game (especially Sokoban-originated ones)?\nNot after this.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1497265620, "timestamp_updated": 1497684091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841169", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32339898": {"recommendationid": "32339898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036228782", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506295488}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game for people that enjoy mulling over logical puzzles.

New mechanics appear organically as a product of messing around and solving each level feels like a victory. \n\nLots of reviews focus on the price, stating that $30 is too high for an indie puzzle game. I bought the game for $10 through a humble bundle and even then I tossed up for a few days as to whether it would be worth it or if I would enjoy the game. SSR was totally worth the money I spent and easily worth $30 asking price. SSR has no levelling, no forraging for items to craft together and no filler components - just pure gameplay. So many games have hours of tutorials, waves of repetitive gameplay, weak endgames or gameplay locked behind DLC. Even The Witness asked the player to traverse a gigantic (admittedly beautiful) island for hours on end in order to find more line puzzles and a clip from a Tarkovsky movie. \n\nPaying $30 is a small tradeoff for such a rewarding gameplay experience.

You do this by moving your avatar, a 1x1x1 person holding a 1x1x1 fork, forwards and backwards and rotating left and right. Despite that description, the control scheme is relative to the player, not the avatar, which was mildly infuriating to me at first but serves to make the mechanics more congruous later on. The game doesn't so much introduce new mechanics to you as much as help you accidentally discover them, and each flows naturally from the base mechanic in such a way that you'll wonder if you didn't already know them and just hadn't had an opportunity to use them yet. All of the levels are intertwined when navigating the world, but when you enter one the rest of the world drops away leaving only the relevant bits.

Long, challenging, and rewarding. You walk around in a small open world and solve puzzles. Introduces new mechanics through discovery. For example, some puzzles are designed so that you'll accidentally notice that you can do something with the sausages even though it's not part of the solution. A few puzzles later, that thing you stumbled upon before will be the main mechanic for a series of puzzles. The game is very hard, but some reviewers and websites try to exagerate the difficulty to be dramatic. The first few puzzles are not that bad despite many people saying you could get stuck and quit on the first puzzle; I don't think that's true at all. A handful of the puzzles later in the game will probably stump you for an 1-3 hours, but the rest you will figure out in 10-30 mins or so. Tons of people seem to think the tower puzzle near the beginning of the game is really hard and maybe a deal breaker or something. It is intimidating, but it's also really obvious what you need to do and you just need to mess around a bit to make it happen. There is a small bit of story to add flavor to what you are doing too. Controls are purposefully weird, but since that type of control is built into the puzzle design, it works. Great game overall, it felt like a great achievement to finally beat it (took me 35 hours).

Here's my comments about the characteristics of the game. And I don't want to spoil anything about the final chapter of the game, after the \"Dead End\" puzzle, which is my favorite. You should feel the same shock with that specific puzzle. \n\n\n- This game features NO TUTORIAL PUZZLES for any of the mechanics. Instead it throws one of the harder puzzles one can make with that mechanics on your face as soon as a new mechanic is introduced. This means every single level is challenging. I mean SUPER DUPER HARD. Sometimes you'll waste more than 30 minutes as soon as entering one puzzle to think about, like, 'Is this possible? Seriously, I don't even see any move I can make.' Especially in the last world. \n\n- Though, all of the mechanisms are surprizingly and EXTREMELY INTUITIVE and doesn't need any further explanations. This is very important and it's the most satisfying point for me. It follows rules of physics very well (but you have to take care of the physics, like the law of action and reaction). \n\n- The game DOES NOT feature any new rule at any instance of the game. It does feature new mechanics for each chapter, but they are not new rules. Like, you are able to walk on the sausages or turn around with a sausage on your head, which is nicely intuitive. But you can't turn around with sausages on your fork or step into midair, rules are never changed or added. Also no new objects are introduced. There are the player character, sausages, solid blocks and grills only. \n\n- Puzzles are excellently designed, every single block (or hole) is there for a reason. Feels like a genious designed the puzzles.  Most of the puzzles make you to think outside of the box. Sometimes you'll find out the puzzle is impossible to solve from your knowledge. Try to do some weird moves, or moves that you thought it sets the puzzle stuck. Furthermore, even if you did come up with the idea, the puzzle remains hard. This is not the kind of the game that you can solve in 1 minute after you find the trick. \n\n- The story was very interesting and fun to me. The story really begins in the last chapter so you don't need to rush. It's simple, weird and satisfying (maybe it's only me). I also love the ending. Yeah. \n\n- You can't redo puzzles you've already solved directly. However you can use 'load game' menu to take yourself to whatever auto-save you want to, so it doesn't matter so much. (Thanks for [SeHa] j0bs of pointing this out)\n\n\n\nAfter all, this is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.

The goal is to cook sausages on the burner. You must cook the sausage once on both sides to complete the level. If you cook them twice or knock the sausage into the water you lose. \n+ \"Undo button\" which allows you to easily traceback your steps without having to restart the level from the beginning.\n+ Very challenging, great for veteran puzzle solvers. One thing that makes the game so hard is that each level is on a very small grid which limits your available moves severely. One wrong move and you will be in deadlock, so you have to carefully plan out each move.\n+ relaxing soundtrack\n+ Just a personal note, but this is one of those game that you have a friend or family member play and laugh at them while they sturggle to get past the first few levels.\n\n- The game is incredibly difficult from start to finish. This may throw off casual players who will likely not finish 5 levels before giving up.\n- I feel like the movement controls could be improved a bit.

It is notorious for being difficult, but while it can take a bit of time to figure out the rules that govern the movement of your character and the sausages (some of these rules feel a bit arbitrary), after you do the difficulty gradient is negative. It felt like the middle of the game was where it peaked in difficulty.\n\nThe game allows you an infinite stack of undos, since it's easy to make a puzzle unsolvable. The best puzzles are those where you really have to use constructive reasoning to rule out sets of possible moves, and there are lots of puzzles like that. For some others the trick is relatively simple and it feels more like trial and error as you try to avoid moving sausages to inaccessible positions, particularly towards the end of the game.\n\nThe level design is consistently creative. Each level feels genuinely different from the last; the game only repeats tricks to introduce new ones. To top it off, each level is integrated into a huge overworld; on activating a puzzle, the unnecessary land drops away and you are left with some sausages to roll and a grill. The overworld is fun to explore, and the freedom to tackle puzzles - within an area - in the order you choose means you can postpone difficult puzzles for later. Without the overworld the game simply wouldn't be as interesting, or as user-friendly.\n\nThe graphics are as you see. Crude, but for a game like this, the most important thing is that it's easy on the eyes. The music is subdued and soothing.

It is 100% created for its mechanics and the way they are incorporated into the staggering amount of puzzles is sheerly baffling. \n\nSomehow each level showcases a new concept. This is an incredbile feat as there are no \"powerups\",\nspecial keyboard prompts or any other standard gaming conventions to promote variety: the sausages, fork and Stephen are all that are needed. \n\nThis game is not for the feint of heart. The begining levels are likely to take upwards of 5 to 10 minutes each to figure out how to properly navigate a perfectly cooked sausage and it is very likely some puzzles will take hours to solve. There is not an unfair puzzle, no red herrings or cheap tricks, just pure rational problem solving.\n\nThe puzzles in this game have two general ways of being solved. The first is organically as you move around the level. Slowly you'll see movements that will get you closer and closer to your goal, its then just up to putting those movements in the correct order. Its a very satisfying feeling slowly building up your understanding of the puzzle until you can see the whole picture and have those tasty sausages pop away. \n\nThe second way problems get solved is by uncovering the underlying mechanics of the game and this is where it truely shines. There are no tutorials to teach you any mechanic other then moving and rewinding mistakes, a flawless mercy that lets you undo any action step by step for as long as the current play session (or if there is another limitation I've never expeienced it after rewinding dozens of minutes away just by holding down a single button). Its so well implimented that you can even undo exiting a level, making sure all those minutes of sausage rolling will never be in vein. Every time you discover a \"new\" mechanic is a moment of awe as your brain tries to process how many new possibilites this new option will provide. Do yourself a favour and never, NEVER, look any puzzle up. There are logical solutions to all of them and you will eventually be able to create it; a moment that will give you pure bliss until the next puzzle.\n\nThe art style at first feels very basic but the more time you spend with this game the more you understand the benefits of its simplicity. Everything has been created to make the best possible puzzle expeience and this art style allows for a clear sense of spacing for all aspects of the level as well as being able to frame most levels so that they fit in one screen. The little details like particle effects on flowers, the day-night cycle, the different sound effects for everything and even the music all show the attention to detail that this game went through. \n\nAll in all this is one of the greatest examples of not only the puzzle genre but of games in general. If more games could treat their mechanics with such care and expand them as far as Stephen's Sausage Roll the industry could only benefit. \n", "timestamp_created": 1486452716, "timestamp_updated": 1486452716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29718710": {"recommendationid": "29718710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068790343", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511693958}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a good game !\nI nearly ignore this game because i found it ugly.

Yeah, it's varied and ingenious every step of the way, it teaches you new mechanics without needing to explicitly tell you them and it makes you think outside the box constantly.

Why can't *I* see it?\" \n\nThe solution (solutions, sometimes) is never obscure, and it never makes you feel like \"oh, how I was I supposed to get that?\" after a level. All the solutions make sense and feel good to execute, leading to such a feeling of satisfaction that SSR should probably be classed as a drug. And like a drug, I got addicted right quick, playing every day and never getting bored of it. The difficulty is very consistent throughout, starting of challenging and gently bobbing up and down, and the way the environment is woven into the puzzle solving is nothing short of mind-blowing.\n\nI'm not going to talk about the mechanics of the game.

Nothing else even comes close.\n\nNot a single puzzle is filler. The difficulty curve is harsh because you're expected to learn fast (though this is not a completely good thing). Every puzzle introduces a new idea. Naturally, some puzzles will turn out to be easier than others, since you'll come across some of these ideas on your own. But you won't come across all of them, and the game will astound you with how much depth its simple set of mechanics holds. Every time you discover something on your own, and you say to yourself, \"Wow, I wonder if there'll be a puzzle that takes advantage of this trick\"? There will. There always will.\n\nNot a single puzzle is cheap. They all stretch your understanding of the world and the mechanics just a little bit, sure, but no big rule is ever introduced without being first shown to you in a safe, straightforward environment. There won't be a mechanics switch in the middle of the game where your expertise in one area of sausage-rolling will become irrelevant. There will be plenty of puzzles where you say \"I think I could make (some situation that I've never seen before) occur. What would happen if I do that?\" and then sometimes, when you do that, you'll find that you've solved the puzzle. Stephen's Sausage Roll does manage to be astonishingly creative in the ways it bends its mechanics, but these ways never really felt very annoying because they were always extremely consistent at their core.\n\nNot a single puzzle is annoying. Once you figure out the core idea, then it's very straightforward to perform the correct set of actions and solve the puzzle. There's no mechanical skill at all. There's no huge puzzle where you have to do ten things in a specific order. There's no irrelevant garbage that will get you stuck looking down an incorrect path. There's an undo button and a restart button, both well-implemented (you can even undo a restart), so making a mistake is okay. The hard part is meant to be figuring out the puzzle, and ONLY that.\n\nAnd finally: not a single puzzle is condescending. They expect a lot from you, and each puzzle is basically the hardest possible puzzle that can be made using its specific idea. Once again, there are zero red herrings in this game, and an idea is never repeated twice. That's pretty damn impressive.\n\nThe game's graphics are blocky and very vibrant, which makes it super easy to see what's going on everywhere. The music is kind of nondescript atmospheric stuff, good for really long stretches of thinking. The sounds are cute and used sparingly and appropriately.\n\nThis game isn't perfect. It's a very linear game towards the end, and frequently you'll have only one puzzle to do. I wish you could take a break from later puzzles and try out other ones when you're stuck. The early game does a much better job of this.\n\nStill, I recommend this game whole-heartedly.

But it's a fair difficulty if you have experience with puzzles. If you don't have prior experience but want a difficult puzzle game you can actually complete, you would be better off playing either English Country Tune or Snakebird first. Go ahead and pick up those two titles first, and complete them. Those are easier than this, but still quite difficult for a first-timer.\n\nNow, a review for those of us who are actually experienced in puzzle games (but somehow haven't bought this?).\n\nStephen's Sausage Roll is a puzzle game that, first and foremost, prides itself on having some of the most ludicrously difficult puzzles, yet having merely a small handful of fairly simple rules. Think Fish Fillets, Hana no Puzzle, and Snakebird. You play as the titular Stephen, who has crashed her ship on the Island of Wisdom and must presumably find her way back home. However, the island is strange; it has sand and grass as you'd expect from an island, but it also has mysterious pink cubes, metal grilles, and ghostly versions of Stephen herself.\n\nOh, and Stephen for some reason holds a giant fork. Don't ask why, because I don't know. Maybe that's her ship's anchor or something.\n\nAt this point, you're probably wondering what the gameplay is like. I understand; the trailer doesn't show anything, you don't want to spoil yourself too much by reading reviews on external sites, but you're not sure if this game really is worth the 23GBP. So I'll say this much:\n\nThe pink cubes are sausages, the metal grilles are grills, and you have to grill each sausage by pushing them onto the grills. Take care not to burn them or lose them in the water. It's like Sokoban, but more difficult due to the giant fork that Stephen's swinging around, making it annoying for her to move. But that's where the \"puzzle\" part of the game comes from.\n\nIt's really not too easy to describe the difficulty of a puzzle, but I'll give it a try; on one level, the obvious path of \"push both sausages together\" ends up burning one of them. Many people get stuck here when they try and push one of the sausages out the way and fail. On another level, there is a moat around the two solitary grills in the centre, and you somehow need to get the sausage over the moat and onto the grill. Then there's the tricksy Clover level, where you think you have the solution, but need to avoid getting trapped. On yet another level, you have to somehow juggle around three sausages on a small island, while making sure that none of them push each other off the island.\n\nMany times, when I've shown the game to my friends, they've all played a level for 15 minutes and simply given up, claiming that the level is impossible.\n\nWell, that's just the first island. The second island unlocks once you've completed all the puzzles in the first island and not before, so if you're not a completionist for puzzles, this game is probably not for you.\n\nIn the second island, there is a new game mechanic introduced; but unlike many other games, this game mechanic had always existed; it was just unapplicable in the first island (no spoilers as to what the mechanic is), and it's at that point that you really gain an appreciation for just how well-designed this game is, if you hadn't already gleaned it from the previous levels.\n\nBasically, what I'm saying is this; if you're not good at puzzles, then your 23GBP would be better spent on The Witness, The Talos Principle, or a combination of cheaper puzzle games; you would probably just get frustrated at this game and refund it after getting stuck on a bunch of levels in the first world. If you're good at puzzles, this should already be in your library, so go play it now.\n\nOh, and don't worry about the infamous \"Tower\" level.

The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.", "timestamp_created": 1479929594, "timestamp_updated": 1479929594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.788261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26598514": {"recommendationid": "26598514", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981185697", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507353549}, "language": "english", "review": "I dream about sausages now.

He'd been touting it as incredible for a while, but in a way that you couldn't quite tell if he was being serious or not. Add to that the fact that all the promotional material out there also makes you question if this is even a real game or not, and it being relatively expensive among its puzzle game peers, I was a bit weary.\nWell, I've just finished playing through the whole thing, and I can tell you it's not a joke at all. In fact, [b]it's the best puzzle game I have played to date, hands down.[/b]\n\nI clocked in just slightly over 40 hours, which should give you an idea of how meaty this game is. The mechanics have so much complexity to them, and the game goes sooo deep in exploring every single little intricacy of them, it's ridiculous. And it does so with the utmost elegance. The amount of times I went to bed in awe of a puzzle I'd solved earlier is so large that I lost count.\n\nOne big thing that is so remarkable about this game is how contextual its mechanics are. In the majority of puzzle games out there you have common game interfaces used as a vehicles to explore unrelated abstract concepts. For example, in Braid you use basic Mario 2D platforming as a vehicle to explore time mechanics. But the time mechanics have no intrinsic logical connection to your little guy jumping around or picking up keys and whatnot. Which is fine, but it's so much more impressive when there is a logical connection.\nIn Stephen's Sausage Roll, just about everything you do makes sense with common real world physics. The way you interact with the sausages and the environment all looks like it should logically work, with few exceptions.\n\nIf you're a puzzle game lover then this is a dream game.\n\nIf you're still unsold, check out the Giant Bomb quick look. It's pretty okay in giving you an idea what it is, and in not giving away spoilers.

There is no form of progression in the game other than moving from one puzzle to the next, and the graphics, music, and story, while fitting for the purpose, are minimal. So, if you require some form of external motivation to stay interested in a puzzle game, I can safely say this game is not for you.\n\nGot that? Good. Now I can talk about why Stephen's Sausage Roll is the greatest puzzle game I've ever played, and what exactly it does that makes it so great.\n\nThe creator of the game, Stephen Lavelle, is no stranger to puzzle games. He has released hundreds of short, experimental games, including many puzzle games, on [url=http://www.increpare.com/]his website[/url] for free. He also released a previous commercial puzzle game, English Country Tune, which is available on Steam. He even created an open-source puzzle game engine called PuzzleScript, which many other game developers have used to create simple web-based puzzle games. But it's clear that Stephen's Sausage Roll is his most ambitious project to date.\n\nAt first, it seems ridiculous that this game could have possibly been four years in the making. When you first boot up the game, you are greeted by a silly menu theme and a title screen that looks like it was made in 15 minutes in Photoshop, complete with stock fonts. Combined with the absurd topic of the game (who in their right mind would make a game about [i]sausages[/i]?), you might begin to suspect that the entire game and its surrounding praise is just an elaborate inside joke if you didn't know better. But as soon as you create your save file and enter the overworld map, you begin to realize what makes this game special.\n\nThe first aspect of the game that immediately strikes you is the player character's movement. The only keys used for movement are the arrow keys, but it as not as simple as a press on one of those keys creating a movement in that direction. Your character wields a giant fork as big as the character itself, and while it is invaluable in helping push sausages around, it also restricts the ways that you can move. If you want to move in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction that your fork is pointing towards, you first have to rotate your fork so that the fork is now parallel to the direction you want to move in. At first, this system can feel clunky and frustrating, and simply entering the puzzles on the map may prove to be a challenge, as you have to align yourself and your fork with the ghosts on the map in order to enter the corresponding puzzle. After a while, though, the movement system begins to feel natural, and you get to appreciate the depth that this system allows for.\n\nWhen you do manage to enter a puzzle and the surrounding terrain falls away to leave room for the level, you realize the second aspect of the game that stands out: that it's really, really, hard. The goal of each puzzle is simply to grill each sausage on the level to perfection, with no square inch of the sausage raw or burnt. A sausage takes up an area of 2 by 1 tiles, with each tile of the sausage having a top and bottom that can be grilled separately for a total of 4 cookable segments. The sausages can be grilled on the various grill tiles in the level, and each segment must touch the grill tile only once in order for it to be perfectly cooked. Despite the simplicity of these rules (which are actually not even stated in the game, you would normally have to figure them out through trial and error), the puzzles that are created with them are fiendishly difficult. It is all too easy to accidentally push a sausage into the surrounding water when trying to move, burn a sausage by moving it in a direction you shouldn't have, or get yourself in a situation where it is impossible to progress because you placed a sausage in a location where you can't retrieve it. You mercifully get unlimited undos to reverse any mistakes you made, but oftentimes the biggest challenge is figuring out how to get the sausages to the grills in the first place, and that is where the game's design comes into its own.\n\nStephen's Sausage Roll descends from an old Japanese computer game called Sokoban, which literally means \"warehouse keeper\". In Sokoban, you have to push crates onto their required target locations to complete each level, similarly to how you push sausages onto grills in Stephen's Sausage Roll. Despite this heritage, Stephen's Sausage Roll plays very differently from Sokoban. Sokoban's levels are highly claustrophobic due to their narrow corridors and the inability to push more than one crate at once. By contrast, Stephen's Sausage Roll's levels tend to have few walls, and you are able to push more than one sausage at once. More importantly, though, while Sokoban's challenge tends to come from figuring out the exact sequence of pushes required to complete the level, Stephen's Sausage Roll's challenge comes from figuring out a broader concept that arises from the game's mechanics.\n\nStephen's Sausage Roll only introduces new gameplay elements once per world, and the new gameplay elements feel like a natural consequence of the existing ruleset rather than something that was added because the existing puzzles were getting boring. For example, the second world introduces walls that you can stab sausages against, allowing for a new method of transporting them that helps get them out of sticky situations, but also prevents you from rotating your fork. The third world explores the consequences of adding a third dimension to the game, letting you roll on sausages by getting on top of them and letting you stack sausages on top of each other, but also introducing three-dimensional obstacles that are even more fiendish than the ones before. Despite the simplicity of these additions, the different challenges and strategies that they allow for are vast, and the possibilities are always fully explored before adding another mechanic to the game.\n\nAs of this writing, the game costs a full thirty US dollars, so some might be worried about the amount of content that you get for the price. Fortunately, there are many hours of enjoyment you can get out of the game. I like to think that I'm pretty good at puzzle games, and it took me 32 hours to finish every puzzle in the game. That's less than a dollar per hour, which is a very good value proposition for anybody who enjoys their time with puzzle games. There are actually only 86 puzzles in the game, which doesn't seem like a lot, but that only speaks to how well-crafted the puzzles in the game are. There are no 'filler' puzzles that are just basic applications of principles that you already knew, and puzzles aren't wasted to teach you those principles without providing a significant challenge, either. Every single puzzle will give you that 'aha!' moment that is the joy of all puzzle game fans.\n\nIn conclusion: if you enjoy puzzle games, then Stephen's Sausage Roll is a must-play. The puzzles may be very difficult, but if you persist long enough to solve them on your own, the feeling of satisfaction you'll get from them is unrivaled. And for those who think games today are too dumbed down: this is probably the least dumb game you'll ever play.

It is much harder for starters and has a minimalistic story. Some might say it has no story at all. I would disagree, but go into it knowing that you might find nothing more than hours worth of difficult brain teasers. \n\nIf you don't like puzzle games, don't buy it. If you don't have money, wait until it is on sale. However, I will say that personally, this was completely worth the price.\n", "timestamp_created": 1467433360, "timestamp_updated": 1467433360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23985725": {"recommendationid": "23985725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188557619", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467938341}, "language": "english", "review": "Great puzzle game.

Every little detail is put in place with great care and has a purpose to it, so much so that you can complete solution through thinking about and finding out what those details mean and where they would play a roll. Many of the levels seem pretty hard or even impossible at first, but the game lets you trust it -- it wouldn't be in the game if it were impossible. \n\nNo new mechanic is added throughout the game, yet the game constantly surprises you with its already rich mechanics, every substantial aspect of which plays some roll somewhere in this game. All of the mechanics are intuitive and none of them are abstract, they all connect together and except for one, none of them is independent from the rest. \n\nThe game frequently drives you to a state where you have to doubt everything you trusted and reconsider everything you ruled out. Many levels need not only one but several moments of epiphany, some of which wouldn't even be needed in the particular level you reach them in, but are a natural result of the interaction between your mind and the level. It takes your mind so deep in the universe of ideas and possibilities that you forget the simplest of actions once you have the solution. \n\nStephen's Sausage Roll is probably the best puzzle game ever made and it's a treasure full of awe. It doesn't try to deceive or distract you through fancy narrative and graphics. There is no hand-holding, no tutorial, no easy levels to make you feel you're making progress. It doesn't waste your time, yet there is more than enough time to be spent solving all the puzzles. It's filled with as much precious content as possible.

It's a\"block moving\" game and a premium-priced indie. It's also flat-out amazing.\n\nIn SSR, you guide the player around an over-world with nodes representing discreet puzzles. When you land on one, the world drops away into a smaller puzzle area. There you're tasked with sliding and rolling raw sausages around the board in an attempt to grill both sides evenly via the strategically placed hot grill tiles embedded in the ground. Roll a cooked side of the sausage over the grill again and it's burned...game over. Roll it off the level and it's game over. The puzzles are ingenious. The puzzles are challenging. The puzzles are addictive.\n\nSSR sports a raw, minimalist asthetic with vibrant, morphing colors and an abstract soundtrack. It looks rough in stills, but is absolutely charming in motion. Controlling your character is strange, as it doesn't adhere to traditional tank controls as you might imagine. Instead movement is absolutely relative to the direction your pointing in. There's a learning curve, but it comes together and makes sense when you start to understand the finesse needed to \"thread the needle\" around sausages and environmental obstacles.\n\nAs mentioned, the game is challenging as hell. Even from the start. One nice related feature is the ability to take back moves, one at a time with the Z key. Even after a level fail (rolling sausages into the water / burning sausages) you can execute this option, alleviating frustration when you're stringing together moves to set up a level clear.\n\nI think SSR looks incredible. It absolutely nails the low-fi aesthetic. Nails it to the wall.  All you have to do is look at the Game Over screen to recognize this is all intentional.  Just look at that font! If someone didn't legitimately have the talent to pull off successful visual design, there's no way they'd out themselves by choosing that font style. It takes confidence and deliberate intent to visually create something on the level of Stephen's Sausage Roll.\n\nReviews are saying there's a TON of content on offer here. 30+ hours of evolving mechanics that keep the game fresh with new ideas even late game. Still, a $30 asking price for a game that looks like an itch.io project might be a bridge to far for many. Totally understandable. I opted in after reading some rave reviews coupled with the praise heaped on it from the puzzler dev community itself. Jonathan Blow (Braid / The Witness) described SSR as, \"one of the best puzzle games ever made, or one of the best video games ever made\u201d\n\nSo I held my breath and dropped $30 on the game. I'm REALLY glad I did as it's pressing all the right buttons for me. I went to bed thinking about game tactics and solutions. I woke up and got ready for my day thinking about tactics and solutions.

Will update upon finishing it. Seems people are reporting an average of 35 to even 60 hour play times if that is of interest though. \n\nSo far it's great, I absolutely love it. As many people have already said, the design is where it shines. The game never tells you what or how to do anything. You begin pushing and rolling sausages to fully cook them around and while it seems like a simple premise, you are constantly learning new things and playing the game in a much different way than you were before so it never feels repetitive. Often I get stuck and then realize, \"Oh wow I can do that?\" While being designed in a way where I naturally stumbled upon it by trying things that seemed possible. I have never thought, \"Oh how was I suppose to think of that?\" You can undo every move you make too so trying new things is encouraged. \n\nBut don't be fooled by its funny name or silly premise. This is one of the hardest puzzle games out there. Think of something like Snakebird, another extremely hard game that looks all cute and innocent on the outside. So don't complain when you get stuck within the first 10 minutes of the game. (Of course I also still have much left to do so it's just going to get even more difficult. Though I look forward to it).  \n\nI can see why Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness) has cited this game as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Alexander Bruce (Antichamber) has given the game high praise as well. \n\nThe developer Increpare has created English Country Tune and a multitude of other small little games. Games I would also recommend checking out. He's mostly known among devs and people who actually watch out for these lesser known titles.

I think that the core gameplay mechanics are fun and interesting. The window dressing is fantastic- talking about rolling sausages and grilling them is worth a laugh by itself. The puzzles are simply sublimely designed and make use of every single bit of sausage-rolling complexity the game's ruleset has to offer.\n\nAll of this is a shame because the game is so relentless in its difficulty that it ruins the whole experience. The puzzles start at a pretty good level of challenge- you might not understand all of the rules and strategies quite yet, but the scope of each discrete puzzle is small enough that you quickly figure out strategies and work toward a solution. You'll eventually solve each of the puzzles in the first area and move onto the second, where the puzzles follow a similar formula and scope. All of this is fine until you reach The Great Tower- a Jenga-stacked tower of 8 sausages that represents the game's first difficulty wall. Suddenly, you can no longer solve a puzzle through simple trial and error- you need to develop a plan of experimentation and strategy of attack to even begin to understand the scope of the puzzle.\n\nProvided you do in fact grill all of the sausages that compose The Great Tower, you will find that it isn't simply a one-off \"boss fight\" of sorts- this is your new sausage grilling reality, as numerous puzzles in the next area follow its newfound scope. And that's basically where I draw the line! I like puzzle games, but the level of difficulty here moves from simple brain-teasers and logic exercises to full-fledged logistic projects in their complexity. It also feels that as the game goes on it loses a bit of its focus- instead of each puzzle tightly focusing on a mechanic, much of the later puzzles require long strings of execution and moves. It no longer gives you that \"a-ha\" moment without lengthy experimentation. It's simply too much work and effort for anybody but die-hards.\n\nUltimately- although I really do like the game's ideas, I really don't think that I could recommend it to anybody.", "timestamp_created": 1461624622, "timestamp_updated": 1464374067, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691665", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22625117": {"recommendationid": "22625117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054854533", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468129721}, "language": "english", "review": "Calling this the \"Dark Souls of puzzle games\" is a fucking understatement.

I'm not particularly a fan of Sokoban style puzzle games, and Stephen's Sausage Roll is like a Sokoban style puzzle on steroids. \n\nI will say that the puzzle design in this game is mind blowingly brilliant. I don't understand how someone creates this many variations of puzzles all with their own concepts behind the solution.

I more or less blew through the first set of puzzles, never really getting stuck on one for too long. They were challenging, but rewarding rather than frustrating.

This is the best puzzle game. Every individual puzzle is just so damn clever, no two puzzles are alike, and there are SO many puzzles. If you enjoy puzzles, you will like this game.\n\nThe difficulty comes because no two puzzles are solved in the same way. The game's mechanics are the same from the start until the end, involving rolling sausages and walking around, but each puzzle puts you in a scenario where you have to use the same old mechanics in a novel way.\n\nUsually, this is difficult because you didn't understand certain consequences of how the mechanics work. But once you flail around for a while and solve a puzzle, the consequences were clearly logical: how could you not have thought of that? Argh, it was right there.\n\nThis makes the puzzles feel straightforward and more importantly fair, even though solving them may be a struggle. There is no busywork of pushing around boring things that don't matter to the main idea of the puzzle. When you get an idea for how to solve a puzzle, it's quick to see whether it works. When you get the right idea, you KNOW it works, because the puzzles don't have unrelated filler and they're easy to think about. So the problem just becomes having the right idea, which is a LOT of fun if you like puzzles.\n\nI don't think most people are going to complete the first area in the 2-hour refund time. I certainly didn't. That's a shame, because although the first area's puzzles are good for what they are, and are necessary to teach how the game works, they are probably the weakest part of the game. As you learn things about how the game works, the puzzles keep getting better and better until the end. It's an extremely impressive body of work.\n\nThere is also an engaging story, which was pretty surprising! It starts off extremely vague, but later in the game there's more story text between every one or two puzzles. Getting more of the story was a good motivation for solving some more puzzles.\n\nI really liked this game.

I've noticed that a lot of commenters in the discussion feel like the positive reviews aren't helpful, so instead of just getting all poetic about how awesome this game is, I'm going to try to be a little more concrete.\n\n1. This is a game for puzzle-game lovers. If you're not into puzzle games, it isn't going to thrill you. If you love puzzle games, but aren't super into Sokoban-style games (like me), you are going to end up surprised by how much you love this. It's basically Sokoban-like, but it takes the concept to a whole new level. I will try to be specific:\n\na) The sausage fork is both a tool and a handicap. As a tool, it allows you to push sausages in directions other than straight ahead (and do other things I won't spoil). As a handicap, it constrains how you can situate yourself to push sausages.\n\nb) A sausage itself has two sides, and each push (with exceptions I won't spoil) rolls it to the other side. This creates extra constraints when trying to grill each side only once. Sausages are also two tiles long, which creates extra constraints based on both orientation (vertical or horizontal) and grilling all four parts of the sausage.\n\nThese additions to the basic Sokoban-like mechanic result in a very large design space for difficult and epiphany-producing puzzles. Great puzzle games are about two things: constraints and topography. SSR hits a sweet-spot (or a spicy-spot if that's your preferred sauage type) for a simple system of rules that produces a wealth of complexity.\n\nBut a wealth of complexity doesn't automatically result in a great puzzle game. There also needs to be a great designer who mines that huge space of possibilities for the most devilish ideas and unintuitive twists. And this is what's getting SSR so much critical praise. The levels are designed for maximum epiphany and minimum repetition of tricks. It's a subtle kind of novelty, but every puzzle gives you something new.\n\n2. Can you discover how awesome SSR is within the refund period? Possibly. If you do two or three puzzles on the second island and your mind isn't blown, though, it might just not be your thing. My particular mind was blown pretty early on. I found myself skipping puzzles and then solving them on a background thread as I was driving somewhere. That's a pretty sublime feeling. Another sublime feeling is the sense that a puzzle is simply impossible, follwed by the discovery of a solution. This has happened to me constantly while playing SSR.\n\n3. The art style. I see people calling it \"simplistic\" and \"primitive\", which I think misunderstands it a little, because it implies that it's unintentional or the result of inability. My sense is that the game looks the way the person who made it wants it to look. Part of the fun of the game is the campiness. If it were logs or plain cylinders instead of sausages, it wouldn't be as endearing. And if the world and its sausages were rendered more realistically, I don't even know what I'd think. It would probably be creepy. Again, though -- if the art style isn't to your taste, then it will probably detract from the enjoyment for you.\n\n4. The price. I write games myself, so I'm probably biased, but I really like seeing indie games being priced higher than a crappy Domino's pizza. I don't know how many hours it will take me to finish the game, but I've seen people with over 30 hours in it who aren't done yet. A buck an hour doesn't seem like a lot to me, when I often spend twice that rate for a 45-minute TV show. I can understand not wanting to spend that much, but I don't really get why people feel offended by it. It's a market. The seller sets a price and people either buy it or don't. It ends up being either a good decision or a bad one, and that's pretty much that.\n\nSummary: I love puzzle games as much or more than I love sausages, and this is likely to be one of my favorite games of all times.

Unlike other Sokoban-like puzzle games, I feel like I could solve almost every puzzle I've played so far a second time without having too much trouble, and every puzzle has felt different. The puzzles in this game are about understanding what your options are, and they all feel much more open than other box pushing games. This means that you can't brute force a solution, but it also means that you're more open to experiment with the mechanics (which you'll have to do a lot). After every puzzle I felt like I understood the game better for having solved it, even if only a little bit. I encourage anyone who likes puzzle games, or even those who just enjoy thinking, to try this game.\n\nEDIT: I just beat the game and I feel like I should add a few things, although I promise to keep it spoiler free. Firstly, The ending to the game is very poetic and almost entirely satisfying. To explain it any further would be a disservice to Stephen's work, so you'll just have to see it for yourself. I can say, however, that it was a perfect way to end the game.\n\nSecondly, the amount of thought and planning that must've gone into this game as a whole more than justifies the asking price, and if you count the time I spent think about the puzzles outside of playing the game it come out to about 2 days worth of \"play\" time. Although I may have gotten stumped a few times I always managed to find a solution with relative ease the next day, usually by considering an entirely different angle to approach the problem from. \n\nAlso, the slow reveal of new mechanics was paced perfectly. One in particular Was so unexpected and mind blowing that I had to undo my moves and watch it happen a second time just to comprehend what had happened. I you thought this game was simple then you are sorely mistaken.\n\nOverall, I have to say that this game is easily the best puzzle game I've ever played in my entire life. I've heard this called the Dark Souls of puzzle games, but I think it'd be more accurate to call it the Citizen Kane of puzzle games instead.\n\nStephen Lavelle, you are truly a master fo your craft!", "timestamp_created": 1461136785, "timestamp_updated": 1462048622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22528485": {"recommendationid": "22528485", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997908353", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492365061}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a series of puzzle games out there which need no description.

The original review can be found below, for transparency.\n\nI had originally purchased the game on launch day, played for just shy of 2 hours, and then refunded. My main problem with the game is that it is just too expensive. I still do feel this way, to a large extent. I mean its an indie puzzle game for christs sake. But its a damn good one, too.\n\nAfter I refunded, the game stayed in my mind. I checked regularly for sales, but nothing. Not even the summer 2016 sale, so I repurchased. I'm really not happy about the price, but I want to experience more of this game. Its good. The puzzles are very rewarding, and quite addictive. So far I don't find it crazy difficult. Its got a nice balance that way.\n\nThe whole thing is just dripping with hand-crafted goodness. Thats the thing, really. The other thing is that if you look at the devs history, he has put out so many free games that maybe its ok to ask a lot for something you dumped many years of your life into. I don't know. Its not charity at all - its great artwork and it has value. I mean you can say a lot of negative things about the price, but one thing you can't say is that its a cash-grab. Its just not.\n\nAnyways, thanks everyone for reading and voting on the original review - I appreciate it. \n\n[b]My bit of advice is to get the game ONLY if you aren't going to be bitter and jaded about losing thirty bucks. It is definately better than [i]The Witness[/i], and is one of the better puzzle games I've played this year, for whatever thats worth.[/b]\n\nPeace,\n\n\n---\n\n[i]Original review is everything below:[/i]\nAlright, this game put me in a tricky spot for two reasons listed here:\n[i]\n1. After nearly two days since release (4/19/16), the store page and reviews really give me nothing other than 1] \"play this game its great - trust in increpare\", and 2] its worth $30.\n\n2. Being just within the two hour refund limit, I see nothing special. [/i]\n\nThe game is not terrible by a long-shot, in fact, its better than [i]The Witness[/i] as far as I've played both. The problem is that the price is just nuts - and it's all on the promise that at some point I will be utterly mesmerized and hooked. Unfortunately that feeling is apparently beyond the refund limit for me. [b] I also firmly believe that games of this nature should probably give me more feels within two hours of playing.[/b]\n\n[b]No hate intended towards the game - but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.[/b] With that being said, I don't care to lose $30 on it when refunds are an option.\n\n---\nOnto the review, proper:\n\n[i]Essentially, given very basic mechanics and rule set, you push sausages onto coals in order to cook them.[/i] Cook the same spot more than once and its burned, start over. Lose a sausage in the water, start over. Its tricky, but doable (at least first 15 or so sausages in early puzzles). Music is nothing special. Graphics are nice, but also, nothing to win an award or anything. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Controls are decent, and there is controller support.\n+The puzzle mechanic is fine, and is certainly better than something you would find on a free flash site/NewGrounds/etc. (I say this because others have criticized that its in the same ballpark).\n\n[b]Meh:[/b]\n[strike]=Idea and game mechanic are hardly new.[/strike] -I've changed my mind on this one\n=Music is meh.\n=Graphics are nice, if not a tad muddy.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Very pricey. I appreciate that there is a lot of content, though.\n-Not that addictive inwards of the first two hours of play for me.\n\n[b]I think this game would be a total thumb's-up at like 50% of the price, or something.[/b] I thought this game was for me, and I was wrong. I also tried watching some LetsPlays before I purchased (at the risk of seeing spoilers), but as others have mentioned - the videos are not that informative because its the personal 'aha' moments that get you coming back for more. I had none of those moments in the nearly two hours I played, and maybe another hour I read and watched LetsPlay videos.\n\nPeace,\n\n[i]Final edit: My play time rang in around eighty-some minutes. I found that as I was playing, towards the end, I was getting nervous of running over. I realise I had another solid half hour or so, but it was telling that I kept checking. I'll stand by my judgement that I saw enough and made the call to refund before getting too close.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1461094783, "timestamp_updated": 1466966267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558774", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22519118": {"recommendationid": "22519118", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998549658", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508205287}, "language": "english", "review": "this is exactly like dark souls except instead of a sword you get a fork and instead of dragons there is sausage\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1461085720, "timestamp_updated": 1461085720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22515541": {"recommendationid": "22515541", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984731710", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490839211}, "language": "english", "review": "The opinion of people you don't know on the internet is kind of a useless rubric, but I'm enjoying this game!

I foresee this being a brutal blocker if a puzzle is giving me a lot of trouble...\n- The music is good, but a little too... experimental/serialist at times?

The first difficulty is that it is a puzzle game and, as such, its core virtues are in its mechanics and in its level design. The second difficulty is that discovering the mechanics is an integral part of the game so keeping things spoiler free without being vague is tough. Let's try though.\n\n\nThe incredible elegance of Stephen's Sausage Roll comes from the fact that from the very start of the game to its very end all the rules of the world are there, but the complexity and richness of the rule set are only unveiled little by little, because new puzzles offer the potential for new situations where new rules are discovered (and are often needed to solve the puzzle). To make an analogy, if you are able to walk on water but are in a desert, you can't know you have this ability. So Increpare would make you start in the desert, then later would put water in a level that would at first feel impossible until you realize you can in fact walk on water.\n\nMy analogy is not very good, because the beauty of this game's design is that, more often than not, it's not the apparition of a new component that allows a new rule to be discovered, it's using new configurations of known elements. Also the abilities and rules you discover do not come out of left field, they make sense and if they might be a little too surprising, levels are carefully designed (with funnels or bread crumbs) to guide you toward their discovery. Something that works with my analogy though is that an alarmingly high number of levels will at first make you believe they are impossible to solve. I can't tell you the number of times I discovered a new level only to mutter (or shout...) \"What???? How???\"\n\nWhile I am slowly running out of superlatives, it is also important to note the game manages the feat to be both very long and very dense. Those familiar with Increpare's other puzzle games, be it the number of free games on the puzzlescript platform he created or his previous commercial product, English Country Tune (also highly recommended), know his aversion for fluff such as mundane tutorial levels, so these sausages are pure meat from the get go. There is no such thing as a level that does not bring something new to the table in form of an original challenge, so solving any single puzzle is extremely satisfying. Reaching this point is the fruit of a strenuous work of distillation that lasted years with dozens and dozens of levels that got discarded and all the rest going through multiple iterations and fine tuning to be sure that, as often as possible, they provide challenge the whole way through their resolution.\n\nTo give a sense of the scope of the game, I played through the final build in about eighteen hours, while I knew just about all the mechanics and had played most of the levels in an earlier build a year or so ago, so I would expect people new to the game to easily go past the 30 hours mark. It is important to note because, at $29, the price can feel pretty steep for an indie puzzle game, but that's probably less than $1 per hour of pure gameplay and level design meat. Another way to look at it is that it is without a doubt the cheapest masterclass in puzzle design money can buy!\n\nWith this package also comes a thin and strange narrative that works hand in hand with the structure of the game, and an aesthetic which at first seems a bit crude and rudimentary, but really grows on you with its surprising care to details such as weather effects, day/night cycles and a soundscape periodically haunted by some minimalist musical tracks. It should also be mentioned that the control of the character takes a little time getting used to, but pretty quick it becomes apparent as to why it is the way it is.

Stephen's Sausage Roll is one of the most carefully designed games I've had the pleasure of playing. It's also one of the most challenging puzzle games I've ever played.\n\nYou begin shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Your only tool is a strange fork and all you can do is move forward, backward, and rotate. You're given very little information, but you'll soon find yourself in one of the game's devious puzzles. Your goal? To roll sausages over to the grill tiles placed on the floor and cook them. That's it. SSR forgoes complex mechanics seen in other puzzle games for simplicity and elegance. You may not see how you can use your limited moveset to accomplish what you want, but there is always a way.\n\nAesthetically, Stephen's Sausage Roll is a succulent treat. Colorful low-fi visuals, soothing accompaniment, a day and night cycle, and an overall tranquil atmosphere. There's also some cryptic story to be uncovered in notes you'll find throughout the island.\n\nNow, as I said before, this game is hard. The puzzle-solving is based on experimentation and your familiarity with the (sometimes hidden) mechanics. Luckily the game is very forgiving in this regard. You're given access to a variety of puzzles at the start of each area and you have unlimited undos available for when you mess up (and this will happen).

Unlike basically every other puzzle game, it asks you to solve a new deep problem on every single level. There's very little emphasis on forward planning, and puzzles are compact but impossible to brute-force. It starts as a soko-ban-like game, but quickly unfolds into something much more ambitious. It's incredibly tough but never in an unfair or arbitrary way, and by the end of the game (40-80 hours I would say) you feel an incredible sense of expertise. \n", "timestamp_created": 1460987317, "timestamp_updated": 1460987317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22497484": {"recommendationid": "22497484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029022097", "num_games_owned": 652, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460983736}, "language": "english", "review": "Just played the first few levels, so take this with a huge grain of salt as I literally just started it.

However, the difficulty in controls were very well integrated into the (excellent) level design and game mechanics, creating some extremely devious challenges. If you want to sink your teeth into a puzzle game, this will give you a lot more meat than you can chew.\n\nWord of caution though, the base mechanic does revolve around \"pushing blocks\" (or sausages in this case) and its not too far off from other similar games like Sokoban.

That is entirely up to you, in regards of how much you value challenge in your puzzle games.\n\nI love challenging puzzle games and I am looking forward to biting into this eventually when I have more time for it, but I appreciate new ideas more than I do just challenges, and going back in time, based on what I played so far, I would not recommend myself to buy it at 30$.", "timestamp_created": 1460983643, "timestamp_updated": 1460983643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525878", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22497348": {"recommendationid": "22497348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010659090", "num_games_owned": 492, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487178317}, "language": "english", "review": "I bet you are wondering what this game is actually like to play and whether it's worth your money.

It doesn't explain anything to you, it doesn't hold your hand but let's you just go about your thing.

Let me just state that I I am avid flight sim fan, so flying games appeal to me. This is unique ittle gem. If you are coming with FS background, the whole abstract graphics might be a bit of a turn off - fear not, this is a wonderful flight sim game. There are two modes more casual arcade mode and more of a sim. Keep in mind this is not your Falcon or DCS, but this game provides you with a pure joy of flight. YOu will not regret it - buy it even for the full price. Devs are activly suporting this game.\n\nNow about VR aspect - I am fairly new to VR - got RIft back in December 2017. This game helped me get over my motion sickness. I had fairly sever case whereas I was not able to do any VR motion for more then few minutes. Repeated short exposure in Ultrawings eventually got me over the hump and now I can enjoy ANY VR motion for the duration of my gaming session - from an hour and longer without any issues. This is reason alone to get this game. I recommend this game wholeheartedly! \n\nThe game offer number of simply missions that get more complex and challenging as you prohress. With each completed mission you earn cash that allows you to unlock additional planes - starting with ultralight, jet powered glider and finally a sports plane resembling Extra 300. All three planes are different experience and even after you unlock the new planes, the old ones are still joy to fly. \n\nDevelopers - consider adding multiplayer for Ultrawings 2 - yeah, there's gotta be Ultrawings 2 - please make it so! Let us support your efforts - release DLCs - more islands, additional planes, maybe a helicopter or gyrocopter?

Both the Vive and the Rift offer up a quality flight-sim experience that perfectly balances arcade and simulation with a seemingly endless array of challenges that will keep you playing for countless hours. I found the Oculus with the Touch controllers delivered the most immersive and comfortable experience; at least from a control standpoint where you can either using your hand to actually grip a virtual stick to fly your aircraft, or just use the analog sticks on the Touch. Gripping the virtual stick offers up a more realistic experience within the game at the expense of the strain and soreness of having your hand extended for long periods of time holding onto nothing.   There is also an option for a gamepad on PC, but this offers the least impressive experience; especially in later levels when you are trying to take photos and shoot balloons. Vive controllers offer the same virtual hands as the Touch but the triggers become painful to squeeze for long periods of play and the orientation in which you hold them don\u2019t feel natural. Additionally, the rudder controls on Vive are overly sensitive due to apparent lack of true analog input.\n\nOnce in the air there is so much to experience and accomplish based on the job you\u2019ve selected from the computer terminal in airport offices located on several lush tropical islands. As you complete jobs you\u2019ll earn money to purchase new aircraft and buy new airports on other islands, all of which keeps adding to the job listings and your piggy bank. Jobs come in several categories. There are the typical target ring courses that reward you for speed and accuracy, as well as a fun photo mode where you have to find specific landmarks and take a photo with your tablet device. There is a balloon pop mode where you fly with one hand and aim a pistol with the other to shoot colorful balloons scattered around the islands within a time limit, and perhaps the most challenging mode; precision landing where you have to stall, and land your plane with almost zero airspeed to drop onto a ringed target. Or you can just lose yourself in countless hours of exploration and free flight\u2026at least until you run out of fuel.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Ultrawings is the comfort level; especially on the PC version, which I played for six hours straight with no issues other than a sweaty forehead. You can kick back in a recliner and play this game forever. The framerate is fluid and the draw distance is impressive with only some minor pixel stair-stepping on distant lines.   The draw distance is surprisingly good, and there are nice touches of environmental detail such as other aircraft, boats, and even some cars. The N64-esque landscape itself is intentionally simple, which keeps the game both charming and fun as well as maximizing the framerate. The most complex model in the game is your plane and its functional instrument panel. One of the more impressive details on the PC were these flocks of birds that would swarm around the various island bluffs in realistic patterns, but the most impressive detail on the PC for me was the real-time shadows of the plane\u2019s wing and canopy frame that would slowly drift across my cockpit and controls as my course changed in relation to the sun. I could even lean forward and see smudges and scratches on the Plexiglas panels of my cockpit.\n\nUltrawings is an amazing VR flight game that will delight the entire family. They even have these charming crash visuals of you either floating through stars or underwater bubbles depending on how you crash, followed by an obituary on your office computer when you restart. Motion sickness is of limited concern unless you play for extended hours, which is easy to do because of the progressive and addictive challenges that continually fuel your desire to keep playing and see what\u2019s next.   I would have enjoyed more islands and planes or maybe even a hang glider mode that uses thermal updrafts around those island spires and bluffs, but that is only because I love this game so much.  For $25, you get plenty of gameplay and entertainment value.\n\nTo sum it up, Oculus Rift is a near-perfect experience in presentation, controls, and gameplay as long as you are using the Touch. The Vive is a close second with only the awkward motion control wands creating some painful issues during extended play.   No matter which VR system you own, Ultrawings is a must-play game that totally delivers the thrill and sensation of flight in a way only VR can do.\n\nFor the FULL review including PSVR comparisons visit http://gamechronicles.com/video-games/ultrawings-review-rift-vive-psvr/\n", "timestamp_created": 1515279933, "timestamp_updated": 1515279933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39108610": {"recommendationid": "39108610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384127453", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "last_played": 1516356808}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a big fan of Pilot wing on snes for the time it came out and this is like reliving it only way better!\nMay have cartoon graphics but it seems like really being in the air this game really nails it.", "timestamp_created": 1515220207, "timestamp_updated": 1515220207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39094726": {"recommendationid": "39094726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038577529", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 254, "last_played": 1515928233}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is very fun and nice to play if you just want to chill out.

You'll end up with some serious tendonitis if you play long enough. \nThe control scheme is purely setup for the oculus touch controllers, which results in an incredibly painfgull and frustrating user experience.\nYou have to continuously press the trigger of your Vive controller to hold on to the yoke. That  seems okay, until you fly for more than 5mn, basically death-gripping your controller while it vibrates nastily in a random fashion. As the orientation of the *VIVE* controller is not natural for a plane joystick and due to the fact that you are holding \"air\" you will end up contorting your wrist in some hideous and painfull ways whilst  moving your chair backward in order to be able to pull the joystick somehow.\nAdd to that the fact that the developer, in his wisdom, decided to ignore analog inputs for the rudder (at least on the Vive controllers ... I guess the mini joystick on the touch works analoguously in this game), which means that controlling the yaw of the aircraft requires you to press the left or right side of your touchpad to apply *always full* rudder.\n\nAnother (very big) publisher got flak from Oculus owners because their game was advertised as \"Vive Only\", not because it wouldn't work on an Oculus CV1 but because the controls were designed for the Vive Controller. I'd suggest the publisher of Ultrawings does the same and removes the Vive from the supported devices, until Vive owners can actually play this game in a correct fashion.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514932939, "timestamp_updated": 1514932939, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567530", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1514939003, "developer_response": "Two things:\n\n1) We are implementing toggle grab in the next patch.  \n\n2) Rudder percentage scales based on where you push your thumb on the trackpad."}, "38942673": {"recommendationid": "38942673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176808819", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514824035}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to get into flight sims.

I'm loving this game so far, very reminiscent of Wii Sports Resort (which is based off Pilot Wings 64). Flying is very fun, no nausia or acrophobia. The progression is very fun and satisfying, though it can be harsh at points. You get money from completing 2-5 minute missions, and you get medal for you performance. Roughly, Gold = Perfect, Silver = 99-75%, Bronze 74-0%. Just missing gold and getting silver means reciving 50% less pay, which can be very frustrating to just miss that last ring and get $3000 instead of $6000.  \n  \nAlso, while I do love this game, I wish there was more islands to explore and more planes to unlock. One of the most fun part of Wii Sport Resorts flying was the amount of exploration, paths to follow that had meaning-full ends. This game lacks this. There needs to be more reward for exploration, wether it be through money or through interesting points. This could be partially becuase Nintendo made the island for more than just flying, but honestly I wouldn't mind this dev making a full on Wii Sports Resort ispired game for VR, I'd pay $30-$40 for that.  \n  \nOverall I love this game and would reccomend this to anyone with VR.

There is also the option to play in either arcade or simulator mode, arcade being easier to control and more bearable for those who may get nauseous while simulator mode makes the plane react much more realistically while banking and using the rudder.\n As far as content goes you start on a small island with an ultralight and have to earn money by comleting a variety of challenges to be able to purchase new islands and new aircraft. The challenges seem interesting, but nothing too exciting as of yet so in my opinion this game is more for the casual flyer. \n  My only gripe would be the lack of input support, I don't mind using the vive controllers for most of the controls, but I'd love to hook up some pedals since it can get a little awkward using the touchpad while trying to steer. \n  All around I love the game and would love to see it get some new content, a mutliplayer mode would be an amazing addition whether that be racing through rings or dare I say it, a dogfight mode ;)", "timestamp_created": 1511643983, "timestamp_updated": 1511644582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37061649": {"recommendationid": "37061649", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998242775", "num_games_owned": 759, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514038683}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u826f\u3044\u70b9\uff1a\nVTOL VR\u3088\u308a\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u64cd\u7e26\u611f\u304c\u5473\u308f\u3048\u308b\n\uff13\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u3068\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306b\u5e7e\u3064\u304b\u306e\u30ab\u30c6\u30b4\u30ea\u306b\u5206\u304b\u308c\u305f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\n\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u306f10\u6642\u9593\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306f\u3042\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3002\n\n\u60aa\u3044\u70b9\uff1a\n\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30ac\u30f3\u306e\u9283\u6483\u306f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u306b\u96e3\u6709\u308a\n\u7740\u9678\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u8a55\u4fa1\u304c\u7dba\u9e97\u306b\u7740\u9678\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\n\u3069\u771f\u3093\u4e2d\u306b\u982d\u304b\u3089\u7a81\u3063\u8fbc\u3080\u306e\u304c\u63a8\u5968\u3055\u308c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u30b2\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3044\u304b\u304c\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304b\n\n\n\u4eca\u5f8c\u306b\u671f\u5f85\uff1a\n\u6d77\u306b\u70b9\u5728\u3059\u308b\u5cf6\u304c\u821e\u53f0\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306b\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u72ed\u304f\u3001\n\u666f\u8272\u306e\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u304c\u6d77\u306a\u306e\u304c\u3082\u3063\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3044\nDLC\u304b\u7d9a\u7de8\u3067\u96ea\u5c71\u3084\u30c8\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u6f5c\u308a\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30b7\u30c1\u30e5\u30a8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044", "timestamp_created": 1511443503, "timestamp_updated": 1511443503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36385667": {"recommendationid": "36385667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030519086", "num_games_owned": 731, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511707284}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant title - a real feeling of freedom as i'm buzzing around the skies and pulling off stupid stunts - simple controls and i'm all the more thankful for it - in no time I was wizzing through the startup process like a pro :D  And as everyone has said totally hits that Pilotwings itch!

The game's atmosphere is relaxing, and has an in depth and colorful cartoony world to explore. There are 3 different aircraft to choose from, and a number of islands with different geographies. The game consists of a decent difficulty curve, a simple economic and progression system, and dozens of challenges, from the relaxing to the hair raising.\n\nIf you are interested in learning how to fly, but know LITERALLY NOTHING about flight, then pick up this game. Despite its arcadey feel, the flight models of the 3 aircraft are surprisingly realistic... There are 2 flight models; \"Arcade\", and \"Simulator\"... I highly recommend that, regardless of how new you are to flight, that you switch it to simulator immediately. You can learn actual basic flying skills from this game, but you'll only pick those skills up if you start off with the simulator flight model right off the bat. The arcade one will only teach you bad habits... Also, the simulator model lets you push the plane closer to its limits, meaning you're more likely to get better scores on the challenges if you master it.\n\nThe flight models feel right. The ultralight, even right down to a tendency to side slip, the glider feels like a glider, soaring on practically nothing for quite a while, and the sports plane feels like a sports plane... Twitchy as all hell, and prone to stalling and flat spins.\n\nEach one teaches you new skills. The ultralight is an introduction to basic flight, and is so easy to fly, you're have to TRY to crash it. The glider teaches extreme power and speed management (it's rocket powered, but only fires in bursts, and has extremely little fuel) as well as unpowered landings, and the sports plane teaches the importance of fine controls, and feeling a stall before it occurs.\n\nI'd honestly probably use this game as a teaching tool before moving someone on to more realistic flight sims like Microsoft X. The great advantage of this game is that it was built from the ground up for use with VR, while flight sims like X-Plane and Microsoft X only have VERY clunky and glitchy paid mods for VR support. There NEEDS to be a new training sim dedicated to VR, but until that sim comes, this is pretty much the closest (besides DCS and WT, but those are combat games).\n\nThe 8 hours I spent was a joy, and I plan on palying much more of it... That being said, it is not a perfect game. This is where my criticisms come in.\n\nFirstly, this game only relies on touch controls for controlling the aircraft. I found a post on here of one of the devs stating that they weren't going to introduce joystick and hotas support because it would be a UI nightmare. I can see where they're coming from, but honestly, it's a NECESSITY. Yes, it's a UI nightmare for you, but if you take on the challenge of coding that, it saves the PLAYER of the nightmare of trying to control an aircraft with touch controllers.\n\nI've seen this problem in the Microsoft X paid VR mod as well. Sure, the idea of using touch controllers to grab a virtual yoke, and interact with the cockpit sounds nice IN THEORY, but it rarely works out, and instead usually just detracts from the experience. For myself, I had difficulty even grabbing the stick because my sensors can't see very well below keyboard level. And the complete and total lack of feeling an actual stick made it hard to fly by muscle memory. I'd be rotating the touch controller to the left, but instead the plane would roll right because my hand was on the right. It's hard to tell when you're even successfully grabbing the control stick because it's all VR... There's nothing there TO grab.\n\nThere is an alternative. You can simply resort to using the thumb sticks, as I did... Flying a plane with thumbsticks just isn't natural. It's why I hate flying in console games. In fact, using the left thumb stick is actually required in this game, as it's the only way to control yaw. And these thumbsticks have a very large deadzone as well, making the planes twitchy to fly this way... This isn't a problem for the glider or ultralight as they're pretty chill, but it became a BIG problem when I first started flying the sports plane. That thing is twitchy enough as it is. With it, I NEED the sensitivity that the big deadzone takes away from me... Not that thumbsticks are very sensitive to begin with. Problems get worse when there are moments you're actually required to use the touch control scheme for certain things. You still need to physically grab the throttle, and you have to use the touch control on the stick to take pictures and fire at balloons in certain mission. So it becomes awkward switching back and forth from using thumbsticks to make a 180 turn, and then grabbing the stick for an attack run. I can't make my own key bindings, I can't change the stick sensitivity or deadzone... This isn't just stuff any flight sim would have, this is stuff most GAMES have. And don't get me wrong, I get it, VR UIs are REALLY hard to do compared to the normal UIs you see in video games. But it's NEEDED. Touch controllers are in their infancy. This is the first generation that I know of that not only detect the location of your hands, but also what gesture they're making. It's amazing technology, it truly is... But it's inconsistent and clunky. Half the time the controller loses connection, and next thing you know, the plane rolls over and crashes. It's obnoxious to keep my finger pointed 24/7 to push the rocket button in the glider during a hair-raising, corner-cutting race, only to be distracted by the fact that the button isn't registering my movement, or because I keep accidently flicking the magneto switch when I go to push the button.\n\n... It's CLUNKY. When I crash, or fail a challenge, I want it to be because I am the one who failed... Not because my stupid Occulus controllers are practically prototypes. Touch controllers are nice, but they only work well in very specific circumstances, like in horror games, or those cheesy room scale games like job simulator... It simply doesn't work where vehicle controls are involved. For a racing VR game, I'd rather have pedals and a logitech steering wheel. For flight VR games, I'd rather have my logitech extreme 3D pro. These things offer me the real world tactile feedback I NEED to fly and drive well. Without them, the gameplay suddenly becomes frustrating.\n\nThis is all a major problem of VR in general, not just this game. That being said, there is one thing the devs of this game could do to alleviate this problem for their game in particular: introduce Hotas and joystick support, with remappable options... That would make this game literally 10 times better than it already is. It would make it a far more useful educational tool as well. And there's a very simple and easy way to avoid most of the \"UI nightmare\": Start the game in a launcher window. Make it so that the game's settings are only accessible through this really simple 2D launcher. Here, players can go through, set up their joystick or hotas the way they like, and then launch the game when they're ready. There. That solves most of the problem of implementing a key binding UI in a VR environment. I am litterally on my hands and knees begging you to add this right now. It would make the game far more accessible to the demographic most likely to buy this game: Flight sim buffs. Put in the effort now to implement better joystick and hotas support, and you'll be rewarded with sales.\n\nBesides that, most of the issues I take with the game are nit picks. Bugs that are obviously going to eventually get worked out (like my issue with the glider's nose wheel steering control being inverted for no apparent reason).

Very slow response to input.  The second is nausea.  Caution if you get any nausea with other \"motion\" games.

The nausea has worn off, and this really is a fun and immersive game.  Got to the rocket glider.  I can \"feel\" the power.

I've gotten as far as the 2nd unlockable plane (the jet glider). I'm warming up to the mechanics after completing the license challenges but it has its charm.\n\nThe sound design is really good. The two voice actors are pleasant and inject a bit of playful charm into the mission briefings and I love the little buzz of the ultralight engine and the little bit of satisfaction you get when you ease back the throttle and settle in for a cruise. The rocket glider makes me feel like a kerbal when i hit the engine start button, i almost wish it had a flippy cover you had to lift over and rather than a push button it was a big thing you slammed your fist onto. At the moment, with the vive controllers i can find the button press a little... finnicky. Not fun killingly so though.\n\nI almost wish there was an in-between from the ultralight to the glider. I could have helped do some low swoops/crop dusting, or some showy fly-by/low passes on the boating people down below, that would have been a nice little interlude between the balloon popping and photo missions - that being said, the photo missions are a LOT of fun.\n\nA friend of mine is a flight sim fan and I can't wait to get his opinion.

The immersion level in that respect is amazing.\n\nThe graphics how ever are very bare bones. In fact if you were not playing this in VR it feels like a game you may have played back in the late 90s. If it only looked nicer it could have really sucked me in more.\n\nThat aside the controls on the planes are great and its one of the best examples to show some one of what it feels like to fly in a VR game. There is a good amount of content and things to do in the game . Picked it up on sale for $12 and was well worth it. Only bug i have run into is the achievements are glitched and wont unlock.", "timestamp_created": 1516639943, "timestamp_updated": 1516639943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 139, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 146}}

Do you wish to indulge in the fantasy of interacting with [b]LIVE HUMAN BEINGS[/b] but through the safety of a virtual medium? Then look no further, this game is for you poor, poor, lonely soul. [strike]oh wait thats me[/strike]\n\nNow I realize this sounds like every [strike]animu porno plot[/strike] [B]INTERACTIVE JAPANESE NOVEL[/B] on Steam ever but trust me on this one, this ain't nothin' like that. Why [i]yes[/i] you are going around, hunting down people like their Pokemon tossing all sorts of sh*t to befriend them, but the game takes a fairly \"realistic\" approach to this. Sure, while you do end up actually befriending some people, (whatever that is.) such is not always the case. Some characters begrudgingly add you to your friend list just to stop you from bothering them anymore. Not to mention they still act like total assh*les to you even after befriending them. Considering how many supposedly \"anti-social\" VN protagonists are actually charismatic gods, this MC is a weird fellow and acts like the part. So yeah, if you're concerned that this is yet another game where everyone worships the MC at the end, fear not, there will be people who are either merely putting up with him or outright dislike him even though they're supposedly \"friends.\"  \n\nWhile the subplots are good, the process of unlocking them can be a tad tedious. Not too much to be a major flaw  but still annoying. For one, you need to buy items that specific character likes (Though if you're lazy you can totally brute force it by just using the cheapest item on everyone.) which costs bits. These can only be earned by [strike]streaming[/strike] playing either Puyo Puyo or Tetris. While these minigames are fun (No sh*t it's f*cking Tetris/Puyo Puyo.) it does disrupt the flow of narrative quite drastically. Running out of bits means the player has to stop whatever they were doing and spend time playing minigames they might not actually enjoy. Or perhaps enjoy but dislike due to the fact they are forced to play it to make any further progress. Now of course, the devs were wise enough to consider this and gives the player an option to get 999999 bits right from the start. Unfortunately, this option is hidden away (in the bottom right corner of the room where you buy stuff.) without any hints to it's existence...at least none I'm aware of. This could be chalked up to me just being dumb and not noticing it and if so, then I'll drop this point completely. Another quality of life issue would be being able to buy items directly from the inventory screen instead of having to backtrack constantly. \n\nBut all the above is mere nitpicking, the game overall is an excellent experience well worth your time. Interesting character designs, endearing characters, a nice soundtrack (Ah one last nitpick: I would recommend not having a vocal track during sequences that require deep thought e.g: the discussion/talking segment. While nice, the lyrics end up being a distraction to the player. Though perhaps it's just me...) and an intriguing story all make up for a great game.\n\nI highly recommend this game! \n\ntl;dr IZ GUD.", "timestamp_created": 1513068435, "timestamp_updated": 1513068583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580420", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38116793": {"recommendationid": "38116793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096487071", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504132262}, "language": "english", "review": "im gay now", "timestamp_created": 1512607220, "timestamp_updated": 1512607220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539924", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38105129": {"recommendationid": "38105129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198438055010", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512019796}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u627f\u8ba4\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u662f\u770b\u5230\u7acb\u7ed8\u753b\u98ce\u5f88\u5408\u80c3\u53e3\u624d\u4e70\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u5267\u60c5\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u6e10\u6e10\u53d1\u73b0774\u90a3\u79cd\u521a\u51fa\u751f\u7684\u5c0f\u732b\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u6027\u683c\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u2026\u2026\u53ef\u80fd\u4e5f\u662f\u548c\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u70b9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5427\uff0c\u603b\u4e4b\u4eba\u8bbe\u771f\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\uff01\n\n\u4ece\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u6545\u4e8b\u6027\u7b49\u5404\u65b9\u9762\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c1 bit Heart\u7edd\u5bf9\u7b97\u5f97\u4e0aADV\u4e2d\u4e00\u6d41\u7684\u6c34\u51c6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5404\u79cd\u6807\u65b0\u7acb\u5f02\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u7b97\u4e0d\u4e0a\u975e\u5e38\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5bf9\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u5f88\u6210\u529f\u7684\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\u5173\u4e8eBGM\u7684\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u7a0d\u5fae\u6709\u70b9\u7ea0\u7ed3\u7684\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f88\u591a\u4eba\u90fd\u5bf9\u914d\u4e50\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u53ef\u5426\u8ba4\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u8fc7\u6e21\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u7565\u663e\u524d\u536b\u7684BGM\u4f1a\u7a0d\u5fae\u6709\u4e9b\u7a81\u5140\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u4ece\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u4e0e\u5feb\u8282\u594f\u548c\u4eba\u60c5\u6de1\u6f20\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u76f8\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u8865\u8db3\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7565\u663e\u8584\u5f31\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\u5b9e\u5728\u4e0d\u592a\u597d\u8bf4\u3002\n\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u7a0d\u5fae\u5410\u69fd\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u793e\u6050\u52a0\u6291\u90c1\u60a3\u8005\u8868\u793a\u4ea4\u670b\u53cb\u771f\u7684\u597d\u96be\ud83d\ude32\n\u6700\u540e\u7684\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8d81\u5176\u4e0d\u5907\u8d76\u7d27\u62b1\u8d70774\uff5e\u8bf7\u6536\u4e0b\u6211\u768415\u9897\u5fc3\u2299\u03c9\u2299", "timestamp_created": 1512572142, "timestamp_updated": 1512662625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38006924": {"recommendationid": "38006924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191268594", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512387054}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.

The low price tag certainly nets you more than you can buy, and then some.\n\nFirst off, the story: Nanase Yoshi, a fourteen-year-old boy who goes by the moniker \"Nanashi\", is a reclusive, yet outwardly cheerful shut-in during a time period where technology has advanced rapidly. One day, he discovers a girl fast asleep in his bed who, when woken up, proclaims she has lost her memories.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nDespite the use of cliches, the game doesn't feel stale. The story itself is, admittedly, not the most complex or thought-provoking story of all time, and there are certainly better ones out there, but it doesn't make any glaring flaws that turn someone off from playing the game entirely, unless you're a temporal scientist, theorist or fanatic. The characters, both main and side, are all certainly quirky and enjoyable to watch as your cast stumbles through a rather slipshod plot, and there are some genuinely funny moments that you'll grin at, as well as some surprisingly philosophical rhetoric that you wouldn't expect.\n\nHowever, know that, in my opinion, the story and plot is perhaps the weakest portion of this game, and not something you should be expecting a whole lot out of. (Though that's not to discount the entire writing at all; there are certainly some better parts than others and it's still worth reading.)\n\nNext, the gameplay; the game plays out like Danganronpa; using information you've received from the story to find holes in someone else's story and progress forwards afterwards. As a big danganronpa fan myself, this was a very welcomed way to progress, and it, for the most part, was smooth and intuitive, though admittedly sometimes it wasn't very mentally stimulating due to either A: being too easy to deduce, or B: being too *hard* to deduce. There were definitely a few kinks in the system (particularly the discrepancy between \"present a topic\" and \"hold a sec!\"), but those are fairly easy to pick around and ignore afterwards.\n\nNow, that isn't the only part of the game. The second portion of the game is Making Friends. Surprisingly uncommon and inane, but nevertheless decently executed. The friend system works like Danganronpa as well: give a character a gift and, if enough gifts are received, a scenario will play out between Nanashi and whichever Side Character you've chosen to befriend. Eventually, at the end of a short side-story, Nanashi befriends the character and goes on his merry way.\n\nAdmittedly, this portion of the game could've been done better and had more effort put into it. The characters, while quirky and all (okay, maybe mostly depending on how you enjoy characters) lovable and appealing, lack a major impact on the plot, and, if it weren't for some factors affected by your friend count, could very well be erased from the game entirely. The sidequest storylines were rather unfulfilling, and it certainly made me wish that these side characters received more screen time, writing and character depth (though with an impressive number of side characters, that may be a feat in and of itself). However, the characters are still, for the most part, fun to interact with (for the limited amount of conversation they have with Nanashi)\n\n(and a bonus nitpick from me: You buy the gifts on Nanashi's computer in his bedroom, and you get \"bits\" (the currency) from playing the games on the console in the middle. I either missed this explanation or the game lacked it entirely, and I didn't learn of this until the final chapter)\n\nFinally, the visual presentation of this game. One of the best parts of the game without a doubt, and where miwashiba shines. The artwork is, simply put, stunning to look at. The colour palettes are extremely easy and enticing to the eyes, the sprite work is very well made, and the character designs are all extremely appealing, all of which are very typical of miwashiba. Admittedly, some of the backgrounds can be a bit simple, but the minimalistic feel doesn't necessarily detract from the overall presentation, and it feels complete. On a plus, the voice lines (while in japanese) are pleasant to hear, though admittedly you won't hear much of it.\n\nOh, and did I ever mention the music? The music in this game is amazing.\n\nAll in all, 1bitheart is definitely a game that's worth picking up for the amount of money that it costs (especially when it goes on sale), and I wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\n++PROS++\nStellar visual presentation\nSmooth, simple and intuitive gameplay\nAmazing music.\nLikable characters.\nMore content than expected for the price tag\n\n--CONS--\nSlipshod storyline\nLack of side-character interaction/depth\nSlightly unintuitive game choices", "timestamp_created": 1511481774, "timestamp_updated": 1511481808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37212514": {"recommendationid": "37212514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047782085", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511473412}, "language": "english", "review": "A great fun adventure of making friends in a world of advanced technology!

Sora. Sora's story was so sad, and made me want to be his friend more, after all, who could say no to that sweet boy. Sure he becomes a big ole tsundere dork when you try to be friends, but he means well and seems to be just self-defensive. After you become friends he seems to have opened up more, and gets really defensive if you give him a Love Chocolate. \n\nNio, Sora, and Nanashi (Both Forms) are my top favorites, These children are ones I can relate to deeply, I act happy and polite to people, like how Nio does. I get defensive and think somethings a joke when someone shows me a form of affection that I am not used to, like Sora. And I'm willing to change myself to help others, even if its in a situation I've never been in before, like Nanashi (I can proudly say I've never choked out my future self, though if I did, that would be pretty Epic.)\n\nIn the end, I highly reccomend this game, and hope whomever buys it, is ready to be absorbed by it and sending mass amounts of pictures to your friends of all the characters you love.", "timestamp_created": 1511309122, "timestamp_updated": 1511309140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36680275": {"recommendationid": "36680275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025400295", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511661594}, "language": "english", "review": "Welcome to Friendmaking Simulator 2017!\n\nPros\n+ Detective elements are well-crafted and interesting\n+ Well-developed world\n+ Interesting and entertaining variety of characters\n+ LOVED the artstyle\n+ Most of the soundtrack is great\n\nCons:\n- GUESS I'LL JUST GO WHERE THE BUS DRIVER GOES\n\nProtip: One can only play tetris for so long, and I have too many [b][i]FRIENDS[/i][/b] to buy stuff for.

It is extremely repetitive and loud.  I played most of the game on mute, tbh.\n-Occasional translation problems, but this would probably only bother people who are really finicky.\n-Elements of the story were predictable, specifically the two 'twists'.\n\nIf you like plot-heavy and conversation-based stories, then I would highly recomment this little gem.

The logic sections aren't very intuitive, sometimes you have to click things at random to discover whether they are what the characters are ready to discuss, or if you have to allow them to keep talking for a few more cycles before introducing the information. They do give you the option to play with additional hints, which I opted out of, but they may be necessary. Additionally, while befriending all the characters is fun, I was at a loss with how to figure out which gifts they might like the most. Maybe for some there were clues in talking to them, but I honestly had to look up a guide, which I feel takes a little bit out of the genuine experience of talking to a character and being able to discover things about them before initiating friendship events. Those issues I would say are just a rough design, not really anything that makes it unplayable or unsatisfying. My smallest complaint is the music ... some tracks were fitting, others were really odd and ruined the tone of the dialogue with certain characters - but that's just a personal issue, some may enjoy the music. That aside, I enjoyed the plot - it runs like a visual novel with just enough interactive portions to keep the player engaged, which can be difficult to do.

It was very fun to read through it all and piece it all together.\nI loved the storyline in general, too. It was beautiful. I'm still trying to classify if the normal ending is actually better than the bad ending, they were both completely shocking... But the good ending made me cry. It was amazing, and hit kinda hard considering how much I feel I relate to Nanashi.\nThe art was so bright and happy! I loved the character designs and stuff. They were all adorable.\nAND THE MUSIC. I listen to the ost on youtube all the time, it's freakin amazing. One of my favorites is the theme that plays in Cocoa Alley. During the game, when I had to go somewhere I would pass through Cocoa Alley just to hear the song. There's also one called Big Plans Remix that plays when you talk to Misane sometimes.

Alicemare & LiEAT were really interesting games, especially the second one. It was a pleasure to see that Ib, or One Shot mood in it. That's my personnal favorite genre. But I wasn't really moved by them. And then, one week ago, I received 1bitheart. I heard that it was the last work of \u25b3\u25cb\u25a1\u00d7 (Miwashiba), and it's a wonderful masterpiece. I never excepted to be that moved by that game. It can talk about pretty serious topics but never in a depressing way, it's really powerful. Plus, the fights of the game are conversations and, as the main protagonist, I'm really bad at it ahah ! XD There's that Phoenix Right vibe on it. Chara-design is truly wonderful, every person that you meet, even if there's a lot of them throught the chapters are just so colorful and their backround is interesting, unique for every one of them. You just can't forget them during the gameplay. There's a true effort on the music too like, since last week from today I'm just listening to the OST, they're all so catchy ! There's not a single that you cannot like in my opinion. They perfectly describe every mood, situation in the game, and help you to love every single character that you see. It's also the first time that I can hear some voice acting in a \u25b3\u25cb\u25a1\u00d7 (Miwashiba) game. And what a wonderful acting :D \nXD I swear, I'm searching for bad points but there's just none of them ! \nI won't spoil the story but, as a very silent person, probably suffering of mutism in the past that also have to analyse and calculate what to say in every conversation, that hero really touched me. The fact that making the effort to talk to other people can bring you happiness & wonderful friendship in the end is not something as natural as some people can think. And, without spoiling it, the differents endings are showing this in a pretty intelligent way. You're not obligated to have people by your side but, during hard moments, it can make a great difference. \n\nAnyway, I finished it 100% in one week.

Mientras que en algunos  aspectos segu\u00ed con la misma opini\u00f3n de hace a\u00f1os, otras por el contrario cambiaron totalmente.\n\nPositivas:\n*La historia principal es divertida, siempre saltaremos de una conversaci\u00f3n a otra donde tendremos que usar informaci\u00f3n que vamos recolectando para conseguir aun m\u00e1s, contradecir o argumentar sobre alguna ilegalidad.\n*Como en los otros juegos del autor, pos\u00e9 una est\u00e9tica hermosa que va muy acorde con la positividad y alegr\u00eda que hay en ese mundo\n*Amplia variedad sonora,  si bien hay algunas que son \u201croyalty free\u201d la mayor\u00eda sigue siendo original del juego, y vaya que hay una gran variedad, lastimosamente mis canciones favoritas suenan 1 vez cada una, pero supongo que es cuesti\u00f3n de gustos.\n *Cuenta con voice acting, que aunque  no me gusta que hablen en japon\u00e9s sigue siendo un plus que algunos pueden disfrutar\n*Tiene un mensaje bastante fuerte y obvio, realmente se me hace dif\u00edcil que alguien no pueda identificarlo al final\n*Referencias a una gran cantidad de videojuegos y pel\u00edculas, hay una gran mayor\u00eda que no entend\u00ed, quiz\u00e1s porque la traducci\u00f3n no pudo ser exacta, o quiz\u00e1s porque sea relacionado con la cultura japonesa, pero bueno est\u00e1n. Me gustar\u00eda resaltar que hacen una referencia a fucking Sharknado \n\nNegativas:\n*Di\u00e1logos o incluso personajes muy infantiles o comentarios muy \u201cdulces\u201d, entiendo que eso es parte de la atmosfera pero tanto en abundancia logra que partes sentimentales no provoquen casi ning\u00fan efecto.\n*Plot holes, si bien entiendo que era necesario que haya uno, no quita el hecho que no tenga ning\u00fan sentido.\n*\u00bfTe gusta jugar al tetris? \u00bfNo?

It's definately up there in my top 10, maybe even #1 by pure merit of how it emotionally helped me in so many ways.\n\nThis game is essentially danganronpa without death, with the funnyness of ace attourney, and style of TWEWY. The art in this is GORGEOUS. And the seiyuu's are pretty good. Most of the music is creative commons, but that ending theme original song is a bop. If you enjoy light feel good games with an interesting plot, futuristic game settings, RPGMaker-esque games, and any of the above mentioned games, then I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy in this game. Get your tissues ready for that ending, you'll be crying. Good tears.\n\nOh you can also play doctor mario and tetris knockoffs if thats your jam.\n\nPro's:\n+Emotional story about a boy opening up to others and coming to love himself\n+Fun colorful characters to get close to, all having events to get to know better\n+Catchy music and beautiful artwork\n+Multiple Endings connected to the amount of friends you have\n+Extra epilogue for more content\n\nCons: \n-Most characters outside of the main group don't get much screentime or development\n-Friend events feel too fast and easy\n-grinding for bits without the cheat takes too

So, i update it a little bit, and give it a thumbs up.\nIf you like playing VN, there's high chance you will like this game. But, if you new to this medium probably you'll end up hating it.\n\nPros :\n- Tons of lovable character with marvelous design\n- Great and cozy music\n- The music is really good, really-really good (except the song after good end).\n- Its so damn good that i need to write it again.\n- It's free (you can buy it here if you want to support the maker)\n\nCons :\n- Some of the villain is poorly written\n- The DLC (soundtrack) is mp3 format 128 kbps, nani the fukk?\n- Some of the VA is kinda meh, but its understandable since they are newbie/hobbyist\n\nI will look forward too the next and last(?) game from miwashiba, 1Beat\u2665.

That\u2019s the main gameplay element. It may seem boring, but the story prevents that from being too repetitive. Sometimes (at the important events) there are an action called \"Talking Time\", where you have to use your logic, and get the facts together. They are somewhat challenging, you need to pay attention. (if you enable tips, it will be easier, and i really recommend it, otherwise it can be frustrating.) The characters are unique, you wont get bored quickly, while trying to befriend them.\n\nThe music is really cool, and wont get boring.

Now that it's on steam, I purchased it immediately! Miwashiba makes a great game about making friends and adventure!\n\nIf you like games where you get to meet an interesting cast of characters, listen to cute music from the web, and playing tetris for money, this is the game for you! Takes place in a cute futuristic set of towns, each with their own flavor and style.\n\nI think it's 5/5 and shouldn't take too much of your time (unless you spend a huge amount of time on the Tetris part haha). It's a straightforward and really cute game and well worth your time.\n\nLike I said, bought on steam to support the dev, so only 5 minutes played so I could review it, but this game took me about 22 hours. probably something like 15 hours of Tetris and 5 hours of the main story.

The cutesy and bright colors paired very well with this game. Not to mention all the characters, even minor ones who you only ever talk too during their friend events, were designed well and uniquely. However, I do feel that some heavily rely on tropes (Like Misato or Saaya). Regardless of this, they were all still enjoyable at the same time! Misato's was especially one of my top favorites. \n\nThe game has some slapstick humor to it, the mc gets punched/hit/kicked/whatever by the main assistant to a fairly frequent degree. I personally didn't find it too overbearing, but if slapstick isn't your cup of tea I would keep it in mind.\n\nOne final thing is the soundtrack. Bless this soundtrack. I got to mid-way of chapter 2 when I toyed with the idea of buying the dlc soundtrack, by chapter 4 I had already gone and purchased it. Each area has it's own music that matches the tone of both the area and the game in general wonderfully. During friend events the soundtracks do get reused between several characters, but there's enough of them and broken far enough apart that you're not listening to the same ones constantly. \n\nAll in all? 1bitHeart was a fantastic trip with just the Happy end, I look forward to getting the Bad and Normal endings and have already bundle purchased LiEat and Alicemare, (Other Miwashiba games) and look forward to playing them in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1516079369, "timestamp_updated": 1516079704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39323144": {"recommendationid": "39323144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315401414", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515884450}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6c38\u8fdc\u559c\u6b22Nanashi", "timestamp_created": 1515885034, "timestamp_updated": 1515885034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39281642": {"recommendationid": "39281642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108666542", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515766586}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub2c8\uac00 \uc624\ub298 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc628 \uc2e0\uc785\uc774\ub2c8?\n\uc77c\ub2e8 \uc549\uc544\ubd10 \ub204\ub098\ub4e4\uc744 \ud589\ubcf5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uc791\uace0 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6b4\uac8c \uc788\ub294\ub370\n\uadf8\uac8c \ub108\uc57c\n\ub108\uae34 \ub10c\ub370 \ub108\ub9cc \uadf8\ub7f0\uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\uc57c \uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6b4\uac78 \ub124\uae00\uc790\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294\uac8c \uc788\uc5b4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uc1fc.\ud0c0.\uc870.\uc544", "timestamp_created": 1515766602, "timestamp_updated": 1515766602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39248683": {"recommendationid": "39248683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389785208", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 375, "last_played": 1515834074}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u6c38\u8fdc\u559c\u6b22774\u2014\u2014\n\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u7684BGM\uff01\nCV\u4e5f\u8d85\u7ea7\u68d2\uff01[strike]\u9664\u4e86\u6709\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u4e00\u76f4\u5a07\u5598\u4f1a\u6709\u70b9\u5c34\u5c2cx[/strike]\n\u4eba\u8bbe\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u4e30\u6ee1\uff01\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u2014\u2014\n\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6709\u6c49\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b89\u5229\u7ed9\u66f4\u591a\u4eba\u5566x", "timestamp_created": 1515649202, "timestamp_updated": 1515649202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39172654": {"recommendationid": "39172654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032081181", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 351, "last_played": 1515386544}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine a cross between the gameplay of Phoenix Wright, relationship-building of Persona 4, and the aesthetics and tone of The World Ends With You.\nThe story wasn't quite as mature as I had hoped, but the characters and themes really grew on me.\n\nI highly recommend it if you want something light in tone, but with genuinely deep characters and themes.", "timestamp_created": 1515387011, "timestamp_updated": 1515387011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39101275": {"recommendationid": "39101275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057103167", "num_games_owned": 1770, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514980584}, "language": "french", "review": "jeu aux graphismes simples et peu colore (reference aux jeux 8bits) il est plaisant a jouer et surtout tres long a finir!\nc est un veritable devoreur dec temps !

Almost in the borderlands next to intolerable. There are multiple moments in this game that made me genuinely uncomfortable. Not sure if that's just because I'm not really used to these kinds of games or what. I loved LiEat. But I found this game more thought provoking than \"fun\". And there's nothing really wrong with that. They broach topics in this game that are completely out there in day to day life. Things that many individuals think about but never voice really. It takes place in what appears to be a futuristic dystopian Japan and your a late teen that goes around speaking to people. Where the creepy part comes in is how some of the characters speak. LiEat never really made me super uncomfortable. Some of the concept art was questionable yes... All in all a psychological trip and it may just be the weirdest game I have ever played.

While this rating may be a bit biased as I've known Miwasiba for a long time since when he was my favorite vocaloid Illustrator, I believe that other reviews can reinforce this statement by stating the fact that the art style is very cute. And let's be honest, it was the very reason why I first picked up this game. (And every other game by Miwasiba).\n\nStory ?/10 - I haven't finished the game yet, though the story thus far has proven to be very interesting\n\nMusic 9/10 - It may be just because Miwasiba has worked with vocaloid producers before (people like REOL and Mafumafu) but the music chosen in his games was very engaging, and fit the mood of each of the backgrounds and the situations pretty well\n\nOverall 9/10 - While it's not a really immersive game, I think that this game is a very interesting and, like I said before, really reminds me of Persona, particularly Persona 3 wherein so many different new concepts were introduced to us JRPG  players. So, if you really enjoyed Persona 3, this game will most likely interest you.\n", "timestamp_created": 1516278654, "timestamp_updated": 1516278654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39496299": {"recommendationid": "39496299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198443605746", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "last_played": 1516483837}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u00e7ok k\u00f6t\u00fc hi\u00e7 tavsiye etmem", "timestamp_created": 1516490514, "timestamp_updated": 1516490514, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

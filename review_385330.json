Eh.\n\nI had been putting this game off for a while and since it was on sale, I decided to just go for it and get it, despite the negative reviews revolving the main character which I unfortunately have to agree with now,\n\nAesthetically, this game is very pretty. The horror elements were quirky and it had style, although it wasn't particularly frightening.\nGameplay-wise, it may as well play itself. The puzzles were pretty easy, you're not left there figuring out what to do. However, there was a part in Act 3 where you have to repeat the whole segment over and over again - amounting to about four times...? All for the purpose of just small differences in between. The repetitiveness in that part was honestly just annoying and it would have been better if they just extended Act 3 rather than making you play it several times. I was enjoying the game up until Act 3, which was frustrating and just boring if I'm honest.\n\nI was hoping the ending would make up for it. It didn't. Not only did it not answer any questions, but it just confused me even more. You're given no answers and then it's over.\nIt could have been better if the main character had more... character? She's so UNRESPONSIVE to everything. She doesn't have any reaction to the weird things she encounters, all you can get out of her really is just '...' Literally.\nI mean, if the point of the story is that it's open to interpretation, I get that, but combining the fact that the character is so deadpan and that the ending gives you no answers (you don't have much to speculate really), you don't get any satisfaction from completing the game.\n\n\nTL;DR: short and kinda sweet game (until Act 3). It's pretty, but ultimately boring and dissapointing due to the main character's lack of character and bad ending.", "timestamp_created": 1514467801, "timestamp_updated": 1514467801, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38665535": {"recommendationid": "38665535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119936549", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514222277}, "language": "english", "review": "Main character was dull, story not immersive and poor constructed, puzzles were boring and repetitive.

The main character is a little \"meh\" - her reactions to all of the weird and unusual happenings don't really make any sense, which loses a little of the immersion for me.\n\nI really, really love the character design and the score - this was a bit thumbs up for me!! I only wish there was a little more depth to the story, perhaps covering why the characters are the way they are (e.g. Sphinx, Babyhead).\n\nThe story was...compelling at first, but by Act III I was just bored. The game gets very dull, as you're forced to repeat the same (somewhat lengthy) sequence over and over and over...you can't complete the game without doing so.\n\nIt's a beautiful game, and it's only 2 hours long. If you're looking for a game with some mildy complex puzzles and a shallow story, this is what you're after.

Come to think of it, it's kinda weird that this engine was originally made for RPGs, but that most of the best games made with it are horror adventure games.\n\nAlthough the beginning feels very horror-ish (red screen tones, jump scares, you get the idea), as the game progresses and you learn more about the plot, the horror elements get less frequent the game gets more surreal.\n\n+ The pixel art is great, from environments to sprites and characters portraits. The music is also pretty good. It's rare to hear post-rock in video games.\n\n+ It manages to tell an interesting story in a couple of hours, while still leaving a bit open to interpretation. The characters are very unique (particularly the Japanese goat-mom-witch).\n\n+ / - The gameplay is pretty standard for this kind of game (mostly puzzles, and one chase sequence). The last part can feel a bit repetitive since it involves some kind of sequence loop (I love this kind of stuff, but apparently I'm the only one who does).\n\n- The trailer features some nice animations but sadly none of those are in the game. Although the jumpscares are actually quite well-animated.\n\n7/10 Short (like that review), original (not like that review), cheap (I'll let you decide if it applies to that review).

Sem muita inova\u00e7\u00e3o no quesito jogabilidade, o jogo se apoia na possibilidade de passar uma profunda mensagem pela hist\u00f3ria que se desenvolve enquanto voc\u00ea resolve puzzles. O jogo usa um sistema de \"complicado no in\u00edcio e respostas no final\", que vez ou outra ainda pode confundir aqueles que o jogam sem prestar muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\n[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]\n\nComo dito anteriormente, n\u00e3o \u00e9 nenhum pioneiro em termos de jogabilidade. Voc\u00ea controla uma personagem em at\u00e9 quatro dire\u00e7\u00f5es e interage com objetos em pr\u00f3 de resolver os enigmas que s\u00e3o lhe impostos para avan\u00e7ar pelo jogo.\nR\u00e1pido e pr\u00e1tico, voc\u00ea no primeiro minuto de jogo j\u00e1 entende todos os comandos e consegue ent\u00e3o desfrutar da hist\u00f3ria que ser\u00e1 contada de uma maneira interessante.\n\nOs quebra cabe\u00e7as s\u00e3o f\u00e1ceis, n\u00e3o foram desenvolvidos de modo que seja necess\u00e1rio um pensar muito aprofundado do jogador para a solu\u00e7\u00e3o. A maior dificuldade imposta (de maneira prec\u00e1ria) \u00e9 em alguns momentos questionar da fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos objetos que fica muito discreto, exigindo maior explora\u00e7\u00e3o do cen\u00e1rio e contando menos com seus olhos.\nSeus puzzles podem ser facilmente resolvidos com spammar de bot\u00f5es em todos objetos que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel interagir no cen\u00e1rio, o que \u00e9 um ponto negativo para esse tipo de jogo.\n\nN\u00e3o existem muitas 'cenas' de a\u00e7\u00e3o, mas elas s\u00e3o feitas de uma maneira [b]tediosa[/b] e [b]pregui\u00e7osa[/b]. Movimentos r\u00e1pidos sem muita espera do jogador entender o que acontece inicialmente, acaba que exige repeti\u00e7\u00e3o de in\u00fameras vezes algo que poderia ser feito em uma ou duas tentativas, j\u00e1 que esse tipo de 'desafio' se torna massante e n\u00e3o desafiador.\n\n[b]Repeti\u00e7\u00e3o[/b] talvez seja a palavra que defina certos aspectos e puzzles do jogo, talvez feito para aumentar a vida \u00fatil curta de Stray Cat Crossing. Em alguns momentos, infelizmente acontece de voc\u00ea repetir a mesma coisa diversas vezes de maneiras diferentes para conseguir prosseguir, deixando a jogabilidade cansativa e tediosa.\n\n[h1]Hist\u00f3ria e enredo[/h1]\n\nA hist\u00f3ria conta sobre uma personagem que estava no meio de uma estrada, com a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de voltar para casa, at\u00e9 que encontra uma garotinha perdida chamada Cat, que havia fugido de casa. Ao aquec\u00ea-la com seu cachecol, a protagonista ent\u00e3o leva a crian\u00e7a at\u00e9 sua casa, mas acaba se esquecendo de pegar de volta o seu importante cachecol, ent\u00e3o invadindo a casada garota em busca da mesma para peg\u00e1-lo de volta. A partir desse momento, coisas estranhas e assustadoras passam a acontecer em volta de nossa hero\u00edna, que ao mesmo tempo que quer ir embora, quer tamb\u00e9m seu cachecol de volta.\n\nO enredo se conta atrav\u00e9s dos pat\u00e9ticos puzzles impostos pelo jogo, de uma maneira extremamente discreta que ao longo que voc\u00ea avan\u00e7a a hist\u00f3ria, vai passando a entender as situa\u00e7\u00f5es que os personagens se encontram e representam, apesar de ser bem f\u00e1cil deixar algo passar e ficar sem respostas no final. Esse jeito de contar a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 muito incr\u00edvel quando bem explorado, e at\u00e9 que foi bem feito nesse jogo, apesar de tudo s\u00f3 passar a fazer um maior sentido pr\u00f3ximo ao final.\n\n[h1]Trilha Sonora[/h1]\n\nPonto positivo para essa se\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m. As m\u00fasicas s\u00e3o curtas, cerca de 1 minuto cada uma. Abusam principalmente de piano e d\u00e3o uma atmosfera mais melanc\u00f3lica \u00e0 situa\u00e7\u00e3o, cumprindo seu trabalho de maneira excelente para o g\u00eanero que foi composta.\n\nSuas faixas mais animadas/calmas s\u00e3o [b]realmente boas[/b], provavelmente as melhores, o que \u00e9 algo inesperado quando se trata desse tipo de jogo.\n\n[h1]Visuais[/h1]\n\nPixelart bem detalhado, cores usadas com precis\u00e3o para cen\u00e1rios mais sombrios e um estilo visual \u00fanico. Uma beleza de maneira especial, que destaca o jogo de sua pr\u00f3pria maneira.\n\nSuas 'cutscenes' s\u00e3o muito boas, apesar de r\u00e1pidas. Anima\u00e7\u00f5es em um estilo mais detalhado que usa e abusa da falta de cores, dando uma imers\u00e3o ao universo aterrorizante do jogo. \n\nO problema que o jogo apresenta s\u00e3o as anima\u00e7\u00f5es dos sprites, principalmente as dos personagens se movendo. S\u00e3o travadas, parecendo mec\u00e2nicas, o que tira boa parte do charme desses visuais belos. Infelizmente uma cruz que o jogo carrega, mas n\u00e3o sendo medonhas a ponto de estragar a experi\u00eancia por completo.\n\n[h1]Conclus\u00e3o[/h1]\n\nPre\u00e7o baixo, hist\u00f3ria boa e que vai fazer voc\u00ea trabalhar a cabe\u00e7a um pouco para compreender todos os acontecimentos, usando terror e leves jumpscares para te envolver numa tr\u00e1gica jornada.

An emphatic recommendation from me.\n\nLet's get the negatives out of the way first -- it's short, it has some issues with crashes (they don't stop you from completing the game), and gameplay is limited to fetching things and chatting with things, with attempts to add variety missing the mark.\n\nFor another game those might be dealbreakers, but Stray Cat Crossing isn't about the mechanics. It's about the spooky world and demented characters which have sprung from the minds of its creators, and in every way that it needs to immerse you in that world, it succeeds.\n\nThe soundtrack is good -- each track is short, tight, distinct, and enhances the game's atmosphere.\n\nThe plot has its fair share of memorable moments. It's convoluted but considering the nature of the world we are visiting, maybe that's just what it should be. It has inspired numerous theories and speculation among fans.\n\nBut the artwork, Wow, this is some of the best pixel art I've seen in years. It approaches the level of the top titles of the 16 bit era. Comparisons with Chrono Trigger come to mind, which is simply astounding considering the dream team behind the art of CT!\n\nAnd we can't overlook the price, which is only a few bucks on Steam at the time of writing, so it's hard to say you aren't getting value for money.\n\nAbove all I think it's the character concepts which make this game a must play. It's rare to come across characters this weird, creepy and creative in any title of any budget. Stray Cat Crossing ultimately serves as a showcase for the eclectic imaginations of its authors, and in this regard it's a complete and unique success.\n\nThe other comparison I couldn't help making was to the Wadjet Eye P&C titles I've been playing recently, some of which are real works of art. If Jurlo and JetPackGone polished the weak points in their output and produced a full-length adventure game with a surreal horror atmosphere reminiscent of Stray Cat's, we could be looking at a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.\n\nIf summary if you have a little nostalgia for the heydays of 16 bit RPGs or adventure games, and you're into creepy atmospheric horror, and you won't rage when the game occasionally crashes or shows a rough edge, Stray Cat is a must play.\n", "timestamp_created": 1507566034, "timestamp_updated": 1507566034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35381348": {"recommendationid": "35381348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045080875", "num_games_owned": 918, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506863380}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is very well made, has gorgeous graphics and an interesting story.

An even bigger crime is that its silences come in packs, causing more discomfort than wonder. \n\nAbove of all, it doesn't understand that decent game mechanics should [b]always[/b] exclude repeating the same tasks over and over again through unskippable cutscenes.\n\nIn short, while [i]Stray Cat Crossing[/i] succeeds in things that its genre isn't renowned for, it fails at a core aspect of good storytelling, be it a bedtime story or an intricate centuries-old tale: it fails at being memorable.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]Stray Cat Crossing[/i]'s biggest fault is being a niche game. It appeals to a specific kind of gamer and, if you're not lucky enough to find yourself in that category, its shortcomings will shine brighter than its gems. If, however, you find yourself inside the specific frame this game was painted for, its faults will hopefully simply be a speck of a drifting ship, lost in a sea of aesthetic graphics and darn good music.\n\nI recommend [i]Stray Cat Crossing[/i] to seekers of good art and music, that enjoy their fair share of words, don't mind wonky puzzles and can handle some repetition. I don't recommend it to anyone that doesn't see themselves clearly in the previous sentence.\n\n[i]EDIT: \u00b9Bast.ards. Yes, Steam, censor Pratchett.

Not knowing anything about our main character we jump right in; the search for our beloved scarf. \n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n-A fairly short but intense story that makes you question what is happening constantly.\n-Unique Artwork. Creepy and cute are the only two words to describe it.\n-Wonderful music to go along with the dark atmosphere.\n-Puzzles. Challenging enough to make you think but not frustrating to the point of distracting from the story.\n-I love the way the save feature was integrated into the game. \n-Playtime is decent for the price. \n\n[h1]Negatives (Subjective)[/h1]\n-Game crashed for me quite frequently in the beginning. Not sure if a bug or isolated event.\n-Default resolution is miniscule, making it full screen distorted it. Again, not sure if it\u2019s just my PC and the way it was presented on my screen. \n-Music is nice, but with that being said, it could get a bit repetitive when you're stuck on a puzzle.\n-Accidently made dialogue choices by hitting enter too many times to make the text scroll faster.\n\nDefinitely worth the money if you're up for a decent story, interesting characters, incredible creepiness and a handful of jump scares. \n\n[i]One question though.

When we choose the inventory, we can see small icons and descriptions of our items. Another thing: we can run and jump.

The story is deep and contains a fair share of twists. Some you see coming, others you don't. \n\nI usually understand confusing stories immediately, but a number of things weren't so obvious to me at first. After watching a 9 minute explanation of the game on youtube, though, I got all the hidden messages. I'm sure I would have picked up on everything if I played through it again, anyway. The story has a number of twists and hidden messages that make it quite deep. It's sad, too, to put it lightly. Some people say they cried at the end. The script was surprisingly powerful in that regard, and the sad parts were caused by something rather intense. Hidden messages and metaphors are found constantly in this game, but it's hard to appreciate them on the first playthrough, giving that all the knots are tied together and everything starts making sense only in the end. Until you reach the last \"level\", the game is an abstract piece of art with hidden meanings you don't understand and can not truly appreciate, and that is why Stray Cat Crossing is worth at least a second playthrough, even though it does not have any achievements. \n\nI would say that my only complaint with this game is that the last \"level\" is very repetitive. This is not accidental, and the repetitive aspect is explained and justified well within the story. That said, it doesn't make it any more fun to do the same thing, and read the same dialogue over and over. Something I really liked up until that point was the fluidity of the game, and that I never felt like any part was dragging on until then. Then it dragged on big time. \n\nAnyway, I don't want to end on a bad note, since I really did enjoy this game and I'm glad I forked out the \u20ac2.99 for this experience. It's not spectacular, but it's very well worth it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1498852996, "timestamp_updated": 1498852996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32893284": {"recommendationid": "32893284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014552816", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 319, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498601015}, "language": "english", "review": "This was good with a sad story.

[spoiler]At the start of almost any horror/horror-light indie game, the question I always half-jokingly ask myself is, \"Okay, what wrongdoing is it going to turn out the protagonist is inexplicably amnesiac about this time?\" This game was yet another time I easily won that little bet with myself.[/spoiler] It features essentially a very simple, even mundane, story, and simply slops buckets of symbolism (and a fair amount of distracting nonsense) over it until it's sufficiently thickly coated to obscure the rather shallow real plot beneath all the whimsy.

Dopo averle dato la nostra sciarpa e averla rassicurata la riporteremo indietro. Solo dopo averlo fatto per\u00f2 ci accorgeremo di non esserci fatti ridare la sciarpa, a cui TIZIA \u00e8 tanto legata.\n Sar\u00e0 in quel momento che ci decideremo ad entrare nella villa, e dare inizio cos\u00ec alla nostra avventura ! \nUn leggero senso di ansia e angoscia sar\u00e0 il nostro fedele compagno di viaggio, in quanto l'abitazione presenter\u00e0 luoghi misteriosi e tetri abitati da creature magiche o comunque paranormali, particolari nei modi e nei gesti.\n\nPotrebbe non avere apparentemente senso ma, credetemi, tutti gli elementi e gli stessi personaggi fanno da filo conduttore con la bambina e sopratutto con noi stessi.

Seriously, I hate jumpscares, but their infrequent enough in this game that I still really enjoyed it. This game is dark, unsettling, and scary at times, but it is far from your typical hardcore game. For those looking for a true thrill, this is not a game for you. If you're looking for what is basically a \"point-and-click\" adventure with a horror theme and super dark atmosphere, then I recomend checking this game out. This is not ACTUALLY a point and click - you control your character with the arrow keys and interact by pressing a button on the keyboard (I forgot which one, but that's not important) - but the puzzles in this game operate very similarly.  You explore, find clues and itmes, and use the clues to figure out what to do with the items. Most of the puzzles in this game are quite good, although there are a couple less-than-superb ones as well that are either frustrating or tedious. There is no combat, so the exploration and puzzles make up 100% of the gameplay, but the biggest attraction is the story and atmosphere. \nThe story is wonderful. The game is one big metaphorical mystery that all ties together at the end, and I quite enjoyed it. This game absolutely worth playing just for the story. It's not too long (about 2-3 hours), so there's no excuse not to find time to experience this atmospheric horror story game.

I may as well be \"Derp The Red Head, Former Blond.\"\n\nThe gameplay consists of pressing enter on everything until the game progress.  Well, it would, except for some reason the game lets you \"use\" items from the item menu (the game just uses them automatically if you have the item and press enter on the right thing) and doing this causes the game to crash (sometimes, other times it does nothing).  The game even crashed on the main menu when I hit \"New\" as in \"New Game.\"\n\nYes, the game crashed when I asked it to start a new game.  Astounding.\n\nApparently there are other endings to the game but the ending I got was so absolutely retarded I can't fathom bothering to explore this mess of a game.  The ending I got references The Shining (without any reason to do so) and that's it.  No resolution to who the girl was, who the guy I was doing favors for was, and I don't even know if I ever got out of the house.  Hell, I don't even know why my character was standing in a garden area on the side of the road in the middle of the night.\n\nThe sound is good but constantly shifts tone.  One room is creepy and atmospheric but then after five seconds you're in another room with happy warm sounding music.  Constantly interrupts occur of jump scares that aren't scary and fail to tell a clear story (not that the story is even good).

Initially I feared the game might be yet another play on the Wonderland theme that while interesting, I see too much of to care for these days (seriously, guys, try re-imagining another work of classical fiction for a change). Yet, in spite of the presence of at least one giant caterpillar and exceedingly creepy twins, it didn't feel 'Alice in Wonderland' at all. \n    [*]General creepiness - if that were what this game was going for alone, then it definitely succeeded. \n    [*]Decent writing and concepts with some genuinely unnerving moments. \n    [*]Good for players looking for a shorter, condensed storytelling experience which is not too difficult in terms of puzzles. \n[/list]\n\nThings to Address. \n[list]\n    [*]Difficult controls. The character movements feel \"floaty\" and sometimes jerky and could do with being tightened up a bit. The game is controller compatible, but there was no option to adjust the configuration, so I was left attempting to press the key to run (Y) and the key to jump (A) at the same time which made me feel like a contortionist. I switched to the keyboard, which helped, but there were still issues... \n    [*] That. First. Running. Challenge. One of the earliest tests in the game... involves running away from something, This took an obscene amount of time to get the hang of. The game's sensitive controls were the major sticking point. \n    [*]It's... not really horror to me. It's surreal and weird, but I'm the kind of person who has conniptions waiting at a strange drive thru at 8 pm and *I* didn't feel unnerved, which ought to tell you something. If you're looking for an intense horror experience you won't get it here. Unless you have a phobia of dolls or mutant insects. Then you're kind of screwed. \n   [*]Lacklustre puzzles. There were not many of them - understandable, but disappointing, and those that were there were very easy to figure out.I understand that many would not consider that a bad thing, but I feel it might be disappointing for some players who were expecting a more genuine challenge. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1467926576, "timestamp_updated": 1467926576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24155017": {"recommendationid": "24155017", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984699801", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507437881}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to recommend this game.\n\nIt presents stunning visuals, excellent sound direction, a rich and dark (if a bit obvious) story laden with symbolism and metaphor all tied up in a package reminiscient of the best aspects of yesteryear's click and point adventure titles.\n\nHowever the game is far too unstable for me to recommend in good faith and, to be honest, it really shouldn't even be on the storefront in this condition.

What a wild ride! Stray Cat Crossing not only has amazing art and music, but also a story telling style that will get your heart racing and it will be on your mind even after you have finished the game.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nAt the first glance at this game, the store page screenshots show that the art style is very unique and eccentric. Having played the game I absolutely agree that the art style played a huge part in creating the atmosphere and immersion of the game. It's made with RPGMaker, however the loving care put into the art, as well as its detail and quality, make it hard to notice the engine at all.\n\n[h1]Thoughts, Story wise[/h1]\nThe story is about a girl named Cat, that got lost. I really don't want to spoil anything by giving out details, as the story is a crucial part of this story, and emotionally impactful. I'll say that it's a story about memories and the past, kind of like To the Moon's themes. The way the story is implemented is quite outstanding, with different layers to getting to  \"what actually happened\". In the end the story is revealed bit by bit, with symbolism and twists of reality. It indeed is very thought provoking and I'm still thinking about the events that happened and what the story is trying to say. I absolutely love games/ shows/ anime that do this! What came to mind after playing was Spirited Away by Studio Ghibli, and after this thought occurred to me I looked up the developer's site and it's listed as one of the influences. So kudos to them for conveying the atmosphere right!\n\n[h1]Thoughts, Gameplay wise[/h1]\nThe game play is generally very smooth, involving puzzles and some chase scenes. I had a lot of fun with the puzzles, and the difficulty is about just right for a game heavily focusing on story - made me use my brain but didn't make me overly frustrated. The first 2 acts are great, the 3rd drags out but felt worth it. However a gripe I had was the speed of talking which is on the slow side and unskippable. The game froze sometimes after saving (thankfully after saving not before!) But looking at an FAQ unfortunately this is due to some problem with the RPGMaker engine, and will not be game breaking on most machines.\n\n[b]Random tips[/b]\n1. The chase scene seems hard at first but don't give up! It's actually quite short. You can only jump over the small holes.\n2. The OST is free, included in the game files!\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nStray Cat Crossing is a game with great storytelling, with a dark and creepy atmosphere. If you're looking for a thought provoking and emotionally impactful game, look no further! In addition the unique art style and soundtrack will draw you right in.

The horror comes from being locked in small areas (typically a single floor of a house) with surrealist characters as your only companions, as well as FMV scenes that interrupt your actions with jumpscares. The characters you encounter are creepy and may antagonize you, but there are very few of them that impede your progress or can send you to the game over screen.\n\nThe narrative of Stray Cat Crossing starts out shallow at first. During the first two acts, it seems like the characters are strange for the sake of being strange and no explanations are given for their behaviour. Near the end of the second act is when things start to become deeper, but still very obscured. During the third act, essentially the last half of the game, the loose threads begin to join and form a unified whole. There is a sense of discovery when you find out the significance of a seemingly throwaway task in the earlier part of the game. I was pleased with the way the story came together at the end. It could have been easy to leave everything vague or unanswered in a game as surreal as Stray Cat Crossing, but the developers thankfully brought everything to a conclusion.\n\nPros:\n-the pixel art is wildly original\n-the soundtrack swaps between creepy ambience, pastoral guitar plucking, and dissonance as needed\n-the full soundtrack is included in the base game!\n-story comes to a satisfying conclusion with everything tied up nicely in a big bundle of feels\n-different characters have distinct personalities and speech patterns\n-about half the puzzles have nothing explaining how to complete them, yet are still intuitive\n-the repetition and changing of rooms. Revisiting the same rooms multiple times and seeing how they change as I advanced made an entire level of just three rooms interesting\n-I really liked the saving system. Very stylishly done.\n-The brevity of the game makes it very easy to finish, and after discovering the secrets at the end, it is worthwhile to play through again to see the foreshadowing.\n-Very unique experience. It is not easy to compare with other games\n\nCons:\n-the song \"Skin Tight\" from the trailer is only as long as it is in the trailer. 0:51 is just not long enough. \n-the controls are not quite ideal. Being an RPG Maker game, I had to search non-Stray Cat Crossing forums to find a way to rebind keys to my comfort and play the game fullscreen without stretching.\n-the other half of the puzzles are simply trial and error with little logic beind them\n-the hedgemaze: this was a really cool, creepy locale with a completely indecipherable puzzle. After wandering aimlessly for 30 minutes, I simply looked online for the answer to progress. I haven't seen any Let's Play videos figure it out themselves either yet, so am sure it was not just my own problem.\n-The repetition of scripted events. This was an annoyance in the third chapter. Rather than merely revisiting rooms, you are forced to sit through scripted events as you replay the same scenes over again, learning a little bit more each time. This would have been awesome if some of the connecting events were cut on subsequent visits. Having an usher always come, say the exact same lines as the three times before, and then walk away, come back, and talk some more is irritating when you simply want to walk into the room you are trying to go to.\n-Some of the dialogue can fall a little flat. One of the things that grated on me was a certain character that begins every sentance with \"...\" waits for awhile, then finally says something.\n-The FMV jumpscares that interrupt you early in the game do not tie into the plot anymore than to remind you that things are oh-so-spooky here, but largely die off in the second and third chapters", "timestamp_created": 1460621716, "timestamp_updated": 1460693083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22380866": {"recommendationid": "22380866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218710463", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466508141}, "language": "english", "review": "I really recommend this game if you like pixel and horror games and in my own opinion it\u00b4s really fun and worth the money", "timestamp_created": 1460485975, "timestamp_updated": 1460485975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22346620": {"recommendationid": "22346620", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985759517", "num_games_owned": 5900, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460313077}, "language": "english", "review": "Stray Cat Crossing is an interesting game that is more about the story than any serious game play. \n\nYou enter a world that you leaves you guessing and your job is to try to figure out what's going on.

while until i played this. stray cat crossing is a horror puzzle walking simulator made in rpgmaker about some bitch ass little girl stealing your scarf and running into a haunted house so you have to chase after her. like many games designed to be art first game second it sucks at being fun and no one cares about the art. and im not talking the game art as in the graphics we already know how those are im talking about the story or point or whatever the point of art is that the game tries to do. i dont know i guess its point is to convey emotions other than boredom but whoops. i think the worst part about it is that it costs money when other walking simulators are both free and better although not much.\n\n   for gameplay it is a walking simulator with the most basic of puzzle elements. as an rpgmaker game it has the obligatory large amount of walk up to a thing and press x next to it puzzles except the game automates it slightly so it auto uses any item that can be used to solve a puzzle instead of making you manually going through your inventory so it actually requires even less thought than other games although it is more convenient. other puzzles usually combine the press x thing with some environmental change and theyre all piss easy too and i think theres only like 2 of these. the real kicker is one puzzle at the end but ill get to that once im done with the fundamentals. in standard rpgmaker fashion you walk around a world divided into squares and you occupy one square at a time and have a sprint button and thats well and good but i dont know why you have a sprint button when there is 0 incentive to not have sprint continuously and the game doesnt really do anything with it barring one poorly done chase sequence. like why not just make sprint speed default speed and make the sprint key slow you down if you need to go slow i dont get it. why not make it toggleable. to go back a little, that puzzle i described as being a kicker the game requires you to replay the exact same part of the game multiple times and do things slightly differently each time which was huge fun when combined with this thrilling gameplay. this takes a large chunk of the games playtime which was like 2 hours so this is like 20 minutes of doing the same shit repeatedly. that was clearly the worst puzzle in the game and is bad enough to be an outstanding mention because the game expects you to care about the developing story changes or some shit that occur during the whatever but you dont. there was also one part where you had to select the right text options in order and do it for like 10 choices or it resets and the text scrolls slow as fuck during this time which makes it annoying as balls. all the puzzles are either boring and irrelevant or suck.\n\n  most of the game is just talking to people and walking around looking at shit since there isnt a battle thing or anything else except bad puzzles. all of the characters barring you get at most 5 minutes of screen time and have one or no defining personality traits not barring you. obviously i remember none of the characters vividly so any sort of character review for outstanding individuals is out. the story is entirely uninteresting and just sort of manifests itself later in the game with no obvious connection to what was happening earlier. maybe the game is doing a diy story thing but i dont care enough to figure it out. i would call it pretentious but it feels like it lacks the magic pretentious spark other, more pretentious indie games have so i dont know. i guess its pretentious. the story itself is also pretty stupid in concept like the main character goes into this haunted ass house that tried to kill her repeatedly because she didnt get her scarf back those other times and the ending has some plot holes like why was the car on fire. you would understand that if you played the game but dont. it was pretentious enough for me to read on the forum a what if it was all in a coma story though. at least the story wasnt like godawful or anything and actually had a reasonably easy to interpret ending. unlike off which was horse shit. today someone actually typed off was good on the same server i was in and it was horrible.\n\n   as for the horror i had to do a double check of things i had to write about when thinking of what to write about for this game because its just not there. i think the game forgot that it was horror after the second time go in the house like a dumbass because that was where the only part that if people said they were afraid of i wouldnt laugh at them. almost. the game is clearly going for some disney/alice in wonderland but scary shit that would probably work if the game wasnt bad because it doesnt push the scary stuff enough. i mean it could work the theme itself wasnt bad but it just doesnt. it doesnt matter if it would though in case anyone thinks i add that to review score i shit on planetside for not being what it could. at least this is less disappointing because it lacks potential entirely. as for the part 1 horror its mostly jump scares. woo. i dont actually have a problem with jump scares if they are used with taste but they arent they just like happen randomly in an very badly done attempt at tension building. speaking of tension building im assuming thats what the rest of what the game is trying to do too but it just results in a bunch of ok that looks out of place moments instead of anything like oh shit something might happen. probably because the player has meta knowledge nothing will happen to them and dying is almost impossible the game doesnt mix this up at all. if anyone reading this is doing a horror game you have to make the player feel like some shit will happen to them by making it so shit can happen to them. i don thtink its even possible to die here except in that one badly done chase scene\n\n   you know the graphics werent actually that bad most of the time. it really wasnt i swear. no stop laughing guys im serious. there were some very obvious flaws but most of it was passable. maybe i just wasnt paying attention or something but it was alright with me. the walk cycle and talking portrait thing were constant reminders that all was not right in the world of graphcis in a game consisting mostly of walking and talking and jesus man were they something. i already talked about the games artstyle thing in the horror thing so whatever. they are graphics if the rest of the review didnt stop you from buying this the graphics part sure wont. pretty sure the graphics were actually the best part of the game which is saying something\n\n   the music and shit was mostly ambient and i dont feel like writing filler so it and the sound effects were all normal.\n\n   pretty boring game overall i dont really have any advice for how it could be better except make the story better and realize that repeating the same actions 5 times for tidbits of a story that i dont care about isnt good gameplay. if anyone says they like this game just call it pretentious hipster bullshit and them pretentious hipster bullshit.", "timestamp_created": 1460170562,

But you realize only after her entering the house that she still has your scarf, which is really dear to your heart, so you enter Cat's house to find her and ask her for your scarf.\nWhile the short introduction also plays an important part in understanding the whole story, the real content of the game starts after entering the house.  On your left you see a blind girl, eyes covered with bandages, holding a camera, meekly asking you if she could take a photo of you...  and then you can pick your save slot :)  The game developers really cleverly implemented, and inserted the savepoint system in the game that it's actually a person, who appears at numerous spots during the game, always reflecting to your current actions - it's wonderfully immersive\n\nAfter speaking to her, you see footprints on the ground, which lead deeper into the house. \nThe game consists of three different parts of the house, three chapters - each really different from the other ones, they build on the previous ones but there's a common thing in them - they are all has their own creepy characters, themes and actions that can send shivers down one's spine.  Each chapter gives you a clear goal, and you can reach it by completing smaller goals, sometimes puzzles.  The characters of the house had a similar feeling to me like in Silent Hill - they do have a strong resemblance to asian, or rather japanese horror-creatures, but what sets the macabre tone the best is that they are all clever, thinking - and has no real intention of hurting you. But, if it's possible, they won't let you go. \nThe game only has one point when you can die while you're just walking around, but it's more like an event, like a QTE is for a game - and it has a save point just before it, so it's safe to say that while saving is advised, it's not easy to get yourself killed. Which is nice, because you'll be able to spend more time exploring the house, and to see VCR-like short video-cuts appear, that unravels a little more about the story, while conveniently raising the creepy-factor a LOT.\n I don't want to spoi the story, especially as the game is short, can be completed in three hours and it's really worth to be experienced rather than just told about. But as it can be guessed from the lack of combat, the game's story revolves around pretty serious matters, and it's elements presented through the game's symbols, with the whole story explained at the end. While the third, last chapter got pretty tedious compared to the first two, the game really did a great job by not making the story overly simplistic, and at the same the explanation was presented in a way that does not make the player feel stupid for not getting it during the game.\n\nWhile the art style seemed a little at first (the characters are pretty big compared to the environment) the game did a perfect job at introducing, then gradually unfold and solve a story while making me feel intrested, weirded out, or at some points just staring onto the screen.  I've got the game from a bundle that cost maybe 1.5$ ; but I think if someone's looking for a more creepy-weird, than a scary horror and finds the art direction attractive, I can absolutely recommend the game even at full price.  It's done with RPGMaker but uses own art, has a great soundtrack and has a really nice story with a proper ending that's quite memorable.

The art isn't quite my style, but it's obviously high quality. The music fits the atmosphere. That atmosphere is well-developed, too. The settings and characters add to the air of mystery throughout most of the game. One point of criticism here: the trailer is pretty misleading. Few of the animations in the trailer are actually used in-game in any way. While the game does have good art, the trailer makes it seem far more well-produced than it actually is.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay and story are greatly lacking. If one of the two were lacking, it might be forgiven, but that's not the case. The gameplay is entirely puzzles, which would be fine if the puzzles were at all engaging. At best, the puzzles are insultingly linear and obvious. At worst, the puzzles are not only linear, but also employ moon logic to make you question if it's actually the solution to the puzzles. The areas are small and confined, and you can solve every puzzle in the game by running around and interacting with everything you see until the solution is effectively told to you. There is a chase sequence at one point, and it was well-executed, but it's the only segment of it's kind in the game. I see people complain about the last segment of the game in the attic. I can see how it might be frustrating if it were a difficult puzzle, but I figured out what I needed to do after the first reset. It was pretty quick after that. Also, the description on Steam is a bit misleading. \"Challenging riddles and puzzles\"? Not quite. \"Test your wit to survive\"? Failing to answer any of the \"riddles\" in the game doesn't affect you at all. You just get to try again. There are no consequences.\n\nAs for the story, there were definitely some good ideas here, they were just poorly executed and explained. I can appreciate leaving things up to the viewer/player, but this level of vagueness makes it seem less like it was intentional and more like the writer just wasn't sure what he was writing about. I figured out the \"plot twist\" less than halfway through the game, but admittedly, I was still strung along by the \"mystery\". That's in quotes because, apparently my idea of what the game's mystery was didn't match up with what the writer was thinking. About halfway through the game, I had pieced together most of the main character's backstory, and who many of the other characters actually were. But, I still had questions: what was going on in this place? Why were things so strange? For the few characters I didn't understand, where did they fit into this? Unfortunately, very few of those questions were answered were answered at all, and none of those answers left me with any sense of satisfaction. Right when I thought the game was just beginning, it ended and left me hanging.\n\nSpoilers ahead:\n\nCat's backstory is fine and all, but where do characters like the grub/bug woman fit in? Why are there four wolves when we know the blind child has only one dog? Why are they being cursed by the \"sphinx\" from the story Cat's mother told her? Who is the toy maker? Why is there a ghost thing in the maze that teleports me to the start for some reason? This is just the tip of the iceberg. I suppose I may have just not have been paying attention, but if the house in the game is a memory, what are these things Cat is remembering? Is it all a hallucenation? Magic? Beyond that, how did Cat forget all this stuff in the first place? Does she have amnesia? And what's with that ending? Is it supposed to be another plot twist? A cliff-hanger? Like I said before, vague is one thing, and I love to interpret stories like this, but there's just nothing to go on here. There's nothing to analyze. It's just a bunch of stuff lumped together in a story for seemingly little reason. Even a little more flavor text on items in the world might have helped. More  things to explore on my own, instead of Cat telling me exactly what I'm looking at (\"It's a light.\", \"It's a mirror.\", \"It's a plant.\").\n\nSo, ultimately, I can't recommend this for most people. The art is good, the music is good, and if you're really interested in that, the game might be worth $3 just for the short and mildly interesting ride. Most people won't enjoy it, though, I don't think.

Stray Cat Crossing has a lot more polish than most of those. the pixel art graphics themselves are almost worth the admission price, and the music is also great. The story is definatley above average for a RPG maker romp, telling a sad tale of jealousy and domestic neglect. \n\nUnfortunatley, not as much love and care was put into the gameplay. Stray Cat Crossing relies on several \"tricks\" to add artificial length to what otherwise would have been a single sitting game. The most infamous is the theatre section, which I talked about at the start, but it runs through the whole game. Actions (such as rotating a bridge) take ten times as long as they should. An early chase sequence requires you to sit through the same 30 second cutscene every time you retry (And you will die A LOT at that part). A part involving carrying objects slows you down to an absolute slow as hell crawl. All of this builds up, and what started as minor annoyance eventually blossoms into resentment.

Unfortunately, it took me months to finish playing this lovely game since I'm a lazy nuthead and I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a confusing experience for me. The puzzles were nice; not too easy or too tough. The characters were interesting except of the MC. I did like little Cat, though. I could relate to her because (running away from home, feeling unneeded and worthless). Yes, I still feel like a kid in my twenties. The boy with a camera (to be honest, I thought it was a girl) reminds me of Flaky from Happy Tree Friends. I wish I'd get to know his name at least. He was there for Cat when no one else was. \nThis whole game is about letting your past go. Humans make mistakes and it's natural. Someone always ends up getting hurt one way or another. Sometimes there's nothing you can do or say to make things better. Even when it makes you feel useless and you start hating on yourself - just stop right there. You can't beat yourself up over everything you do. That's life, unfortunately. It takes long to learn how to live. Too long. How many of you people are truly happy? I'm not talking about material happiness. Appreciating and cherishing what you have is a good start. 2deep4you? I beg your pardon.

So now having beaten the game let's get to the pros and cons of Stray Cat Crossing.\n\nCons:\n\n- This one might be more of a Windows 10 issue, but this game crashes a lot.  If you press two buttons on the joypad at once, if you accidentally press a non-bound button on your joypad, if you attempt to combine items and so on.  Basically if you give it an excuse to crash it most certainly will.  Fortunately the frequency of save-points is an effective stopgap.\n\n- The lack of volume control.  The volume levels of the music tracks are all over the place and you have no in-game way to adjust the volume.  Some tracks are still deafening at minimum volume settings on my headphones and others need to be turned up to be heard.\n\n- The game is short, like really short.  You can pretty much subtract a half hour of play-time from having to re-do things before I got OCD about saving.  It feels like you've got three quarters of a game here with the semi-final act missing.  Now while I'm sure the creators of the game intended to leave things vague to add to the surrealness of the experience; I feel like it left a lot of characters under-developed.\n\nBut with that said there are some real positives to the game:\n\n+ The music is good stuff, volume levels aside.  It's got the creepy minimalist vibe to it; which enhances the experience.\n\n+ There is some great surreal imagery here.  I played this ony my Twitch stream and there were a lot of instances where what I saw caused me to just stop talking mid-sentence to wrap my head around things.  I want to keep my review spoiler free, so it's hard to go into detail, but nothing is quite as it seems in this game.\n\n+ The art itself in the game is great.  I think the game strives to have it's own sense of style while still delivering a 16 bit retro feel to it.\n\nSo the bottom line is that you are basically getting 3/4ths of a good game; but when you factor in the price of the game you're really getting some decent bang for your buck. \n", "timestamp_created": 1451957210, "timestamp_updated": 1451957210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20307873": {"recommendationid": "20307873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211101472", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444121852}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, from the soundtrack to the story this really has it all.

So when it was brought to me attention that there was an intriguing new title known as Stray Cat Crossing, I had to give it a look over. And while it is far from a complete horror experience, it is an exceptional case of RPG Maker horror done right. A signpost of sorts to guide the way.\n \nIndie devs Jurlo and JetPackGone have created a wonderful, beautiful, creepy little game in Stray Cat Crossing. It goes in the right direction, but never quite reaches its destination.\n\nAfter the first few minutes of Stray Cat Crossing, I was hooked. It grabs the player with some astoundingly pretty presentation. The graphics are reminiscent of GameBoy Advance-era 2D pixel art\u2014charming if sparing animated brightly colored sprites set upon creative backdrops. The world of Stray Cat Crossing is bizarre and fascinating, a fantastical mixture of Silent Hill and Alice in Wonderland. It features creepy anthropomorphic creatures, Japanese Noh masks, freaky babies and theatrical interludes. The horror isn\u2019t outright\u2014the emphasis is placed more upon weirdness and subtle uncanniness. Jurlo\u2019s music manages to bring calm and fright to the atmosphere, laying as it does somewhere between Akira Yamaoka and Yasunori Mitsuda.\n\nStray Cat Crossing places nearly all of its strength into its presentation and atmosphere, and boy does it ever perform this well. Beautiful graphics and sound-work, effective art direction and a flurry of inspirations that come together as something wholly unique. These facets make it worth the price of admission.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not make the whole game. Not everyone places so much value on the presentation. The regrettable flipside of Stray Cat Crossing comes from its two greatest weaknesses: Un-engaging gameplay and a lazily vague plot.\n\nThe gameplay, by itself, is serviceable. Definitely a flaw, but not altogether bad. It simply suffers from never feeling cohesive. One doesn\u2019t get the sense that there was much design philosophy behind the gameplay. There are occasional inventory puzzles. There is one chase sequence involving light platforming. There are some dialogue puzzles. Yet none of this ever seems to come together\u2014they feel like challenge added for the sake of having a sense of gameplay, rather than the game organically developing its play.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the Charnel House Trilogy, which the developer Ashton Raze has admitted did not lend itself well to gameplay. But the devs at Owl Cave Games managed to accept that and work around the game\u2019s inherent shortcomings, doing what they could to make it engaging as a game despite not having much by way of challenge. Stray Cat Crossing\u2018s gameplay feels like a sequence of arbitrary puzzles\u2014some challenging, others not so much\u2014that in the grand scheme just don\u2019t match the rest of the game. They may be filtered over with the game\u2019s atmosphere (filling a fountain in a dark garden with the right amount of water in order to save a giant bug, only to inadvertently lead that bug to be eaten), but they don\u2019t feel like they fit. Puzzles in Stray Cat Crossing are always obstacles. They simply never feel like progress.\n\nIn addition to this, some of the puzzles are just plain bad. The horrendously repetitive final act involves exchanging various items with people in order to gain the script to a play, allowing the play to finish and the game the move forward. Only one must perform the previous scenes of the play multiple times in order to speak to the correct people and obtain the right items. It is essentially one large, monotonous fetch quest, quite unwelcome at any point in a game but especially right at the end.\n\nThen we come to the story. Now, Stray Cat Crossing\u2018s story is by no means bad. In fact there is a lot to like about it. It touches on themes of childhood, jealousy, loss and regret. But its way of being told really distances the player from these themes, leaving them with neither a solid narrative nor a sympathetic character to connect to. Rather we get a quirky cast of one-dimensional creatures and a few curious but ultimately nondescript humans.\n\nThe vague story in indie games has been bugging me for a while now. Perhaps popularized by Limbo, one of the few to actually perform it right, a great deal of indie games have been turning to player interpretation narratives. In only a few isolated cases is the vagueness ever a complement to the overall game. Limbo, for instance, works because it never makes any attempt to really tell a complex story\u2014it only asks that the player experience this weird German expressionist-inspired journey. Another example, Lone Survivor, meanwhile gets a pass because it is a conscious experimentation in dream logic. Stray Cat Crossing doesn\u2019t have these excuses. The execution of the story, as a result, comes off as lazily constructed\u2014a nonlinear sequence of events assembled as a means to set the aforementioned great atmosphere together. They could have combined much more smoothly, but this lack of synchronicity between them causes the story to simply drag the atmosphere down.\n\nThus we have the three pillars of Stray Cat Crossing\u2014atmosphere, gameplay, narrative\u2014and only one is stable. These pillars rely on each other to hold the game up, but Stray Cat Crossing put all its weight on one. And while it doesn\u2019t quite cause the whole game to collapse, the strain definitely pushes the overall experience down a bit.\n\nI like a lot about Stray Cat Crossing, don\u2019t get me wrong. It just doesn\u2019t hold up as a game on its own.

The graphics are beautiful, the art pulls inspiration from all corners of the world, the music is perfect and it has a glistening array of eccentric characters. \n\nThat's not to say it's not without fault. Admittedly I struggled for great lengths of time on some of the puzzles, and even had to look to walkthroughts. At one point it got very repetitive, but honestly I can only say that added to my immersion, a true sense of desperation as you get trapped in this house of horrors. \n\nOn the surface it's polished, well written and exciting, though it truly is a three dimensional game (metaphorically, pardon the pun) its exploration of the darker side of the human psyche left me wanting to play it again from a new perspective.\n\nI can only say- for \u00a31.99 this game is a complete steal.

Most ditch the RPG trappings entirely in favor of a minimalist retro-2D walking simulator style, and most of those tend to be boring or poorly designed. But every once in awhile you'll find a gem in the pile, and Stray Cat Crossing is one of those gems.\n\nYour lovingly-rendered character happens across a small girl wandering the road at night. The girl, Cat, runs off with your treasured scarf and you follow her all the way home like the worst sort of creeper just to get it back. Don't feel bad, though, because her house is full of all kinds of nightmare beings. SCC is a surreal adventure game through symbolic realms of guilt and loss, expressed in a magnificently detailed and colorful art style. Characters are memorable, environments are vivid, and the atmosphere is excellent.\n\nThe sound design is on point as well, but the real stand-outs are the bizarre video clips the game hits you with periodically. Every once in awhile, you'll be interrupted by a short scene that looks cut from the VHS tape in The Ring. These sequences are incredibly jarring and effective. I am not a fan of jumpscares in the least, but these felt well thought-out and earned. They add immeasurably to the atmosphere and help hint at future story beats, as well.\n\nThe story itself is quite good, managing to dabble heavily in symbolism and moralizing without falling into the traps other games often do. There's nothing forced or heavy-handed about the plot developments, and you tend to catch up with things as your tight-lipped protagonist does. The one place the game stumbles is in the puzzles, which start off strong and clever but end on some sour notes. The final sequence is honestly quite clever as well, but in a way that's not actually very fun to get through.

The game follows up a really strict pattern, each place in the house has it story, characters and puzzles and you go trough them as the story guides you.\n\nThe gameplay isn't really the focus here, and when the developers try make it the focus they fail. As you can see in the game description, Stray Cat Crossing was made using the RPGMaker and the game have a little list of flaws because of it as little freezes, crashes and others who are more bad design choices like the infamous escape from the basement or the loop sequence at the attic. \n\nThe game REALLY shines through the story and the things related such as the visuals and music. Going against the preconception of games made through the RPGMaker, this one uses really good looking assets and the art style is really unique, it is creepy but in a way that fires up your curiosity and the same can be said of the music. The plot that starts quite simple at its premise evolves quickly on the 2 hour long game into a sweet story about what is a family and how much love can change bad feelings such as guilt and regret.\n\nAlthough not perfect, this game is great and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of short experiences.

Of course, I was surprised who the actual \"cat\" was and how the real cat had such a trivial role. By saying that, I don't mean it in a bad way. \nThe soundtrack is definitely the best part of the game, it's very atmospheric and I would really be able to listen to it when I'm in need of some good instrumentals. I also very much loved the mini-animated clips when the screen would randomly turn to static; the first time it creeped the hell out of me lol; but they're very artistic. \nThis is a rpg mostly focused on gathering \"pieces\" that make off the overall story and so, most part of the game is going to be focused on puzzles. I personally am a very big fan of these types of rpgs and this one was not a disappointment in that particular area. I had fun trying to solve the puzzles and I didn't find them particularly brain wrecking, so don't worry. Just take a bit of time and you'll manage to solve them on your own.\nI have to also praise the writing when it comes to the dialogues/monologues between the twins. They were, to say the least, fantastic! It really reminded me of TweedleDee and TweedleDum of Alice in Wonderland. Maybe there was a refference there, though I don't know. XD I would be able to relate this game with Alice in Wonderland for some elements, mostly because on some parts it's quite \"unique\" and \"twisted\". But don't expect a girl in a blue dress and a white rabbit. That you won't get. It's more of a \"feeling\". \nThe thing that I'm disappointed in though, is the ending and the revelation of what truly happened. I can't exactly say why; maybe on one side I found it a bit \"trivial\" and \"too simple\". There wasn't any big revelation in the ending, just didn't have enough impact to care about it properly. And it was kind of annoying to repeat the same scene at the end for like 5 times without able to at least skip on the already read text. \nBut overall I still recommend it. 3$ is not much, and it deserves them. \n\nOther games like this one that I would like to recommend if anybody's interested are: Ib, Mad Father, Witch's House and the Crooked Man.", "timestamp_created": 1442180887, "timestamp_updated": 1442180911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17978223": {"recommendationid": "17978223", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987915649", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441554368}, "language": "english", "review": "For what it is, Stray Cat Crossing is interesting and artful RPGMaker game that will last about 2 hours.

While it may normal for these types of games I still found a lot of it irritating.  Seeing as the game is short on things to do it would be nice if the dialogue wa smore fleshed and deeper.

Why you need this scarf so much and just why this house seems to hold so many nightmares within is soon explained in three parts.\n\nAdmittedly, I was waiting for Stray Cat Crossing since greenlight and now that it's out (and cheap) I was happy to play it. You'll be able to play this in one sitting. At the most, you'll do three hours if you're getting stuck. You probably won't.\n\nThere's no real combat in this game other than fleeing from a few monsters. Most of the time you'll be scratching your head over some moderate brain benders, but nothing is really too tricky in this game. The hardest puzzle is the red larvae passwords and that shouldn't be too hard if you listen to the other hints from the larva and try to draw connections to the storyline in that area. You'll figure it out eventually, I promise.\n\nThis game is unusually storyline-rich. There's less gore and less emphasis on the jumpscares (they are there, however, but tend to pop up only in relevance to what you're doing) and more on figuring out Cat's story. I find that some RPG horror games can overdo it on the scaring you out of your skin aspect. This game seeks to disturb you and keeps you involved by introducing these figures in Cat's life. You're immediately shown that Cat feels guilty over something, but why? What is wrong with this tiny little girl and why are you chasing her through this nightmare house that Tim Burton might rent for a summer vacation?\n\nThe music is rather beautiful in the game. I was disappointed to not hear the trailer music anywhere (I'll live!), but every level was delightful. Leaving the game on pause for a quick break wasn't a nightmare. I can see (and hear) the effort. The jumpscare cutscenes are animated very well and while not something that certainly scared me, but made me feel uncomfortable and with an impending sense of doom. I preferred that over screaming in horror. I loved the design of the characters and how other-worldly they felt. While the main character was the only \"normal\" person there, supposedly, they also had a special look to them as well, which made me feel like there was something more.\n\nNow that I've lavished praise, let me talk about my dislikes of the game. I was reduced to only using the arrow keys. A mild annoyance and once I was able to sprint, I didn't complain as much. It gave me a reason to rest my hands across the keyboard. However, after only using the jump function for one part of the game, it was relatively useless. I would have loved to see it again after I had mastered it. (Because that is one angry fetus monster and he did eat me a few times!)\n\nSince I'm a handicapped gamer and I often make reference to it, there is quite a bit of flashing graphics in this game. Do not, by any means, play this game if you are prone to seizures. This game may cause severe migraines. Please take a break and do not play straight through. Otherwise, it wasn't too awful. It's not so much a negative as I was neutral on it. Not my favorite, but if I could have turn it off, I would have loved to.\n\nWhat I loved the most from Stray Cat Crossing is that I didn't expect needing to grab a box of tissues by the end. I was sobbing. I was hugging my laptop and sobbing. I've already mentioned it, but allow me to do so again. The storyline really has a lovely build up. You're already piecing together the truth, but once everything is revealed and you have your confirmation of Cat's life, you will feel like your heart is being ripped out. With emotional lines and capturing the feelings of love between family members and friends, Stray Cat Crossing has a theme of love and never forgetting your past, even if it gives you some of the greatest pain you can ever endure.\n\nPlay it. It's a good way to blow off two hours and it really is cheap. You won't get your typical horror rocks off from it, but it's a much more artsy style of horror.\n\nFrom what I saw of the ending?

It is at times reminiscient of movie scores by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor (Gone Girl, The Social Network, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), eerie and discordant, and at times creepy carnival music\u2014an appreciated clich\u00e9. \n\nIt's not a particularly scary game after you complete the first \"stage,\" but it does maintain a very unsettling atmosphere the entire time. You even feel, in the best way possible, faintly unsettled after the ending. \n\nWhat I really enjoy about SSC is that it doesn't hold your hand through the puzzles. Often when I play RPG maker games it feels like I'm just constantly being spoon-fed instructions, and it takes away from the actual fun of the gameplay. Of course, there is the opposite problem of not being given any direction and subsequently becoming really lost, but SCC's puzzles were never so difficult as to frustrate me and detract from the immersion. Instead, you feel satisfied for solving something on your own in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe story itself wasn't anything incredible; by around halfway through the game, I felt like I already (mostly) knew what was going on. However, the game's symbolism of that story is awesome. I plan on going back and playing it a second time just so I can fully appreciate the rich imagery, as well as little details hidden in book titles and whatnot.\n\nAlthough the characters weren't particularly compelling, esp. the main character, I didn't mind at all. SCC felt like playing a work of art; it didn't need a 3D main character to make the game interesting. The visuals, gameplay and symbolism were more than enough to make SCC an enjoyable experience.\n\nTL;DR - Great game. Amazing atmosphere and music. Rich symbolism and imagery. Good, smart gameplay.

I liked that the game tried to make sure that the puzzles were intuitive through gameplay, without much specific info-dump-like dialogue.

The game itself was a semi-memorable experience. Is it horror? Not really. Were there jump scares? A few. Most reviewers have commented on the Alice in Wonderland vibe as well as the more Ghibli-esque elements so I won't mention those here.\n\nOne mechanic I found interesting, albeit frustrating, occurs during the first level with Baby face. Once you complete \"favors for favors\" you are presented with verbose seemingly redundant dialogue. If the player scrolls through too quickly they will auto-select \"yes\" to a question that ulitmately ends the game. While annoying for some, this mechanic caused me to slow down and take note of the game design's self awareness. \n\n--Aesthetic, SCC knows who it is and what it's going for. Overall, I felt it was similar to \"The Witch's House\" with much nicer graphics. \n--Story itself was fairly predictable, no \"twists\" or \"turns\" to really speak of. \n--Dialogue was average\n--Level design was enjoyable until the third arc which was repititive with little to no payoff.\n--Replayability: little to none\n\nTL;DR: I sound hyper critical but the game was an enjoyable experience.

There isn't much in the way of challange to it but that's alright. The core of the gameplay can be summed up as bumping from point A to point B, interacting with something or someone in order to advance the story. There are several puzzles thrown in to spice things up a bit, which is certainly a welcome decision. Everything is pretty straightforward, though, so there is little chance to get stuck for more than a couple of minutes at the same point. The single exception to this could be a small but very unforgiving action sequence (which I sincerely hope is tonned down at some point).\n\nThe story is intriguing, though the game never really takes the time to explain some details and lets the player imagination fill the gaps. The music is great and adds a lot to the ambience. The art is nice too and has a lot of personality. The backgrounds can get a bit repetitive, but they are populated with big, detailed props which really help to ease that feeling. All these elements feel well integrated with nice shadowing arround them and simple lighting effects livening things up a bit. The sound effects are maybe a bit lacking, with very simple PSG-like samples played to give feedback about things like locked doors.\n\nAs for the tone of the game, it certainly fits the horror label in the beginning. But this aspect is progressively downplayed and the final act pretty much drops it completly. If you come expecting a traditional horror experience you may feel disapointed.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this title and found it's release price very fitting.

This one is pretty OK, but indeed very easy and stringent. What in fact annoys me a lot: Never have I experienced a game with so many bugs to be released. Depending on if Iplay in Fullscreen or small screen (but sometimes it's the other way round) Iget thrown out of the game. The first time after 2 minutes, if Itry to open up the inventory. I have the feeling, there was no exact testing of the game, because every behaviour that is not perfect according to the solution seems to end in me being thrown out. So I saved a lot (which also resulted in being thrown out, but at least the save stand stayed...) and played for a while. \nBecause the game really is nothing special at all, at least in my opinion, and because I think a game should at least be properly tested before being released, no matter how many updates follow that correct the bugs, I wouldn't recommend it. \nSo my review has two sides, a very subjective one, according to the frustrating experience of repeatedly having to start again, to play. And one, trying to be more objective: the game atmosphere, the graphics, the storyline: not very innovative. There are lots of games, for examples the ones translated by vgperson (just search this via google) that are a lot more interesting, very outstanding and indeed creepy, in a deeper kind of way.

The Alice in Wonderland vibe I got from the game hooked me for good and I was definitely interested in the final product upon release. This purchase did not leave me disappointed.\n\nYou start off as an unamed girl merely being a decent human being to a lost child named Cat by escorting her home, and when you reach your destination you're pulled into a house of mysterious creatures and settings as you discover just who Cat is. Now, I'm not familiar with games made from RPG maker - though I have heard some negative things - but in my opinion this is one of the better ones. The pixel art is indeed gorgeous and well done (the cutscenes served their purpose well too), and the puzzles were a perfect balance of \"Oh, I know this,\" and \"Hmm, gotta actually think.\" It's not really horror in the traditional sense of inducing fear, but I suppose one could see some of the creatures and actions as disturbing. The soundtrack was hauntingly perfect and set the mood for everywhere the protagonist traveled, and as the plot unfolded before my eyes I was surprised in a bittersweet way.\n\nThe only gripes I had with this game is the keyboard layout and steam overlay. Although the controls are few and simple (up, down, left, right to move, enter/space to interact, shift to run, and A to jump), there was only the one scene where jump was introduced that I had trouble with. It felt awkward using shift and A at the same time and I wish I could've changed the jump command from A to space, but I managed through the scene. As for the steam overlay it's nonexistent, and while it's not necessarily a bad thing, it would've been nice to know that attempting to screenshot via F12 would actually bring me back to the menu screen and I hadn't saved for a while.\n\nAll in all, I could totally see this game extended a bit since I was left with a few questions, but for $2.99 and roughly 2 hours of gameplay I definitely recommend Stray Cat Crossing.

The demo covers tthe first act of three in the game. I was interested by the Ghibli-styled horror, and the first act delivered some chilling moments. However, after the first act I felt the game tone the horror down. Nothing really comes after you and the sense of dread is replaced by wonder, which is alright by I really wanted a horror experience, especially after the first act. The third act is item fetching and LOTS of repetition, and the horror elements are completely sapped.\n\nThe story is interesting, but not without poor writing. Lots of unneccessary characters and too many unexplained details. It's not hard to figure out what exactly happened by the end, but there are questions that will nag at you.\n\nThis game has incredible visuals for a 2D game. The characters are well designed and the locations are incredible. This and the amazing soundtrack are the best parts about this game.\n\nGameplay is alright. You have a run button to go places faster and there is one instance where you have the option to jump. Puzzles are way too easy. There's only one or two instances where you might die, so the rest plays like an interactive novel.", "timestamp_created": 1440809303, "timestamp_updated": 1440809303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40897587": {"recommendationid": "40897587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074691072", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 169, "last_played": 1521312829}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0443, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0443\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0441\u044e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430.

It boasts beautifully crafted art and a surreal dark fantasy story about loss and loneliness. The game does a very good job building a creepy yet alluring atmosphere using art, music, and surreal imagery. The puzzles in the game are challenging and interesting without ever being too frustrating or obscure. The game hooked me in from start to finish.\n\nThe game length is short, only 2-2.5 hours maximum, so I\u2019d say the price is fair for what the game delivers.\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect game by any means though. Some of the things in the game that I thought were not so great are:\n\n- some of the music tracks sounded grating to me, which is a shame since most of the soundtrack is decent or good\n- one of the last few puzzles gets tediously repetitive \n- the protagonist never really seems fazed by any of the crazy things that happen around her??? Which I found odd. Her personality can come off as rather bland.\n- Quite a bit of the story is left ambiguous/open to interpretation, which can be both interesting and somewhat annoying.\n\nOn a side note, the game also has a few jumpscares if you aren\u2019t a fan of those. \n\nRegardless, Stray Cat Crossing overall is worthwhile, especially since it doesn\u2019t cost much. I give it a 7/10. It\u2019s worth checking out if you\u2019re interested and/or enjoy pixel horror games.", "timestamp_created": 1520723321, "timestamp_updated": 1520723833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40453801": {"recommendationid": "40453801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120384596", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519794565}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat this game in about 2 hours, The story is great, the pacing is perfect and the graphics are nice.

The trading and colonizing aspects of this game are incredibly fun but literally everything you do in combat removes score from all the other factions reputation. One battle and you trash all the work you've done. This leads to a downward spiral of constantly being a target for war because you are so hated by everyone. You either lose everything you have to people with more resources than you can even try to get, or you pay a large sum of money to get them off your back for a week. I enjoyed every minute of it until I had my first war for the above reasons. After that first war, all of my positve rep was turned to -100 and the number #1 rated company with literal access to a shipyard was after me. It was incredibly frustrating to have this happen and I don't think I'll play another game of this for a while. And when I do, I will avoid conflict like the plague.", "timestamp_created": 1514244065, "timestamp_updated": 1514244065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38489579": {"recommendationid": "38489579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091698832", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512273314}, "language": "english", "review": "Helium Rain is not a bad game, but it does have some things that are just a kill for me. The main one is traveling between systems. Rather than doing the traveling yourself, you simply set your destination and hit a button to simulate time that has passed to get to your new destination. So, to me, it feels like you're just playing in different rooms. No feeling of distance, or traveling. When it comes to space games, you're talking distance and traveling. The way this is set up, it just feels wrong. \n\nSome of the missions just make no sense. In the real world, today, you wouldn't give a stranger a ride to the store just so you can get some reputation increase from him. Well in this game some of the missions will reward you with research or reputation gain. Please correct me if I'm wrong, that is just how i seen it while in game. Yes, many missions do reward you with monetary rewards, and some would argue that the research rewards can be worth it as well. fair enough.  Still, if I was creating a business, the last thing i would want to do is give a free ride to someone who will feel better about me by doing so. \n\nThat really is my big gripe with the game. It has many good things as well. Trading feels rewarding, ship movement does not have speed restrictions, it really feels like you are navigating in space.  Granted, this is only in each sector. Not sector to sector travel. Again that is obtained by simply skiping time into the magical future. \n\nSo I'm nuetral about this game. If i could give a neutral rating i would, but with steam it's always a Go, No Go situation. \n\nI have hopes for the future of this game. I have enjoyed it somewhat for the few hours I have played and hope the devs continue to develop this into what could be one of the greats.", "timestamp_created": 1513862642, "timestamp_updated": 1513862642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38345055": {"recommendationid": "38345055", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984801272", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513415026}, "language": "french", "review": "Vous aimez la s\u00e9rie T\u00e9l\u00e9 \"The Expanse\"?

If you enjoyed X\u00b3, Elite:Dangerous or EVE Online, or if you just wanted to build your own industrial empire in space, I\u2019d highly recommend you give Helium Rain a try.\n\n[h1]What do I get to do in this game?[/h1]\n\nYou start out in a scrappy little shuttle, hopping from station to station, flying with 6DoF and Newtonian flight physics, and spinning and lining up your ship to perform docking manoeuvres. For those of you who prefer more economics and less flying, Autopilot and Auto-dock are also available.\n\nYou\u2019ll work your way up towards purchasing freighters and building a trading fleet, making money hauling goods from A to B. As you buy low and sell high to corner the market, you\u2019ll amass enough wealth to start building your mines and factories of your own, cutting your competitors out of the market.\n\nBut beware! Pirates and less scrupulous corporations won\u2019t stand by watching idly. You\u2019ll have to invest in your own defense fleet to escort your haulers and protect your assets from the greedy paws of others who are after your hard earned coin.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1][list]\n[*][b]Economic simulation:[/b] every good and asset in game is produced by a factory, supplied with goods produced elsewhere. \n\n[*][b]Fleets:[/b] the game is built around the player owning multiple fleets spread across the system. You can choose to micromanage or set up preset trading routes\n\n[*][b]Flight model:[/b] No speed limits: you can accelerate as much as you want, just remember that you\u2019ll need to decelerate unless you want to overshoot your target and drift into space. At your disposal are forward/backward thrust, pitching, yawing, rolling, and lateral/longitudinal strafing.\n\n[*][b]Dev feedback:[/b] The game is actively being worked on and the developers regularly provide feedback both on here and on the game\u2019s website.\n\n[*][b]Graphics:[/b] The game has a beautifully polished aesthetic going for it. It adds a lot of character that really make it stand out from the crowd.[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1] [i]Not so much cons, but features that still need a bit of dev love before the game leaves Early Access:[/i] [list]\n[*][b]User Interface[/b] has a few niggles here and there that begin to manifest in the mid to late game when you have large amounts of assets to keep track of. Especially noticeable is the lack of a Journal recording your cash flow.\n\n[*][b]AI corporations[/b] feel like they lack differentiation. Shipyards will gladly take orders to build fighters for pirates, only to the summarily attacked by them. Peaceful corporations seem to just turtle and amass wealth.\n\n[*][b]Simulation speed[/b] begins to slowdown in the end game due to corporations expanding without enough resistance.[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nPersonally, I am a dozen hours into my first playthrough in the first 2 days of buying the game. I\u2019ll still play Elite:Dangerous for the combat, atmosphere and immersion of the spaceships, and EVE Online has its niche as the MMO for space economies, but Helium Rain has established itself as my go-to option for single-player spaceship economy tycoon empire building.", "timestamp_created": 1511729373, "timestamp_updated": 1511729573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594470", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37516974": {"recommendationid": "37516974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071611456", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 535, "last_played": 1514673392}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you watched the TV series called \"The Expanse\"? Have you ever wanted the game in similar setting? Search no longer - Helium Rain is what you need!\nThis game cointain technology and designs that are very close that that theme (aka plausible close future tech - so no hyperdrives, no shields and no Star Wars pew pew pew lasers).\n\nIt also gives very good \"early colonization of remote star system\" wibe.\nThe trading, station building, military oeprations - everything is on good and deep quality (casuals beware!)\n\n\nDon't let the \"Early Acess tag\" fool you. In current state the game offer plenty of good and stable gameplay.\n\nPros:\n- simple, but great ships and station designs (sphere shipyard in Blue Heart is my favorite)\n- well ballanced trade and economy\n- well designed star system\n- ability to own your own ships, stations, shipyards.\n- good price to content ratio -

Don't get discouraged by the grinding in early game, it gets much more complex and diversified as soon as you get a fleet. There will definitely be some hauling to get through first, but manual docking takes only 10 seconds once you're used to it and seeing your progress in that task will make it very rewarding, even without a HOTAS. Or you can buy an autodocking technology to make it as easy as a click, but in my opinion, it just lowers the potential and depth of the game; if you're into space simulations and piloting, then no need to make money faster by doing more trips thanks to the autodocking, it's not a competitive multiplayer game, take your time and play each trip. Hauling is more fun in HR than in Elite from my perspective, and fortunately it won't be your main task for weeks.\n\nAt the beginning, after a few hours, I thought myself that this game was beautiful and felt great, but unfortunately was going to be repetitive and lack content. I'm happy to say it proved me wrong (but the game can definitely use more content of course), however it all depends on how you play and how you expand your colony, it's possible that the game could evolve in more or less interestings ways depending on your actions.\n\nAs soon as you get a fleet, it is much easier to make money since you can specialize a ship into trading (and the trading routes system is complex enough, I was expecting something much simpler, very good surprise here), or start using fighter ships with contracts that tend to pay better rewards. Overall, the money/docking ratio increases quite fast as soon as your fleet and company build up, and the diversity of the gameplay as well.\n\nThe UI looks great and is actually convenient once you mastered it, but it takes some getting used to. A few more hints on where to find specific functions would help sometimes, it's not always obvious that the warning about missing components for building a ship would be in the orbital map for instance, or that you'd have to go check the shipyard in its sector screen to know what is missing, I was initially just looking into my Company screen to check the status of the ship I ordered. More filters in the Economy screen, and a way to show which stations buy what in that same screen would be useful, as well as a Search field for specific ressources in the Sector screen. But all that is really rather minor, the UI is already nice to use and feels a lot less crippled than Elite's sy-fy/immersive UI for instance.\n\nSo if the beginning of the game looks repetitive and boring to you, try to hang on, it gets better and the game has a great potential. I have played or backed many space sims, from KSP to Elite: Dangerous, Star Citizen or Rogue System (very recommended if you are into hardcore DCS-like sims). KSP is a jewel, but is admittedly quite a different game. Helium Rain is the game I didn't see coming, and yet it's the single best space opera I've played so far. Beautiful, several things to do, good flight models that feels just right, real physics (no cap on velocity as long as you keep burning; only saw it in KSP and Rogue System so far), deep if you care about the company system, real sandbox with an impact on the world, and I have to add that the orchestral music is beautiful and fits perfectly the pleasant ambiance of the game. Playing this game feels like watching [i]2001: A space odyssey[/i]; not that the music or assets are similar, but your brain and eyes will feel the same.\n\nIf you are into space sims and not necessarily intense shooters with fancy effects everywhere, you will like it (even the fights are nice, much calmer than fights in other space games, and it's not a bad thing). If you're into intense shooters, think twice, but give it a try, you may like what you'll see. If you're into trading, you may like it, but you will have to go through some piloting first. In any case, don't expect an AAA game with 52 billions stars or a mix of FPS/Fight/Exploration and 160M funding, but do expect a game beautifully made with a great attention to the details. The game is not expensive and is well worth that price, or more. The team have opened their source code, have a public bug tracker (with visible progress), communication is great, and their first game is good, it's encouraging to see development going this way.\n\nThere is a minor bug in the current build with UE4 on Linux with AMD mesa drivers, basically there's no bright sunlights on my computer. Sad. And then, looking at screenshots and videos, I realized I much prefer the game this way, looks more realistic and just more \"space\" when the bright anodized paints are more subtle in the shade.

A smaller, more refined attempt rather than featuring dozens of specific zones to explore and trade in. It is sadly more simplified though, where sending ships to automatically trade instead makes them sell to all stations within a Sector who are willing to buy, instead of setting a single station to manually trade with. But it adds its own level of complexity to ship systems. You can disable engines, weapons, power. You don't need to destroy a ship to win the fight. Movement feels good, combat feels good. There's not much more to say here. Its good.\n\nThe AI: If any of us have played the X games then we should all know the AI is terrible in those. I've been pleasantly surprised by Helium Rains AI pathways. Auto-Docking is cleaner than i ever could have thought possible. Though bugs do persist that requires me to manually dock sometimes.\n\nResponsive Developers - As far as I have seen the development team appear responsive to suggestions and tweaks. It is always nice to see an Early Access game that is cared for publicly.\n\nCons:\n\nExploration - Rather than going through Warp Gates to reach zones, you instead 'Fast Forward' after selecting a spot orbiting one of the four planetoids in the Menu. It can feel as though it is removing you from the flow of the game as days pass by in-game before you reach your destination but for you it is merely 1 second per day. It feels too much like teleportation since you can do it from any area to any discovered zone. It takes seconds to reach the other side of colonized space, causing this sensation of disconnection with events in-game.\n\nThe Menus - Though the UI is certainly well designed and easy to navigate, half of your time will be spent inside of it. This also suffers from taking you out of the perspective of the Universe. The game feels almost half like an Information terminal sometimes. Watch gameplay of Helium Rain and you will see a Window taking up the entire screen with text more often than you would think. Not a con if you like this terminal-focussed gameplay, but for me it can become frustrating not knowing whats going on around me while im inside of it. (The game continues in real-time when you open it up)\n\nStar System design - The trailer and screenshots shown tend to focus on the handful of Zones that genuinely look breathtaking. But these are far and in-between. Most of the regions you will explore look barren, with only the odd few asteroids to give aesthetics. Along with this, these systems tend to have the Stations clumped together in close clusters. Giving the impression that these were rushed into creation to get the economy up and running first, aesthetics later.\n\nFactions: Each Company in the game has a monopoly on their chosen industry. You are the new comer, someone who can choose which industry to focus on and act competitively against one of the Dominant Corporations. There exists a reputation system, which I tend to love in Video Games. But I dont feel it is handled well in Helium Rain. There are no set rivals for each company, aside from Pirates. I haven't waged war yet to see if it affects reputation, but I feel it is a large miss for reputation to not be dynamic. If you want to be cosy with one faction then another should totally begin to hate you for it.  You could go the entire game being neutral to all and friendly with some and face no consequences. But that's just my opinion. I liked how Freelancer handled it is all. You simply couldn't be neutral with everyone at once, someone will always hate your guts, which kept things dynamic.\n\nEconomy - Speaking of the Economy, it leaves much to be desired in its current state. I have found simply saving up for a large transport and then buying a full cargo of water and parking it in a Sector that consumes the most of it for trading can make the entire purpose behind the games ability to buy stations and wage wars completely mute. With 2k a day in profits, you can simply click the Fast-Forward button and leave it at that. Gaining a hundred thousand within 50 seconds. You simply do not need to do anything else to make money. And if you really wanted to abuse the economy, you could repeat this step by buying more transports and selling resources where they are most consumed over time, your supplies will always be bought first so there's no need to worry about the AI selling them before you. The game has a very unbalanced economy and the existence of a fast forward mechanic seems to work against the premise of doing missions and undercutting your competition as you will simply only be doing them for the early game. It is just not worth doing anything other than sitting through the fast forward process because the Time Wasted versus Profits Gained ratio is so far out of scale that its just more beneficial to just not bother at all. Building stations in fact act more as a drain to your income than an actual benefit.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all the game is still early in development and these are issues that can and likely will be fixed given enough time. I'd completely recommend the game in its current state as long as you enter into it with a refusal to abuse the economy and take all the fun out of it.

The UI is clean, functional and I also found it intuitive so far.\n\nGameplay-wise, it seems very similar to a cleaned up X3. I attribute a lot of that cleaner feel to the way the game handles trading and travel. There are no gates, and transfering to different orbits takes days, but days can be fast forwarded through. Days also act as turns for resolving automated trade activities and constructions (and other events during war or metorite intercepts).\n\nThe combat was responsive and fun. It seems like it can be easy to disable parts of ships, but destroying them takes a lot more. This turns out to be a good thing since the combat ends when ships are disabled rather than destroyed. So even if you loose a fight, you likely will only need to pay to repair your drifting damaged ships instead of having to construct entirely new ones. I haven't tried combat using larger ships yet.\n\nDefinately can recommend this one. The developers are also very active, listen to observations/suggestions, and are willing to discuss them. In some cases they have implemented suggestions very quickly. The game already feels mostly finished and it runs great (no stuttering/performance issues, and no crashes).", "timestamp_created": 1504473212, "timestamp_updated": 1504473212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524913", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34719940": {"recommendationid": "34719940", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967013685", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504469360}, "language": "english", "review": "A love at first sight for any X-series fan.\n\nFirst impressions after 3h:\n- wow, for an early access title it's amazingly stable!\n- nice graphics and a well-thought-out UI\n--> the game is being built around a very solid, already functioning technical basis\n\n- non-scripted economics model\n- own stations, production chains, trade routes\n--> how long I've been waiting for all that!\n\n- regular updates with significant improvements and adjustments\n- features and ideas are being proactively discussed with the community\n--> EA done right\n\nAll in all, Helium Rain is very well playable and worth the $15 even now.\nWith the potential of turning into a truly unique gem.", "timestamp_created": 1504467492, "timestamp_updated": 1504467492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34686617": {"recommendationid": "34686617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068159053", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504895283}, "language": "french", "review": "Un X-like moderne, simplifi\u00e9 mais dans le bon sens.

one for me: it's fun immediately. There's some complexity here but it lacks the vertical learning curve of X3 or Evochron. Piloting is fun and doesn't take long to get used to. Mouse look, WASD, QE to roll, and Shift/Ctrl for strafing up and down. It doesn't need to hide anything behind obtuse mechanics, the whole feel is streamlined and efficient.\n\n   [*]Never thought I'd say this, but manually docking is...really enjoyable. This game makes me feel like Riker in [i]Encounter at Farpoint[/i] every time, I love it! \n\n    [*]Intuitive GUI, pretty colors. It got easy to fly through the menus after just a few contracts.\n\n    [*]The graphics are cool and look good, yet it runs smoothly on my potato laptop.\n\n    [*]The contract system is great. One of the things I dislike about some other space trader games is having to keep track of prices for all the wares to try to get the best deal. Some require pen and paper...Contracts do away with that, you accept one or three and make the money upon completion. There are certain restrictions like you can't be at war with the destination, but there doesn't seem to be a time limit for completion.\n\n    [*]The scenery...love the look of this game with the cool temperature palette and fresh hardware designs and I have never played a game that looks like this before. The lighting is stark and well done.\n[/list]\n\nAnyway, I'm still rocking a single ship in the first solar system so there's tons left to see like fleets and empire building, but right now it's looking pretty good. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1504063659, "timestamp_updated": 1504063659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34566422": {"recommendationid": "34566422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062259956", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504797131}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been looking for a game that recaptures the magic of X3 for a long time. It is rare to find a space sim that has the same ethos as X3: your goal is to build an empire, and you build fleets to protect that empire, rather than the more common philosophy of \"it's fun to blow stuff up, so that's the main goal\". But the devs are well on their way to delivering this, even though the game is VERY early access. I'm really quite surprised at how much there is since it was released (in EA) like a week ago. I really, really hope they continue to develop this game. So if you like space trading sims, it is playable as is but will no doubt get better and better. Probably its biggest advantage over X3 is a pretty sane interface.\n\nThe rest of my review is notes and suggestions to the devs:\n\n- The number of sectors is just too small for a long-running game. It is nice to start, though.\n\n- More goods, more stations, more ship types, and more weapon types are needed. I'm sure these are all forthcoming, although the current content is great for the current stage of development.\n\n- I haven't done any combat yet although I couldn't easily find commands for a military fleet to \"patrol this sector\" (with all my stations) and so on. There is apparently no need or purpose to build a military fleet to protect my traders from pirates etc. I'm pretty nervous to try combat actually, as to do that I'd have to declare war, and there is apparently no \"revert to save\" option. (EDIT: I was right about \"no revert to save\" being a problem, because once you get into a war with one company, you'll shortly find yourself in a war with everyone...but wrong about the \"no combat ships needed\", as it turns out)\n\n- If research is supposed to be a key part of the game, there needs to be a lot more to research. In particular, (more) ship upgrades, tiers of ships/weapons, and so on.\n\n- Contracts do not seem to scale with reputation, ship capabilities (other than military), or anything else. So later game, contracts become useless and too small to bother with really. (EDIT: I think it does scale with the needs of the factories, so that as NPC factories level up, contracts get bigger. If so, scratch this one).\n\n- Not sure about how I feel about the \"you have to discover new sectors via VIP or telescope\" mechanic. Seems a bit contrived.\n\n- The diplomacy system seems underdeveloped, at least at this point in my playing. I'm not sure why it benefits you to curry favor or hurts you to lose it (as long as you lose favor with less powerful corps).\n\n- No incentive for exploration. I'm all about the trading sim obviously, but it would be nice to have more things to do while you wait for your factories and trading fleets to make you obscenely wealthy.\n\n- It hurts me to say this because I fear it will get nerfed, but the Atlas seems overpowered to me. Basically the cost difference between bad and awesome ships is too small IMO.\n\n- I built a habitat thinking it would make me credits from taxes or something, but it seemingly consumes resources for no reason. Is there some benefit to population?\n\n- Sometimes I am in the middle of autodocking and it cancels for no apparent reason. It may be because I frequently ALT-TAB (or the Linux equivalent) out of the game while I'm waiting to dock. Speaking of autodocking, it should just be built-in, not researchable. Manual docking at the beginning is annoying as balls, and it was the first thing I researched anyway.\n\n- I think instead of in-game tutorials, at least for the intermediate concepts, like making a trade fleet, there should be an in-game wiki or something. I got halfway through \"making a trade fleet\" and then forgot how to do the first few steps of it.\n\n- Oh, BTW, thanks for Linux support.

You'll find bugs, typos, all the old favorites, but the developers are extremely receptive (they even have their own Redmine server you can log and track bugs in) and quick to turnaround fixes and enhancement.\n\nPast the Early Access considerations, you're left with a very compact, but utterly hypnotic space trading/combat game.  \"Compact\" because HR eschews the current trend of \"fifteen trillion stars!\" for just a handful of planets and sectors, but those planets and sectors are never without plenty to do, from running simple courier missions to building space stations, developing a trade fleet, commanding an economic empire.  Fly one ship while the rest of your fleet is own doing your bidding (and hopefully making some money while they're at it.)  For me it's almost reminiscent of something like Euro Truck Simulator 2 in that regard.  Except in space.  And with guns.\n\nOn the surface, look at the screenshots.  The washed out, high-contrast colors and dreamlike music confer one of the most \"chill\" space games I can remember.

That's something to keep in mind.\nI've encountered a couple of very minor bugs, none of which interrupt the game. It runs stable, great frame rate, and haven't had a crash at all. Which can't be said for a lot of other games in early development on Steam (and in full release too).\nThe game itself feels like the X series with Elite and mildly inspired Kerbal Space Program. The physics make it interesting and while at first I was concerned it would be a chore to fly around with the momentum, the game is good about adjusting to your controls and where your mouse is pointing (or where you adjust your view if you use a gamepad).\nThe game does feel sparsely populated and stations are relatively close together. I haven't played very long (4 hours in), but there doesn't feel like much reason to explore just yet. On the other hand I'm still doing tutorial contracts and understanding the game, so there might be a lot that opens up. There appears to be a story/plot that you can follow, but seems to be ultimately an optional contract to start.\nTrading works like you would expect. Stations require specific resources. Some produce specific resources. You purchase the products and sell them to places that have them in demand. One unique aspect in the game is a live economy. It's a welcome aspect that causes natural changes in prices and I look forward to using this to my advantage as I progress in the game.\nWhile the interface seems relatively bland and light, it works very well. The docking information is very helpful in lining up your ship and feels satisfying to have the magnetic bonding occur when you get close. Finding the right information in the menus is a bit of an issue. It feels cumbersome to look up where locations are, how long it'll take to fly there, then enter another menu to look up economic information. On one hand I'd hate it if it made it extremely clear since half the fun of a game like this is finding a trade route, not just having it handed to you. On the other, I'd like to see this design improved in the future. As you start to get additional ships, this sort of management process is more crucial. However there is an option to make trade routes that I assume send your other ships out to do the route automated. If that's the case, then there isn't much issue once they go on their merry way.\n\nUltimatly I'm happy with this game at this price point. The game feels light on polish and interface, but feels relatively solid in features and content. I'm hoping to see a wider variety of locations, ships, equipment, and items to move in the future, but there's a lot of potential here and the developers are very active on Reddit and on their own forum.

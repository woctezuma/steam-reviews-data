Is it as good as I remember? Well, no. Is it still fun? Yes.\n\nIt's a simple enough game. Eat smaller fish, grow bigger, eat the previously bigger but now smaller fish. I finished the game in about 8 hours, however I did take a lot of breaks inbetween levels to go do other stuff. And while I did lose all my lives, I didn't lose all my continues. By the time I got to the last level I was on my last continue. However, this isn't really because the game is super challenging, so to say.\n\nOne of the main flaws with this game for me is that it's pretty frustrating, and rather unfair at times. When you have a screen that's zoomed in on your big fish it's kind of hard to tell what's around you. One wrong move and you end up in the mouth of a giant fish you had no clue was even there, and by the time you see it it's too late. While this issue isn't present in the whole game, it's still there, making it so you can lose your lives in pretty unfair ways late in the game. \n\nThe story is simple and kid-friendly, and if you're just looking for a little bit of fun for a couple of hours, then go ahead and pick this up I guess. However, I'm not sure that this game will click with everybody. I grew up playing these kinds of Popcap games on my dad's computer. Playing this is like getting slapped in the face with a nostalgia fish.\n\nI've also bought this game at least 3 times by now, I think. I have honestly lost count, because I always lost those codes Popcap would give you when buying it from them. Definitely a lot easier when doing it on Steam! \n\nNow, would I recommend this game? I'm not sure, to be completely honest, as I'm writing this. You've probably already seen whether or not that thumb is pointing up and down. Even though I did enjoy it, I'm not sure if most people who didn't grow up playing this and the original would, which is why I can't say I recommend it.\n\nHowever, if you think this game looks fun and you think you'd enjoy it, then go ahead and try it out.

I used to play this game all the time as a kid. I was scared of it the first time I played it, but it soon became my favorite game to play, along with Diner Dash and Wedding Dash. I'm so glad they brought this game to Steam and that I am able to play the game again. I hope one day they will bring the first Feeding Frenzy, as well as some other older games. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone. Even if you beat it really quickly it's still fun to play again. It takes about 2 hours to beat the game on average. It can be a little too easy sometimes, but it makes up for it in some other levels. You can wind up losing about 20 lives all in one level, expecially ones with poison minnows and mines.

Nor is it surprising that it is all but forgotten about except for the occasional burst of nostalgia of mid 00s pc gaming.\n\nGets points for working just fine from the get-go on Win 10 for me, but no controller or resolution alternatives means no recommendation of this game.

A little repetitive but they throw in new items and fish as you progess to keep it interesting. The goal is to eat smaller fish while avoiding bigger fish until you are big enough to eat them as well. The ultimate goal is to keep doing this with various fish to discover this mysterious predator that has been lurking by the entire game.\n\nOverall the game is fun, a little addictive and somewhat replayable. The campaign is a little short but long enough to make it fun and the difficulty ranges from very easy at the beginning to a decent challenge towards the end. However, if you lose all your lives, you can restart from the same level, so it is more of a casual game where staying alive for many levels only really affects your high score. When I was young it was one of my favourite games so I highly recommend it for younger players and mildly recommend it to others to kill some time, otherwize they might blow through the game quickly and be bored.

It's a static reference to our predators and prey, dictating the creatures we're able to dominate, and those we would be better off avoiding. Sitting on the top of the chain, we as humans need not worry about being spontaneously eaten while simply out on a morning walk, but for the aquatic dwellers in Feeding Frenzy 2 it's a constant race to eat or be eaten, with a constantly evolving menu as every fish fills its belly and inflates itself in order to devour more and more. Morbid stuff for a casual game.\n\nFeeding Frenzy 2 essentially works on the basis that there's always a bigger fish, and you want to be it. Gameplay is almost suffocatingly simple, boiling down to \"eat what's smaller than you; avoid what's bigger\" with the only change coming when you eat enough of the smaller fish that you're no longer one of them, and can then swim around chomping on everything that moves. It's basic, though undeniably enjoyable for what it is.

There is a nice surprise after you beat the game, and for some added replayability and challenge, there is a time attack mode.", "timestamp_created": 1398902732, "timestamp_updated": 1398902732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502412", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9971483": {"recommendationid": "9971483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022326399", "num_games_owned": 1347, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 1312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398785694}, "language": "czech", "review": "Z\u00e1bavn\u00e1 minihra.

It is also the sequel to the 2004 title, Feeding Frenzy. The game was developed and published by PopCap Games.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Gameplay\n    2 Plot\n        2.1 Special abilities\n        2.2 Power-ups\n        2.3 Environments\n            2.3.1 Above water challenges\n            2.3.2 Midnight Zone\n        2.4 Playable characters\n    3 References\n    4 External links\n\nGameplay\n\nAs in Feeding Frenzy, players have to control several fast growing marine predators who are out to uncover a mystery which is lurking in the ocean. The aim of the game is to avoid predators and obstacles while eating other smaller fish and creatures, eventually reaching the top of the food chain. Feeding Frenzy 2 includes 60 new levels which feature scenery such as new underwater worlds, coral reefs, deep sea caves, and sunken ships, as well as above water challenges. The story mode starts the player as a small butterfly fish named Boris. The player has to eat and chomp his or her way to the top of the food chain. Along the way, the player meets new creatures, both friendly and unfriendly.\nPlot\n\nThe player controls different fishes. We start first as Boris the butterfly fish. In the end of each the 9th stage, the fish saw a dark shadow. After moving on and moving on until we reach Goliath the shark, Goliath reached the top of the food chain and battles the Intruder. He lured the Intruder to a nearby mine. When the INTRUDER explodes the mine, it stays stunned and we have to eat enough shrink shroom to attack the intruder. After defeating the INTRUDER, the alien fish shrunk and escaped, so we have to re-control the fish in the previous food chain to track down the Intruder. The stages after the first boss battle got more difficult, and each fish that we re-control have 3 stages only. However this is an exception to Edie the Angler Fish as the Intruder was said to be afraid of the dark. After we reach the last stage, Boris battles the Intruder in an ocean full of cuttlefish and poison fishes. After shrinking the Intruder for one last time, the Intruder was eaten by Boris.\nSpecial abilities\n\nThe animals which the player controls have special abilities, although these are generally quite similar to those in the previous title. They include a \"dash\" maneuver for a quick burst of speed, the ability to \"suck up\" a large school of fish all at once, as well as an ability which allows the character Edie to light up her way.\nPower-ups\n\nThe game features power-ups which can be used to gain instantaneous or short term effects. These include older power-ups from the previous game, as well as completely new ones:\n\n    Lighting Bolt: A lightning bolt icon which is usually stored in a bubble. The effect of this power-up is to provide increased swimming speed.\n    Shrink Shroom: The effect of this power-up is to shrink any fish whose size is bigger than the player.\n    Instant Illuminate: Lights up the whole screen for a few moments during the \"Midnight Zones\".\n    Looney Lures: This power-up is displayed as a hook icon. It lures and moves bigger fish off of the screen.\n    1UP: The player is awarded an extra life.\n    Golden Herring: This fish makes the player grow one level size, allowing you to eat the next biggest fish. This fish is fast though, and the best method of catching it is to use the inhale ability.\n    Plankton: Can be eaten by Edie for light in midnight zones.\n\nEnvironments\nAbove water challenges\n\nIn some levels the player will be able to jump out of the water, catching several insects and bugs which wander near the surface. In the air, the player can use an ability which sucks a number of insects at the same time. The player can also do back flips to gain more style points, while a failed attempt will result in a belly flop. Also some are just in the middle waters of the ocean and are like midnights zones, only the giant difference is it has light.\nMidnight Zone\n\nThe player will also come across several \u201cMidnight Zones\u201d. During these levels Edie the anglerfish's illuminating lure will be used to light the player\u2019s way. However, eventually the power of her illuminating lure will decrease. Hence, Edie has to hunt for bioluminescent plankton to increase the lighted area of the level. A bulb icon power-up can be eaten for instant full screen illumination.\nPlayable characters\n\n    Boris - Boris the butterfly fish is the first playable character in the game. He lives in the warm waters of the Sandy Shoal, a beautiful area off the Frenzy Coast. He is the first to meet oysters that give pearls and sometimes power ups, and also meets starfish and sharks.\n\n    Layla - Layla the queen triggerfish is the second playable character in the game. She lives in the warm water of Paradise Reef and is the first to meet barracuda enemies and shrink shrooms.\n\n    Edie - Edie the anglerfish is the third playable character. Edie's levels are difficult because her several of levels are the \"Midnight Zones\". Note that the fish's gender has been changed to female due to the fact that only female angler fish emit light; this was a mistake in the original game. She is the only returning playable character from the first game.\n\n    Peter - Peter the pompano is the fourth playable character in the game. He lives in Buccaneer Bay, where the player will first come across cuttlefish, which shoot ink.\n\n    Harry - Harry the humphead wrasse is the fifth playable character in the game, the balloons are back after a while and you can again jump for bonuses out of the water. Also, he meets pelicans.\n\n    Goliath - Goliath the great white shark is the sixth playable character in the game. He is very high up in the food chain, and is the first to fight \"The Intruder\".\n\n    The Intruder - The Intruder is an alien fish disrupting the food chain. The player is required to fight it every 3 levels after Goliath defeats it for the first time. The player then moves lower down the food chain, playing as previous characters until The Intruder is defeated for the last time, after which Boris eats it. This completes the game. The Intruder is then unlocked as a playable character, and the player can then play through the entire game again as The Intruder.\n\nReferences\n\n    http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/f/ffrenzy2xboxlivearcade/\n\nExternal links\n\n    Feeding Frenzy 2 Official site\n    Feeding Frenzy 2 at MobyGames\n\nCategories:\n\n    2006 video games\n    Windows games\n    Xbox 360 Live Arcade games\n    PlayStation Network games\n    PopCap games\n\nI would buy this game multiple times if i could, just buy it. \n\nBestgameyouwilleverplayonthisplanetdonotforgettobuybread/10", "timestamp_created": 1397582002, "timestamp_updated": 1397582002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476100", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9705136": {"recommendationid": "9705136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024747236", "num_games_owned": 1723, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396540680}, "language": "english", "review": " ", "timestamp_created": 1396452207, "timestamp_updated": 1396452207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9703322": {"recommendationid": "9703322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087207493", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396431089}, "language": "french", "review": "nice game, the principle of eating a fish to become a bigger fish is really nice and when you play it, it's quite hard to stop it", "timestamp_created": 1396437134, "timestamp_updated": 1396437134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9669756": {"recommendationid": "9669756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107489939", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396252430}, "language": "english", "review": "kind of like dark souls, but you're a fish.", "timestamp_created": 1396139945, "timestamp_updated": 1515456534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9667971": {"recommendationid": "9667971", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975041945", "num_games_owned": 835, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417338589}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you know that the African pompano is also called the threadfish and the Cuban jack?

"language": "english", "review": "I too got this game for nostalgia purposes. However, it has not aged well, at all. The first problem is the game's resolution. I know this game is pretty old, and super HD things weren't around back then, but the view you're given is so very very limited. There is no warning of any predators that are coming from off screen. Far too often you will find yourself swimming right into a fish. Another issue is that the game is crazy unfair. Most of the power-downs that prey emit are pretty much death sentences. Fighting the alien fish (5 times with no difference in the fight every 2 levels...) or a barracuda is pretty much impossible because they just turn around and eat you right away. Another big issue is your growth rate. You have to eat an insane number of fish before growing to the next level. This is hindered even more due to the fact you lose all of your growth bar for that level once you die. Finally, the concept of the game itself is pretty flawed as well. The game's level difficulty is reversed: it is easier at the end of the level than at the start. This makes the feeling of completing a level a chore rather than a rewarding experience. \n\nOverall, skip this even if you've played it back in the day. It is not at all worth $10. $5 is a decent price, but only if you've played it before and are prepared to rage often.", "timestamp_created": 1394914470, "timestamp_updated": 1394914470, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432763", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9486232": {"recommendationid": "9486232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002329962", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394878980}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game Fun For All Ages!

Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown Deluxe\u2122 is one of the last old-school classics, and every modern game should try to learn from the greatness of this title.\n\nFrom the astounding, vivid, almost LIFELIKE visuals which really capture the feeling of a deep sea aquatic adventure, to the dynamic, orchestral soundtrack which supplements the gameplay extremely well; this game is as close to perfection as one can get. But Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown Deluxe\u2122 is more than a game; it is a critique towards the human condition in the 21st Century. The world order in Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown Deluxe\u2122 is eat, or be eaten; much like it is in our society. \n\nPersonally, I think this game should be remastered with modern technology, to give the developers the possibility to fully realize their vision for this groundbreaking game, which was not possible at the time of it\u00b4s release. Just imagine this: Feeding Frenzy 3. With even better visuals, Oculus Rift Support, and a multiplayer to fully capture the Online market. I have a dream. And this dream is Feeding Frenzy.", "timestamp_created": 1391871853, "timestamp_updated": 1391871853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8857170": {"recommendationid": "8857170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064474700", "num_games_owned": 837, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476550412}, "language": "english", "review": "good game but is hard and the bigger fish comes and eats you", "timestamp_created": 1390751125, "timestamp_updated": 1390751125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474595", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7888349": {"recommendationid": "7888349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071192077", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387372959}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u68d2\u7684 \u6e38\u620f\u63a8\nI think the game is really good and interesting!!", "timestamp_created": 1386028377, "timestamp_updated": 1386028377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "5440824": {"recommendationid": "5440824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049806385", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501950870}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game when I was 10, I love it now.

Easy to learn, \"plug & play\" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that \"in between big games\" time.", "timestamp_created": 1347614370, "timestamp_updated": 1347614370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2379893": {"recommendationid": "2379893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006574782", "num_games_owned": 2374, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1343026800}, "language": "english", "review": "Feeding Frenzy 2 Deluxe by PopCap Games is a very simple concept that becomes suprisingly challenging as the game wears on.  The basic premise is you begin as a small fish and must eat like sized or smaller fish until you grow big enough to eat the next largest fish.  The games graphics are bright and cheerful, the music appropriate and not aggravating, and the scoring screens even offer a little bit of fun information about fish.  While this game would be perfect for kids, the gameplay is brisk enough to be enjoyed by adults as well.  My only minor concerns with the game are the lack of Steam Overlay support, and a no Vysync option, which for high end systems may lead to some minor graphic tearing.

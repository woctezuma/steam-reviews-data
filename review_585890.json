That would've been fine if there was more to it than that, but, for two hours or so of reading, it's only enough to set this up and hope that it pays off for the reader. If you're too perceptive, then there's no point. Nothing is fleshed out enough for the story to survive without that impact at full force.\n\nAlso, the VN doesn't really answer / delve into the elements which set up the twist, and so you're left with more questions than answers. It's understandable for such a short story to leave some things unsaid, but I felt as though the things left unexplored were more interesting than what was given to me. This must have been intentional to decieve people and set up the end, but it wasn't to my tastes. Right at the end of the VN is where the most interesting things could have started to happen, but, again, that's the end.\n\nThere were no choices in this VN, and so there was no reason to save in different slots or to go back or anything like that. It made the already short VN quite a bit shorter. The one path route makes sense with the main character's weak personality, but it was boring for me. It was repetitive. It plays out in a predictable path. Well, maybe not so predictable if you dont' figure out that one thing, but, aside from that, it's quite easy to guess what will happen next.\n\nThe sound effects aren't as good as they could be. Footsteps in certain scenes don't match up with the actual scene at all. They sound out of place, to be exact. So, instead of bringing me into the writing, they took me out of it. The only part where that actually worked is when there are kids talking and screaming and being annoying in the background of a certain scene.\n\nThe art was so-so. It didn't leave a lasting impression on me.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't say it's bad, just... rushing towards that certain scene? It wants to be over too quickly. It makes me think that perhaps that's all the writer had figured out and so that's where it had to end, for better or worse.", "timestamp_created": 1515579391, "timestamp_updated": 1515579391, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39221110": {"recommendationid": "39221110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025540438", "num_games_owned": 4907, "num_reviews": 489, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515056777}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderfully well written, at no point was i bored.

Not sure why. I guess they pretty low impact but can still have a lot of fun and possibly even depth built into them.\n\nThe author's notes say (minor spoiler) that this is a fanservice-filled VN that sort of punishes enjoying that fanservice, undermining the way most VNs slavishly service the male gaze (my phrasing, not hers).\n\nAs an older male, I think she wrote an old, world-weary man surprisingly well. But then, women aren't taught to ignore the thoughts and feelings of men the way men are taught to ignore those of women. ;-P\n\nI digress, tho. Is the game any good?\n\nWell, it's not really a game. It's a \"kinetic\" visual novel, which means there are no choices to be made. Just words and pictures and sound / music. It really is a [b]visual novel[/b]. It's not exactly an electronic comic book or picture storybook... The author is a VN veteran, and makes good use of the software to tell the story in a way that's different from how it would be told in other media.\n\nSo, given you're just buying a story told in a very particular medium, is the story good? Yes. \n\nThe other horror VN I read recently is [i]Doki Doki Literature Club[/i], and while I'm comparing apples and oranges here, while [i]Doki Doki Literature Club[/i] had more seriously creepy moments (and actually had choices), [i]Sweetest Monster[/i] has a much better, and more personal, story, with much more depth. (On the apples and oranges thing, we're talking personal horror for [i]Sweetest Monster[/i] rather than surreal horror in [i]DDLC[/i]. Very different.)\n\nI [i]did[/i] guess where the story was going about halfway through, so when the climactic moment of horror came, I was able to remove myself from the story enough to enjoy the fanservice, perhaps more than the author would have liked. That said, it was still genuinely creepy/disturbing and afterward, I wasn't 100% sure where the author was going with the epilogue until the end, which drew me back in and put a capstone on the protagonist's damnation.\n\nI already said she wrote the protagonist really well. She wrote the other major character, Bell, equally well, and they play off each other excellently. I don't think anyone reading this is going to get the idea this is a \"typical\" fanservice vehicle from the very start. While some might argue that things went on with Bell longer than should be possible, I suspect the author, like me, was enjoying the interaction so much she didn't care. I didn't care either. It strained credibility a little, but it was so fun and creepy it didn't matter.\n\nSo, it's good. Is it good enough to be worth the money? Well, I guess it depend on how much you got it for. Google tells me the typical horror novel is 80K words or so, and this is 40K words long, and took me about an evening to read. But normal novels don't have excellent atmospheric art and music. So YMMV. \n\nI got [i]Sweetest Monster[/i] for $6 and [i]The Atrocity Archives[/i] is $3 on Kindle and [i]It[/i] is like $12 on Kindle, but that's more apples and oranges. It [i]felt[/i] maybe it was overpriced for the amount of play/reading time I got out of it, but (A) I've been consuming a lot of free VNs, so my sense of cost/value may be super off-kilter and (B) I really liked the story, so even at this price,  I ultimately didn't regret buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1515391790, "timestamp_updated": 1515391790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39109099": {"recommendationid": "39109099", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996890063", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 181, "last_played": 1515221778}, "language": "english", "review": "That was seriously fucked up.", "timestamp_created": 1515221825, "timestamp_updated": 1515221825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39036506": {"recommendationid": "39036506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053215759", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515039100}, "language": "english", "review": "This game truly seperates [i]Horror[/i] from [i]Psychological Horror.[/i] (This probably isn't a spoiler but I'll do it just to be safe) [spoiler] Despite not having a single jumpscare or \"scary\" images, it still will haunt my mind far more than a quick startle.

Looked like an interesting kind of thing. I was expecting psychological horror- something like Doki Doki Literature Club.\n\nBUT NOPE.\n\nThere's a very interesting, but DISTURBING AF storyline, that tackles a lot of heavy subjects... but... this story is VISCERAL. From a writer's perspective, this story is masterfully composed, the pacing, the detail, the interaction... I could really feel the internal struggle of Robin (the main character).\n\nThe final twist of the story is... just... it's disturbing. On every possible level, it's just absolutely gut wrenching. I kinda started to see it coming.... but the execution, HOW the twist happens... it is probably one of the best plot twists I've ever seen written, even if it made me sick to my stomach, want to bleach my eyes, and take a shower with my toaster.\n\nHowever- this is a kinetic novel. There's NO choices. It's literally just watching the story unfold. Gameplay itself is nonexistent- you simply immerse yourself in the story. If you're looking for a graphic novel, to just watch as it unfolds, I'd highly recommend you ruin any remaining innocence you have left with this. If you want gameplay... go somewhere else.\n\nAlso, the music is wonderful. It seems a bit repetitive at times, but it's not too annoying, and the music always fits the scenario.\n\nThere is ONE scene with nudity, but there's quite a bit of sexual references going on. And, I have to say, it's actually done pretty tastefully- meaning, sorry boys, this ain't porn. It actually exists to further the plot and develop the characters- something that is pretty hard to do from a writer's perspective. (Just don't get too attached to Bell, please. It WILL get disturbing.)\n\nAll in all, I'd like to say it'd was worth it just to have the experience,. It's an interesting story that does very well, and it's strangely insightful, though very disconcerting as it progresses. But, I doubt I'll run through it again- like I said, there's no choices or anything, so there's nothing else to achieve, and the impact and shock value will likely not hit me quite the same way.

It moves in one direction only in a way it\u2019s a canon way of the story. Now that\u2019s out of the way let\u2019s begin, the main story revolves around the main character robin Hawkins. Robin is a middle aged man living with his wife, and his daughter who he cannot connect with. Then just as his life began to in a way plummet he meets a curious girl named bell. Now bell in a way throughout the story attempts to (seduce) in a way robin. And as time passes you can see just how much that is affecting him now that may seem kind of clich\u00e9 but the novel doesn\u2019t follow the *plot* that other Vns follow like say the sakura series. Which goes with the let\u2019s say tits for the win strat but not this one no this novel follows a real plot how I feel novels should be. Now you can say all you want about how you can\u2019t have choices but honestly for me it doesn\u2019t change how good the story is especially the twist at the end some may notice it some may not.

It's not that it's bad, just that I loved their other stories, and this one was a lot less enjoyable in my book. It's a relatively short (~3 hours of read time), kinetic VN. It tells the story of a man who's pretty much going through a mid-life crisis, when he meets a young woman/cat/spirit who professes her love to him because of an event in his childhood. The rest of the story revolves around the struggle between his family and this new \"love\". I think most of the reason for my not liking this story as much as other ebi-hime VNs stems from just how spineless and dislikeable the protagonist is. I never grew to care what happens to him as I did other ebi-hime main characters. The story itself if interesting, if not gripping, with a bit of a twist at the end. The art is well done, if not as good as others they have done. There is no voice acting, and the music is average. There are Steam achievements (3) that are earned just playing through to the finish, as well as trading cards for those interested in them. So, while not their greatest, still recommended as a good, short read. I'd encourage anyone who hasn't read any of ebi-hime's other VNs to not judge any of the other works by this one (if you didn't like this one), as the others really are wonderful reads.

So this game did well in not really setting up a ton of that. I didn't feel like I already knew the story or that I had an idea of where the characters were going to end up from too early on when, ideally, I shouldn't know that kind of information just yet. \n\nFor anyone who has played Asphyxia, Empty Horizons, Strawberry Vinegar, ect.. this story doesn't have quite the same feel and so the usual quirks you'd expect from those titles won't really be around either, aside from a few references to romantic poets and such. For example, the male character isn't very feminine in the slightest, which is a distinct change and I must commend ebi-hime for that. Not that feminine males are a bad thing, it just seems as if that was something they felt they struggled with in the past and I think they managed to really nail a neutral or more masculine guy in this story. \n\nTo accompany some changes in quirks and writing style, the art style is different and it works for this tale. I'm not quite sure what I would feel if I were playing this game and it had Silly Selly's art in it. It would certainly be interesting, but I've come to recognize them more for heartwrenching adorableness, purity, or melancholia than something very eerie, disturbing, or explicitly sexual in any way.\n\nOnto the story itself, I feel it accomplished exactly what the writer was going for. I both empathized with and was at times infuriated by certain characters exactly when I should have been and by the end I felt very unsettled when everything I didn't yet know finally revealed itself. And there was such a helpless feeling to it, too. I'm so used to having choices in these stories, but in this one.. there really is nothing you can do to change the outcome. There isn't supposed to be. It leaves a lasting impact and sometimes that's much better than having multiple endings where one can overshadow and perhaps even make you forget all the others. \n\nI would talk more on the characters, but personally I'm fearful of saying a little bit too much about them. They're probably best met during a playthrough rather than in a review, especially since there are so few of them in this story.\n\nOverall, the game is just delightfully upsetting. That's the best way to describe the experience in my opinion. If you enjoy messed up stuff and you're good with visual novels, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a go. Similarly, if you're already a fan of ebi-hime's work, I'd also recommend it as long as a change in formula doesn't turn you off.", "timestamp_created": 1500065604, "timestamp_updated": 1500065915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33439196": {"recommendationid": "33439196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035294703", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499715822}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont think i have ever been wanting to be so wrong of my guesses while reading a story.. this VN left me slightly traumatised and scared..", "timestamp_created": 1499716139, "timestamp_updated": 1499716139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33432577": {"recommendationid": "33432577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152308686", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499696974}, "language": "english", "review": "creepy and disturbing. \n", "timestamp_created": 1499697739, "timestamp_updated": 1499697739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33408964": {"recommendationid": "33408964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145327122", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499618486}, "language": "english", "review": "This VN may have had a slow start but i shit you not the end is well worth it, though its a bit short the quality is still pretty damn good.

It starts off slow and innocent, with some charming moments sprinkled here and there but because of some questionable writing at points as well as flat out retarded decision making on the part of the main character in the latter bits, the ending didn't really pull it up to an 8 for me. That said the ending was just W O W. I figured as much at some point but the full revelation still hit me like a truck, and the events immediately following it only add to the shock. I'd defintely recommend the game if you have a few bucks to spare, though if you're anything like me you may want to put it down around 60-75% of the way through because trust me when I say that the setup for the climax and the plot in it's entirety has a few weak spots.

And if you read the latter and then wished you would not, then perhaps you skip this one too. \n\nIt is not that their plots are similar or anything, it is just the same irrational \"Oh, it could be a perfect story, if it only would\" feelign they both leave in me.\n\nIt frankly is not easy to describe the feelings without goinf into details, and details would be spoilers. So, i guess this review would seem biased and unsibstantiated, and perhaps it is.\n\n1. If the author's point was to unnerve the reader by making a micro Summer Days, by submerging him into \"some games hurt\" - then it was reached, absolutly. Though, my personal uncanny valley started with \"the family that still may be rescued\" emotional chasm, not the fan-service culmination itself. So, i kind of was untouched by the scene that was planned as the most shocking and cruel.\n\n2. Let me say, the story was too short for all the content the author tried to squeeze into it. It is a \"constructed\" story, ratehr than \"born\" one. It feels like when one developes One Great Plan and then when some narrative starts flowing from it he jsut squeezes it into \"what it must be\". \n\nIt kind of works. Kind of. Because some natural sincirity gets lost in those hard work hours. Chekov's guns are way too exposed, without any lampshading. Tolstoy syndrome happens here and there: crucial events are getting happening not out of natural development, but because the point in the One True Plot had to be proven and ends jsutify means.\n\nThat very \"willing suspencion of disbelief\" was burst a bit too often, and when the athor tried hastily to knot few threads together, he/she left their ends standing out.\n\nMaybe one day the author would dare to make 3-4 times longer the story over those ideas, so the bines would get overed by some curvy flesh, dunno. As of now, sorry, to me this story feels like \"Oh, those fair people did so try to make this journey pleasant for us, it is a shame we ere less happy than their efforts were worth. Though i know 3-4 times more would be much more exhaustive, and perhaps much less on ROI scale, and the plot with get more and mroe runaway tendency as the character would be getting the breathe of their own. So, it is veeery easy to me to make suggestions like that investing nothing.\n\nJust, this story does have a potential, but not in this short form where it became too much obviousy \"constructed\".\nIf it was not worth notincing, ig it was just \"an obvious miss and nothing to talk about\" that would make it mmuch less complicated :-D\n\n3. And my personal thing, damn it, when the same team makes text and background graphics, when they are not best matches copypasted from chans or devianart, then why they do contradict one another? sigh... Perhaps i should not be even noticing those discrepancies, but... that willing suspension of mine, it was all like an old tire not patched enough....\n\nOTOH, i was noticing picture mismatches even in Ame no Marginal. So perhaps i am just a picky reader and this time i pick on Ebi-hime, having nothign better to do :-D", "timestamp_created": 1493678692, "timestamp_updated": 1493678692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31496265": {"recommendationid": "31496265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029304262", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493678043}, "language": "english", "review": "This was awesome.

The writer knows exactly where she/he wants to take the reader and does so well. \"You've been warned.\" I've read very few visual novels and none that are linear. I did not know what I was getting into, so it was shocking not having any choices and just reading. However the story was compeling enough to keep me reading to find out what happens to the characters. I found this to be a great read/experience in the evening with the lights turned off and headphones on. I read it for about an hour or so over the course of a few nights. The music while repetitive at times is deeply captivating and helps set the sinister mood. I found the art to be superb although I wish there had been more of it.

Beyond this, it's pretty easy to see how Robin is very much responsible for the deterioration in these relationships.  He has arguements with his wife, but rather than try to work through his issues with her, he chooses to run from the confrontations.  He doesn't understand how to relate to his daughter, and again, he tries to ignore the problems she has rather than talk to her about them.  Compounded with the other stresses in his life, the ultimate result is a man in the midst of a midlife crisis, which is right when this story properly begins.\n\nWhile Robin's meeting with the mysterious and peculiar Bell is what sets the tragedy in motion, it's easy to see the places where Robin could have taken hold of his future.  Instead, he reveals himself to be a weak man, easily manipulated by Bell, as she draws him in with impossible tales and suggestive acts.  What begins as mere escapism quickly transforms into something more, much darker and more sinister than Robin ever suspected.\n\nI won't spoil the conclusion, as Ebi-hime has done a good job making sure that it's not a complete surprise.  Astute readers will see what is coming, but the conclusion is well earned.\n\nArt:\nThe aesthetic fits with the story, with dark backdrops in the moments of mystery and unease, but brightly colored settings in the places where Robin feels most comfortable.  The few character CGs are all of Bell, and they all do a good job of conveying just how peculiar a person she is.  At other times, character stills of Bell or Sally will take center stage, and they are always well drawn; no gonk faces to be found here.\n\nMusic and Sound:\nThe soundtrack was provided by Mock Off, and he has done a great job of helping communicate the tone of the scenes through his music.  Many of the tracks are very sparsely arranged, staccato piano or synth melodies over eerie, airy backgrounds with a small amount of percussion to help keep the pieces moving.  The title track, Sweetest Monster, is probably the standout piece in the short OST, doing a fantastic job of generating a sensation of mystery and unease.\n\nThe sound effects are perhaps the only criticism I can find to level at this visual novel.  While some of them are appropriately subdued, I found that the effects used for falling rain, people walking, or children playing were overpowering to the point of distraction.  Thankfully they don't occur often, but a softer, more subdued set of sounds would have worked better with the soundtrack and the tone of the story.\n\nConclusion and Recommendation:\nSweetest Monster, admittedly, is not a story that everyone will appreciate.  It is a story about a confident young woman, a weak-willed man, conflicting emotions and obligations.  This is not a story to read when you're looking for something to perk you up.  If you are looking for something different from the majority of visual novels, however, something that doesn't simply give fanservice for fanservice sake, but uses sexuality as an integral part of its story, you will find something special here.\n\nI highly recommend Sweetest Monster, and though I have not read any of her other works to date, I plan to do so, and will provide recommendations for similar tales at that time.", "timestamp_created": 1487226806, "timestamp_updated": 1487226806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29948053": {"recommendationid": "29948053", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992053136", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487306496}, "language": "english", "review": "A short but well written visual novel that I highly recommend.

Routine can smother the spark, if no effort is made to keep it alive. The protagonist of this story feels unloved and abandoned, his wife argues with him day in and day out, his daughter avoids him altogether. So when a pretty young girl appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and offers him a new perspective, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY5hR7z5wWE]will his familial loyalty manage to subdue his base desires[/url]?\n\n[b]Sweetest Monster[/b] is the newest kinetic novel born of [i]ebi-hime[/i]'s quill and published on Steam by [i]Sekai Project[/i]. Its 40 000 words of non-branching story translate to three hours of reading time, give or take one. It boasts widescreen visuals (although the assets are not quite 1080p) as well as a custom original soundtrack and all the quality-of-life features we are used to from modern VNs, like multiple save slots and a skip-read-text mode. It's available on all three major platforms, and as always, I'll note that the presence of a Linux version makes it that much more convenient for me personally.\n\nIt's difficult to talk about [i]Sweetest Monster[/i]'s technical and artistic choices without delving right into [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863497606]the atmosphere[/url]. Every piece of artwork and music in this title is bespoke, and the resulting coherence and intensity of the mood is something that would be impossible to achieve with the stock sprites and elevator music often seen in the lower priced VN market segment. Everything is gloomy and eerie, not so far outside the norm that it would scare you away immediately, but just far enough to make you doubt your own judgment. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863497645]Bell[/url] is a very interesting take on the [i]femme fatale[/i], the art as well as the writing convey very clearly that there is more to her than meets the eye.\n\nSpeaking in terms of genres, what [i]can[/i] one expect from [i]Sweetest Monster[/i]? I'd say that \"psychological horror\" is a good enough fit, even though it paints an incomplete picture. There are also slight allusions to cosmic horror, and if you like your stories to make you feel small and insignificant, this one may be a decent bet. There is character drama, of course, and a story centered around a young seductress may be particularly appealing to some. Though no matter your expectations going into it, and even if you pick up on more details than I did, the final act should still leave you thoroughly disturbed.\n\nThose who have read my other reviews may already be aware that I'm generally fond of genre subversions. Granted, if [i]Sweetest Monster[/i] were nothing more than a boring rehash of moege catgirl clich\u00e9s, I wouldn't be writing about it in the first place, but just as a general note: I like being surprised by the fiction I read, and this VN managed to keep me on my toes, even though it was nothing if not upfront about where its story would be headed. On the contrary, watching the main character slide [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863497680]from one careless mistake into the next[/url] and seeing the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863497714]potential consequences pile up[/url], it comes with all the morbid fascination of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863497748]watching a train derail in slow motion[/url].\n\nI'm going to dwell on Robin Hawkins a bit more, just because apart from his being rather timid and indecisive, he is pretty far outside the norm for male VN protagonists as well. He is around 40 years old, has a full-time job and a family. He's not a blank slate at all, we start the story learning about his life, his hopes and worries, and it's made very clear that he is a full-fledged character. This also opens him up to being potentially unlikable, depending on how well the reader's views align with his own. Reading some other reviews of this VN, I found that the whole gamut was covered from \"very relatable main character, highly immersive\" to \"implausibly dumb protagonist\" and everything in between. Even though Robin likes to prop himself up as a hapless victim, I fall into the faction that thinks the story might have unfolded very differently if someone had told him earlier and more often that his problems are [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863497772]largely his own damn fault[/url].\n\nAny discussion of [i]Sweetest Monster[/i] would be decidedly incomplete without an intertextual perspective. By the author's own admission, popular moege like [i]Nekopara[/i] were a major influence on this title, but \u2013 again \u2013 if this were a mere attempt at going with the flow and pandering to market forces, I wouldn't be writing about it. Nor is it a shallow dismissal of the genre or of its audience \u2013 it's a tough balancing act, but this VN manages to deliver a rewarding story in its own right while also calmly holding up a mirror from time to time, but without becoming overtly preachy. (If there is an Aesop in here that goes deeper than \"don't trust strange catgirls\", it has evaded me.)\n\nAre there any negatives to this VN? Well, on a technical level, I'll say that the highly ambitious sound design was perhaps just slightly too ambitious for its own good. It makes very good use of rain, of heavy footsteps and other sound effects to build its atmosphere, but there were a few spots where the attention to detail took a momentary dip, such as when outside footsteps sound like they're happening in a closed room because of too much reverb. But as I often seem to say, if that's the heaviest criticism I can come up with, then that already speaks volumes about the work as a whole. Everything else is largely a matter of opinion: some people might find the story distasteful, others may have wished it to be longer. If you like your catgirls only when padded with cotton candy fluff, chances are you've already figured out that this isn't one of those cases. But if you're yearning for something disturbing that can be finished in an afternoon, then be sure to give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1487017509, "timestamp_updated": 1487017509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684295", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29890128": {"recommendationid": "29890128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066472377", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486954554}, "language": "english", "review": "I will vouch for this VN, it is kinetic, as stated above.

It isn't meant to be a direct attack on the author, their content, their views, or anyone that enjoys this work. It is me merely collecting my thoughts on how I felt about this story, which I DID enjoy, but also had some fundamental issues with. Thanks for understanding-\n\nIt\u2019s certainly disturbing, to say the least!\nSweetest Monster had me caught like a moth to a flame, because at a particularly tender spot in my life, I yet again run into something macabre. My morbid curiosity with this VN was particularly with its base plot, and the themes. And the reviews seemed to give it even more of a fascinating persona.\n\n[SPOILERS TO FOLLOW]\nWhat I got in the end, was still something I didn\u2019t expect, even after I had prepared myself for all eventualities. I wasn\u2019t too shocked by the plot twist; in fact I had openly guessed it all long. However, it still caught me off guard.\n\nThe VN itself is incredibly well written, and I had plenty of chuckles and grimaces in equal measure, due to the vivid descriptions of UK life (which I understand all too well). The characters are believable and the dialogue feels right. The overall plot can most certainly be considered \u201chorror\u201d, especially due to the ending. There\u2019s a genuinely unsettling feeling throughout, and the whole thing is set up in a way to lead towards an insane conclusion.\n\nI did feel that this VN accomplished what it set out to do, which was to make you feel unsettled/uncomfortable, and the author\u2019s notes certainly made me aware of such. However, a part of me can\u2019t help but feel somewhat miffed, almost as if I was being punished due to the author\u2019s personal feelings about certain types of Vns, and fanservice being the main target. Which is perfectly fine for them to feel that way, and it\u2019s reasonable to separate the art from the artist of course. It\u2019s not that I think this was any kind of political/social agenda, but it may have also been presented in a way that\u2019s meant to make you bad feel for liking fanservice, and the plot twist exists to execute that very act. This could be the case, or it might not be, I will probably never know. But I hope not, because it would be a shame if that was the goal when the story was hitting such incredible high notes on its own.\n\nTaken in isolation, this is a short but detailed story about a man with a mid-life crisis with his wife and estranged daughter, with supernatual elements, and themes of commitment, obsession and infidelity. It reminds me a lot of the game Catherine in that respect, which is probably what also drew me to this VN. I just couldn\u2019t help but feel like the plot twist, and the author\u2019s intent behind it, sit in direct opposition to this stellar and horrific story, because it seemed less about presenting this horrid truth for the sake of the plot, and more about cheapening the whole experience. That is, the plot twist (at least superficially) appears to be an \u2018aha, got you\u2019 moment that is meant to pull the rug from underneath the feet of the reader, and take away what made the plot so engaging. Or put into more words: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for liking cat-girls and fanservice; now don\u2019t you just feel terrible?\u201d At least based upon the author\u2019s notes (and perhaps their intent?) because otherwise it\u2019s just a damn good horror twist, haha. On its own the \u2018art\u2019 has a good story to tell, but I\u2019m just concerned by what the \u2018artist\u2019 intended us to feel about it. But I could also just not be seeing the forest for the trees in this case.\n\nI was genuinely enthralled by this story of a man potentially \u2018cheating\u2019 with a spirit, and I was so sympathetic to his wife and I wanted them to resolve their differences, and for him to be closer with his daughter. The aspect of Bell\u2019s one-sided love and persistence felt like the perfect foil for the main character\u2019s development in this direction, and it would shape him to either be a complete douchebag who ruins his family, or the man who overcomes this midlife crisis and does something about it. Or some twisted area inbetween. It\u2019s clever really; how the interactions with Bell, and the main character\u2019s descriptions of her, are clearly meant to represent one specific thing, which will be the constant hints that lead towards the plot twist. I can openly admit that I was so hooked and invested in the conflicted feelings of the main character, and his divided thoughts between his clear love for his wife, and his bedazzlement by this young cat girl who had so much love for him. It felt like that story was never truly resolved, and maybe it was never meant to be.\n\nPut simply; I was perhaps expecting a story where the infidelity with the cat girl spirit was being used as a plot device for the main character\u2019s reflections on his current life, and what he should do moving forward. So again, the plot twist sort of feels destructive to that, and \u2018cheapens\u2019 the experience by making it seem more like it wanted to play a dirty trick on you, and the seemingly deep and emotional story was nothing but the literal pre-text. But that is just my feelings about it, and I am in no way suggesting the author wanted to do that. And at the end of the day you\u2019re free to form your own opinions on the whole thing.\n\nI fully admit that I was captivated by Bell\u2019s character, and I was expecting the inevitable intimate scene, but not out of purely perverted reasons but rather because it would be the apex of this messed up story. And the plot twist was good yes, but I wonder if it just makes the whole theme of infidelity, family and self-improvement just fall apart in the face of it. I was expecting to feel bad, sure, but only due to how far gone the main character was in his infidelity, and how it would affect his family going forward. And whether the supernatural element would feed into that, or perhaps take a whole different direction. Because I really appreciated the story up until that point, and I just personally think that the plot twist\u2019s shock factor is hampered by what it does to the rest of the story preceding it. The plot twist (I personally feel) made me feel bad for all the wrong reasons, and suddenly the story arc is shattered. \n\nThe narrative, at least I thought, seemed to be headed towards a scenario where the main character would have to finally choose between this sick twisted romance with a cat girl, and his shaky but real family, and while the \u2018choice\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be an in-game one, and one that just happens as it was meant to be written, I was excited to see whichever choice it would be. I understand that this was all just my expectation, and even projection to a certain extent, and I was actually ok with having none of these fulfilled.\n\nDon\u2019t take any of this to mean that I disliked this story, or that I don\u2019t recommend it. Well, it\u2019s hard to really sell this to most people due to it being a non-interactive VN, with VERY mature themes (plot twist not-withstanding). But I think it\u2019s a worthwhile read if you, like myself, are a moth dancing around a flame and you\u2019re looking for something different, and very very dark. It\u2019s well written, the art is nice, the characters do well and it\u2019ll certainly leave you thinking. I want to stress that nothing I\u2019ve said here is a direct attack on the author, their personal views, their work or anything like that. I actually fully respect the effort that went into this VN, and I respect the bravery to tell such a dark, twisted story, with whatever intent they may have had behind it all. I think Sweetest Monster was a tiny little pocket of disturbing but enjoyable narrative, and I just wanted to fully express my fundamental disappointment with the overall direction of the closing act.

On the plus side, the story had me feeling some genuine emotions. Most of those were negative emotions but I appreciate it just the same as positive emotions. Not every story has to be a pleasant one. It's not easy to write a story that's likely to upset the reader and still have them feeling they were glad to have read it. I respect that.\n\nI found the main character, Robin, rather frustrating throughout most of the story. While most VNs are fine with a generic male protag who's friendly, agreeable, easy-going, etc so that the player can self-insert, here the author is brave enough to write one that you probably won't agree with. I certainly didn't. I couldn't self-insert here even with a 6 foot long shoehorn. It's all very deliberate and well-written, though, and that's the main difference between the good kind of frustrating and the kind that makes you genuinely dislike the story.\n\nAlso among my favorite negative emotions was the unnerving/creepy tone of many scenes. The female lead, Bell, is very difficult to trust. You never feel like you understand her motives or intentions and you really just want Robin to interrogate her but, as I mentioned above, he's not the type to act the way you would like so you're stuck being unnerved. I like it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though. There were some positive emotions, too, and I don't only mean the sexy kind. There are a bunch of happy scenes and a smiling Sally is a treasure.\n\nOne mark against it is that I would have liked more time to be spent on the characters and their preexisting relationships. Enough is given for the reader to fully understand their situations and motives but a little bit more fleshing out would have been appreciated (and it would have helped with the length a little, too).\n\nOverall, a great read. A bit short at like 2+ hours but for about $5, that's not bad.

The themes of faded feelings and guilty pleasure pervade every corner of its short but well-written story. I came into this game expecting whimsical fan-service as a catgirl sensually posed before me on the title screen, but what I came away with after my two hours were profound questions pertaining to commitment, my own transient existence, and what it really means to live for myself. Thanks to strong usage of vivid language and consistent word choices, the tone remains suspense and deep throughout its many scenes. \n\nThe protagonist Robin is equally mature, being a pleasure deprived professor of music with a nagging wife and a daughter who hardly peeps at him. This dysfunction is painted early thanks to the quaint setting and melancholic tunes that play during his in-home conversations. The monotony that has gone on for much of his life  changes almost instantaneously, however, during a lone walk across a lakeside bridge. There he meets the spirit Bell, who so happens to be a cat girl simply trying to return a huge favor. Everyone in Sweetest Monster possess humanly goals that are relatable which made the reading all the more satisfying. They tend to revolve around the idea of being alive as lines like, \"cats don't have nine lives,\" \"I could be one of those statistics someday,\" to Bell thanking Robin for her own existence showoff expertly injected  subtlety into the reader's subconscious. \n\nRobin's in-home predicament is further accentuated by the dichotomy between the scenes spent in sadness with his wife Sally and those spent in frolick with catgirl Bell. The music does a fantastic job striking this cutoff as if bipolar, almost symbolic of Robin's inner thoughts as he struggles to sustain his relationships with Sally and daughter Melly. The toxic environment he puts up with is convincing. This is amplified by the contrasting personality and aesthetic appeal that Bell brings to his life. It makes for a fun trek into a grown man's cognitive state, oozing with dissonance as something so palatable awaits him in exchange for a foregone commitment that deep down still tugs his heart. \n\nHow quickly can love dissipate, and how quickly does it rekindle? Sweetest Monster turned out to be anything other than what I had labeled it to be. It is an introspective tale about the value of life. It seeks to evoke emotion rather than please. It will also leave the reader with questions, and not because it is left unfinished, but because it is a thought-provokingly good rendition of what it means to be human. I enjoyed my time spent in Robin's head as the questions he tackled could very well be one that any of us may one day experience.

Something really important.\u201d\n\nSweetest Monster is a kinetic novel (a visual novel without choices). Although it doesn't have choices, which some might be looking for in a game, it does have a very intricately designed/tightly-knit story that more than made up for the lack of interactivity, in my opinion. I can't bring myself to tell you anything about the story because it is very hard to put to words without spoiling anything, much like Ebi-Hime's other works, but I will say that it leans more toward the horror genre than romance (though it arguably pulls bits from both) and that the story itself is very bold. Beyond that, the best I can offer story-wise, is pointing you toward the author's description of the game. \n\nThe artwork is beautiful, yet carries an air of creepiness to it. Meanwhile, the music is both vibrant and classical, a perfect compliment to the art (especially some of the objects that appear washed-out/antique by intended design). I also found the sound effects to be on point and fitting with the somewhat eerie theme. There isn't any voice acting, but I'm glad because I feel that it might have worked against the dark feel that the artwork and score provided, not to mention how it might have cut over the excellent soundtrack. \n\nThere are also quite a few extras: Art Gallery, Music Box, and Author's Notes. As with the other Ebi-Hime titles I have played, I found the Author's Notes to be very informative, well written, and interesting. I really like what the author set out to do, and accomplished, with Sweetest Monster. The game does indeed have uncensored nudity (I've seen questions posted about this, but couldn't figure out where to place mention of it in my review, so I chose to post it in the most ironic spot I could think of). I'd say that the VN is a bit short as it took me around 4 hours to finish, but I am a somewhat quick reader.  \n\nIn closing, I found Sweetest Monster to be a more than worthwhile and thought provoking read. I would definitely recommend it at its normal price.

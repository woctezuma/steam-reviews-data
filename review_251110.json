This game was definitely introduces a new concept to the gaming. But it has its pros and cons with this new implementations of this concept:\n\n+ Rich and detailed worlds that a structural analyst would die for!\n+ I loved how you can work like an engineer to fix stuff!\n+ Deep story with environmental storytelling\n+ Based on Source\n+ Good graphics for its engine. Not the best but still good.\n+ Great community.\n+ This was one of those games that I felt like I live in its world.\n\nBefore getting to the cons I'd like to say that I am a completionist. So the cons will be from the perspective of completionism.\n\n- Collectibles were awful. There were too many of them and were hard to count especially because of the lack of an inventory system.\n- Developers LOVES to change the locations of collectibles with constant updates for no reason. I use guides a lot in games and these kind of updates instantly makes those guides I use obselete! I had so many troubles counting, calculating and looking for the data of collectibles. I am currently stuck at Part 3 and its \"corruption documents\" collectible. I will probably never have the will to attempt %100 this game.\n- Stairs... STAIRS WERE SO BAD! They were the worst stairs I have ever seen in a Source engine game. They destroyed the sense of environmental navigation for me.\n- Some areas are too dark, some are too bright.\n- The batteries of the camera and the flashlight were probably produced by the cavemen with some sticks and flint taped together with a maple leaf. They deplete so quickly! At least they were kinda easy to find.\n\nStill though. I will recommend this game if you don't mind %100 it. I kinda have a gaming OCD. :D So I did and I am regretting my decision. But if you are unlike me, you will have a lot of fun exploring the old structures, fixing the broken machinery and even solving a corporate corruption mystery!

Well done to the developers that worked on this game, it has just the right abount of puzzles, adventure and a great story line too.  I absolutely loved it, if anyone is thinking about getting it dont hesitate.  Its like no other story/ puzzle game I have played before.  I have been pleasantly surprised all the way through this game and it hasnt bored me at all.

I really did. I was really intrigued by the novel concept of the game. I sunk 16 hours into it, but in the end I couldn't bring myself to keep going with it. Some people have pointed out issues with some of the game mechanics, or the annoying flashlight and camera with the worst battery life in the world. But my biggest criticism of the game is its absolutely, glacially slow pace.\n\nTo be honest, after 16 hours, I'm still not sure if the game actually HAS a story. I got to Chapter 6 of 11, which gets past the first Act and into Act 2. But throughout the whole time, I was waiting for this \"fight for survival\" that the game description mentions. That never happens. Or at least, it never happens after 16 hours of gameplay. The game doesn't have a story, it has hints of a story, some bits and pieces you encounter throughout your exploration, of some story of corruption that happened thirty years ago. I kept waiting for something more to come of that. But all I got was scatter notes, the occasional audio recording, and....lots of wandering through buildings relatively aimlessly. Either that means there really IS no story to this game...or else it has a pretty serious problem with pacing. Take your pick.\n\nThat said, there are some things that this game does phenomenally well. The buildings and world you inhabit are incredibly detailed, with lots of those gray boxes and electrical panels that you probably walk by every day without paying any attention to. The nature of the game forces you to consider your surroundings, and there is lots of rich detail in those surroundings to keep you focused. The developers also added lots of neat little easter eggs and hidden content that is fun to stumble across. The puzzles feel very natural to the theme of the game, and in general I found them very well done. Some puzzles are necessary to progress in the game; others are optional. But mostly they involve getting machinery working properly -- getting a water purification plant up and running, getting a forklift operational, etc. That doesn't sound thrilling, but it's rewarding to find the correct process.\n\nUltimately, I can't say I recommend this game, but there are some people (clearly, from the other reviews here) to whom this game will appeal. If you are a fan of exploration, walking simulators, and environmental puzzles, you may really like this game! All I can say is, be prepared to make your own story, or come up with your own purpose for continuing on, because there is very little in terms of story or plot to sustain you. Or there was little to sustain me, at any rate. I've put in a hard day's work as a structural analyst, but in the end I'm not sure it's a career move I was really willing to make.", "timestamp_created": 1520028139, "timestamp_updated": 1520028175, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559050", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40459108": {"recommendationid": "40459108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047998585", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520083436}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, I have spent nearly 5 days playing this game.

The graphics look a bit outdated, especially at first, like they are from 10 years ago.

The more you advance in this game, the more and more interesting and enticing it becomes. This is a relatively long game, with not much action going on, but it still manages to keep you incredibly captivated. You just have to explore every corner and every cranny, and you just have to check if there's a way to open that one door, or that one floodgate, or reach that one platform, and see what's on the other side... And the story, which felt so uninteresting at first, starts becoming more and more intriguing. The game is full of exploration and discovery, done in a surprisingly interesting manner.\n\nI got completely hooked, and just had to play the game to the end.

In fact, 2009\u2019s Wolfenstein (shamefully  and inexplicably withdrawn from Steam and other digital distribution platforms) was among the last that comes to mind. Allow me to explain. Nearly two decades of gaming experience have taught me to estimate quite precisely, what to expect from a title in terms of both length and content. INFRA is a welcome exception from my unwritten rule. Even more surprising, it\u2019s the Steam debut for developer Loiste Interactive which also acted as publishers  for their first project. Calling it a labour of love, is an understatement. Initially released as a three-part story since early 2016, the past two years have seen INFRA finally releasing as a unified game.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\u201cINFRA\u201d is referring to \u201cinfrastructure\u201d most likely, yet the underlying tones hint at another kind of road network. One which has nothing to do with going places, but rather opening doors which were never meant to be accessed. Enough metaphors though. The game shall feature corruption in its material form so to speak, since the fictional city of Stalburg is literally crumbling under the weight of negligence and incompetence fuelled by one person\u2019s desires to enrich himself and control as many destinies as he can. Before I\u2019ll discuss the antagonist though, let\u2019s focus on INFRA\u2019s protagonist. Structural engineer Mark is tasked by his company (NCG \u2013 National Consulting Group) to survey a few key locations within Stalburg and coordinate the necessary maintenance as the situation shall demand it. Unlike Gordon Freeman, Mark\u2019s only weapons are his keen sight (assisted by a trusty digital camera) and sharp wit. Also the obligatory flashlight, naturally. But no weapons at all. There are no enemies to harass players and you have no reason to shoot back at something.\n\nIt will not be easy at all and Mark will have to fight for his survival, yet he\u2019ll be facing natural or man-made obstacles, not conventional foes. The main culprit in Stalburg\u2019s current state is an industry magnate which doesn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Jeff Walter is a man that knows just how far you can get if you\u2019ve got local authorities and politicians in your back pocket. He\u2019ll not be stopped by his business rivals since he\u2019s always managed to be one step ahead of them and even run their affairs into the ground, buying them once they\u2019re close to bankruptcy and \u201cfinishing the job\u201d himself. It all seems legal on the surface but the city and its inhabitants are slowly starting to react and fight back. Within this backdrop of uncertainty, poverty and acrimony, Mark must fulfill his duties and care for structures and industries whose employees have seemingly abandoned in disrepair.\n\nCentral themes for this title include: urban and industrial decay (Metro/S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series), mechanical, electrical and environmental puzzles (TARTARUS/Portal series) and a cult of personality matching Bioshock\u2019s Andrew Ryan to INFRA\u2019s Jeff Walter. It\u2019s important to notice that while I could find certain stylistic similarities with the aforementioned games, INFRA is an entirely original story, with its own well-documented albeit fictional locations and characters. And there isn\u2019t a combat section at all. How well documented? We\u2019re literally talking about hundreds of documents and points of interest. I\u2019m honestly surprised by the attention to detail in nearly all regards. There are so many handwritten notes alone, which must have taken quite a lot to simply plan, not to mention insert in the countless rooms Mark shall be visiting. And they make sense since they all point towards one inevitable conclusion.\n\nPiece by piece, the evidence gathered against Walter will begin to form a clear picture for Mark and all his associates to see. Taking pictures of the damage sustained by the surveyed locations, is only half the mission since our protagonist seems licensed in investigative journalism besides his engineering degree. Makes sense though, for the firm which was hired to make repairs, to also find out how did it come to this dire situation in the first place. The answer is Stalburg\u2019s rampant corruption on all levels. Someone has to pay and Mark will make sure of that. In his own nonviolent way, of course. That\u2019s a big part of INFRA\u2019s appeal to me. Just like playing Dishonored without killing anyone, for example, not all conflicts must be resolved through bloodshed and I\u2019m glad that some video games offer this option and break from the norm.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nAs a die hard fan of Dear Esther and Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines, I knew INFRA was powered by the Source Engine within less than 5 minutes of playing it. I have to agree that while some age-related limitations are becoming obvious (such as the lack of truly large, open level implementation), Loiste Interactive are also skilled artists, not just storytellers. Very few textures might give away the graphical engine\u2019s \u201cancient\u201d age and most visual assets are an excellent match to what Unity Engine can also achieve. And both Source and Unity are guaranteeing stability to my system, even when running their projects maxed out and on 4K resolution. \n\nJust how much did I like what I saw and played in INFRA? Enough to capture over 200 screenshots (and counting) while publishing a majority of them on my Steam profile as well. INFRA is a rare case in which you\u2019ll appreciate both its looks and the messages it sends. So far, I\u2019ve met no glitches, crashes or even frame rate drops in this game\u2019s case. I really can\u2019t complain even if I wanted to. As for sheer location variety, I\u2019ll got further into detail in the gameplay section. Suffice to say, there\u2019s not a dull moment in sight and most locations distance themselves from the previously visited places.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nSince it\u2019s usually sporting a more relaxed perspective than the combat-heavy titles I compared some if its themes, INFRA tends to showcase this in its soundtrack and laid-back voice acting. Mark\u2019s a true professional and he rarely loses his composure, even after his boss sends him from one \u201csuicide mission\u201d to another. Stalburg\u2019s slowly falling apart but here\u2019s one structural engineer who\u2019s doing his best to contain the damage and even repair what can still be recovered. Sound effects are well represented, so I also couldn\u2019t find any apparent flaws in the audio assets. A quality title clearly proud of its production values, through and through.\n\n[h1]Gameplay, Verdict, Summary & Rating are below in the Comment Section.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1517307513, "timestamp_updated": 1517521234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780434", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39612121": {"recommendationid": "39612121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002280336", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517355869}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a major crap shoot, so be careful before spending the money.

I'm not one to have many games but this tops all of the ones I have. \n\nAt face value it seems to be a simple game where you picture all structural faults and technical documents and navigate through long forgotten infrastructure, but soon you are enveloped into a story where the people whom you meet through old documents and tape recorders, and even your own coworkers, are not who you once thought them to be. You find out deep rooted schemes of the past, political rigging, manipulation of influential figures and secret sinister projects which were hushed up: all as you navigate through abandoned buildings, tunnels, and as you escape to your office when disaster for the entire city could happen if you, the player, don't think quickly and do the right things.\n\nAs you navigate through all these buildings and old hash-ups which seem to try and kill you, the game poses the question to you: Do you want to reveal the problems with the city of Stalburg and ensure security for its inhabitants, or, do you want to save your life above everything else?\n\nBecause of this, the game will end in different ways taylored to your attitudes to what is around you and how you deal with it. That's the beauty of this game in my opinion. It's so pleasingly simple but at the same time the storyline which you are led into is entirely separate. It's fun and yet again mind blowing with the attention to detail to all the textures and themes it brings. The [ageing gracefully] Source Engine has been used to the full in this game and it's the best I've seen from it to date.\n\nEven the tools you have at your disposal is enticing. All you have is a torch, a camera around your neck and the wits about you. I don't know if it is just me but I really enjoy the use of a camera in-game. It's just pleasing.\n\nSame must be said for the soundtrack. Never heard of Finnian Langham before but his music for this game is fantastic. Even for a musical brain like me this soundtrack is amazing. Having the DLC was a good purchase for me as the music is really good.

It's that, only with all of its attention spent on that aspect, without enemies to fight. Which if you're me, is actually good thing.\n\nThe level design is great (there are a few areas that dragged on a bit for being visually repetitive), and the puzzles it introduces are challenging without (usually) being so obscure that you need to seek a walkthrough. I got stuck in a couple of places due to it not being clear what the game wanted me to do, but in general trial and error was enough to progress.\n\nThe voice acting of the protagonist is pretty wonky - the guy has a good voice but the delivery is always borderline confused, like he genuinely doesn't know what he's saying. Every other voice in the game is pretty decent, so it's weird that the one that's so front-and-center is so awkward. But it wasn't anything that killed it for me, it was just a weird quirk.\n\nAnyway, the game ended up being a lot longer than I expected, and I enjoyed the vast majority of my time with it.

While I was on the fence about getting the game, I quickly realized that it is well worth the money. By the end of the first chapter, there was no way I could stop playing: the story line isn't cinema worthy but it is truly captivating.\n\nGameplay is simple yet versatile. You have a flashlight and a camera and are sent off to explore the labyrinth that is Stalburg. The voice acting is quite terrible but once you get past the initial cringe-iness, the voice acting is much more humorous. You can play the game at any pace: speedrun where your only objective is to get to the end; engineer, where your due diligence and ability to notice any and all minutae in your surroundings pays off with the satisfaction that you've made progress; it's your choice.\n\nThe balance between an amount of physical inaccessibility guiding you -- be it through locked doors, welded portals, or passages to what seems like nowhere -- and the amount of autonomy given to you, pushing you to explore anything and everything is truly mastered in the game. Whereas some games push you along by inhibiting your extraneous paths, INFRA provides a natural number of potential paths leading to different stories, outcomes, and realms. You're not overwhelmed by an inordinate amount of free choice whereby taking a path of your choice leads to your demise; rather your ability to take the path that you find rewarding proves itself in what you find.\n\nINFRA is certainly not a game to be taken for granted. Nor is it to be played only once. The number of times I went left instead of right; up instead of down; or forwards instead of backwards begs my curiousity to revisit it.\n\nThe environment is magnificent; 6 GB of scenery (and mechanics, critical game files, etc.) shows itself realistically, smoothly, immersively, and beautifully. The sounds are well placed and immersion in the game is almost instant.\n\nThat's not to say there is nothing wrong with this game. Some gameplay mechanics could be improved, functionality could be tweaked as far as interactive objects are concerned, and some graphic effects could be augmented.\n\nIn any case, if you are on the fence about buying the game, for me the game is well worth the price.

All you have to your name is a flashlight and a camera.  You start as a structural inspector but quickly turn into an engineer extraodinair while traversing a dam, steel plant, water treatment plant, and so on. There are lots of rewarding feelings you will get when playing this game as some of the puzzles are very challenging and it's a story I won't soon forget.  It's fun to explore around, read notes, listen to tape recordings and follow the story of Stalburg and it's people.  However, the game doesn't come without its drawbacks.\n\nFirst and foremost: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO INVEST SOME SERIOUS TIME IN BEATING JUST THE MAIN STORY.  This is probably the  longest linear/semi-linear story game I have ever played and that's saying something because this is a cheap indie game running on source engine. My main complaint is that this game was just too long.  I realize this sounds like an odd complaint and that most people want plenty of bang for their buck, but I clocked nearly 22 hours just gunning through the main story.  There are puzzles to complete when running through the main story but there are also lots of auxilary puzzles that can be completed on the side but in the true indie game fashion - there is no hud, no written objectives, and nothing to tell you when you're on a side objective or the main objective.  So it took me up until about 15 hours into the game before I started to be able to pick out what to look for in puzzles to determine if it was main story or otherwise.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n-Very immersive\n-Good graphics/source engine reliability\n-Intriguing puzzles\n\nCons:\n-Main story is about twice as long as it should've been .  I had an absolute blast up until about 10 hours in.  Couldn't believe the story kept going. Was just too much of a good thing. \n-At least 1 game breaking bug that forces a checkpoint reload\n-It's an indie game so there is no hand-holding.

Remember those chill sequences in Half-Life 2 where you got to explore desolate places and solve environmental puzzles without enemies bugging you? This is how playing INFRA feels like. INFRA is not without flaws though:\n[list]\n [*]Lets start with biggest one in the room - INFRA just LOOOOVES to cut you off from it's optional content - It's not often obvious which way is optional area and which is the main path that will cut you off from any sort of backtracking. Turned right instead of left? Too bad you can't go back now, this will later affect the ending since you didn't take enough pictures.\n[*]To add to the above you only have 4 save slots which lead us to the next flaw:\n[*]Main menu stylized as protagonist smarphone - very cool looking and original, but comes with a cost of usability - everything is tiny, graphics opitons are limited, you have to scroll the screen instead of seeing everything on one regular window\n[*]There are still areas where you can accidentaly trap yourself.\n[*]Game has no HUD - good for immersion, but hurts the gameplay a little: most keys that you pick up (but not all) look the same and are not shown anywhere, you have to check all the doors to see which one uses the key you just found. Technically keys have tags on them, but half of the time you can't see what's written on them since tags face away from you. Also 50% of the doors you encounter in game are purely cosmetic and cannot be opened - realistic, but a little frustrating for me as i love to explore and closed doors make me sad.\n[*]There is no way to pause the game other than through a console command. It's not a big deal for the gameplay, but there are times where player is required to act fast, and if you get distracted IRL there's no way to pause.\n[*]Handwritten in-game texts are sometimes hard to read. Again - realistic, but i would rather have a clean text that's easy to read.\n[*]Game uses Half-Life 2: Lost Coast era HDR effect and strong bloom that makes skybox blindingly white at times, the setting is most likely bundled with \"effects\" parameter in options menu, but i was to lazy to check. I think the game would look beter with it toned down or off.\n[*]Not a flaw but rather a nitpick - music only plays during scripted sequences, most of the time you explore with just ambient sounds in background.\n[/list]\nTo adress getting cut from backtracking and trapping yourself you can use noclip cheat (it's not cheating when you fight bugs or poor game design choices)\nTo end the review on postitive note - the game is really good and i highly recommend it if you like exploration and puzzle solving.

There are tons of little things in the game that most players would probably not even care or notice about, but the sum of the details makes an incredible whole.\n\nThe puzzles are not very difficult but they are just hard enough to jog your intuition just a little bit, there are also many optional puzzles and hidden objects you definitely will not find or do the first time around.\n\nMy only complaint so far is that the game does not allow you to go back if you accidentally progressed too far in the map before completing the optional puzzles in the game that grant you more insight into the story\n\nBottom line is this game is not your average indie walking simulator \"art\" game. This is going to be a cult-classic near masterpiece of a niche genre for a niche group of people who just \"get it\". \n\nOne of the best and definitely most interesting games of 2016, wish I knew about it sooner.", "timestamp_created": 1515038307, "timestamp_updated": 1515038307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39015863": {"recommendationid": "39015863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046143848", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506761882}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043a \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0435, \u043d\u044b\u043d\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1514995802, "timestamp_updated": 1514995802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38957334": {"recommendationid": "38957334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041550897", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507092561}, "language": "english", "review": "It's got a big, lovingly detailed map you can walk around in, but I just struggled to get interested in it.

There's no violence here and the main gameplay involves taking pictures of infrastructure damage (and documents related to that damage) and solving simple mechanical/structural puzzles in order to proceed.  You have a flashlight and camera, both of which you'll have to seek out new batteries to keep powered, but the game never really hides these things in devious places, so you shouldn't have to worry too much about it.\n\nThree things to note:\n\nFirst, the voice acting is...well, it's not great.  I'll just say that it's probably as good as it can be with the budget the development team were working with and leave it at that.\n\nSecondly, the game does NOT have full controller support as is advertised on the store page.  The controller mapping is not configurable, the game does not ever tell you what the controls for a controller are (all menus and gameplay only show keyboard shortcuts) and the gameplay using a controller is fairly janky.\n\nThirdly, the game does not have a permanent crosshair option.  By default, the game has no crosshair at all, and the crosshair option that is available only makes it appear when your viewpoint moves close to hotspot.  For a game about finding things in the environment, solving puzzles that sometimes consist of small dials and switches and generally being able to keep your bearings, not having a permanent crosshair as an option is frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1514757040, "timestamp_updated": 1514763676, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38889342": {"recommendationid": "38889342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015073437", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514696122}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Half-Life without guns.\n\nThis was way better, and longer, of a game than I expected.

The videos in the store page don't show anything spectacular. The premise does not seem attractive enough. Yet I decided to buy because some strange hunch I've had a few times before. The hunch worked flawlessly again.\n\nINFRA looks like an urban exploration simulator. With the difference that you have one reason to be in each location, and not everything is abandoned or wrecked. Moreover, the areas are big, and the attention to detail is impressive. The people who designed this deserves every penny. You can't end with something like this just by guessing how things should look. You need to do your research homework first.\n\nOn a side, personal note, though I'm not an urban explorer, when I was a kid, I had the chance of roam several times through a huge industrial complex, with warehouses, factories, machinery, labs, classrooms, offices, gardens, etc. [i]-With my dad's commandment, \"OK, BUT DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING\", before you ask-[/i]. And the feeling of solitude was something hard to describe, but it remained buried in the past until I played this game. It took me off-guard and it's one of the most astonishing gaming moments of my life.\n\nI'd have to say that as soon as I noticed that sometimes you can reach forbiden areas, I started to invest several hours wandering around, don't caring about the plot. Yes. Exploring the exploration game. Sometimes wondering things like [i]\"why is this place so well done? You're not supposed to climb here anyway!\"[/i]...I.e., some design holes contributed to add more hours of gameplay, even if the only reward was taking screenshots.\n\nFar from perfection, a bit about the bad:\n\n[list]\n[*]Voice acting. At the beginning. I totally disliked the main character voice. Got accustomed with the time, though.\n[*]Flashlight battery life. It's excessively short. Like a cheap way of adding some extra difficulty. On a game that tries to depict real scenarios, this is quite an annoyance.\n[*]Just a bunch of available save slots, with no way of entering a descriptive title.\n[*]Some of the \"puzzles\" are not exactly puzzles. At least not in an abstract sense. You just need to follow the machinery instructions. Sometimes the instructions are not fully clear so you need to use your logic. [b]I'm FINE with that[/b], but people might feel that they are doing work instead of playing anything.\n[*]Too much reading, if you want to keep track of the story. Not required, though.\n[*]Deadly waters. Mark Siltanen is officially the cotton-candy man. Water seems to be like sulfuric acid for him.\n[*]I'm probably being picky on this one, but sometimes, doors frames, racks or scattered objects block your path more than they should.\n[/list]\n\n\nFinally, I'm very impressed that this game has \"Very Positive\" reviews considering that a lot of people could criticize its slow pace, sub-par graphics and lack of hints.

Never would have thought that it would be possible to take something as mundane as being a structural analyst, and turn it into a compelling adventure.\n\nThe atmosphere and story are great, and Stalburg feels like a fleshed-out city. The sheer amount of environmental storytelling is staggering, and you'll gladly explore to know more. The game is definitely one of the prettier Source engine games... Except when it comes to the humans. Those fall straight into uncanny valley. Luckily, you don't see too many of them during most of the game. The voice acting pretty amateurish, but I don't know how much you can expect from an independent developer with a tight budget.\n\nThe puzzle designs are nicely varied and competent, but there are a few segments where you'll get stuck for hours because you failed to notice one teeny tiny detail, because you were so distracted by the bigger picture, or by things literally exploding around you. Some puzzles you can solve in two different ways or even ignore completely, and these affect the routes you can take and the ending that you get.\n\nAs a major negative, the game has really infuriating platforming segments over insta-death floors. These wouldn't be a problem, if your character didn't jump like he was wearing concrete shoes. You're gonna need to quicksave and quickload a LOT. There is also one segment with a super fragile pallet raft that will make you rage hard. The major mechanic of pulling yourself up ledges is insanely picky on when it wants to actually work, so you'll be jumping in front of boxes quite a bit before making progress. This can get pretty frustrating during timed puzzles. Finally, sometimes it's very unclear what water is safe and what isn't. Knee-deep water that was safe in one spot, might be an instant death two steps to the right.\n\nINFRA has a lot more replay value than most other games of its type. There are so many things to photograph, fix and collect, not to mention alternate routes, alternate endings and a plethora of hidden content. As for the moment of writing this, I have only one playthrough and already 30 hours in the game, with plenty more content still left to see. If you like puzzle games and exploring, and have plenty of patience, I highly recommend it.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Pretty for a Source game\n+ Good story\n+ Nice puzzles\n+ Replay value\n+ Lots of hidden content\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n- Bad platforming segments and one bad raft segment\n- Picky ledge grabbing\n- Inconsistent drowning spots\n- Amateurish voice acting\n\n[h1]FINAL SCORE: 8 / 10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1512904444, "timestamp_updated": 1512905039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38140967": {"recommendationid": "38140967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114636686", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519076138}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever(L)", "timestamp_created": 1512691229, "timestamp_updated": 1512691229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38099578": {"recommendationid": "38099578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981916485", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511909302}, "language": "english", "review": "TL:DR This game is hands down amazing i would recommend it regardless of the price, its well put together, has a great enviroment, brilliant story, nice mechanics and can keep you busy for hours at a time if you let it. If your into urban exploring this is for you.\n\nMy first run was spent mostly looking at the beautiful sceanery, sometimes you can spend a good deal of time just taking in the view and you only need look at the screenshots for that. This turns out to be quite handy because the aim of the game is finding all the cracks and problems with diffrent structures, buildings, etc. As the game progressed i started realising what i should be looking for, the cracks in the walls, steam leaking from pipes, the massive holes everywhere and it got me more and more involved in looking at everything. Basic rule of thumb is if its broken photograph it.\n\nThe puzzle mechanics are nice and break up the corridor sections, often you'll find that you hit a big puzzle area, wander around a bit to solve it and then move onto the next corridor leading to a smaller easier challange so that you keep moving. I admit that some areas can be fustrating but if your really stuck theres generally always instructions nearby plus only so many combinations of switches and valves so you'll get there in the end.\n\nThe enviroment in this game soon becomes your enemy, not only because of the above mentioned puzzles but also you will spend half the time wondering \"does this count\", \"should i photograph this\" and cleverly enough the camera has a nice mechanic to let you know. Also do not be afraid to use your battery's as this is probably the sole reason that you will miss things as you try to conserve them, generally without any need if your observant.\n\n I fully recommend playing with the headphones on as the sampaling work is pretty amazing and will drag you into the enviroment. The music is great as well and times in at appropriate moments adding to events and milestones.\n\nThe story unravels through documents and tapes you find at each site, if you see a piece of paper, book or something written on the wall, read it, so that you understand how everything has come to be the way it is ( then photograph it :P)\nAbsolutley fascinating way of revealing the story you feel more like a detective rather then a structual engineer. \n\nOnce your done with your first play through, your gonna want to run this again just for the fact that there is so much in it that you'll miss first time round. Keep your eyes open as there are some puzzles that link into later parts of the game. However you have 4 save slots and a quicksave option as well so theres plenty of chances to look back at a puzzle if you think you've missed something.\n\nBig congratulations to the guys that made this game its deffinatly one fo my all time favorites, if you happen to get the chance to adapt this for VR headsets at anytime i think it would really push it to the next level. Just as a nit pick i would have really liked an in game count of the documents and repair sites, maybe as a new game plus bonus or something, but thats just me :P\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512555744, "timestamp_updated": 1512555744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38090355": {"recommendationid": "38090355", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982497955", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513371410}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitly something different from any other game, a puzzle game with a setting which brings your mind to think. \nThe puzzle are at a level that anyone can solve them and have always logic to them.

However, exploring these places often requires you to get through various obstacles ranging from closed doors through malfunctioning equipment blocking your way to flooding, fire, toxic gas and various other environmental hazards. To deal with these, you'll need to find items hidden (sometimes way too well to be considered fun) in the environment, figure out how to fix and/or operate certain machines and other devices, or simply find the right path through a complex environment. As you go from location to location, you'll also come across old documents, which shed light on some dark secrets and conspiracies in the past of the city, and give some insight into why all the places you've visited are in such a poor condition in spite of being critical parts of Stalburg's infrastructure.\n\nThe puzzle gameplay of INFRA is a bit all over the place, and it was probably the weakest aspect of the game for me. Some of the puzzles are well communicated and fun to figure out, even many of the more complex mechanical/engineering themed ones have a logical flow which helps you clearly unerstand what needs to be done and giving proper hints as to how to achieve that. And then there are the ones which are completely counter-intuitive, way too drawn out for their own good, or you feel at every step of the way how much effort has been put into obfuscating an otherwise simple task into a jumbled mess of unconnected things to do, or making sure that a key element of the puzzle is hidden in the least likely location in the least visible way. As a whole, it will average out to an ok puzzle experience, but there are qute a few frustrating moments temporarily making the game feel less fun than it actually is.\n\nIf some of the puzzles were my personal low, then the architectural design of the various environments you encounter over the course of the game is hands down the best aspect of it. Some unavoidable artistic liberty aside here and there, every single place feels as real as anything you can find in any larger city in the world. The layout of the outdoors areas and the floorplan of the buildings make sense from a practical/engineering point of view, the industrial and other installations are not just a bunch of random machinery thrown together for the looks, but actually follow the technical procedures of whatever was supposed to be taking place at that location, and the detailing of each location helps selling it even more as something \"real\". Another aspect of the level design, especially in the underground and long abandoned locations is how well it can build and maintain a really tense, even frightening atmosphere without crossing the border into \"horror territory\" or using cheap tricks like jump scares (although if you are really good at exploring every hidden and remote area, making the connections and thinking a bit outside the box, you may encounter things which will come to you as a shock, quite literally ;). The developers have squeezed every bit of performance out of the Source engine, making the game a sight to behold even compared to some of todays more modern game engines, although at the price of extreme memory requirement. (Don't even think about trying the game at max settings unless you have at least 8 GB system memory. I was like \"Oh, Source engine, how demanding can this be? Let's crank it all the way up!\" Very bad idea; constant paging, 30 seconds freezes, several minutes loading times level bad.)\n\nAnd while most games that are built on exploration and puzzles offer little reason to play them again after you've figured things out on your first playthrough, INFRA has a certain level of non-linearity, which makes later maps play slightly differently based on what you did and discovered on previous maps. This means that unless you make the exact same choices and do the exact same things during a subsequent playthrough as in a previous one, the game may play slightly differently this time. And based on your deliberate and accidental actions throughout the game, as well as how attentive you've been in spotting the damage you were sent out to survey and discovering the old documents scattered about, you'll get one of several different endings, which might also be a reason to revisit the game a few more times to try to find what you may have missed in the previous playthroughs.\n\nAs a whole, if you don't mind slightly (and at times not even just slightly) annoying puzzles while exploring a real-world looking, beautifully realized and detail rich game world, topped off with a story to piece together about how and why a number of corrupt politicians and businessmen almost brought down an entire city in trying to seize more power and money for themselves, INFRA is an ejnoyable game with a somewhat unique gameplay, nice atmosphere, good music (oh, I didn't specifically mention music, let's just say it's good, I really liked it, and the soundtrack is available if you feel like listening to it again after having heard it in the game) used sparingly,  and enough reason to revisit it a few times if you liked your first run.", "timestamp_created": 1511448830, "timestamp_updated": 1511451339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37065820": {"recommendationid": "37065820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117987081", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518729685}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Awsome Amazing Reality puzzle ... epic scenery's .. game plot keeps growing, its a reality adventure with many secrets!

It actually gets frustrating \u2013 essentially you\u2019re underground the entire time and you have to earn your route back to the surface, but when you do it is one of the great feelings of gaming. \n\nI will say this \u2013 the game can be uneven. For every two outstanding sections there\u2019s a less inspired or downright poor one. And the amount of underground can be a hindrance more than anything else.\n\nBut the thing is meant to be a long hard day at work and it certainly rewards you for the battles you\u2019ll put in to get to the end of it.\n\nInfra is a game which didn\u2019t get much coverage and few people know about it \u2013 when it\u2019s bad it\u2019s really insufferable (some bugs as well as some of the design hurt it) but when it\u2019s good it\u2019s absolutely stunning.\n\nIt\u2019s a game without enemies, without people to kill, without anyone to shoot. It\u2019s 30+ hours of you with your torch and camera and lots and lots to do and discover.\n\nHighly recommended.\n", "timestamp_created": 1510930595, "timestamp_updated": 1510930595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746594", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36532080": {"recommendationid": "36532080", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989052543", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511102217}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm 43 hours into this game right now and loving every second.

Despite the jolly humour and lighthearted beginnings the core atmosphere of [i]INFRA[/i] is filled with dread. Please do not mistake [i]INFRA[/i] as being another typical horror game at first glance, instead think of it as being a first-person \"walking sim\" on steroids. I highly recommend this to fans of puzzle games in a similar vein to [i]Myst[/i], to those with an appreciation for detail, and to whomever would have the patience to delve into various notes, documentation, and sights in order to slowly extract and piece together this breadcrumb trail of exposition as it balloons into something much larger than anyone could have anticipated.\n\nBased in Finland, [i]INFRA[/i]'s campaign will see the protagonist, Mark, cross an entire city, trying to save himself, whatever, and whomever else he can whilst everything crumbles down around him. My first playthrough of [i]INFRA[/i] offered a playtime of around 30 hours which I can see being doubled in order to discover all the intricacies that this game and its world has to offer.\n\n[i]INFRA[/i] is an absolutely stellar game where developer, Loiste Interactive, displays an insane attentiveness in regards to the detail and quality of the game and its world: from incredibly complex story lines where each branching narrative and its characters are subtly interwoven and eventually come together in the end; having each chapter's set pieces tastefully hide tonnes of pop-culture references and further important revelations to the story that can easily be overlooked as just another in-game texture; containing puzzles that may require the player to accomplish something seemingly insignificant in the first few hours of gameplay that won't prove its usefulness until the final act; and a masterful handle of the Source Engine with massive, sprawling levels and visual tricks that keeps the adventure interesting and occasionally provoking a sense of true horror.\n\nFor fans of point and clicks from the '90s to the present day, for anyone who enjoys puzzles with a logical and methodical solution, and for those who want to experience something completely different and who have an appreciation for detail, [i]INFRA[/i] provides all of that and more. There is no doubt in my mind that [i]INFRA[/i] is my game of the year for 2017 and one of the best adventure/puzzle games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.\n\nView my [url=https://www.twitch.tv/collections/2uqZjG3C6xRldA]playthrough of INFRA[/url] on Twitch.", "timestamp_created": 1508812116, "timestamp_updated": 1511301280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35944857": {"recommendationid": "35944857", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985402480", "num_games_owned": 615, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508611249}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me want to be a structural analyst.\n\nWhile not traditionally \"graphically impressive\" (which may be from the choice of engine), INFRA still manages to stun with its environments. The massive open vistas of dilapidated industrial facilities and the winding service tunnels beneath both play in the Source engine's favour. That the game's main focus is on observing the environment says something about how good it looks; it comes under scrutiny far more often here than in other games, and I can't say I saw more odd seams and glitches than in any AAA title.\n\nThe puzzles vary in difficulty, and they don't really follow a clear difficulty curve (except for some of the later puzzles having a time limit), which is not really a problem as the focus of the puzzles is more about fitting into the world. They do that amiably.\n\nThe humour of the story is typically Finnish, something I really love, and the \"ambient narrative\" about corruption is told in a really cool way. Any questions about why certain parts of the environment is the way it is can be answered by the scattered notes. They way sidequests have consequences further down the line is also very neat.\n\n I worry that some people may miss important parts if they don't read everything they photograph. I started out thinking that the documents weren't supposed to be read because of the almost-transparent ink colour and the low resolution, but after a while I realized that wasn't the case. That's definitely a point of future improvement, overall texture quality is on the low end, and for the documents it's on the verge of being unacceptable. It is still readable with some effort.\n\nThe absolutely worst part of the game is unfortunately the voice acting. I can see that this really was a labour of love and I hate to be negative about such a thing as someone's voice, but the quality overall is low and the main character is just awful. He gets the enunciation wrong in just about every line of the game. I get that he's supposed to be a Finn, but Finns usually speak English a lot better than this. He also doesn't \"sound like a surveyor\". It's really a nitpick, but it goes a long way to help immersion. Someone like Grady from the Practical Engineering YouTube Channel is more of what I'd select as a voice actor, with proper enunciation and an air of professionalism.\n\nAll in all, a top-notch experience with some minor hiccups, which shouldn't be missed by anyone who has even a minor interest in infrastructure. If you can't stand the main character, that's understandable. Fortunately, he speaks relatively little.", "timestamp_created": 1508765526, "timestamp_updated": 1508765526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35874688": {"recommendationid": "35874688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197690074", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508278522}, "language": "english", "review": "Unsung excellence.  Why isn\u2019t this game much better known? \n\nIt\u2019s hard to summarise Infra but that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t fit any obvious genre. It has Myst-like puzzles but it\u2019s not just a puzzle game. Then there are bleak underground areas with a heavy sense of dread in the air but without horror monsters to face. And it's all joined up with huge detailed explorable areas which would grace a AAA blockbuster. It combines these beautifully to give you (in my case) 50 hours\u2019 worth of unhurried playability in the first run through without a single enemy to fight or weapon to fire. And the perfect pacing maintained my enthusiasm to keep going every step of the way.\n\nThe jewels in the crown for me though are the fabulously detailed industrial environments. I\u2019ve worked in places which have plant, switch panels, pipelines, ladders, cable trays etc. [i]exactly[/i] like this. The dev team and artists have got this absolutely spot-on; the immersion here is total, right down to the tatty control rooms and abandoned workshops with tools, coffee cups and notes left by long-gone workers. Each one had its own challenge and \u201cAha!\u201d moment of satisfaction to slowly tease out before you could move on.\n\nCriticism? Well, the logic of some of the switch & valve puzzles can be a little off-piste. There was one in particular which required [spoiler] a stuck valve to be freed by throwing three bricks into the mechanism [/spoiler]. I\u2019d still be there now if it wasn\u2019t for the walk-through. And there are a few timed puzzles which I for one dislike. I\u2019m an older gamer and don\u2019t have a young person\u2019s quick reactions, so I just die dozens of times over before getting through. No fun there, just stress and broken immersion. So that would be my one change request: an \u201ceasy mode\u201d option to globally increase the timeout on all timed puzzles to make them more easily achievable for players like me.\n\nBut in the end, they all added to the quirkiness of this unique world.

If you like exploration, and long rewarding gameplay I very seriously urge you to check this one out. Despite how there are some dark, even mild tension inducing parts in the game it's overall a very relaxing, chill experience. This isn't one to be rushed! The game is very long - and even so it manages to keep the player interested and immersed. I found no part boring myself. There are some minor, vexing inconveniences; such as the terribly energy hungry camera and flashlight. But to be fair there are plenty of batteries really, and managing them isn't terribly challenging. Some bugs here and there; that is an unfortunate little downside to this game. Nothing that can't be managed though. \n\nThere is a very well spun, even a somewhat complex story and plot in the game; but there are also plenty of hidden easter eggs and strategically sprinkled bits of humour to keep it from becoming too serious. I'm a bit conflicted on weather one can call it a walking simulator. On some ways I suppose the term can be partially accurate here - but keep in mind there are plenty of puzzles and exploration to keep you more active than your usual \"walking simulator\" would. At least in my humble opinion. \n\nIf one is a fan of a chill, exploration experience, I seriously urge you to check this little gem out. Even more so if you happen to Finnish like myself; there are plenty of little jokes us Finns will definitely notice and apperciate. (there are even a couple of references to Kummeli; I won't spoil and say what and where they are but they made me laugh when I found them!) \n\nFinally I'd like to just praise the environments. They are absolutely beautiful, even if you find yourself inside a crumbling, rusty decrepit damn or outside in the more foresty, shiny areas. Rust or lush greenery, it's all wonderfully created. I have nothing but respect and love for the devs here! \n\nI DEMAND MOAR. \n\nAll in all: Great, fun, long rewarding gameplay, wonderful silly little easter eggs (especially if you're a Finn), enjoyable puzzles and hell, it's just great fun. You also feel sympathy for the poor player character. Really isn't having a very good day :P \n\nPlease consider buying this if you like long, rewarding exploration games.", "timestamp_created": 1507189148, "timestamp_updated": 1507189148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35474549": {"recommendationid": "35474549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132286296", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518646937}, "language": "english", "review": "INFRA is easily one of my favourite games of all time, it's got tricky puzzle elements, large and expansive environments, and an interesting and compelling story.

If you happen to have a thing for abandonment and urban decay, then you're going to have an even better time.\n\nYou are also a site inspector of sorts in this game, so there is also a photography aspect to the game where you snap photographic evidence of areas that are damaged, deteriorating, or dangerous. Basically take a photo of anything that looks like some kind of OSHA violation. This part of the game can be a little frustrating because sometimes things look photo-worthy when they're not and vice versa. But if you open your camera, the viewfinder should hint whether a photo should be taken or not. The game also could do more to underscore this aspect of the game or explain what it is for. It is possible to forget about the photography and complete the game without taking any photos, for example, which may lead some players to ignore it if they don't see the purpose.\n\nAnother demerit could be the areas in the game where there are environmental hazards that can kill you---especially areas where the player is obligated to perform a specific sequence of actions on a fast time limit or else immediately die. These segments often feel confounding, cheap, or frustrating; but hang in there. It doesn't happen TOO often.\n\nBut the real draw of the game is its nostalgic Myst-iness. As a person who craves that type of experience and is sort of sad that we don't see many titles like that, it really does a lot for me. And unlike games from Cyan, it's more friendly to slightly older machines.\n\nIt's a pretty solid game, though I am sure the $25 price tag will make some people hesitate--especially if they are not too sure what to expect. If you really really enjoy that slow exploration/puzzle type Myst feel, and if you enjoy abandonment and urban decay, then it should be worth the money for you. As I understand, this game will be updated later with more episodes, which should add even more value to the game.\n\nIt's not without its odd rough edges here and there, but on the whole, I feel it was a good buy.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is absolutely worth full price.\n[h1]6) A solid good game that is worth the full price.[/h1]\n5) A pretty good game that may or may not be quite worth full price.\n4) An alright game, but opinions are likely to strongly differ on the game's value.\n3) A bit rough, but with some interesting or redeeming qualities.

Some scenes are quite beautiful. The backstory is rather unique and appealing. Some instances are genuinely frightening without involving monsters, jump-scares, and the like. Puzzles are very varied, involving acquiring information or manipulating objects in a combination of rooms or facilites in order to progress the main puzzle; thus, advancing your physical progression through the area. (My particular favorites are the instances where you interact with a computer and manipulate facility functions to get it back in proper running order). The computer interfaces for these puzzles are very satisfiying. I don't know why, but I found the uniformity of the piping that can be seen throughout the game to be very pleasing, especially the color-coded ones. The physics at times where things collapsed or broke were very impressive. I found the way you interact with menus, settings, and saves to be very pleasing. The game is stable, and well optimized.\n\n[u][b]Dislikes[/b][/u]\nI ran the game at 4k, so I often found the textures to be adequate in some areas, but the world is very large, involving many assets to texture, so this can be overlooked. Effects, such as from explosions, are subpar. The puzzles are what ultimately got me. I am essentially half way through the game, and I just can't bring myself to play it any longer. The freedom to explore with a lack of direction is welcome to some, but aggravating to others. I fall into the latter category. When you get to a new puzzle involving buttons, switches, and dials some notes, scrap paper, or just some form of direction or information is provided on how to begin solving the puzzle at hand. However, the arrangement and use of these dials, switches, and buttons ends up being used in so many different and new ways throughout the game, that you sometimes don't know how to continue solving the other half of a puzzle without the guidance of a walkthrough, which becomes annoying very quickly. The camera is also a point of contention for me. At first, it was novel and unique, but as time progressed, it just became something I cared less and less about, and finally stopped doing altogether. I had no incentive or way to measure my progress with the pictures I had taken. The flashlight is also a pain. I was almost always getting by, by the skin of my teeth with batteries, which is a pain, because most places don't have sufficent lighting. And, if you want more batteries, you have to use your flashlight to look in tight and obscure places, so it is rather self-defeating. The voice acting is also comical, both for good and for bad. In terms of quality, I would place it at the half way point.\n\nTL;DR:\nOverall, the puzzles become increasing annoying, with a few gems of the computer-based puzzles intermingled. The voice acting is adequate. The camera mechanic gives you little sense of purpose or a goal.

Part 3 is as amazing and interesting as the previous parts.  Pick it up if you've been waiting for it to be complete first.  Still worth every penny.  Short review about part 3 below.\n\n-Review-\n\nHonestly, one of the best puzzle adventure games I've played in years.  There is so much to see and find while playing, I never felt once like I was wasting my time by taking the obviously not correct way to go, in fact I felt rewarded most of the time by coming across collectibles and little pieces of lore.  \n\nThe level design is bloody amazing, everything seems to have a purpose and not once did I feel like an area was empty or meaningless.  The entire game feels so connected and gave me a clear sense of progression as I played the game.\n\nThe graphical design of the game, even though its limited by the source engine, is still beautiful.  Standing on top of a large tower and looking out at the horizon and seeing a sprawling town with individual buildings, trees, planes, cars, people, and more, was just breathtaking.\n\nThe puzzles for the game are all challenging, but don't fall to the same problems that most adventure games with puzzles seem to have when it comes to logic.  You're always sure what needs to be done to progress and simply need to take some time to understand the problem.\n\nWhile its a puzzle game where you can mostly work at your own pace, there are still moments in the game where you have to act fast and feel real pressure to figure things out, such as a room collapsing on you while you figure out how to get a door open.\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle games like the witness, you'll like this game.  If you're a fan of linear style adventure games like Half-Life, you'll like this game.  If you're a fan of games with heavy atmosphere and mystery, you'll like this game.\n\n\nThere are also some bugs in the game.  I've found very few, none of which were game breaking for me, but others have experienced some bad ones.  Luckily the devs are very active and communicative with the community and have an active github you can submit bugs too which will be fixed fast.  They are also active on the steam forums.\n\n\nTL;DR, great game, worth full price easily, third episode should be released soon.\n\n-Part 3 short review-\n\nPart 3 was just released, and introduced some brilliant, and slightly frustrating designs to the game.  If you've played the first 2 parts, then you're probably used to the more enclosed, linear underground areas.  Without going into too much detail, part 3 is a lot more open than the previous parts, which can make figuring out what you're supposed to do a bit more challenging, simply because you have so much more ground to explore to figure things out. \n\nSome of the more annoying and frustrating introductions to the game include finding very small parts scattered along a very open area, with numerous paths to take and very little direction given.  You're going to get lost in part 3 a lot.  If you prefer exploration, you'll love part 3.  If you prefer puzzles however, part 3 might leave a little to be desired.\n\nPart 3 TL;DR:  Great conclusion to the game, lacking slightly with puzzles, mostly exploration.  Little frustrating at time. Still worth 25$ easily.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't open B2.", "timestamp_created": 1501570146, "timestamp_updated": 1506673382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549368", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33867871": {"recommendationid": "33867871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287415001", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506956402}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e.\n\u0422\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443 \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0442 \u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430:\n\n....................................................................................................\n-\u042f\u0439\u0446\u0430\n-\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\n   \u0416\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0443!\n....................................................................................................\n\n \u0421\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0432 1 \u0436\u0438\u0436\u0443 \u0438 \u0436\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c (\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0435).\n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430!!!", "timestamp_created": 1501283609, "timestamp_updated": 1501330257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.375635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33798553": {"recommendationid": "33798553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302175537", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501494952}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was highly detailed.

It's quite similar to walking simulators only a bit more challenging since you can die. The graphics are good (i think it's the source engine from Half Life 2) story is a bit mysterious and long.

The story is good and long (longer if you're the investigative type). Music is ok but i didn't buy the soundtrack (maybe on a sale). It's definitely one of the better walking (action) simulators out there - the engineer sections seem quite faithful to real life (though i'm not an engineer), there is a lot of nice nature areas as well as abandoned buildings to investigate. I definitely recommend this game but watch gameplay on the net just in case - you can refund games on steam now but the below two hours gameplay may not be enough since the start is a bit slow.

If you're someone who loves to explore and appreciates small details, you won't be disappointed by this game.

I ended up playing through the entire thing a second time and saw so many things I had missed the first time. The devs were also quite good at coming back and patching issues.

An independently developed Civil Engineer Puzzle, Thriller, Mystery, Survival game I never knew I wanted! A game like that must sound odd to most, after all, what could be so thrilling about being a game where your job is to go around fixing a city's worth of infrastructural issues? The fact is, everything's been abandoned, built poorly, in extreme disrepair, or just down right broken. Also most of the things in those horrible conditions are not things you want like that. Such as Subway tunnels, sewer tunnels under the city, a whole dam, water treatment plants, power stations, and it all falls under a corruption scandal. The story is still going and the final Part 3 is still on the horizon with no release date in sight, but I have faith an amazing game like this has people working passionately behind the scenes to complete this properly but at their own pace. The one thing I want to point out as the big part of the game I enjoy, it has to be the Engineering puzzles. The story is awesome, the suspenseful almost horror like elements are well done on their own, but my interest is mainly with the Puzzles. I always feel like I accomplished something when I run around a building or a series of tunnels and manage to fix something using only notes and signs left behind by the now unemployed workers or unfortunate explorers, or just my ability as a puzzle solver to find the answer to each puzzle. And they always feel like a pure achievement as you fix a water treatment plant the city needed, or restoring electricity, preventing disasters, correcting the problems like a Civil Engineer would in real life! In fact I'd say the game about meets the definition of engineer: A person who performs precision guess work based on unreliable data provided by those of questionable knowledge. See also Wizard, Sorcerer. I'd say fixing a whole city's infrastructure using sticky notes and ones own wits about sum up the game.

A lesser problem is the constant need for batteries for your only two items: Your camera and your flashlight. Use of these are very simple. Pull out the camera to snap pictures of decayed or damaged infrastructure. You're going to be taking a lot of pictures. The flashlight is exactly that; A flashlight. The batteries you find out of the field and you'll find plenty of them. I never ran out of batteries but it's an odd that the devs decided on this gameplay choice. You either ran out which would suck or you never ran into a problem with battery supply.\n\nAnother nitpick for me was the slow running speed and the amount of long hallways. This game requires you to back track at times. This was perhaps the most annoying part of the game as I usually don't take the time to smell the flowers.\n\nThe goodside of this game is that it is an amazing exploration game with tonnes of interactive puzzles and a conspiracy theory developing as you play. The best part, in my opinion, is that all of it is completely skippable. You can leave broken things broken, you aren't actually required to take any pictures and the conspiracy is just a side plot for those who are interested. This gives it a huge amount of replayability in my book. I've played through the game twice and though I think I've seen all that I can, fixed all that I could I'm still going to replay it again. \n\nAt first the voice acting sounded a little off. The voice actors are non-native speaking and all have a thick Finnish accent but half way through the first part the accent grew on me. \n\nIt is such a shame that this game hasn't gotten as much attention as it should have. The game has a secret puzzles that expands throughout the whole game and, as far as I've checked, it hasn't even been solved yet (As of 23 April 2017). I am eagerly awaiting the release of part 3.\n\nUpdate: Part 3 is out and I'm as impressed as I'd thought I'd be.

The idea seems to be keeping players from running around with the camera out like a teen walking with a cell phone - but limiting the few people who would actually do that [which is harmless, anyway] by making a problem for all other players...it's unfortunate.  It feels like it wants to make all the wonderful puzzles into time-based ones (which most puzzle gamers hate) - if it's dark, you now have limited time to work on an otherwise clever situation.  Or maybe it feels like you're constantly playing a horrible minigame.\nDevelopers, please, everything but the batteries is amazing - finding secret items is cool, but they can be anything else.", "timestamp_created": 1489118173, "timestamp_updated": 1489118173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691175", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30347897": {"recommendationid": "30347897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036798720", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488757872}, "language": "german", "review": "richtig gutes game. man bleibt eigentlich kaum wo h\u00e4ngen. die r\u00e4tsel erschlie\u00dfen sich von selber. eine stelle war mir nicht ganz klar wie man auf die l\u00f6sung kommt. hat f\u00fcr mich keinen sinn ergeben, aber glaube das lag an mir :D das ende ist leider etwas abrupt und mit den ganzen fotos die man schie\u00dft h\u00e4tte man noch irgendwas anstellen k\u00f6nnen :P trotzdem hat es sehr spa\u00df gemacht mit langer spielzeit ohne langeweile :) guter walking simulator in cooler umgebung mit technik und maschinerie. daumen hoch :)", "timestamp_created": 1488758509, "timestamp_updated": 1488758509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30307324": {"recommendationid": "30307324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032993020", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510784983}, "language": "german", "review": "Thank you Loiste Interactive for this f...ing great game!\n\nEs ist die unglaublich gelungene Atmosph\u00e4re, weshalb dieses Game mir so sehr gef\u00e4llt.

Das Sounddesign finde ich hier ebenfalls sehr ansprechend und haucht dem Spiel Seele ein. Dieses Spiel hat es geschafft, dass ich nicht aufh\u00f6ren konnte und die Nacht durchgesuchtet habe (hat seit mindestens 3 Jahren kein Game mehr geschafft). Auch die R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6se ich gerne - auch wenn die nicht sonderlich innovativ sind.

Because there's a barrel in the way and the designers decree that I shall not be able to move barrels.) You have to do everything one specific way, which can turn into a game of guessing the designers' intent. More than once I've imagined going back to tell the boss, \"I'm not going back down there without a crowbar, a non-awful flashlight, breathing gear, some of those red fuses, and all the keys you can find.\" Still, it's pretty interesting.\n\nAs for the story, I barely know more than you can gather from the voice-over trailer: massive corruption scandal and terrible infrastructure maintenance leading to a city about to collapse. I've read many in-game documents and still can't tell you much more than that, other than that there is a serious hobo problem and a long-term conspiracy theory. One interesting thing here is that there are no supernatural elements (aside from one hidden achievement) despite how much the outdoor parts resemble Skyrim and the indoor parts, Fallout.

Just wow.  I'm almost positive most of the reviews for this game are fake.  I could tell less than 5 minutes into the game that this was going to be horrible.  Stiff animations and terrible voice acting with people who could barely speak the language.  The game is basically a Half-Life mod and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the assets were just purchased online.\n\nThe game starts in a room where you review a powerpoint.  You're tasked with photographing dams or something, but who cares.  You don't know where your desk is and turning in the game makes you want to puke your brains out.

The idea is nice; pure exploration with some social commentary and light puzzles. Unfortunately, a few design decisions are just so poor that it ruins the experience. Some examples:\n\n[list]\n[*]At one point, as soon as you step onto a rickety raft, it launches and it's incredibly difficult to steer. If you hit [b]anything[/b], it breaks apart and you \"die\" because you touched deep water.\n\n[*]There are several places where you have to jump around like a platformer. You even have to place boxes in exactly the right place or your feeble jumping skills won't make the gap.\n\n[*]In another area, the instructions (which are generally good) say \"do this and that opens\", but what they don't mention is it doesn't open immediately after you do \"this\". Because the ceiling is collapsing (which will kill you), you are looking for immediate feedback.\n\n[*]The level design is generally good, but in a few places, very vexing. There are several places where once you go through a particular door, you cannot go back and there's stuff you missed.\n\n[*]There are way too many places that require you to crouch (which makes you move very slowly) or are very dark (which requires the flashlight). I understand this is realistic, but after the umpteenth ventilation duct and dark room, it just becomes a massive drag.\n[/list]\n\nIn short, this game seems to want to be too many things. It's not an action game, so don't make navigating a raft of death hard. It's not a platformer, so don't make me do precision jumps. It's not a repeat play game, so don't prevent me from getting to areas because I went left first instead of right first. It's not a stealth game, so stop forcing me to slowly crouch through unlit areas.\n\nLastly, this game would be perfect for VR which it doesn't support. VR is lacking good games and I think, with some of my other issues addressed, this would be a great experience in VR. It's clear the dev's tried, but I think they missed the mark a bit too much for me to recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1484458949, "timestamp_updated": 1489857333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702704", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29190540": {"recommendationid": "29190540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970159801", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484166075}, "language": "english", "review": "In level 3 ran out of flashlight batteries and can no longer play because I can not see the puzzles or where to go or to find more batteries.

You can for example fix a water treatmant plant and in the process learn how these operate.\n\nI could recommend this game just for the story alone, but the whole way the game is setup, I love it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1482335578, "timestamp_updated": 1482335578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28506090": {"recommendationid": "28506090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023341516", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482321637}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e.\n\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0444\u0435 \u0441 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e?", "timestamp_created": 1482322087, "timestamp_updated": 1482322087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28495527": {"recommendationid": "28495527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338938233", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482273327}, "language": "english", "review": "so this game is fantastic if you don't want a shooting game. tremendous scenery, challenging puzzles without driving me too crazy like Obduction did (though i did love Obduction). \n\nCons would include all the photography, which seems kind of pointless other than maybe an achievement. Also, the dark scenes required finding a lot of flashlight batteries, and at times that became annoying, trying to see in the dark when necessary to save flashlight batteries.\n\nI was able to complete all but the final chapter with no cheating using walkthroughs, and then the final chapter did me in and i had to use a walkthrough for some hints. When I got to the point in the final chapter where I had to open flood gate #4, i simply could not do it. there was a wired set of switches and 4 lights at the bottom that i was never able to solve, even after checking a walkthrough. in fact, the walkthrough displayed that puzzle with no switches, but with 8 lights at the top, wiring in the middle, then the same 4 lights at the bottom. The flood gates #1 through 4 had red lights above them. Yet in the walkthrough gate #3 did not have a red light. So i searched and searched, went as far backward as i could, but never found a way to turn the light off for gate #3. I'm wondering if i missed something or something went wrong with the game. Luckily i was able to finish the game by finding another route to the electrical generators. That was another thing i appreciated about the game.....there was more than one way to progress if you missed something. i hate when it's game over if every single clue and puzzle must be solved to continue forward. this game didn't have that issue and didn't become frustrating.\n\nanyway, fantastic game, worth more than the price. i played 55 hours and at times felt it would never end! i can't imagine anyone not liking this game, unless they need violence with their games.

As an older gamer I find the pace is set by the player rather than game (although there are a few time based puzzles), but on the whole you get to explore the environments at your leisure and solve a nuber of varied puzzles, some of which can be challenging (at least for me anyway).  The graphics are good without being great, but that doesn't detract from the gameplay.  It's one of the few games I've put in the hours and keep coming back to play again - for someone without much free time that's a big thumbs up.

If you want a game that will allow you to explore abandoned structures and offer you some great puzzles along the way I highly recommend INFRA.\n\nINFRA manages to separate itself from the pack of walking simulators very quickly by making every area of the game worthy of exploring, but also having so many puzzles that immerse you into the world and contribute to the tone and atmosphere of the game. The puzzles are very creative, often involving many different variables and there are often puzzles that you will miss on your first playthrough (I know I did!). The enviroments are large and open ended -  exploring the enviroments never ceases to be interesting. In fact on my second playthrough I found many areas and passages that I had missed on my first playthrough which I thought I did a thorough job on. However even on my second playthrough I still didn't get the 90% repaired achievement. The amount of content is amazing and with part 2 out and continuing the line of excellent puzzle design, interesting world development it pains me to see the game so underrated. \n\nThe voice acting at times sounds weird. As if the voice actor wasn't a native English speaker and was fighting with his accent. It isn't a big deal and I've come to find some of the lines endearing over my playtime. \n\nOverall INFRA is a game I highly recommend.

I absolutley HATE the main character (The guy you control) and I can't even see him (Not even mirrors work). I wish he wouldn't even talk as he sounds like a Resident Evil 1 voice actor. The options menu is a bit of a pain to use as well when you aren't on the starting menu which is a strange complaint for a Source game. I can't access certain options when ingame and while some do appear on your phone which is kind of immersive this is a game where you can't even see your feet or reflection. The only thing really going for Infra so far are it's visuals which while not on par with Black Mesa are quite good. But it's more style over substance and as painfully linear as Dear Esther with limited interactivity and poorly explained rub against everything puzzles. It would rather you just look and not touch. You can jump and crouch but swimming? Hell no! Best to do a dumb puzzle instead. It's not the worst thing I've played it's just boring and dissapointing.

Stalberg's power and water networks are failing, and you must see whether you can repair them enough to keep operating, and also photograph every hazard and failing you notice.  \n\nNow, if all that sounds terribly dull to you, believe me when I say that INFRA is quite possibly one of the most atmospheric games set in a modern, urban setting.  It soon becomes clear that there is something currupt or even more sinister going on, and that perhaps you're not as safe as you think you are.  There is also a tinge of horror with a couple of jump scares that you might or might not encounter depending on where you go and what you do.  \n\nINFRA is essentially a combination of simulation, puzzle, part-platformer, hacker and escape-the-room gameplay with a small touch of horror on occasion, but it is all in such perfect context that all these aspects blend seamlessly.  For example: the early game necessitates repairing and reconnecting a flooded dam to the power grid, which entails figuring out how to override security doors, power up machinery and repair as much of the damage as you can without getting yourself killed in the process.  You don't feel like you've been presented with a set puzzle at all but instead are carrying out your routine day-job in a simulation.  Some people describe the game as a walking simulator but it's really not just that: you're mostly not JUST walking, but figuring out a puzzle or photographing as many aspects of damage as you can spot, as the atmosphere becomes creepier.  \n\nThe game's puzzles range in difficulty but none are impossibly obscure.  The most difficult aspect of the game is that it doesn't follow through in a predictable linear path: for example you might find you can choose Route A which will give you a whole new area to solve, or alternatively take Route B which leads to a secret but skips the new area offered by Route A.  As gamers we're more used to being able to follow ALL parts of the game (ie see the secret AND access all puzzles) but it isn't always the case in INFRA and you might need to reveal different parts of the game in different play-throughs.\n\n\n[h1]What's to like?[/h1]\nThe atmosphere and the rich variety of INFRA's different environments are superb.  INFRA is an absolute dream for anyone who either likes the idea of exploring urban decay or tinkering with industrial structures such as pumping houses, sewers, power plants and even a dam.  The puzzles are engaging and well thought out, helping the game feel more like a simulation rather than a pure puzzle game.  The world is large and, although linear, there are multiple paths you can take and there is realism in what you can and cannot do (jump off a 20ft ledge in this game and you'll crunch a few bones and die).  A lot of the graphics are truly stunning, let down only by some low-resolution textures on equipment and posters.  For people who like to solve a mystery, there is an optional code to crack (sorry - not giving ANY clues here) in various forms.  The game reveals a story through audio tapes, letters and newspaper clippings that you can choose to read or not.  For an indie game, and one that has only released two of its three parts, there is a lot of content already, offering excellent value for money (the third part is to be released for free).  \n\n\n[h1]Anything not so good?[/h1]\nNot much, to be honest.  The very start of the game feels a bit laborious (more irritation than puzzle) which is a shame because the rest of this game deserves a much richer introduction. Still, get your kit, find your car, and then you're away - and into the game proper!\n\nMovement can be a bit glitchy - especially in parts of the game requiring a bit of platforming, but I suspect this is due to the engine rather than the game.  The voice acting is not so good and (at first) breaks the immersiveness until you get used to it.  Sometimes, you can find yourself inadvertently past a point of no return which might mean you can't complete an aspect of the game unless you reload one of the four limited game-save slots (or start the section again).   There are a few complaints in reviews about the speed batteries are eaten up, and while that is VERY true, it is the game's metric needed to create an urgency and sense of survival, so I can see why this has been done.\n\n\n[h1]In summary...[/h1]\nINFRA is a superb indie game packed full of atmosphere - of particular delight for anyone who likes the idea of exploring and fixing derelict and decaying industry.  It's a bit glitchy here and there but the gameplay and simulation puzzles make up for this ten-fold.  Even though the third and final part of the game is yet to come, there is plenty of game already (it kept me busy for close on 50 hours).

Very very immersive. Though it's very linear experience it has a feeling of sprawling lining environment. In a vein like Half-Life did. Imagine if Half-Life had no guns/enemies - it'd be pretty close explanation Infra feels and plays.\nYou play as a guy who j\u0435rks every switch/valve/button and makes pics of everything due to his job. Or he's just wanna-be detective. That's the premise of story, and it'd slowly unfold from there with use of a bit of environmental storytelling and your good old collecting notes. There is a lot of lore underneath, multilayered detective story about corruption and conspiracy mixed with mistery and some scary things as an icing on the cake. IF you dig deep enough (and probably there is some metagame too).\n\nIt's NOT a puzzle game mainly. Don't expect it being packed with intriguing puzzles. All puzzles it has can be divided in two groups - 'figure this machine' and 'common logic'. Both are pretty scarce. Machine puzzles operate on the same simplified real world logic as other puzzles. They are barely 'gamey' and barely enjoyable with some exceptions where it's either 'gamey' or enjoyable. Valves and boxes. Don't buy for puzzles, you've been warned.\n\nInfra looks good enough with it's incredible attention to detail. Though it's not that techy, since it's just good old source engine. And performance is top notch being built on ancient engine.\nSounds are competent and they really build up environment and add feeling of space (use headphones pls), music is nothing to write home about, but it suits the game well.\n\nThe only flaw (and it is a major one) is 'action' sections. Be it a rafting through tunnels or just 'escape before stuff blows up'. They not only don't fit the game since it's pretty slow paced explorative expreince, they are badly designed and they give away that it's not A-class title (also they look pretty bad too, in comparison to overall attention to detail in Infra). You often need to simply memorize where to go after numerous attempts. Well, not all such sections are bad (basically first one with flood gates, rafting one and walter's underground with explosions are crimes against humanity), some are great (runoff puzzle) and some are tolerable (sewers cave-in). You'll need a bit of patience for those.\n\nAll in all for it's low price you get a 40-50 hours of exploration (as of today only 2/3 of the game is available - around 20-30 hours).\nIf exploration is your thing - buy it right now.

I was delighted! It's surprisingly engaging, as a game, to seek out and take pictures of corruption, damaged INFRAstructure (hurr) and explore the delightful environment on offer. Of course, the delightful part doesn't apply once you get to the nitty gritty of dingy tunnels and life-threatening situations (Of which there are many, and I feel sorry for Mark at this point. Guy needs a pay raise.)\n\nWhat I like about the game:\nThe story. It's surprisingly engaging as you explore, uncover more and more corruption (and it gets worse than a few smudged reports, sure enough) and generally uncover more and more deathtraps in every single corner of the city. The puzzles range in difficulty from common sense to the downright nasty (I had to use guesswork a lot.)\n\nIn spite of a serious story and scenario of a city crumbling at the foundations, there's also an underlying sense of humour in the scenery itself. Little eastereggs break up the monotony of dreary tunnel after tunnel somewhat well. And on that point, though the game (No doubt at least partially by necessity) involves a lot of tunnels, it still manages to keep them varied. You know you're in a different section from part to part, for example.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty good. Hit the nail on the head in some of the more dramatic points, though there's plenty of more normal trudging about too.\n\nWhat's not so hot about the game?\n\nVoice acting - Not brilliant, but I found it relatable once I got used to it. The lack of a HUD means that it is kind of essential to have some ques as to how many of those camera batteries you have left, for example. \n\nSome of the puzzles aren't terribly intuative - Frustrating at times, especially given the placement of some of the save points (Though you can mitigate it with the manual save, perhaps, so milage may vary)\n\nLone wanderer - Other than the sparse contact with Mark's boss, your only company is Mark. (Er... yourself? I guess?) There's very little sign of other people in part one once you get past the tutorial level. It's an eerie touch in some places, but in others, it just feels out of place.\n\nWhat I think as a result of all this?\n\nInfra Part 1 was a solid game in and of itself, a nice length, and even an ending (in the sense of Halo 2 having an ending, anyway?) Well made (aside from the odd glitchy handling of a ladder) and challenging level designs that also provide a way to relax into the setting. Just as things get monotonous, however, the environments change, and as the game picks up pace, it can get stunningly exciting for a game about taking pictures and peering at things in wellies. There's a touch of a dry sense of humour added to it for flavour, too, of course.\n\nPart one and part two differ significantly, however, in the number of missions. That said... The entirety of part one feels like a warm up for Part 2, in comparison. The levels get complicated, maze-like and interconnected, with new and ever more frequent dangers to deal with in the underground network of tunnels, all while uncovering corruption far beyond what you might have suspected in part one.\n\nI would happily buy the game in it's current state, all consideration aside, if it ended. However, as it's being split into three parts, it inevitably ends on a cliffhanger (again) - Which, considering the third part will be added for free much as the second one was, isn't really so terrible. Though it makes me hunger to finish the job, as it were.\n\nI rambled and waffled on and on, so basically...

INFRA is as fun as it sounds, even if some features aren't fully implemented. \n\nThe general concept is that you play a \"structural analyst\", reviewing municipal works for disrepair and safety violations. You have to manage the battery level of both your camera, which is your way of documenting violations, and your flashlight. Being able to explore sewers, tunnels, office buildings, and factories and finding every little cracked wall or broken catwalk is engaging, and I never felt tired by that. After all, you can go through the game just by walking; the documentation gameplay is entirely optional. This could be good or bad, depending on the player. I appreciated that the game stepped out of my way, and I never had a heads-up display or a minimap pointing me to every OSHA violation. At the same time, some small way to monitor how many of these issues you've found would be nice.\n\nThe other aspect of the gameplay reminds me of Disaster Report or similiar games. Basically, as luck would have it these structures you explore are in such bad disrepair that they start to fall down around your head. You have to battle the environment as you try to escape before total collapse. Usually, this works well, and it's cool to see these big set pieces slowly falling to pieces. It also makes sense within the context of the story... they really should have sent someone out here a while ago. Speaking of story, there is an overarching narrative to tie everything together, and it's one of the weaker parts of the game. It's been done time and time again, and you already know it: greedy land developer puts profit in front of human lives, there's a web of corruption and coverups, blah blah blah. Thankfully, your access to the story is limited to text pick-ups and audio logs, so the game doesn't force you to buy in if you just want to play.\n\nEverything here just works. The environments are varied, detailed, and look really good. Sound design is sparse (thank you), so when the music ramps up during a collapse, you can feel the tension. The voice acting is serviceable, which isn't really a problem when your protagonist is a working engineer. I loved the game; I kept thinking it would end early as indie games sometime do, but at around 6 hours it's the perfect length to show you all it wants to show you and get out. I easily recommend it at both the $7 sale price and the full $15.", "timestamp_created": 1474556824, "timestamp_updated": 1474556824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25552222": {"recommendationid": "25552222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076434010", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520792557}, "language": "english", "review": "Intriguing.", "timestamp_created": 1474133650, "timestamp_updated": 1474133650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406591", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25476680": {"recommendationid": "25476680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100120829", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503691994}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks like the guy from postal 2 found a new job.\n\n10/10 would take pictures of broken things again", "timestamp_created": 1473673905, "timestamp_updated": 1473673905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427790", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25320579": {"recommendationid": "25320579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060546540", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483969848}, "language": "english", "review": "Played both parts (Part 1 and 2) and absolutely loved it!

is of INFRA Part 1.  The developers have indicated their intent to produce Parts 2 and 3 and release them as a free upgrade for owners of Part 1.  Even so, if they'd restructured the ending of Part 1 to be more definitive and called the game finished, I honestly wouldn't see much reason to complain about the length (though it is possible to blast through Part 1 quickly if you want to skip all the extra puzzles and content).\n\nAlternate title: \"Loading Screens: The Game\".   \nPerhaps it's because I had all my settings cranked up as high as they'd go, but my first time through INFRA (Part 1), I had loading screens that would take a full 30 minutes to complete.  That's not an exaggeration - I was watching the clock.  It may have been generating a Shader Cache or something because loading times on subsequent playthroughs could be lengthy, but never quite that long again.\n\nAlternate title: \"Bridge Inspector: The Game\"\nOne of INFRA's greatest strengths is its unique subject matter.  I can't think of another game offhand that's focused on Civil Engineering slash Municipal Infrastructure Inspection.  Sound boring?  Sometimes, yes.  INFRA is largely a walking simulator, and much of the content can be safely ignored, but the realistic setting provides for an Urban Exploration vibe where seeing the \"underside\" of everyday locations is the reward.  There are puzzles scattered about, though nothing too mind-bending.  Most major obstacles will have a couple of paths around them, so a single puzzle isn't likely to stymie your progress, though obesssive explorers will want to backtrack and see what they missed.  There are a few moments of panic where quick action is necessary to avoid an untimely demise, but nothing too taxing.  There is a single jump scare, but it's located off the main path and you have to work really hard to even find it, and once you're headed toward it you'll probably be expecting it anyway.\n\nAlternate title: \"Markku Siltanen and the Most Power-Hungry Camera in the World\"\nA central gameplay element is your charge as structural analyst Markku to document structural defects in the infrastructure of the fictional Eastern European city of Stalberg by photographing them with your camera.  The camera has a voracious appetite for batteries, which can be found scattered along your path through the game world.  You can carry up to 10 packs of spares, which would be enough for a year-long tour of Europe in reality, but here you'll be changing batteries every handful of photos.  I tended to be judicious about only pulling the camera out when I was pretty sure there was a subject to be photographed, and I explored every nook and cranny, so I never actually ran out of batteries completely.\nThere's also a flashlight which requires different batteries, but the same experience applies.\n\nAlternate title: \"Alt-Tab and the Infinite Sadness\"\nAgain, this may just be my particular setup, but INFRA would not recover if I Alt-Tabbed out to the desktop or another application, or clicked on something on my 2nd monitor.  This wouldn't be as much of an issue except that I had a couple of reasons to want to do so:\nFirst, did I mention the 30-minute load times?  I would liked to have done something else while the little white bar crept through the darkness.  I had to get out my PHONE of all things (hashtag first world problems).\nSecond, I'm an achievement junkie, and four of the achievements are particularly brutal because of a specific requirement.  They're awarded for finding 90% of the collectibles in the game IN A SINGLE PLAYTHROUGH.  Since running around with your camera out searching for hotspots burns through batteries, it's nice to finish the game and then go back for a second round with a walkthrough open to make sure you're not missing anything.  But don't try to Alt-Tab to your browser (or scroll in the browser on your second monitor) because INFRA won't recover.  (And then you have to force it closed and endure the loading screen again to get back to where you were.)\n\nAlternate title: \"English As A Second Language: The Game\"\nThe voice acting is...hard to pin down.  I can't tell if it's bad, or if it's genuinely trying to be an Eastern European speaking English as a second language.

It's a charming journey through abandoned buildings with some mild puzzling and platforming with plenty of easter eggs and terrible voice acting.\n\nGAMEPLAY: WASD controls with sprint and crouch, plus a flashlight for dark areas. You will walk, sprint, and jump through debris, avoiding various obstacles that a building in disrepair will throw at you. There's some mild physics puzzling here in the form of picking up objects and being able to carry/throw them around. This is used pretty sparsely, only being necessary for a few puzzles, and thus comes off as a bit of an afterthought or because it's a trend. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, but aren't pushovers either - they're a nice mix of nudging the player in the right direction and having them pay attention to the environment. \nThe most unique feature of this game is the photography mechanic. The player, due to the protagonist's background (more later) must take pictures of structural deficiencies in the areas explored. I haven't seen a mechanic like this before, and I quite enjoyed it - it provides an objective without combat, and encourages the player to explore the environment with great attention to detail. The only issue is it seems somewhat arbitrarily selective with what can be photographed. I won't say here what to look out for - part of the fun is figuring it out for yourself - but there were many times where something looked very much broken to me, yet didn't register with the game. Regardless, it's fun, and isn't necessary for completing the game - it almost serves as a bit of role play, and a collection challenge.\nAnother great feature of the game are the collectibles. They encourage exploration off the beaten path, and I had a feeling of accomplishment at having found them. Moreover, they're related to the overall narrative, which gives the player a better understanding of the events in the game. One particular easter egg, relating to a hidden stash of beer, had me grinning from ear to ear. You can tell the developers had a lot of fun thinking up and implementing these secrets, which I appreciate immensely.\nThere are also plenty of optional notes and audio recordings that can be discovered which flesh out the backstory.\n\nVISUALS: This is the highlight of the game for me, as it looks beautiful. Though you're primarily wandering abandoned areas, there are lots of objects strewn about, readable signs, etc. Some of the foliage looks a little bit on the 2D side of things and some of the character models a bit robotic, but it's not immersion breaking for the most part and doesn't really stick out. Some of the best parts of this game for me are taking in the spectacle of exiting a building and stepping into a huge open space overgrown with vegetation, having been reclaimed by nature.\n\nAUDIO: This game is mostly on the quiet side of things, given that it's about one man traversing abandoned buildings. What audio there is fits well - chirping birds, gusts of wind, maybe a distant car in some areas. But the voice acting - good lord, the voice acting. Some of the secondary characters are acted decently enough, but the protagonist sounds like Tommy Wiseau in a PS1 Resident Evil game. It can be somewhat jarring, as it's laughably bad at times and you may find yourself wondering what on Earth his accent is supposed to be. In addition, he insists on narrating little things, like announcing \"I have [X number] packs of batteries for the flashlight!\" when you pick some up. However, the game has a slightly humourous tone, so it almost works in a Deadly Premonition kind of way. In any case, it doesn't wreck the experience, but it certainly takes away from any seriousness the game wants to have. During the sections where the protagonist interacts with other characters, there's some light banter that can be fun to listen to and helps flesh out the experience.\n\nSTORY: You play as an engineer for a consulting firm, sent to evaluate the structural integrity of a building complex (hence the photography mechanic mentioned earlier). While exploring the complex, you can discover - completely optionally, from what I recall - the reasons why the facility shut down and about the people who used to run the facility. The story isn't groundbreaking, but I wasn't expecting this level of depth to the narrative, so it was a nice surprise to uncover it (especially in the form of easter eggs). It invites the player to piece together various clues that's up the them to find, so it doesn't hold your hand, and is satisfying to make the various connections.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game for players looking for a slower, more relaxed experience. The pleasure of this game comes not so much from challenge, nor a heartwrenching story, but from quietly traversing long-forgotten places on your own and uncovering their secrets.

The central story encourages exploring never nook and the game does not disappoint, at least at first.  If you go into the game assuming a certain level of exploration with fix it logic then you will enjoy much of this game, but will likely find your enjoyment level to drop significantly around the end of chapter 3/beginning of chapter 4 and I'll explain why.  There are two primary problems with the game's current set up.  The first is the scope of what is going on, which balloons in a hurry and in a way that loses credibility due to where its happening, which is a shame.  If handled on a much slower build and if the game had kept its locations remote it would have worked brilliantly.  I will avoid any spoilers in this this explanation but just know that the locations in this game start off remote, possibility believable that they have been abandoned for decades, and then moves on to locations that smack in the middle of cities in a way that they can't have been ignored that long.  The size of the levels also grows significantly, which makes there placement less credible.  If they had remained remote it would have worked much better.  \nThe second and id would argue bigger problem is that the physics engine, or physics interactions suck.  This will not be a problem until the point I mentioned above, where you will start to encounter area after area of instant death traps which require precise object placement.  There is no rotate option, the items bounce around and one mistake and your back to your last save.  These sections, unlike the exploration and fixit puzzles that i enjoyed so much, rapidly drained my enjoyment of the game, as they involved huge set pieces of \"how do i get out of here\".  The lack of inventory interface is irksome, but i can understand the thematic reason for it.  As the character mentioned how many packs of batteries he has one picking a new set up.  A command to have character due a verbal check would have been useful.\nTo the developer, I see a lot of good things in this game and I hope the second part is ever better.  If you don\u2019t; want to add in human models keep the locations remote.  But please rework the controls and get rid of the water hazards.  Your strength is in useful interactive exploration, not physics obstacles.\nTo the rest of you, despite its flaws, I would give it try, just be aware the flaws are there\n", "timestamp_created": 1468731304, "timestamp_updated": 1468731304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24359758": {"recommendationid": "24359758", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970852139", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507348022}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a hard game to recommend, even though there were a LOT of good things about it.  I think this is a unique setting for a game and everything in the game looks great.  I loved poking around in these old crumbling and rusting contrete buildings/structures.  There is a compelling framework for a great game...  I just think they fell a little short.\n\nFor example, the puzzles aren't particularly challenging.  The mechanics are good and it could be fun if they were a bit more difficult and even rewarding.  I found myself wanting to get the equipment working again (which would've been rewarding), but really you had to get it working enough to get through the level, and then everything crubles behind you most of the time.  You actually do a lot of damage for someone who's supposed to be inspecting things.\n\nThere are also some inconsistencies to the world.  Slight spoiler/valuble tip:  [spoiler]Early in the game, touching most water is an insta-kill (GTA3 like, even).  But then later in the game, you have to jump off a ledge into murky water and, suprise, you can walk around no problem.  I had to watch a youtube video for that.[/spoiler]\n\nThat could be better, or there could be a compelling story that keeps you moving forward.  There's a attempt at a plot, but the scraps are so far and few between that you don't remember any the names or what's going on.  There are newspaper articles that have a lot of background info, and they have general world building, but I couldn't put the pieces together.  Maybe the designer looked at this stuff as a whole, but when it was spread over 10ish hours of gameplay all the intricacies and the interconnected bits were lost.\n\nSo again, this is sort of a regrettable not recommended.  I wanted to like it, but in the end I was just watching youtube videos almost right away because I wanted to finish it.  I think the designers (or you) should take a look at SOMA.  I wasn't a fan of the horror element, but it also had a beautiful world, lots of walking, and similar mechanics.

It's most definitely a narrative exploration game, often known by the semi-derogatory term \"walking simulator.\" I'm not a fan of this genre. I thought Dear Esther and Gone Home were pretentious, overpriced dreck. Yet, there's something compelling and fascinating about this game because it deals with what seems like an utterly boring and bland subject in a fascinating way.\n\nINFRA tells the story about an engineer who is sent to a dilapidated, rural power generation site to assess and document the damage. This place is not only a wreck but along the way, you'll discover a twisted story happening behind the scenes. There's no combat and so overt scares, though you may get started a couple of times. The core of the game involves exploring the surprisingly large environment, solving clever but often infuriating environmental puzzles to progress and taking pictures along the way. The pictures are optional but help flesh out the story more and are also tied to achievements.\n\nThere's a minimal amount of voice acting, though what you do hear is pretty cringey. It's a minor part of the experience though and doesn't detract much. What surprised me is the amount of content here for the money. INFRA's environment is massive and even though it runs on the Source Engine (it was originally a mod), it looks absolutely gorgeous and provides a really immersive environment. While researching my video, I regularly just stopped and took in the environment, something I rarely do in any game. Though you're in a wrecked environment and it is stressful, it's also frequently relaxing and zen. Most people are taking between 16 and 18 hours to finish INFRA and this is just the first half of the game. It was split up into two parts but the second part will be free and the developers are saying it'll be a similar length. Given that Gone Home was 90 minutes for $20, $15 for what could be over 30 hours is a frankly staggering value proposition.\n\nIf you're really opposed to any game in this genre, INFRA won't change your mind. However, this team took something as seemingly boring and uninteresting as photographing a run down power dam and made it a compelling, beautiful experience with a great mystery behind it. If you're unsure if INFRA is for you and my video doesn't help sway you, give it a try. It may surprise you.

This is probably one of the strangest, most unlikely ideas for a game I have ever seen actually work. If you're a fan of anything remotely like Gone Home, Firewatch, Dear Esther, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, etc, etc you'll love this. I think it's a good deal better than all of those, except for Firewatch, which I think is the high-water mark for 'walking sims'.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n\n- The world is beautiful. I absolutely love the way everything looks in this game. And the detail is great. It really looks like every, single thing was paid attention to in making this game. Old, neglected rooms feel grimy and worn. Everything is dusty looking and gritty. They actually look like real rooms that haven't been touched in years. And then the newer buildings are bright and clean. Everything shiny. You don't just walk through a world where you feel like the developer just recycled the same things over and over, even when you are in a place where it's essentially the same things over and over; it doesn't feel that way.\n- The developer's seeming knowledge is impressive. It doesn't feel like a subject he just guessed at. It feels very convincing.\n- For the most part the puzzles feel logical and real. They're not 'video game puzzles'. A lot of puzzle games, particularly older point-and-click type games suffered from puzzles where you were just trying through trial and error to figure out what the developer wanted you to do and not really applying real-life thought to anything. I haven't had to check a walkthrough yet, even though some of the puzzles can get a little confusing, but I always felt like I could figure them out using the same thought processes I would use in real life.\n- The sound is amazing in the game. Very immersive.\n- The game runs fantastically. I haven't had any crashes or glitches or framerate issues or anything. It runs better than a lot of AAA titles while looking just as good as many of them.\n- The story sounds completely bonkers, but it unfurls in a way that hooks you. I read the description for this and I thought, 'This is not a game. This is walking sims and novelty job sims gone mad,' but decided to chance it based on the other reviews. I'm amazed at how addictive and compelling it is. I would urge anyone who hears, 'You play as a safety inspector,' and thinks that it sounds horrible to give it a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised, I think.\n- I LOVE the camera. The fact that it's a real camera that you bring out and use the way you would an actual camera is brilliant. I wanted to snap photos of everything.\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\n- The voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag. When there are two or more people talking to each other it comes across as robots talking. Dialogue is stilted and awkward, they're speaking over one another, the repsonses seem out-of-place and devoid of any emotion. Even when people are hearing shocking news they'll say something in a totally flat, bored voice, 'Oh, really? Ok. See you later.'\nThe game actually opens with someone saying, 'Oh hi, Mark,' and I'm legitimately unsure if this is a purposely nod to the horrible acting in the film, The Room, or not.\n- The only way to access the options menu is from the opening menu before you enter the game. It caused a little minor irritation when I was trying to find how I wanted to play the game early on (hints on or off, subtitles on or off, crosshairs, etc) and I had to save and exit the game anytime I wanted to experiment with any of these.\n- Actually moving through the world can be a little tedious at times. Your character, Mark, is almost the exact same width as every door, so it's very easy to get stuck just trying to walk around and then you have to jig left and right to get through.\n- There's no inventory. You can pick up an assortment of labeled keys in the game and there were a few times I picked up some keys and then found a sign that would explain where keys could be found and I would wonder if they were the keys I'd already picked up, but there was no way to check their tags again. Same with batteries. Mark tells you how many packs he has when you pick up more, but if you forget there's no way to check.\n- I wish that when you picked up some items like wheels and spare parts that they went into your unseen inventory like keys and batteries do so that you wouldn't have to walk around with a giant object floating directly before your eyes.\n- No map. This just doesn't make real-world sense to me. You find maps scattered everywhere. Why does Mark not collect them to consult later? Or let us check photos that we've taken of these maps.

It starts out in an office block which I found very boring, the people are totally without facial features, the offices and corridors all look the same and again without any detail in them whatsoever. I had to ask myself what the hell had I just bought, I began looking for the refund button. The first 5-10 minutes are spent wondering around said office block collecting your equipment before setting off to the job.\nIt's when you arrive at the Hydro Dam that the game really begins and a wonderfully crafted setting can be enjoyed to the full. It took me 11 hours to complete but then I do love wondering around these realistic worlds and taking in the views, so it can be done much more quickly if thats what you prefer. \nAs you can probably tell I love good graphics in my games and this one is up there with the best. In places it reminds me of another beautiful looking game,The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter, although this game takes place underground a lot. I hope part two is as good as part one.

All of this combined kept me hooked for 12 hours, enjoying every second.\n\nThere are many things to be fixed, atmosphere to experience, and ways to get yourself killed! Thorough exploration will reward the player with additional backstory, and help them uncover bigger mysteries. \n\nMy biggest criticism of the game, is the lack of 'reward'. You get a camera in your hands, and is told to take pictures of damages and broken things. It honestly seems like there is no point to this, the achievements to be aquired for this are very very long term progresses. \nI wish there had been, even the tiniest of rewards for finding and photographing the most awkward of things. Perhaps have the protagonist drop a few comments? \nI can see that something like that would be very time consuming to implement, but would give the player more reason to search for every lose pipe screw. (I did so anyways)\n\nI will close out by saying that while i personally recommend the game, i would be careful with whom i recommend it to. If you are NOT into explorative, non-combat puzzle games, this is not for you.\n\nOn the other hand, i enjoyed every second of this game, and I am great anticipating Part II !", "timestamp_created": 1467139592, "timestamp_updated": 1467139592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533560", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23888665": {"recommendationid": "23888665", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976767769", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499307849}, "language": "english", "review": "The game starts off promising with interesting environmental puzzles and world-building, but gradually replaces its claustrophobic loneliness and reflections on the banality of corruption and decay with over-the-top action set pieces and overwrought conspiracies that ultimately detract from some of its best charms.\n\nTo be honest, the game is downright schizophrenic with its tone and focus. On the one hand, you'll find yourself faced with some intriguing problems, and if you take the time to walk through them you'll find yourself gradually pushing back the inevitable collapse of the city's forgotten infrastructure. But you don't have to. You could just progress onward, building bridges over the rubble of the past never once looking back.\n\nThis is a pretty great choice for this game, but it's implemented so poorly you wonder why it was an option at all. As mentioned before, the game loves throwing you into skin-of-your-teeth breakneck action sequences, which would be fine every once in a while but becomes the bread and butter of the last half of the game. As a result, puzzles you were in the middle of solving get swept away in a flood or a pile of rubble and you're simply pushed onward into the next segment leaving your latest project frustratingly half-finished. What's worse, there's never any subtle clue that what you're doing is about to gate you off from any previous content -- you simply walk into a room and suddenly everything hits the fan.\n\nOne could almost forgive it if the game was instanced or modular in such a way that you simply can't retrace your steps due to the code. But several times you have complete and unfettered access to massive stretches of territory you casually walked out of, including an entire chapter. Speaking of which, the last half of this game abandons its close-knit and focused puzzle environments for a sprawling, endless city barred off increasingly by artificial gates and doors that you will never be able to open, giving it an awkward sense of padded uselessness.\n\nIt's a pretty good game but abandons its own promise to stretch out its length at the end.", "timestamp_created": 1467108450, "timestamp_updated": 1467108450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23846312": {"recommendationid": "23846312", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995489881", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506826685}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish INFRA stayed closer to the \"First Person Inspector\" game it looked like it was going to be (and started off as).

Unfortunately my time was spent looking through a guide with vague directions when the game was even more so with what I was supposed to do.  I'll give you a scenario right now:\n\nI after going through a frustrating 'puzzle' of moving boxes to jump across shallow electified water (That may I add any inspector with properly equiped rubber boots would be able to walk through easily) where sometimes I'd fall in a crack between the boxes that is close to impossible to be the size of the actual character, was lead into a control room with many interactble buttons that I messed with, to later find out where there FOR NO REASON BUT TO CAUSE CONFUSION, and after passing by all of those I go into a saw mill with in the darkness some sort of pulley system, I let it loose and make a hole in the floor to go down it look around and find that oddly in the basement are MORE POWER GENERATORS that I have to turn on but when I do it takes a few seconds then kills me in what looks like ankle deep water.  Again, the rubber boots thing saves lives.  Anyways I go back down there flip the lever run up hop over a wall instead of just have it locked like another door I had to get the keys for earlier, go into some cabin that's been abandoned for years in the most unlikely way possible (climb a ladder up the roof and fall down on some sort of wood shutter that's held by some string strong enough to hold our weight to climb into the attic) get some guys keys into a mineshaft that for some reason is related to the power system we're inspecting.\n\nThat was only a PART of my time with Chapter 2.  3 from what I played involved a switch puzzle that only existed because the lines weren't managed professionally, and something that was literally filp all the switches on, turn it on, then hit reset and you know all this by reading a note placed right next to it all.  It was then I realised that this game is a puzzle game based on cheap tricks that are 'puzzles' only because it takes a minute at most for you to turn something on and it was also based on hiding what you're actually supposed to do, I thought I was only investigating the actual power plant, why am I in a cave now.  I only got more confused by this game as it went on.\n\nAlright now time for the graphics, while they're actually good for an indie game and the price I cant say I enjoyed a lot of the enviorment design, in chapter one the graphics were the poorest some models looked phoned in and textures were sometimes large part solid color, that was the worse of it, chapter 2 the starting area sums it up pretty well.  A lot of green outside, green, green, green making it harder to believe.  And the interior is grey dirty and overall just ugly.  I'm just going to say this ugly is ugly even when intentionally made ugly.  From what I saw of chapter 3 the game was only moving more toward that.\n\nThe soundtrack was never played, its odd I remember it badly but going back and listening to it it sounds fine, maybe even good.  I hope for their \"Episode 2\" they utilize it more because while the tracks are short they're enjoyable and might be good for ambience.\n\nI am actually sad I couldn't enjoy the story it seemed like it had something written but we already know what's going to happen from our surroundings in the very start of the game we're told we were handed this place off FOR A CORRUPTION SCANDAL.  I don't know about you but when I already know essentially the end from the start the stories lose something to me, it's the same with movies recently, with their trailers showing the ending bits since those are the best.  I was hoping to hear more of the characters dialog from when the company went bankrupt, but unfortunatly I stopped myself over gameplay not story.  Also on that front voice acting is horrible not for the recording enviorments changing or anything like that but the direction, at some times the voice sounds like a COMPLETELY OTHER PERSON, some lines change from one to the next with voice and THATS why I think it's bad.\n\nSince part two is coming out I hope that these complaints are fixed by then, maybe with a update to the previous maps/levels to clarify things like objective, maybe a in game hint system, or maybe just a log/diary of some sort that records more precise thoughts of the protaganist that will give you a strong idea of where to go / what to do, maybe with a pre done or a hand drawn map to give a sense of where you've been / where to go, as that's the main thing that made my time with this game poor.  Also lower gravity or raise jump power a bit and enable always run or something to make our movement go faster as the walking simulator complaints are something I felt while playing.", "timestamp_created": 1466875346, "timestamp_updated": 1466875346, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453180", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23708804": {"recommendationid": "23708804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015533327", "num_games_owned": 1782, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466832261}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0414\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442. \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a, \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 (\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d, \u0447\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0447\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e). \u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c-\u0442\u043e, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442, \u0433\u0434\u0435, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b, \u043c\u044b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 (\u043c\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435). \u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043a.\n\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0436\u0430\u043b\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0441 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430.\n\u0414\u043b\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u2013 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u043e (\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0447\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0443\u0434\u0430-\u0441\u044e\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043a\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e).", "timestamp_created": 1466612551, "timestamp_updated": 1466612551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23652459": {"recommendationid": "23652459", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962973671", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 1993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514637688}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Yleens\u00e4 en pid\u00e4 palapelipeleist\u00e4, mutta t\u00e4n kohdalla tein poikkeuksen.

It looks great considering the aging engine. (It would be amazing on modern engines) It's very atmospheric and I just love crawling in every place looking for easter eggs and more things to photograph. (and if you're careful you can find plenty of batteries. I had 10/10 for both almost all the time in last episodes) \n\nSome people complaing about the protagonist's voice acting but I find it very fitting for what I imagine the guy is like :) The game has a lot of easter eggs, hidden things, things that only Finnish people understand (+/-) and on top of that extreme attention to small details. I found a phone number in random poster after the cave early in the game and much later I could call the number for some additional fun. Plenty of things like that. \n\nThe basic gameplay consists of walking around looking for structural damage / other things that need maintenance or documents exposing corruption and then snapping a photo of them. May not sound very exciting but the beautifully aged environments make if very enjoyable. For me at least. The game really rewards exploration. \n\nThere are also a number of puzzles which vary from simple to slightly more complex ones but  you don't have to solve them all (Unless you're looking for 100% completion) Good thing about the puzzles is that usually they are rather logical. There are few places where you have to do some precision jumping but if you've played any fps games it's nothing too difficult. \n\nThere is also bigger plot behind the whole thing which slowly unravels as you find new clues and stuff. I have to pay more attention to it on the next playthrough but it seemed interesting enough. Anyway I'm really looking forward to part 2 and want to congratulate the devs for great work so far. \n\nAs a sidenote I bought the game for my 70 year old father who enjoys playing Myst type games and he at least seems to have enjoyed the experience even if some areas that require nimble fingers were causing additional grey hairs for him :) \n\nAs a final warning I'd like to point out that if you're looking for continuous action and get bored of exploring places just for the sake of exploring you may not enjoy the game as much as I did.", "timestamp_created": 1465325520, "timestamp_updated": 1465325715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664579", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23392353": {"recommendationid": "23392353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186469305", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501029543}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u300aINFRA\u300b\u6545\u4e8b\u80cc\u666f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u53eb\u201cStalburg\u201d\u7684\u8150\u8d25\u57ce\u5e02\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5c06\u5316\u8eab\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u6bcf\u5929\u90fd\u5728\u5de5\u5382\u68c0\u67e5\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u5fc5\u987b\u8fd0\u7528\u667a\u6167\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u548c\u771f\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u73a9\u5bb6\u5c06\u8eab\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u4e0b\u94c1\u8def\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u673a\u62cd\u7167\u627e\u5bfb\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u6536\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u3002\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u673a\u5173\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u9700\u8981\u601d\u8003\u3001\u89e3\u8c1c\uff0c\u624d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u524d\u8fdb\u3002\n  \u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u6ca1\u6709\u67aa\u6218\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u63a2\u7d22\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6362\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\u5c31\u662f\u6728\u6709\u5927\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u67aa\u6218\u7684\u573a\u9762\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bcf\u5929\u90fd\u5728\u5de5\u5382\u68c0\u67e5\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u73a9\u5bb6\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u6167\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6765\u5bfb\u627e\u751f\u5b58\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u5b58\u800c\u6218\uff01\n  \u753b\u8d28\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ec6\u8282\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u73a9\uff01\n  \u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u8bfb\u56fe\u6709\u4e9b\u6162\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1465096542, "timestamp_updated": 1465367861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691040", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23387758": {"recommendationid": "23387758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004479916", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507586445}, "language": "german", "review": "Dann fangen wir mal an.

Die Puzzle sind schlau und passend in das Level eingebaut und es gibt oft mehr als nur einen Weg durch besagtes Level.\n\nPros:\n-Eine Welt, die man fast schon als 'Grimdark' bezeichnen k\u00f6nnte\n-Durchdachtes Leveldesign\n-Fesselnde Atmosph\u00e4re\n-Optionale, aber sehr interessante Story\n\nCons:\n-Voice Acting\n-Steuerung k\u00f6nnte besser sein\n\nWas dem Spiel fehlt ist Eindeutig die M\u00f6glichkeit seine geschossenen Bilder anzusehen, zu Ordnen und zum Puzzle l\u00f6sen benutzen. (Oder einfach nur die Landschaft Fotografieren und sein Werk betrachten). Au\u00dferdem sind die Animationen und Synchronstimmen und das fehlen eines Spielermodels recht 'Immersion-breaking'.\n\nWer also auf der suche nach einem Spiel ist, in das er voll eintauchen kann, wer gerne Geheimnisse aufdeckt oder einfach gerne Erkundet ist mit Infra an genau der richtigen Stelle...

Scavenger hunts and repeat deaths are not fun.\n\nYou play as an infrastructural analyst, tasked to investigate reports of damage at various facilities. The game has you enter these facilities, explore them and then try to figure your way forward to the next area. Exploration has you documenting various types of damage, finding documents exposing multi-layer corruption, and finding secrets and easter eggs.\n\nAdvancing usually means a scavenger hunt to find a small card, key or a specific object hidden in some obscure place, or figuring out how to operate machinery by reading manuals and then running back and forth between buttons, levers, valves and computer screens. Sometimes parts of the machinery have been inexplicably removed and hidden, so that also means more scavenger hunts. There will be many dead ends with no importance, and some sections will be timed death traps that require foreknowledge of the area.\n\nDialogue isn't that great to begin with, but the voice acting is simply all-around terrible. Graphics feel somewhat outdated (partly due to Source engine), and the quality of  level design stretches from the fantastically lively places to the tediously barren levels. And at some point finding beer [i]everywhere[/i] starts to get annoying.\n\nI had high hopes for the game when it appeared on Greenlight, but I can't recommend this.", "timestamp_created": 1464478719, "timestamp_updated": 1519943419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23248601": {"recommendationid": "23248601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058006304", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508143809}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0440\u0430. \u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0441 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432 - \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a, \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 90%, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0441\u0443\u0431\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0445. \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e 1- 1.5 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043c \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439, \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0442-\u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0438. \u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b - \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433, \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435-\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438. \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \"\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0439...\". \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 1 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1464424827, "timestamp_updated": 1464424827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23246088": {"recommendationid": "23246088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032510500", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509725823}, "language": "english", "review": "Think of this game as Dear Eshter combined with a puzzle game.\n\nStunning atmosphere, unique puzzles and a gripping story.\nSo if you like puzzle games, you should definitly buy this.

No guns \u2013 the only things you'll be shooting are pictures; minimal inventory \u2013 just your camera, flashlight, batteries for both, and whatever random bit of the environment you're lugging around at the moment, whether that be a fuse that belongs in a fusebox somewhere, a crate you'll need to cross a pool of electrified water, or an empty beer bottle that's just lying around, waiting to be smashed.\n\n \nInfrastructure Isn\u2019t Sexy\n\nYou play an engineer who works for a fictional Baltic country's infrastructure inspection service (in case you're wondering, the developers are based in Finland). Your job is to go out to inspect dams, highways, bridges \u2013 all the little things that make life easier, but could cause disasters if they break. And boy, do they ever break.\n\nIn a nice nod to just how things work in the real world (channeling John Oliver here), the nation's infrastructure \u2013 and the agency itself \u2013 is pretty blatantly underfunded. Even your starting office area is badly in need of repair, and only sparsely staffed. The workers hanging around complain about unsafe \u2013 but heavily used \u2013 tunnels that they refuse to drive through because they know just how bad they are.\n\nThe plot of the game kicks off with a typical, monotone office meeting (which, mercifully, you can skip), explaining where to go (a local abandoned dam system) so that you can gather photographic evidence of the repairs that need to be done, as well as doing patch jobs on whatever you can. Using your camera (or flashlight) drains batteries like crazy, but you can find plenty of them as you go along. The only downside is that there is no real way to tell how many batteries of each type you have left, aside from your character's comments when picking up fresh packs or installing a new set. The digital camera \u2013 which helpfully adjusts its viewfinder whenever you point it at something you need to photograph, has a battery meter; the flashlight just grows dimmer and dimmer to the point of uselessness, as its way of saying \u201cFeed me!\u201d The whole short battery lifespan thing is par for the course for a video game \u2013 but, obviously, they only drain when they are active (this includes looking around with the camera out).\n\nYour secondary purpose, along the way, is to figure out why the place was abandoned in the first place \u2013 and you can even find some evidence pointing to this in your home office if you explore it thoroughly enough. It looks like a profound lack of funding might not be the only problem with this country.\n\n \nDam It\n\nINFRA uses standard WASD for movement controls, E to interact, R to reload batteries, F to toggle the flashlight; jump, crouch, pickup/drop/throw \u2013 you know the drill. All fairly standard FPS-type controls. Spinning the mouse wheel toggles the camera, and clicking it zooms in or out. For better or for worse, there\u2019s no HUD, and no inventory screen.\n\nIf you don't quite make a jump, you just get kicked back a few seconds of gameplay. They want you to play the game, not re-do ten minutes of running around every time you miss a jump by a few pixels. There are no enemies save for the environment itself \u2013 a few feet of water, most falls, etc. will one-shot kill you if you're not careful, along with the more obvious deathtraps such as the aforementioned electrified pools of water. For certain scripted, survivable falls, your character will have something to say about that, complete with some colorful language.\n\n \nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe game is simply gorgeous at maxed visuals, even on a mid-range graphics card (GeForce 660). Old crumbling bricks and concrete, rust-covered metal, faded glass, and flowing water all contribute nicely to the atmosphere of the game, while providing an effective contrast to the relative sterility of your equally-in-need-of-repair home office. The dam and its environs feel abandoned and empty, even if most of the vehicles you find look brand new, and have been polished to a mirror shine!\n\nThe ambient noises that comprise much of the soundtrack accompany the visuals well \u2013 birds chirping out in the wilderness, winds rushing down deserted corridors, water dripping off of rusty pipes, etc.\n[Eric Kei]\n\nSummary\nINFRA is a nice break from the run-of-the-mill first person games. They take a topic that most people find exceedingly dull, but with a touch of mystery, some entertaining gameplay mechanics, and excellent visuals, turn it into something worth sinking several hours into \u2013 and it's longer than you might think. A true exploration game.\n\nPreviously published on dlh.net -- Eric_Kei\n\nhttp://www.dlh.net/en/reviews/2128/infra--pc-.html", "timestamp_created": 1464049651, "timestamp_updated": 1506125288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639007", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23160617": {"recommendationid": "23160617", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997839450", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464030398}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome atmosphere and clever, realistic puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1464031635, "timestamp_updated": 1464031635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23159755": {"recommendationid": "23159755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103909152", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494013505}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich kann das Spiel empfehlen !\nGrafik ist angenehm und passend zum Spiel.\nAu\u00dferdem ist es durch die Musik recht Atmosph\u00e4risch.\nklare Kaufempfehlung !", "timestamp_created": 1464028215, "timestamp_updated": 1464028215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23150628": {"recommendationid": "23150628", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965605243", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508455896}, "language": "english", "review": "I..

Van deze gebouwen zijn geen of onvolledige onderhoudsrapporten gevonden en het vermoeden is dat het geld voor het onderhoud is weggesluisd en dat deze gebouwen (waaronder een waterkrachtcentrale) in een slechte bouwstaat verkeren. Jij gaat op pad met je digitale camera en zaklamp om foto's te maken van eventuele schade en de staat van deze gebouwen in kaart te brengen. Terwijl je hiermee bezig bent, ontdek je dat er bij de aankoop en latere verkoop van de bedrijven van wie de onderzochte gebouwen zijn schimmige spelletjes gespeeld zijn. Je ontdekt dit op de inmiddels gebruikelijke wijze: achtergelaten briefjes, aantekeningen, bandopnames en foto's. Veel van deze aanwijzingen zijn verstopt op moeilijk bereikbare plekken en je zult moeten klimmen, kruipen en allerhande puzzels moeten oplossen om het mysterie te ontrafelen en je weg te kunnen vervolgen. In tegenstelling tot veel andere spellen, hebben de ontwikkelaars hun best gedaan alles zo realistisch mogelijk te maken. De meeste puzzels bestaan uit het vinden van sleutels op moeilijk bereikbare plekken en in het aanpassen van de apparaten en systemen die je tegenkomt in de gebouwen. De puzzels voelen hierdoor niet kunstmatig aan, maar zijn op een logische manier in de omgeving verwerkt. Sommige achievements verdien je eenvoudig door de verschillende hoofdstukken uit te spelen, maar voor andere achievements zul je flink je best moeten doen. Ik voorzie dat ik het spel nog zeker een of twee keer zal moeten uitspelen om alles te vinden.\n\n[i]De zwakke punten van het spel[/i]\n- De stemmen zijn (grotendeels?) ingesproken door acteurs die Engels duidelijk niet als voertaal hebben. Het is niet tenenkrommend slecht, maar je hoort het wel meteen. Persoonlijk vind ik het niet zo erg, het verhaal is goed en de dialogen zijn geloofwaardig, maar sommige spelers zullen zich hieraan storen.\n- geen beschrijving van de besturing met een controller, sommige acties worden gedurende het spel netjes aangegeven op het scherm, maar een overzicht (en de optie om knoppen aan te passen) zouden welkom zijn geweest\n- digitale camera en zaklamp met beperkte gebruiksduur, batterijen zijn ruim genoeg voor handen, maar je moet ze na ongeveer 10 foto's of twee minuten gebruik van de zaklamp vervangen en dat is verre van realistisch, het voelt aan als een geforceerde poging om het spel spannender te maken (of om de claim dat je moet zien te overleven te rechtvaardigen)\n- de ontwikkelaars noemen het een 'survival' spel, maar dat is enigszins overdreven. Ja, je kunt doodgaan door verdrinking, electrocutie, verstikking of een te grote val, maar verwacht niet dat je hout moet verzamelen voor een kampvuur en dat je paddestoelen moet eten om je gezondheid te herstellen en dat je zelf wapens moet maken of iets dergelijks. \n- geen mogelijkheid om het spel via het menu op te slaan. Wel zijn er regelmatige checkpoints en je kunt F6 en F9 voor quick save en quick load gebruiken. Toch vind ik het een punt van aandacht, omdat het spel uit verschillende hoofdstukken bestaat en als je voorbij in een hoofdstuk voorbij een bepaald punt komt dan wordt het deel wat je hebt voltooid afgesloten en je kunt er niet meer naar terug. En gezien de vele verborgen sleutels, briefjes enz. is dat een minpunt. Je kunt dit oplossen middels de F6 en F9 toetsen, maar aangezien ik met een controller speel, is dat onhandig\n- je maakt foto's, maar je kunt ze niet terug zien, vooral jammer omdat ik soms zou willen dat ik foto's kon maken van de uitgebreide schema's die aan de muur hangen (t.b.v. een van de puzzels). In plaats daarvan houd ik weer ouderwets aantekeningen bij op een notitieblok.\n- af en toe kom ik kleine bugs en glitches tegen, maar tot nu toe niets waardoor ik niet verder kon of een eerder spel moest laden\n- ik heb een aantal puzzels niet kunnen oplossen, omdat ik aan een wiel had gedraaid of op een knop had gedrukt waardoor de puzzel in een niet-oplosbare toestand leek te zijn beland. Maar het kan ook zijn dat ik een deel van de puzzel heb gemist, er zit zoveel verborgen dat het me niets zou verbazen als ik stomweg op de verkeerde manier probeerde deze puzzels op te lossen. Het heeft me (tot nu toe) niet verhinderd om een hoofdstuk uit te spelen, maar ik heb hierdoor wel informatie gemist.\nBovenstaande punten zijn voor mij geen breekpunten (anders zou ik het spel niet aanbevelen), hooguit kleine irritaties. Tot nu toe vind ik het meest irritant dat ik soms gesloten deuren tegenkom waarvan onduidelijk is of je ze kunt openen. Van sommige deuren vond ik na verloop van tijd een sleutel of een mechaniek waarmee ik ze kon ontgrendelen, andere deuren heb ik (nog) niet kunnen openen, terwijl ik van sommige deuren bijna zeker weet dat ze open zouden moeten kunnen. \n\n[i]Wat ik erg goed vind aan het spel[/i]\n- interessant verhaal (gebaseerd op ware gebeurtenissen)\n- puzzels zijn lastig, maar niet onmogelijk, het vraagt vooral om goede observatie, goed nadenken en enig experimenteren. Elke keer dat ik dacht dat ik ergens niet verder kon, vond ik een tijdje later zelf de goede oplossing en dat geeft een gevoel van competentie\n- mooie omgevingen, niet zo gedetailleerd als bijv. Ethan Carter, maar het komt een eind in de buurt. Alles ziet er ook uit alsof het echt zou kunnen bestaan. In alle gebouwen zijn toiletgroepen en kantines en dergelijke te vinden. Bureaus van verschillende medewerkers hebben ieder een eigen, unieke inrichting. Terwijl je in veel spellen ziet dat bureaus gewoon worden geknipt en geplakt. Ook vind je verschillende gebouwen bewijs dat er (tieners of krakers) zitten of hebben gezeten. Wat wel opvalt is dat veel voorwerpen zijn hergebruikt (zelfde stoelen, knoppenpanelen, bomen, bloemen, rotsen enz.) en bij sommige voorwerpen zijn relatief lage resolutie afbeeldingen gebruikt, terwijl andere voorwerpen scherpe en bijna fotorealistische afbeeldingen gebruiken. Door de aandacht waarmee de natuur, de gebouwen en elke afzonderlijke ruimte zijn ingericht, wordt dit niet storend. Maar het valt op een gegeven moment op dat je regelmatig dezelfde poster, koffiebeker, graffiti enz. tegen komt. \n- puzzels passen bij het gebouw waar je ze tegen komt. Puzzels worden ook goed afgewisseld, soms moet je een sleutel vinden op een onverwachte plek, soms moet je met kratten sjouwen en andere keren moet je een grote machine aan de praat zien te krijgen of de code van een cijferslot zien te vinden.\nVoor het eerste spel van een kleine groep ontwikkelaars is het een hele prestatie en tot nu toe is de ervaring de moeite waard geweest (ik zit ongeveer op de helft).

I thought the puzzles were extremely well done personally, they dont have a sort of mad science feel that some other games like this have, its mostly about you controlling stuff to progress on and complete your job (which is to monitor how bad the spot is wrecked so you can begin fixing it).\n\nI've noticed it had the tag of horror but I wouldn't really agree with that, I didnt come across anything that made me feel uneasy at all, it was just quite atmospheric throughout. By the way you dont get attacked by anything like in a survival horror game. I felt that was something I should mention because I was concerned about that throughout. \n\nThe story is pretty decent to, the game tells the tale of an economic collapse of an entire region, and you get to experience how it progressed to where it was by looking through notes and areas that you experience when going through the game. I began by not really careing all too much and didnt pay that much attention to the newspaper articles littered through the world, but then towards the end I started to read through them and found them to be quite interesting, so my recommendation was if you get it do that from the start :).\n\nThis game has a great atmosphere too, in particular theres a section where you go into an abandoned steel factory and lose connection with the outside world, and it feels really earie which I guess explains the horror tag. The sound was done really well in this area too, mostly silent with a low bassy hum of I guess the old poweplant? \n\nSpeaking about sound, I really liked the soundtrack for the game and I felt that it fit well with each section, so if you have a few extra pennies I'd say its worth buying it.\n\nMy time played shows roughly how long the game lasts, and I'd say its not bad for a small indie game, infact quite good. Theres also multiple collectables and stuff you can go back and do for the achievements giving you a reason to play it again, which you know, its always a positive. \n\nBad Bits:\n\nAlthough I really enjoyed my experience with INFRA theres a few points I think you should know: \n\n1. The voice acting at the start was pretty bad, the characters other than your own didnt feel genuine at all and the animations of the people were lacking quite a bit (but this goes away after about the first 15 mins or so, so dont worry about that too much). \n\n2. Its got quite a walking simulator feel to it, aside from the puzzles, and is more of a relaxing experience than an intense one. So thats something to watch out for if you don't really like those types of games.\n\nAnyway to sum this up, I also had a crack at making a video review which you may want to check out to see what the gameplay is like and get my full view on it before you buy it:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THlqNr-opzE", "timestamp_created": 1463433763, "timestamp_updated": 1463433787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22996148": {"recommendationid": "22996148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971006717", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506848551}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like exploration or puzzle games you have to buy this one.\nPros:\n-Excellent music (In my opinion)\n\n-It doesn't have the best graphics but they look awesome.\n\n-The athmosphere is great, it's complemented by the graphics and it's my favorite part of the game.\n\n-The puzzles are ok, they are not very hard, and not very easy. Some of them are a bit boring, you have to search for a key or a fuse, so it gets boring after you spend 10 minutes searching for it.\n\n-The story it's a good one. It's separated in three (3) chapters. It's pretty much straight forwards, BUT if you pay close attention you'll realize why everything is the way it is, and soon you'll see that there's a big conspiracy behind everything.\n\n-The maps are great, they match the athmosphere perfectly.\n\n-The developers are active with the game and help the community all the time in the forums. If someone is stuck they tell  that person clues to find the solution to a puzzle. If someone finds a bug. The developers fix it in the next update and the tell to that person a command to input and skip the section, so the player can continue playing. This should be and example of how to be a good developer team.\nCons:\n-Voice acting, This is between con and pro, because it's, well... It does it's job. It sounds a bit forced but I ended up liking it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-Having finished the game already, it definetly was worth my money, I really loved the part 3. But that's because I am studying to work in these kinds of places, so it hits my spot. I'd say the length is 12-14 hours. Maybe 9 if you speed run it. I love the details of the game and I finished it 4 times just to take a look at the details. \nYou'll realize the developers pay a lot of attention to details.\nWith a conspiracy that big, it's hard to fit the puzzle pieces without looking at the big picture.\n\nThis is definetly my kind of game.

About half of the building is unavailable to explore, but you can see through the many big windows that more than a lot of time and effort has gone into this building alone. The building is only a fraction of the game and it would already make up one of the best maps for an online FPS.\n\nAnyway, your job turns from bad to worse when you go to visit and report deteriorating infrastructure. I will avoid spoiling any more of the game so you can experience it for yourself. Just expect to spend a lot of time exploring places that the people at Loiste didn't need to add, but added anyway, which made the game just that little bit more detailed and affected the overall amenity of the game in the long run.\n\nThe game can be compared to a not-so-scary version of Outlast, in that you are navigating dark areas with a camera. Unfortunately your camera doesn't have a built-in flashlight, so you carry one seperate (which if the developers had thought through, you would be able to smack some stuff with.) The camera and flashlight both have batteries that drain unbelievably fast though, so you must find some new ones lying around in convenient places. Not to worry, there are more than enough lying around!\n\nAs you can see, I am so far, very impressed with INFRA. It has some very meticulous developers and the environmental graphics are brilliant (the humans could use some more detail though, but the environment makes up for that.) The sound effects in the game make the game a bit eerie and - although it is a completely non-violent game - it does get a bit spooky (especially when you take a picture of something out of the ordinary, that sound caught me off guard a few times.)\n\nThe game plays nicely once you manage to load it up without crashing, Sometimes it crashes on launch, sometimes mid-game, sometimes when I'm trying to quit. No game is without problems, though.\n\nOverall, the game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who likes exploration, attention to detail and/or taking photos.\n\nI rate it 8/10 very detailed koalas.\n", "timestamp_created": 1463268976, "timestamp_updated": 1463268976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22984763": {"recommendationid": "22984763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277984478", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462754084}, "language": "english", "review": "Id liek to have a serious word with the develpors of this game, i got naild with COPYRIGHT STRIKE for uploaded gameply footage of the game, because MUSIC IN THE GAME LAYS FOR !!

Aparantemente ele se passa na Finl\u00e2ndia, e como sou suspeito em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos pa\u00edses escandinavos, fico enbasbacado admirando as paisagens externas.\n\n+ C\u00e2mera: O recurso da c\u00e2mera foi uma grande sacada da produtora. Como \u00e9 opcional, quem n\u00e3o tiver paci\u00eancia pode simplesmente ignora-la, mas eu o aconselho a tirar proveito deste gameplay e reservar um tempo para tirar umas fotos de danos ou documentos relevantes.\n\n+ Explora\u00e7\u00e3o: Aproveite que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 monstros ou alien\u00edgenas te aporrinhando e explore os locais com calma. Os puzzles s\u00e3o adequados, no ponto certo. N\u00e3o s\u00e3o nem muito f\u00e1ceis e nem muito dif\u00edceis. \n\n[u]Pontos Negativos:[/u]\n\n- Dublagem: Fiquei espantado com a dublagem horrorosa do personagem principal. Ele n\u00e3o tem um boa entona\u00e7\u00e3o, tem um timbre ruim e fala mecanicamente, sem emo\u00e7\u00e3o alguma. O game tem sons ambientes bem recriados, mas tenha certeza que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai querer ficar ouvindo o seu personagem.\n\n- Baterias: Em INFRA \u00e9 preciso procurar baterias para a sua c\u00e2mera e lanterna. E procure mesmo, pois elas duram ridiculamente pouco. Ap\u00f3s aproximadamente 15 fotos j\u00e1 \u00e9 preciso trocar as baterias. Com a lanterna \u00e9 a mesma coisa, e procure racionar o uso. Eu entendo que procurar novas baterias torna a explora\u00e7\u00e3o interessante, mas elas duram muito pouco e isso \u00e9 bem chato.\n\nRecomendo definitivamente o jogo.

Es gibt eingestreute R\u00e4tsel, die sich haupts\u00e4chlich um Maschinen und Elektrizit\u00e4t drehen, und alle in der Realit\u00e4t verankert sind. Mit Taschenlampe, Batterien m\u00fcsse gefunden werden, und Kamera, auch hier m\u00fcssen Batterien gefunden, geht man auf die Reise durch verschiedene technische Bauwerke, z.B. Stahlwerk, Kl\u00e4ranlage, etc.\nDabei fotografiert man alles was nicht in Ordnung ist, haupts\u00e4chlich Sch\u00e4den an den Bauwerken und Maschinen, denn schlie\u00dflich spielt man einen \"Inspekteur\". Dabei findet man im Laufe des langen Spiels auch den roten Faden, der sich eher unauff\u00e4llig im Hintergrund h\u00e4lt.\n\nEs gibt Zeitungen, Berichte, Notizen zu lesen, die einem die Story erz\u00e4hlen oder einfach nur Hinweise zu den R\u00e4tseln geben. Schl\u00fcssel m\u00fcssen auch mal hier und da gefunden werden.\nOft gibt gibt es mehr als nur einen Weg durch ein Level, wobei der zus\u00e4tzliche Weg zumeist mit einem R\u00e4tsel verbunden ist.\n\nDas Spiel nutzt die Source-Engine die auch in Half Life 2 zum Einsatz kommt. Die Level sind sch\u00f6n gestaltet, detailliert und laden zum Erkunden ein. Die Soundkulisse passt, und die wenigen Musikst\u00fccke sind auch gut eingesetzt.\n\nEs gibt zwei oder drei Action-Sequenzen, die aber relative einfach zu bew\u00e4ltigen sind. Das w\u00e4re auch meine einzige kleine Kritik an dem Spiel. Auf diese Action h\u00e4tte man auch verzichten k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDas Spiel ist Teil 1. Teil 2 befindet sich schon in Arbeit.

Dont get me wrong, the graphics arent photorealistic - they are just very well crafted in terms of level design and setting an ambience. Its not just a couple of very detailed setpieces with bland areas in between, all environments in INFRA have been crafted with the same attention to detail. INFRA is truly a level designer's game.\n\nThe puzzles are truly challenging if you want to do them properly, but the game also allows you to progress without finishing them. This creates a very rewarding game that, at the same time, can be completed by nearly anyone.\n\nThe story isnt really that deep, in fact sometimes it feels like a portal rip-off, but everything is made up by the phenomenal atmosphere the game offers. Even with the shortcomings regarding the main story, I found the game very immersive.\n\nIs INFRA a walking simulator? Not really. The environment interaction in infra is deep, and always conected with the core puzzle gameplay. This means the walking around and enjoying the visuals isnt its own goal, but rather forms a solid puzzle solving experience with plenty of eye candy.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1461586832, "timestamp_updated": 1507894790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22573269": {"recommendationid": "22573269", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971777277", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 3317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508661348}, "language": "english", "review": "I was expecting a 4-hour game at best, but instead I got 18 hours of enjoyable exploration and puzzle solving set entirely in Finland, as it should be used more as a setting and not just for sports games. And that's just Part 1. I can't imagine how many more locations are in store in Part 2, which will be a free update, when I've already experienced the length of at least two modern FPS games for \u20ac15. Not only is it a refreshing change of setting from your usual New Yorks or what have you, though any city would work here, it's also inspired by a documentary about deteriorating infrastructure. That fact alone fills me with confidence that games as an art form is in safe hands. It's a fascinating choice of subject matter for a developer's first game and not in any way presented through a prism of science fiction or a military conflict, which is usually the choice for first-person games set in crumbling cities.\n\nInstead of having a decaying city as a backdrop, it's a character of the story. A victim of neglect, rivaling companies and corruption. You're tasked with surveying the structural damage of the city of Stalburg by taking photos of the damage. Finding documents and tapes people have left behind, you start to piece together where it all went haywire. You work your way through a maze of different locations, each of them detailed to the point of being believable, but not impressive by standards available to those with a huge budget. This being a crowd-funded game however, the scope and level of detail achieved here is shocking for a team of just 6 people, according to the credits.\n\nINFRA removes the guns, the aliens or bad guys with guns and you're left with elements that every great FPS relies on: exploration, environmental storytelling, quiet moments, puzzle solving, dealing with obstacles, etc. It's a game of valves, switches, key cards, buttons, turning it off, turning it on, reading notes and instructions to operate machinery and I loved every minute of it. You can find most of these in every notable FPS since the days of DOOM. The reason I'm emphasizing these is because the devs have honestly described what their game is about. It's not overburdened by pointless distractions that only create the illusion of immediacy and importance. What you're doing here is important in and of itself. The game sends a strong message of being responsible with the world around you, which is, among all these hugely expensive and ultimately pointless games, thoroughly heartwarming and commendable. Not to mention rare.\n\nCouple of moments where I couldn't figure out how to progress, so I consulted a video walkthrough, but I'm more bummed about the the stuff I didn't know how to repair. You're stuck between analyzing and trying to leave a place in a better shape than it was, but many of the bigger puzzles tied to achievements I just couldn't figure out, so grudgingly I had to move on. Thankfully there are no easy-to-use guides out there yet, so you can actually enjoy the puzzles as opposed to following a step-by-step guide on how to restore the functions of all these different facilities. There is damage, or scripted moments, that's unavoidable, but instinctively you try to be responsible where you can. These places have been abandoned, reminiscent of Pripyat, but the machinery still has life left in it, which continue to do damage.\n\nThe overall aesthetic reminded me of STALKER meets Half-Life 2, so a big thank you for Loiste Interactive in filling a gap that certain developers have failed to do for too long. To crawl through vents and solve puzzles is not to be underestimated, guns or no guns. While I eventually gave up on reading newspapers or longer notes, towards the end, I'm very much interested in how the story will progress in Part 2 and I look forward to taking more photos and solving puzzles. Somehow I've managed to ignore the elephant in the room. The voice acting of the player character is atrocious, but it steadily grows on you at a snail's pace, cos it's just so bad that it becomes almost cute. There is a lack of polish here, but that didn't stop Shadow of Chernobyl in becoming one of the best games of all time. You have to let a few things slide in order to get something special out there and that's fine, cos it's important that we get to play this in its current form than not at all.", "timestamp_created": 1461353058, "timestamp_updated": 1461357140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677395", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22520970": {"recommendationid": "22520970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054105945", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506720835}, "language": "english", "review": "I keep trying to write a review for this game but I keep starting again.

Having now played through the entire game from start to finish I felt the need to recommend it. \n\nIn short, you walk around abandoned buildings, tunnels and facilities and solve puzzles in order to progress. You are either the luckiest person in the world or the unluckiest, because everything seems to collapse or explode around you but you always just about find a way to survive. \n\nBut don't just think this is an abandoned building sight-seeing tour, oh no. The city is full of corruption and scandals that have lead to the neglect, deterioration and collapse of most of the city. \n\nThe game looks good and generally runs well as well (It's a Source game at it's core, so most PCs should run it). Small parts towards the end of the game run slightly worse though [i](and there may currently be a memory leak/bug, as the game started to chug after 3/4 hours running straight during Act 1.

INFRA is packed full of little details. It definitely rewards you for exploring and being observant. These rewards range from simple easter eggs to shortcuts. Puzzles in INFRA can have multiple solutions. You can get to the other side of a door by cunning navigation or clever circumventing. Because of these multiple routes, there are many offshoots (not complete branches because they connect back to the trunk quickly) that make the game feel organic and immersive. This game is definitely replayable as you will miss things the first time through.\n\nLet's talk about the bad a little bit. So while on the whole, I thoroughly enjoy the puzzles in this game, they don't scale well. What I mean by this is that rather than having puzzles that get trickier as you progress through the game, the puzzles get harder to solve because the pieces become hidden. My favorite part of putting together a puzzle isn't the part where I have to dig in the couch cushions because I think I lost a piece. So while this can make simple things take longer it does have the upside of forcing you to explore the world more and none of the pieces were ever hidden in a way that I thought was unfair.\n\nOn the balance, the experience and mystery of this game significantly outweighs the frustrations of having wasted an hour because you didn't look behind a door or in a box.\n\nMy playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9oRUnwXp-tzlYvT6ea990wS", "timestamp_created": 1459985377, "timestamp_updated": 1460053403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22204749": {"recommendationid": "22204749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091173619", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518626368}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: I had to edit my review seeing how the old one didn't give the game justice.\n\ntl:dr: This game is a 10/10, pick it up right now.\n\nI first found out about this game when I watched a video about it on youtube. I picked it up and instantly fell in love with it. The atmosphere, the music, the environment, is all perfect. I love the setting of the game too, exploring a \"broken\" city doesn't sound very interesting but Loiste Interactive somehow managed to make it into a game that I would argue is a direct competitor of Half-Life in terms of story quality and the amount of stuff there is in the game.

Having played through Part 1 (Part 2 is due later and will not be DLC but an integral part of the game, which will rise in price when it is released, so buying now may save you!) I would say that my favourite part of INFRA is the incredible atmosphere the game manages to create. An effective mix of impressive visuals and ambient effects bring to life the game's juxtaposition of the natural and artificial landscapes - so you'll emerge from a tunnel to see the decaying entrace behind is encrusted in trees and plants just as a slightly haunting tune plays, giving a pleasantly melancholy feeling. \n\nThe game puzzles are nice and varied, with clever use of the same elements to prevent everything from feeling too 'samey'. The game plot appears threadbare at first, but as the game progresses you can find out a lot more - nothing is presented explicitly, but if you piece together the scattered documents you find along the game you can put it all together, culminating in the final setpiece which sets the game up nicely for Part 2. The game has pretty good replay value, with a good mix of hidden achievements and collectibles (e.g. when going off the game path to some inaccessible place you'll sometimes find a geocache).

There's a scent of danger here and you need to solve what's going on in that old facility. A great game with a great display and visuals. The puzzles are really difficult, maybe not all of them but get away of the danger, and don't forget your job, take those pics for the boss.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIt's quite easy. Go to your office and forget those boring morning debriefs. You have a work to do. Take the camera, flashlights and all things you gonna need in an old facility to solve the mystery. And the puzzles. You are a structural analyst, in the middle of a routine mission but things get complicated. I promise.\n\nDon't forget to pick up for batteries! You gonna need for the camera and don't use it a lot. If you enter a place just use it once, take the picture if you need and turn it off, just to save batteries, and the flashlight. You will listen a sound when the appropriate picture is taken, take that into account.\n\nHere the puzzles are very logic so think. Use your head, that gonna help you to continue your mission. Use your eyes too, there are keys or objects you gonna need to use. Don't forget to visit every corner of the \"map\". I always do that, you never know what to find.\n\nWe can forget about the music here, except in the car radio. In real life, we don't have music everywhere. But the ambience sounds are amazing, the birds, the wind, everything. Also, the voice interpretations are just great.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Very realistic adventure\n+ Great sound effect\n+ Intelligent puzzles\n+ Great visual and display\n+ Good story\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Sometimes you can feel frustrated if you don't pass the puzzle\n- No gamma corrector. Adding one would be interesting.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nThis is an amazing game with a lot of puzzles, realistic ones you have to solve.

While some may call it a \u201cwalking simulator\u201d, I personally disagree, most of all due to the fact that INFRA allows you to take different routes and solve puzzles in different ways. \n\nFirst off, it is necessary to say that at the moment only Part 1 of the game is available. The developers are already hard at work on Part 2 but, as of now, there is no estimated release date and the first part ends somewhat abruptly.\n\nI was really surprised as I began to play this, that right from the start the game doesn\u2019t hold your hand. Even though it is a linear game, you are able to explore your surroundings within certain limits. The game also doesn\u2019t give you an objective so sometimes you might have a hard time figuring out what exactly you have to do or where you need to go. That said, even though you\u2019ll encounter multiple puzzles, they are not mandatory but they might give you access to documents that can provide you with some background information on certain events that could potentially shed some light on the mystery you\u2019re trying to solve. \n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nYou play as Mark, a structural analyst that is sent on a job to survey some old structures for potential degradation. What begins as just another day at work, quickly turns into a series of events that test his dexterity and resilience.\n\n At the beginning you\u2019ll most likely find yourself lost and with no idea of what is going on but slowly throughout the game you\u2019ll find clues that will reveal why these events are taking place and who is responsible for them. This was one of the reasons why I ended up exploring a lot and looking for as many documents and audio logs as I could. The world surrounding you seems so mysterious at first but you\u2019ll gradually get to know the city past, its history, how it became an industrial power and what led to its demise.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nINFRA mechanics will be explained to you very early on and they are really simple but yet, they add a whole other layer to the game. The most important one is your camera. You can use it to photograph evidence of structural damage and documents that contain information relevant to your case. Assuming you\u2019re actually interested and immersed in the world, this mechanic adds a lot to the game. I often found myself looking at every single structure I came across looking for damage, and still, I only found around 50% of the evidence in the game. \n\nOne other mechanic that also plays a huge role is climbing. You can climb any object, assuming it is not very high, by just getting closer to it and jumping. Of course you can also jump in the \u201cnormal way\u201d like in most first person games and this will also allow you to overcome some of the deadly traps that await you.\n\nThe puzzles in INFRA are varied but most of them involve activating switches or finding missing electrical components. Some of them are very easy and its answer will be obvious you right from the start. Others however, left me going back and forth on the level looking for hints and activating several switches in order to get them right which sometimes was rather tedious, especially on larger levels.\n\n[h1]Visuals & sound:[/h1]\nOne thing that became pretty clear for me since the very start, was the fact that the voice acting is very subpar. This kind of voice acting combined with the lack of dialogue didn\u2019t leave a lot of room to get attached to the main character.\n\nStill, the game has great sound design with background noises and overall the music is pretty great as well. While the graphics close on are somewhat dated, from a reasonable distance they allow for quite the scenery. You\u2019ll be exploring gorgeous open door environments, dark tunnels and abandoned buildings. Each of these places has its own unique markings, either it\u2019s an old dam, an ancient tunnel or an abandoned industrial complex from the early 1900\u2019s which make the game world feel a lot more real. All these aspects combined, provide for an amazing and relaxing experience\n\n[h1]Complaints:[/h1]\n- Loading times can take up to 30-40 seconds\n- I experienced some framerate variations (even though I\u2019m way above the recommended system specs), one second I\u2019d have over 100 fps and the next moment it would dip down to the 40s and sometimes even lower\n- The game auto-saves but there is also an option for manual saving. The problem I have with this is that you have 4 different save slots but it easily gets very confusing which save is which because the game gives you no indication other than \u201cSave Slot 1\u201d, \u201cSave Slot 2\u201d, etc.\n\n[h1]Final thoughts:[/h1]\n\nEven though only Part 1 is available, INFRA is well worth your time. It is a mysterious and engaging experience that conveys the story by narrative means other than dialogue. It has its relaxing and tense moments and, most importantly, it lets the player choose if they just want to storm through the scenarios or explore them meticulously looking for clues of the towns past and the whole mystery surrounding this structural degradation.

On the outside looking in a person may shrug and think to themselves, another walker, ugh!!!  (in walker I mean Walking Simulator not the walking dead silly goose).  While this game isn't your typical walking simulator.  The scenery is beautiful, the puzzles can be quite challenging, the game is billed as the first part of a larger series of games, with the sequel set to release sometime in the \"near\" future..  If you go into the game expecting to whip out your arm cannon, or unload your boom stick, or even blast away creepy crawling monsters you'll be disappointed, no weapons, violence or monsters exist in INFRA, but you will get an amazing experience and a good story, told through various memo's notes, and character dialog. \n\n[b] Tech Issue[/b]\nI had a few technical issues with my main computer, which was far above what the recommended specs are, and the game crashed to desktop when pushing play, white graphics in doorways, and a few other minor graphical issues.  I could get the game working but typically the moment it had to load, between stages etc, it would crash to desktop and require more tinkering to work.  I did however manage to play the game on my older PC which was barely above the minimum recommendations and it worked flawlessly and looked beautiful  I used every conceivable work around I could think of in order to get the game working on my updated computer but nothing would do the trick for long.  With that said, I'm not sure if it was the game or my computer which caused the issue, so I just wanted to put in here my experience.  \n\n[b]The Story[/b]\n\nYou start the game as a man named Mark, he's currently sitting in on a board meeting, the \"boss\" goes through the specifics of what is required of Mark and his fellow teammates (although you're flying solo this time pal).  The basic story is Mark needs to visit a location and document damages to the structure, while at the same time keeping an eye out for documents which can help explain what brought about the demise of the crumbling buildings and town.   Sounds easy enough, after the meeting which is a 6 to 9 minute affair, you're tasked with searching out supplies, \"getting some new markers\" and collecting the car keys to drive yourself over to your eventual destination.  What follows is a relatively uninspired trip through an office.. Unfortunately if these guys are \"structural\" anything, they haven't done a good job as their building has many technical issues, and the elevator can only travel between a few floors...   ANYWAY, after getting your supplies (minus the markers... aww) you make your way to the parking Garage...  after that it's onward to your destination, for puzzles, walking, and possible even a few deaths..  (I totally suggest the moment you get out of truck, head to the left and take a dip in the water.. so warm it's awesome..  sike.. if you do that you're totally gonna die, did I say the game was a swimming simulator?)   From this point on you search around looking for clues, looking for batteries and broken structures to photograph. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\nBeautiful scenery, \nCan be quite challenging to spot the structure issues.\nThe lands are fairly large and interesting\nDoesn't hold your hand... (you won't find no glowing yellow streams in this one)\nPuzzles can be rather difficult to figure out\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nPuzzles can be stupidly easy (although the easy puzzles are few and far between)\nTechnical issues (may have been my computer?)\nVoice acting (the voice acting is like something out of the Playstation 1 era)\nTotal lack of direction or explanation of what your goal is (it's ok to not hold your hand, but at the very least give some idea of what is required to move onto the next portion of the state)\nBacktracking (goes hand in hand with the above mentioned con)\nLoading times can be upwards of a minute (this could be my computer as it had other issues with the game)\nSome clipping issues, which can cause you to get stuck\n\n[b]Recommendation[/b]\nWhile I had a few issues with my computer it did sour me a bit, I understand it was probably something on my end rather than the game's end, so I set that aside and will recommend the game based on the merits..  Unlike many of the other Walking Simulators out there, this game actually did a good job of getting the atmosphere right.  The puzzles are challenging for the most part and the scenery is absolutely beautiful.

It has a very nice graphic, a good background sound, nice gameplay and a decent story. Everything, a good game needed. \n\nThe game starts in a conference room where you wait for your boss and some work colleagues, they talk about work and what to do in future and you have to click some \u201cPowerPoint\u201d.  Then you get your mission. \n\nGo to a dam in a ghost town, documenting everything is broken or wrong and find documents, so far so good, first I search for my office to get my stuff I really need (flashlight, camera, helmet), as I found it I see, oh nice the boss gave me the new car. So I go throw the bureau and find all the things. That is how the game is all the time only in little. \uf04a Now I have to find the garage in basement, everything is broken, oh my god, go down the stairs, use the elevator, find the door key\u2026ten minutes later\u2026get into the car. (Short sequence) Get out of the car and the game starts finally. There I can make some pictures and I hear a gentle ringing (sound if you found something what broken or wrong). There are some items to collect but not many, batteries for flashlight and cam and the keyitems like keys, boltcutter etc. You can move some items like crates, in some situations its really necessary. The puzzles are mostly logical and aren\u2019t hard, sometimes you will run in circles to search for the solution.\n\nThis game has no GUI, no inventory, no journal and no hints. If you collect or use batteries the character say how many packs left. This kind of style is OK for me. BTW save you batteries for later game, you will need it.\n\nGraphic is very good, not an eye-catcher but still good.

Turn the Gamma up, or you aren't going to see the puzzles in some spots. Took me a while to figure out what I was doing wrong.

The puzzles themselves have a wide range, from the most simplistic, to rather challenging. The game itself looks great, the graphics and shaders really seemed to take effect to the game itself. There seems to have been a lot of work on everything on this game, from the stunning graphics and scenery to the puzzles.\n\n[h1]Game Play[/h1]\nThis game focuses mostly on puzzles, and have some puzzle-platforming parts of the game as well. It makes a nice change to the game rather than sticking to just puzzles all the time. Some of the puzzles that you may encounter in this game are either simplistic or rather difficult. The challenge of the game increases as you proceed through the game, the puzzles get harder and therefore require you to think more about how to solve them. The game starts at a slow pace in the way of solving puzzles, and the ouzzles seem to be one right after the other. The game itself isn't completely open world, but there is a decent amount of areas to explore if you are the kind of person who likes exploring places that aren't always 100% necessary to do so. A point that I didn't like about the rather difficult puzzles where the situations where you would just die over and over again until you can figure out what to do. This got me rather fustrated and made me stop playing for a small remainder of time. Thankfully this game has autosave checkpoints which slightly lowered my furstration when dying over and over but still pushed me enough to make me stop playing for a little bit. The story line of the game is really good, it's very interesting and made me come back to play more if I ever did break out of fustration at times of the game.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics of this game are absolutely stunning. I can't even begin to imagine how much work the developers must've put into this to make it look as good as it does. Although most of the game will be going into dark and gloomy places, there still seems to be a lot of work been put into this game. When you are platforming on the game, it gives you a chance to see more of the contryside that you couldn't normally see.\n\n[h1]Music & Sound[/h1]\nThe game really does well when it comes to the sounds when you are in the different locations of the game, depending if you are outside or inside a dark gloomy area, it really helps set the atmosphere up for the game.

You use your camera to find disturbances and clues as to what is happening, as well as taking pictures of any documentation and other evidence that could \"aid the cause\" of the company you're working with.\n\nI will go through my rundown of what I thought was good and bad, and give a few more tidbits of why I like this game overall, and how I came to giving this one a \"thumbs up\".\n\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\nNice environments and scenery.  Easy to learn the controls, as with many walking sims.  \n\nI like the camera in the game.  It's cool seeing the picture in picture, and taking pictures of things that should be repaired, or were neglected.  \n\nI enjoy the idea of having to be very observant in order to find things that are not quite right.  It is \nnice since I don't like rushing through games, and promotes slowing down and examining your surroundings.\n\nI like finding the pieces to the broken elements or fixing things along the way.  \n\nExpansive game, with a lot more to it than I first thought.  Trying to figure out the puzzles took me a \nwhile to complete many sections of the game.\n\nI like the various traps to overcome, and the changing environment as you get deeper into the game. \n\n \n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\nI don't much care for the voice acting, especially when I first started out.  It took some getting used to for me to adjust to it.  I don't really feel much connection with the protagonist either, so that is a little bit dry for me.  I would have liked to have a little more dialog, but at the same time I guess it is in the character's personality to be very matter-of-fact and not the talkative sort.  \n\nI did not know you could throw objects you pick up until a good bit later, so I would have liked seeing this in the initial part of the tutorial phase.\n\nThe backtracking and trying to figure out what to do to go onwards can get a little bit frustrating.  It's \neasy to miss something, only to have to backtrack quite a bit in order to move forward in progression.\n\nI can't really tell where each save has me at, if I am curious.  I would really like an area select, so I could work on particular areas again if I wanted to go back.  I'm not sure if there is a way other than the four save slots.\n\nLoading screens are a bit lengthy and break up the continuity and fluidity of the gameplay.  They can take a bit of time.\n\n\n[h1]Glitches:[/h1]  \n\nHeard the train horn go off after the train was stopped on the other side of the bridge.  Also I turned around at the train tracks for a second, then when I turned back the train was already at its destination.\n\nSometimes on reloads, certain sound effects would cut out for me.  \n\nI had a few times where I got killed in strange ways.  A box near a ledge might turn, and I'd suddenly die.  If I was not careful on my exploration, I might get trapped beside rocks, or other obstacles. \n\nI also trapped myself by doing stupid stuff with items I was able to carry, so use caution when moving these types of things around.  I had to reload a checkpoint or two because of my carefree attitude with things I could grab in the game.\n\nNot so much a glitch, but the controller for me was a little bit clunky, when compared to the mouse.  For example, if I was trying to select something on a computer screen map, I couldn't be nearly as precise as with a mouse.  The same thing if i were interacting with something by looking at it.  Hard to determine where I needed to focus with the controller at times, but zooming in could help a bit sometimes.  I liked having the ability to move between one or the other though.\n\n\n[h1]Other Thoughts:[/h1]\n\nSave often, as you can get stuck in places, or die, and it will become your checkpoint.  Collecting the items is a nice bonus as well for achievements, if you're into that sort of thing.  They are not so easy to find though, in many cases.  While not gigantic, the game is fairly expansive and immense for something of a walking sim/puzzle.  From my experience, others I have played were much shorter.  \n\nAfter finishing one playthrough, I would have to play through again to get the achievements I have missed.  I would have liked to have some kind of level select to try to complete more of my achievements too, but I could not find anything like this.  I believe that would improve the desire to replay the game.  I would love to have some sort of map feature, so I could tell where I am at certain times.  It can get a bit confusing while moving from place to place, and I think this would have enhanced my experience just a bit.  As for resources, I didn't really ever come close to running out of batteries for flashlight or camera, and with proper exploration, they are very plentiful.  I also used both fairly sparingly whenever possible.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game, and I am glad I played it!  I would recommend to people who are into a more laid back and somewhat relaxing cinematic-style experience.  I could see most people enjoying this game though.  It was a breath of fresh air for me to see the combination of elements put together in the game.  It worked well, I thought.  For me, this fell more in line with that cinematic style, but there are moments where you have to act fast to survive.  I liked the dynamic changing world around you too.  The colors and textures were pleasing to the eye, and I wanted to keep playing, which is a great thing.  I wish there were a little more story involved during your own personal struggle to get through though.  With the place falling apart around you, there were many times you just could not go back, and while I expected bad things to happen, it was still surprising in the well done placement of many of the various dangers.  Great game overall!\n\n[b]** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

The gameplay consists of a large variety of fairly accurate electrical and mechanical puzzles. I found the pacing to be perfectly blended with fast paced moments evenly spread across the game.\n\n The visuals serve as a testimony of what an old engine such as Source can still achieve. The developers have clearly stretched the engine to its maximum capabilities to create this game.\n\nThe soundtrack is brilliantly composed and consists of a mix of industrial, ambient and action-oriented tracks which I find myself listening to outside of the game.\n\nHowever, the main thing which I find carries this game, is the message behind it.  INFRA tells a very real story about a city which isn\u2019t too different from yours or mine and shows events which can likely happen if we refuse to take care of our infrastructure.\n\nAlthough the game is not without its flaws. There are a handful of visual and gameplay glitches scattered throughout the games. Fortunately, the developers have been very active in fixing issues within the game and helping out the player base.\n\nINFRA is a game I find enjoyable but it might not be for everyone. The game has a slower pace, is currently unfished and mainly consist of documenting, walking and solving puzzles. Something I could see not appeal to me if I had more action orientated tastes.\n\n[b]Disclaimer: [/b]\nI obtained a free INFRA key for beta testing purposes in the last wave before the games release (2016), however I was already intending to purchase INFRA before this.\n", "timestamp_created": 1457237200, "timestamp_updated": 1505205319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21617543": {"recommendationid": "21617543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154425859", "num_games_owned": 1046, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458983971}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Infra is an Indie atmospheric mystery adventure that doubles as a physics puzzler by day, with minimal and realistic platforming.[/h1]\nIt is a must have for anyone who likes mysteries and crime dramas. I love the genre myself, so was delighted to find something new. With the narrative of Stanley\u2019s Parable, and the stimulating puzzles of Portal, Infra is sure to be worth the price. \n\n[b]Physics in Motion:[/b]\nThings move, and you move with them. The world is more than just a traditional set of \u201cmaps.\u201d Each map location contains physically responsive pieces of machinery. These provide open-ended exploration opportunities for the gamer to solve puzzles that were not spoon-fed to him. This one will not insult your intelligence with big arrows on screen shouting, \u201cclick here.\u201d Either you find them or you don\u2019t and you keep moving. Nobody\u2019s holding your hand here. And there is none of that, \u201cpile everything up and see what you can craft\u201d mechanics either. \n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nThe artwork is well done and often panoramic in outdoor scenes. The platforming gives you great chances to see more of the view around the countryside. The graphics are satisfying in a nostalgic way. For a game that makes such low demands on the hardware, the graphics come out mid-range. The locations are mostly dark and dingy so, it is a whole different type of atmosphere, as in Late Garage-Sale/Early Thrift Shop antique furniture. Hitting things causes dust to rise.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b]\nIt\u2019s easy to get immersed in the sound effects of birds and nature when in the outdoor areas. Ambient effects like birds whistling give it an airy and peaceful feel. I have the deluxe edition with a soundtrack of the ambient music. \n\n[b]Lighting Matters:[/b]\nColors on puzzles often play optical tricks in less than true color if you don\u2019t check them with the flashlight. Ignore this at your own risk. \nBatteries, though plentiful, have to be located and collected as you go. Only turn on the flashlight to see then cut it right back off, moving without it when you can or you\u2019ll be whining in the dark later. \n\n[b]Telling Story:[/b]\nInfra is a story of corporate disillusionment, where corruption has left a man\u2019s dreams as a rotting nightmare. I haven\u2019t finished the game yet, so I have no idea where this is headed. But, I feel like I have walked into the middle of a conspiracy. The story is definitely intriguing and draws you in to complete the missions.\n\n[b]Photographer:[/b]\nYou are chronicling the story as you go, but the mechanics of the camera are highly restrictive in what is considered \u201ccorrect\u201d evidence of structural damage. Limitations of batteries will force you to think and evaluate machinery, rather than just randomly snapping photos, hoping for something to come out right.\nThe game presents puzzles and keys to proceed through doors, and therefore the story is quite linear. However, the detective work consists in sleuthing out all the hidden codes and evidence alongside the linear route. This lends replay-ability to the game, since you will need more than the first run through to locate all the things you missed. \nI found it important to take screenshots of codes, numbers, and puzzles for further analysis after the first run through, as I have not memorized binary code, and I am not experienced with code-breaking. There are undoubtedly numerous types of codes located throughout for you code-breaking junkies out there. \nThe locations in the story are extremely dilapidated and hazardous to your health. In the first chapters, I thought I would die traversing the electrified water spots. But, I made it through those just fine and broke my neck trying to jump off a roof onto a window ledge. It makes it all the more realistic, because accidents happen when you get too comfortable in a hazardous environment.\n\n[b]Choices:[/b]\nAs you play you will find chances to repair things yourself. Your decisions affect the outcome of your play-through. Everything matters. The map is highly accessable, with multiple routes for many of the missions. \n\n[b]Pros: [/b]\nNot cartoony, and decidedly adult in content/ Not another Nancy Drew or Sherlock Holmes Mystery\nTechnologically and Environmentally relevant plot \nUser-friendly game-play mechanics, real life tools\nVoice acting is enjoyable. \nReal adventure gaming at it\u2019s best. \nMentally challenging / Intelligent puzzles\n\n[b]Cons: [/b]\nNot an adrenaline ride thus far, just serious crime sleuthing in hazardous environments.\nNo guns\u2026 you\u2019re shooting pictures here. \nNo inventory to collect, except those batteries \nNot a point & click Mystery, & no Hidden Object puzzles, I\u2019m sorry. \n\n[b]I highly recommend Infra to gamers in every genre, as it has something for everyone.[/b]\nTime in game is sure to vary depending on your code-breaking experience. A simple speed run through could be done in just 3 hours by experienced gamers, where I have 5 hours already and just into the 3rd chapter.  Achievements are nicely aligned to provide something extra for fastidious types who like to find all the details and enjoy the atmosphere. I will certainly be watching Loiste Interactive for more great games.

The levels are big and there is a lot to explore. Yet the game feels unfinished. Most of the time you don't know what you are doing and where you are going, which could be ok if you would get rewarded (which you don't) for wandering around and checking every corner like in other exploration games.\n\nThe voice acting was horrible, especially on the part of the main character. With the given voice of our hero, the letter a in the flashlight sounds more like an e, which then again might be humorous... The game was doing it's best to be funny, but managed to do this in quite a childish way. Most non-Finnish people won't probably find the ever-present beer references amusing.\n\nThe game has some climbing and jumping elements, for which the character movement isn't very well suited. Especially the part requiring jumping or other athletics were frustrating as our hero can't really do these things. When this was couple insta-death situations (dropping to water etc.) or running against time situations, it wasn't really enjoyable. Is this poor map design, a challenge or did I miss some important controls when I would always end up in the river when taking what seemed to be a short cut?\n\nAs for the puzzles and the story, well, I lost interest in them. The puzzles became something I had to do in order to open a door to continue and I couldn't get any joy out of that after a while. Something was missing to keep me interested and motivated, something didn't make the world believable. Still, I managed to complete the game, though I could have just as easily given up after losing interest.\n\nWhile investigating the problems of the infrastructure and corruption behind it seemed like a nice idea, it felt like a bad hobby (because of not getting anything in return, just to advance to next location). There was no benefit in doing it. Also there is some illogical aspect in this, a hole in the bridge or a wall should be reported but blocked fire escapes and other clear structural defect and dangerous things shouldn't be? I really couldn't understand sometimes what I was supposed to document and what not.\n\nSo, who should buy this game? If you like exploring and solving puzzles, maybe this is your game.

INFA delivered on all fronts.  My first play through took about 15 hrs (currently at 65 hrs and have played through the game at least 4 times looking for achievements).  I'm looking forward to episode 2 (which will be free for those who purchase episode 1).  I have really enjoyed my time with this game.\n\nI would describe INFRA as an environmental puzzle game with a decades old conspiracy story at its heart.  You play a structural engineer working for a private firm which has just been awarded a contract to manage infrastructure maintenance for Stalburg, a fictional European city.  You are sent to survey bridges, a dam, a power plant, etc. and document (i.e. photograph) any need for repairs.  Along the way you uncover documents about an old conspiracy which led to the city's current state disrepair.\n\nThe game starts off somewhat slow in terms of puzzle solving and ends with nearly one puzzle right after another.  There is plenty to do.  The game is not open world but offers a decent amount of urban exploration of decaying infrastructure along with some beautiful views.  There's also a pervasive undercurrent of dry humor which I really enjoyed.\n\nPuzzle difficulty ranges from almost too simple to extremely difficult.  Most deal with manipulating machinery of some kind, although there are some platforming puzzles too.  There are some crisis situations where you just die, die, and die again until you figure things out.  Not my favorite type of puzzle, but fortunately autosave checkpoints are really well done to minimize frustration.  (You can also save anywhere.)  Coded messages are also hidden in the game.  Some in binary, others encrypted.  I'm not really into that sort of thing, but I appreciate it being there for those that are.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is actually just moving around.  I'm forever getting caught up on doorways, ladders, railings, low ceilings.  Maybe that's just a product of the Source engine, maybe it's just me.  There's also a battery requirement for the flashlight and camera.  Batteries run out quite fast in this game.  There are plenty of batteries to be found though, no need to be miserly with either.  Perhaps the batteries were a game mechanic meant to encourage exploration.  Regardless, it can get exapserating with how frequently you need to replace them.\n\nINFRA is a bit rough around the edges.  Some parts of the game are beautiful and some parts look unfinished or unpolished.  The voice acting ranges from fine to bad.  The underlying logic of why you need to solve X to accomplish Y is sometimes missing, or mystifying.  The puzzles themselves were not hard to recognize and there are usually notes or hints to guide you to solutions.\n\nI recommend this game if you are into puzzle games like Portal, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and The Talos Principle.  INFRA is roughly in the same vein.  INFRA's pros outweigh its cons and absolutely delivers on urban exploration and puzzle solving.", "timestamp_created": 1455398701, "timestamp_updated": 1455398701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21110800": {"recommendationid": "21110800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075691729", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508947041}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.

It has it's flaws, and it can be frustrating at times for all the wrong reasons, but the effort put in to the locations and enviroments shines through.

The devs have clearly done their location research, starting all the way with the office at the beginning, through to every piece of infrastructure in the game.

No hay que confundir con t\u00edtulos como Dear Esther u otros similares cuyo enfoque es distinto, pese a que en un primer vistazo pudiera parecer que son similares, en lo \u00fanico que se parecen es en alejarse de los c\u00e1nones establecidos sobre los videojuegos en primera persona. Aunque en realidad s\u00ed tenemos enemigos, y son las construcciones del hombre d\u00e1ndose la mano con la fragilidad de la integridad estructural, con todo lo que ello conlleva.\n\nPese a que por motivos obvios no es una aventura donde predomine la acci\u00f3n, s\u00ed que hay varios momentos donde la tensi\u00f3n nos obligar\u00e1 a ser r\u00e1pidos e intentar evitar situaciones de verdadero peligro. Acostumbrarse demasiado al ritmo predominante de este t\u00edtulo puede suponer un grave error cuando las cosas cambian.\n\nAlgo a tener sin duda muy en cuenta es la parte visual de los escenarios, con toda una serie de detalles, contraste de colores, luces y sombras que amenizan a\u00fan m\u00e1s si cabe nuestro avance. Uno nunca pensar\u00eda que un t\u00edtulo de una tem\u00e1tica como esta pudiera conseguir ofrecer una visi\u00f3n art\u00edstica tan notable, y esto \u00faltimo es algo que se puede apreciar a simple vista en varias de las capturas que tiene. No obstante el dise\u00f1o de los personajes (visualmente hablando) no me gust\u00f3 demasiado.\n\nEn lo que se refiere a la historia se nos presenta de determinadas formas, aunque todas ellas en su justa medida. Aparte de las conversaciones con nuestros compa\u00f1eros disfrutaremos de comentarios en solitario de nuestro personaje, notas y se\u00f1ales (narrativa visual), e incluso textos, diarios, informes y grabaciones que nos ayudar\u00e1n a destapar toda una trama detr\u00e1s de los acontecimientos y a darle mayor sentido a lo que nos rodea.\n\nLa banda sonora es bastante correcta, y encaja con los lugares y situaciones que se nos presentan.\n\nPersonalmente y aunque en los primeros compases el juego me dej\u00f3 un poco fr\u00edo, tal cual fui avanzando todo empez\u00f3 a volverse mucho m\u00e1s interesante porque los aspectos que ya he mencionado empezaron a brillar con luz propia.\n\nActualmente solo se dispone de la primera parte, que ofrece en torno a las 10-12 horas de juego (en mi caso incluso unas pocas m\u00e1s), no obstante la parte restante y una vez finalizada estar\u00e1 incluida para todos los que ya hubieran adquirido el juego anteriormente.\n\nEst\u00e1 completamente traducido al espa\u00f1ol por un servidor, aunque de momento de manera no oficial (se puede encontrar la traducci\u00f3n en la secci\u00f3n de gu\u00edas).", "timestamp_created": 1454576792, "timestamp_updated": 1461228826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800060", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20933317": {"recommendationid": "20933317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195898951", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454549678}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, no hairy monsters or bloody battles.

Some of the puzzles throughout the game are brilliant, but others are really not that good (I'm looking at you, raft section and all the elecrified floor jumpathons). I like the scandinavian aesthetic as I am a Finn myself (really brought me back to my heydays in Kontula with the above ground segments) and I really loved the nature segments as well.\n\nAbove all, the game really needs some solid hints. I got through most of the game without a hitch, but some solutions are not so obvious and could use for example the player's voice to guide through them. I think there should be a prelude \"routine infrastructure case\" before coming to the office, a small tutorial course where you need to photograph, flashlight and get used to the mazelike urbex gameplay of INFRA. The game could really use one where you learn some not-so-obvious things like stacking crates and such. I really loved the office, but only in hindsight as it's a bit too good at showcasing the gameplay elements...it's just too much too fast and might scare more casual players away.\n\nI gotta hand it to you Oskutin & friends, the level design is phenomenal. There are some really amazing vistas and you managed to squeeze everything out of Source. I loved the blast furnace tower. I really really loved the little landscapes near the dam and the little suburban canal section. Top marks on the hacker den too - that place was fun as hell to go through. The waterfalls, the dam, everything is so peaceful, serene yet manage to get the atmospheric 'spooky' factor to the max. \n\nThe unpolishness is making this a bit of a tough sell. There's a LOT of spelling errors, confusing sentences and overall weirdness going about. In my playthrough, none of the audiologs worked so I didn't get much out of the storyline. I'll play it through again when part 2 is out (lovely cliffhanger by the way). You really need someone to fix those quirks in text and script when you get around finishing the entire experience.\n\nThere are also quite a few bugs. Physics glitches, sound issues and such were thankfully quite fast patched, but there are some lingering issues that almost all pertain to the engine itself. There's a crane that can detach its load in late chapter 5 that can kill your playthrough unless you reload a checkpoint, if you do things in wrong order with a certain forklift. There's some inconsistencies in level design where that cool area you found might not go anywhere at all. There's the infuriating pixel-perfect-or-you're-dead raft section that makes me want to skewer the one who okay'd that through QA. I hope these gets fixed after part 2 is out, since these really destroy the immersion and experience.\n\nAnd boy, what an experience it is. I'm almost inclined to go romping around abandoned factories and facilities in real life after having so much fun exploring these urban ruins. The camera mechanic is genius, if only you'd give more batteries to play around with. The puzzles are creative and the nice crisis scenes you get from time to time are well thought out and executed. A phenomenal title focused solely on urbex and puzzling, beautifully laid out in an urban yet natural scandinavian wonderland. Few more spit shine polish elements and I'd give this a solid 10/10, but I'll have to go with 8/10, with one point out for repeated 'electrified water' and 'stack the boxes' gags and the second one for unpolishness and the infuriating raft section. Did I mention how I hated that part yet? Seriously, it is beyond terrible.\n\nOverall, 8/10, would heavily recommend.

Currently the game is a drag, and that's a shame, because I really want to like this game. It has a unique atmosphere and does (tries to do) something different from most games today. I wouldn't have bothered to write this review if I didn't like this game, but in it's current state I cannot recommend it.\n\nMy main issue is that it feels very much like an alpha release, and definitely should still be in Early Access. But as that is not the case, I fear some of the weird design features will not be rectified. I will list a few issues I have with the game below.\n\nThe game world is not logical. It appears to be, but is far from it. Abandoned places still have electric lights on, and every place is generally too well lit; makes me wonder why do I even have a torch with me. People have left notes lying around which are obviously there to help me, but would make no sense in a real world. Usually these notes are right next to the puzzle and basically tell you how to solve it, so it's not really a puzzle but \"follow instructions\" type of a problem. I got stuck at the sawmill for several hours because I didn't notice an attic window, which for some unnatural reason had a plank protruding from it, and I was supposed to go through there. Never in my life I've seen something like that in real life, so I didn't think to look for it. It makes sense in game, kinda, but I've never liked puzzles which do not rely on real world logic but impose their own on the player. There are other kind of logical problems which break the immersion, like finding a dead body but not reporting it to anyone immediately, and halting a train but not communicating to the crew in any way, etc.\n\nThere are several places in the game world where you can get stuck, like falling between some rocks. Otherwise the character can climb low obstacles, but apparently 50 cm of rock is too much for him. This wouldn't be a problem, as most of these places are off the beaten path, but the game suggests that it rewards exploration. And I like that, it's nice that there are places you can walk around, which are there just for the atmosphere, but as it is, it's way too easy to get stuck or fall into water (instadeath, naturally). This is all made worse by the save game system, which doesn't tell you which save slot you used last (nor name the saves), and doesn't ask if you want to overwrite your last save. Additionally you can also get to areas from which you cannot go back, so saves are somewhat important, yeah.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty bad, but okay I guess for an indie developers budjet. The English used in the notes found in game is rather awful, with a lot of typos and poor grammar. Almost every note found has some mistakes in it. Another thing related to this is the weird nation the game takes place in, as it seems to be some sort of strange hybrid of Finland, USA, UK and some East European countries. The main character speaks like he's Slavish, but still speaks in (very broken) English, and most of the names are English as well, yet there are some Finnish products and words here and there. Pontikka is moonshine in English, so why would the characters in game use the Finnish word? This would've worked so much better if the whole game was set in Finland, or if the protagonist or another major character was Finnish living in whatever country this is supposed to be set in. Being a Finn myself, I'd love to see a pretty game like this set in Finland.\n\nThe main character's camera uses AA batteries and runs out of them after a couple of shots, doesn't zoom or record video, and you cannot look at what pictures you have taken. I guess the state of decay extends to the city officials equipment as well. The protagonist should know his camera is a POS, and pack extra batteries, but no, he prefers to rely on luck, finding fresh batteries in buildings abandoned for years or decades. Feels like a producer told the dev team that if there aren't any guns, there still should be reloading and ammo pickups. Please. Hunting for batteries adds nothing to the game and is just plain irritating. The fact that you can't look at the pictures you've taken is also a missed opportunity, as taking a picture of a found schematic and checking it from the camera later when you actually have to solve a puzzle would make much more immersive gameplay than finding the instructions right next to every puzzle.\n\nThe good? As I stated above, the game is unique in atmosphere. Mix of slow paced exploration and puzzle solving is a great idea, and at times works very well. The game looks good enough, but runs very unevenly, freezing sometimes for no reason for a second or two, and having other graphical glitches like doorways that are nothing but bright white light until you walk through them. The sounds are good and the sparsely used music fits the game well. The environments are somewhat unusual for games, as there are areas which seem to offer nothing but places to walk around. I like that, makes the world feel all the more real. Many of the puzzles are fun enough and most of the locations look like they could actually exist. This is by no definition a bad game, but it could be so much better than it currently is.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, so maybe there are more things I'll like later in the game, I don't know. Had to stop playing because it got so annoying to deal with everything above that I had to write this review. Currently I can only enjoy this game if I play it 15-20 minutes at a time, any longer and I want to rip my eyes out, out of pure frustration. This has the potential to be an amazing game, and I won't give up on it.

The game had humble beginnings as a Source Engine mod project  that eventually grew large enough to become its own fully fledged title.  The game drew a rabid fan base whilst it was in the Steam Greenlight program attracting more than 45,000 votes and peaking at #4 on the Greenlight Charts. It wasn\u2019t until the developers understood just how popular their title was that they ultimately decided to create the company from that \u2013 until this point it was a group of friends who were working on their mod together. Soon thereafter thanks to some investment into the company the group were able to commit themselves to their project on a permanent full time basis.\n\nPre-Steam Release Acclaim: To show just how popular INFRA had become the game received a number of nominations and awards during its development cycle beginning in 2011 with selection to the top one hundred \u201cMod of the Year\u201d list by ModDB, earning Greenlit status the following year on Steam and peaking with a nod from IndieDB as a top one hundred selection to \u201c2014 Indie of the Year Awards.\u201d\n\nA grand beginning: The first episode in the INFRA episodic adventure, part two will be free for purchasers of the first part, averages about ten hours in play. You play the role of a structural analyst whose tasked with the job of navigating, and hopefully surviving, a brutal labyrinth. As it says in the Steam Description, it is a gun-free puzzle adventure. Intelligence and strategy are awarded as you work your way through some of the most rewarding interactive puzzles to be seen in gaming in recent times. It\u2019s an ambitious opening act that offers highly rewarding gameplay.\n\nLarge maps that truly inspire you to explore: Almost from the very beginning you will be surprised at just how large the maps in the game are. Although I found the office section to be more than a little tedious  \u2013 it\u2019s main purpose  is to serve as a tutorial \u2013 I was surprised at just how large the area was. This continues right throughout the episode. They are all highly detailed featuring a number of different potential routes and offered a feeling of an open world better than some true open world games. Each area is filled with puzzles and unique game play that really does make you feel that you\u2019re not repeating the same things over and over again. The game design has been very well thought out. The maps provide you ample opportunities to explore and to try different ideas with all of this feeling very rewarding. I quite enjoyed the distinct looks and sounds of the various areas. The environments are lush and beautiful. It genuinely feels as though Loiste Interactive thought of everything to create an immersive experience for the players.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect: There are a number of flaws in the game. However, I believe that this can be explained by the availability of resources for development and the relative inexperience of the development team. Overall, I believe that these flaws can be overlooked but they are notable. First, I was worried that I couldn\u2019t even start the game. I don\u2019t necessarily put games straight onto my SSD. Consequently, I put INFRA onto my HDD and it stayed there. When I first loaded up the game I got long periods of black screens to the point where I quit the game multiple times believing that the game had crashed on me. I believe on the third or fourth attempt I just said to hell with it and got myself a drink. I soon heard the game begin \u2013 so if this happens to you please wait. Secondly, the voice acting is poor. However, thankfully once you get out of the office there isn\u2019t a lot of it and what little of it there is is bearable. That office seen, though, felt as though the voice actors didn\u2019t particularly care for the job that they were doing. Not a good beginning. There are also grammatical errors in the English within the game but not to the point where you are dumbfounded at what is being said.\n\nINFRA is one of the best new Indie games on Steam. It offers significant gameplay value at its current cost and is perfect for those of you who enjoy good adventure puzzle games with some horror thrown in for good measure. If you don\u2019t buy it now because you\u2019re waiting for the second part of the game to be released then you should at the very least put it on your wishlist.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/", "timestamp_created": 1453458238, "timestamp_updated": 1453458238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490368", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20666795": {"recommendationid": "20666795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072130043", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506811099}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished it, I love this game alot.\n\nSometimes the puzzles were hard to understand what you had to do, but taking a step away and coming back to it, then being able to solve the puzzle was very rewarding.\n\nThe game, in most areas, looked very good, especially the foliage and the tunnels.

A highly unique and enjoyable experience that really tickled the right spot for me with its attention to detail and atmosphere.\n\nSome puzzles seem to be avoidable or optional and the reason for using the camera is not well explained. Several times I questioned my mental map of things to do, thinking about those locked doors or unpushed buttons that I'd promised to return to, then somehow managing to progress to the next section unable to return, wondering if I had maybe cheated the game. Perhaps this is an intentional design choice, I feel that the multiple paths and player choice elements could've been made clearer to avoid anxiety about fully exploring before moving on. Some kind of labelling/inventory system for keys/doors might've helped in that regard.\n\nVoice acting is cheesily bad but thankfully sparse, and I did encounter some bugs (graphical glitches, had to reload saves to progress, achievements only earned if online in Steam).\n\nWishing the best success for Loiste Interactive and looking forward to Part 2 and any future projects.", "timestamp_created": 1453317192, "timestamp_updated": 1453317192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20646110": {"recommendationid": "20646110", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964236059", "num_games_owned": 805, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505201677}, "language": "english", "review": "INFRA is possibly the best puzzle/exploration game I've played-and I've played them all.

INFRA is on par with some of the greats in terms of atmosphere, like S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Metro, Half-Life, Bioshock, old school Silent Hill, or even the more recent Soma. The world is beautifully designed. The detail is incredible, and every building/area seems to be meticulously designed and unique in it's own way. Visually, the game is quite appealing, and impressive for a game running on Source. The environment strikes a nice balance; it is realistic and believable, yet remains imaginative throughout the story. \n\nReally, if you took away the poor voice acting and sometimes poorly written notes, you would be left with a game that doesn't look or feel Indie.\n\nMy main complaint is that it is far too short and ended quite abruptly, though the price reflects that. I very much look forward to the second part. \n\nEdit: Nearly 2 years later, and I finally got around to playing all three parts consecutively. It was hard to tell where the story was going to go after part 1, but I love the direction it went. \n\nI still adore the meticulous & realstic detail of the levels, with the final level really taking the cake. Overall, it's a game unlike no other, and while I understand it isn't for everybody, I wish it would get more credit.

Currently I don't know if it's worth $15, but the developers are going to add further parts for no cost to those who own it, so it will be worth it in time.\n\nPlot: The story feels a bit forced, but it is interesting, and fits very well with the concept of the game. It has a lot of potential for advancement, and is left on a cliffhanger that does work. I'm looking forward to the continuation with the updates.\n\nPuzzles: The puzzles are Portal-style; built into the level, completing them is the only way to get through. There's a mix of physics puzzles, jumping puzzles, and others that incorporate many different concepts and features into them. Some are easy, some are very hard, but I was able to get through all of them except one without having to look on the discussion forums, and in that case, it was because the instructions were poorly worded. Here's a tip; remember to always look at EVERYTHING in the area. There are a few puzzles that I feel are unnecessarily hard, and one or two instances where the instructions themselves are unclear (water treatment plant...) but you can work past them, and the developers are very active on the forums answering questions if it comes to that.\n\nGraphics: The game is gorgeous. There are some incredible locations, both outdoors and indoors. Some of the locations remind me of the coastal area in Half Life 2, but much more beautiful. So while the game produces plenty of great outdoor scenes, the indoor locations also do not fall to the tendency that games have to make their indoor locations boring and dark. The indoor locations feel varied but familiar, with new visuals every time.\n\nSounds: The sound design is pretty good, nothing to phone home about. There isn't much you can do with this kind of a game, but it feels atmospheric, which is about all is needed, I guess. Voice acting could use some work, particularly the main character, but it is far from game-breaking. The music is pretty average throughout, but there are a few points where [i]just[/i] the right piece starts playing at [i]just[/i] the right moment, creating a fantastic feeling.\n\nOverall, if you like puzzles, I would recommend this game. The first part of the story took me about 9.3 hours to complete, with a pretty average amount of struggling, so with the updates, there will be enough content to make it worth it. If you've always wanted to be able to explore infrastructure (like me), this will be a blast. I can't vouch for its accuracy, but it feels realistic, and that's pretty much all I care about.

I usually have no interest in these puzzle games but INFRA is an exeption as I've followed the development for many years. And I also love games using the Source engine so of course I had to give it a go. \n\nI don't want to bore you with a long review where I point out every single thing that I liked or disliked so I'll keep it short. I also hope one of the developers read this review as I think that I make some interesting points.\n\n[h1]So what is INFRA?[/h1]\nINFRA is a game based around puzzle solving and exploration. It's based in modern times but you spend the majority of your time in abandoned buildings/areas. You encounter some puzzles along the way that you have to solve. Some are easy, some.. not so much. \n\n\n[h1]The good[/h1]\nThe level design is absolutely amazing. To see how much they managed to squeeze out of the good old Source engine is beyond what I could have imagined.\nThere's an interesting story to it which encourages you to progress and explore further.\nThere's a good amount of puzzles to keep you occupied throughout the game.\nAnd then there's multiple approaches to pretty much everything.\nThe developers are showing great interest in the people who are playing it and are helping them out here on Steam!\n\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\nI'd like to mention first of all that I got stuck twice in my first playthrough due to crashes and bugs. Most of this has already been fixed though. \nThe game is confusing at times. There's not much guidance for what you're doing so you keep asking yourself if this is the right thing. There are notes throughout the game that can help you solve the puzzles but you're not guaranteed to find them due to the multiple approaches. \nThe multiple approaches makes you wonder if you've missed something. Would I have found a key to this door if I had gone the other way? Am I even supposed to go this way? \nThe voice acting is not great. I don't mind the accent, it just gets annoying at times, especially the player's voice. He keeps pointing out the obvious. \"Somebody should fix this\",\"I'm pretty sure that's not meant to be like that\", \"A pack of spare batteries for the flashlight\", \"A pack of spare batteries for the camera\", \"I should have brought my other boots\",\"Fascinating\", \"Interesting\", and so on. You really don't need to point out the obvious, after all, I did make you pick up those batteries. \n\nWhy not use the player's voice to help out the player? Something like \"I wonder if I could get up there\" or \"Maybe if I can find a way to smash this\". There's a bit of this towards the end of the game but I really would have liked it earlier on. (And it certainly could have helped me) I don't want it to give it away but maybe if you can tell that the player is struggling, help them out?\n\nAll in all, a very solid game and I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a bit of puzzle solving and/or exploration! If you want to avoid getting stuck because of bugs, wait a few weeks before buying and then I'm sure they've been fixed.\n\nAnd a shoutout to one of the developers, Oskutin, for helping me out!

After the first level, voice acting is scarce and there's no hideous characters models to look at, only the amazing environments (look at those screenshots!).\nIf you like exploring atmospheric worlds and solve clever and logical puzzles don't even think twice. Buy it.\n\nTHE DREADED \"VALUE\" QUESTION:\n\nIt's a known fact that most indie games nowadays don't offer much in terms of length and sometimes ask a hefty price. INFRA is the exact opposite. The game costs just 15\u20ac and the first part alone can last you over 10 hours. The second part is coming later this year and it'll be FREE if you already own part 1.

As a structural analyst, you venture deep into the infrastructure of a city, gradually making your way through various factories, tunnels and facilities. Traversal problems are the main meat of the game - You need to figure out, repair and operate decrepit machinery to progress, pushing and turning dozens of buttons and valves.\n\nSome of the contraptions are rather complex, and combined with the fact that the levels in the game can get quite expansive, patience and perception are required. Be prepared to run around in circles every once in a while, since the game isn't in the habit of holding your hand at all.\n\nOther than your wits, nothing much else is required. There's absolutely no shooting or enemies of any kind, but you can easily die to a multitude of enrivonmental hazards. There are some sections that require precision jumping and swift actions, but they are relatively far and between. For the most part, you can take as long as you want to explore.\n\nSome of the industrial levels are quite good-looking especially considering that the game is running on Source, but Infra definitely doesn't put its best foot forward and the game begins by bombarding the player with some extremely dubious character models and seriously weak voice acting. Fortunately these are the only attempts at human interaction you'll have to endure during the playthrough, and things quickly get into the groove once you're alone in the rural areas.\n\nI was pleasanly suprised by the length of the game and the toughness of the puzzles - Infra took me nearly ten hours, which is a lot considering the low price of the game. You'll have to look past a lot of rough edges though; The game crashed on multiple occasions, and I even had to momentarily swap into windowed mode to get past a particularly nasty level-loading crash. More than that, there are a few map glitches that forced me to revert to a previous checkpoint because I got hopelessly stuck. Oh, and the achievements seem to work very sporadically.\n\nAnyhow, despite of its shortcomings, I enjoyed my time with Infra a lot. The environments of the game tell a way better story than the various memos sprinkled around, and there's a promise of Part Two coming in the future.

It takes wondrous care in it's level design and mechanics that topple many of the other games out there. It scares you with every day things, nothing supernatural except you own imagination. Even though I do recomend this to anyone with any interest in puzzle, exploration, story or even real-life urban exploring there are a few major problems that this game have that are purely to do with immersiveness, user learning and user preferences.\n\nFirst off, there is no options menu in-game. You can save, load and all that but no options to find keybindings, change mouse sensitivity, or any of the normal stuff. This is really quite irritating especially when there is no information given during the game as to what buttons to press for the flashlight and camera. That said, there is a pop up telling you to press R for switching batteries when you have to. This needs to be implemented for when you get the devices. tutorials are important, especially without an in-game keybindings screen.\n\nSecondly, it is very annoying to me when I find this many grammatical and spelling errors everywhere in the game. In a discoverable office early on there are some logs that are written with many spelling mistakes and general sloppiness like \"close of bankcrupty\" and \"waiting receiving the funds\". These errors really take away from the immersiveness of this lovely game for me. Not saying that these errors can't be good if done right, but there are just so many and the game offers no lore-friendly explanation for them. \n\nFinally, the voice acting is really quite bad in some areas, with much of the scripting following the errors in the writing. I actually feel like I am in The Room (movie) with everything combined. Something I think also ties in with this is when you talk to the office workers at the beginning. They have voices, but no animations. \n\nAll that in consideration, this is still an amazing game with even more amazing potential in the future. I am judging this at the same level I would judge games by EA and Valve, which is saying a heck of a lot for an indie title. If you read all this and are still considering whether or not to buy the game, do it. The gameplay is unique in so many ways it just doesn't compare.

But it seems like the devs put their manhours to the wrong tasks. The levels look pretty but feel very unnatural (unless blocking pretty much every fire escape door and denying access to all non-important doors is some sort of inside joke). The puzzles range from \"too easy/obvious\" in the form of \"get this item and put it here\" and simple \"read the code on this paper and then switch the right switch\" where the code and the switch are always directly next to each other to almost impossible to figure out parts of the game... more often than not you are supposed to pick up or pay attention to things before you see the actual puzzle. Exploration in this game isnt rewarded. I was constantly running low on batteries especially in the mid section of the game since even when exploring you wouldn't find any supplies. Exploring, well the parts that you could explore, lead to nothing and often you just ended up at places you were before. You keep picking up keys (they all look the same) without knowing what they are for.\n\nThe only cool thing that I discovered were a hand full of easter eggs (smaller stuff) and a bunch of codes that seemed important [SPOILER] like the code on the sheet over the corpse, although that one wasnt really \"hidden\" at all [/SPOILER] but even that part didnt save the game. There are better Indie games out there that look better and have a more solid story plus better gameplay. If youre interested in this game, you definitely want to check out The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, as it has a somewhat similar setting but is a better game all around for the same price.

There are no guns here, but there are still bad guys and monsters. There are no soldiers, spies or saboteurs, but there is a battle taking place. There are no jump scares, creeping horrors, or panicked flights from hordes of undead, but Infra can still scare, unnerve, and frighten you. Just not in the ways that you would expect.\n\nYou take the role of Mark Siltanen an industrial engineer from a firm who has just taken over the maintenance contract for the city of Stahlberg, and you are about to have the bad day to end all others, and maybe everybody else's day toboot.\n\nYou could use the words 'Walking Simulator' to describe Infra, but that definition barely scratches the surface of what's going on here. You could say that Infra is a puzzle game, but you'd only be talking about the tip of the iceberg. You could say that Infra is a job simulator, but you'd still be missing the real point of what is going on.\n\nYes, Infra is an Indie Game, and a bit of a klunky one at times. With a smattering of wooden character sprites and voice acting recorded on what sounds like half a dozen different setups that needs better post production. But that's not why you should buy it. The chewy chocolate-fudge centre of this game may take some of us a little while to get to, but when we do, it should give everyone pause.\n\nIf you've ever worked in one of those big, Star-Wars-scale industrial environments where a moment's inattention in the wrong place can end your life without so much as slowing down the machinery that just turned you into paste then Infra won't take long to get under your skin. The cracks in the walls, the leaky pipes and barely functional equipment. . . If you've ever worked in heavy industry and had to find a new workaround to each successive problem, and/or deal with OHS and get management to take things like this seriously, then the reaction will be instinctive. Like me you'll be thinking about all the dominoes that could be toppled by that half-flooded generator room or tainted water pipe. I realised that the game had me completely immersed when I found myself backtracking time and again to keep turning off the generators in said half-flooded room only to find out I wasn't yet past the point where I needed to have them running.\n\nAt its brilliantly mundane heart, Infra is an interactive cautionary tale, and one that hits close to home for all of us. All around us we are surrounded by tecnologies and systems that we take for granted and that is the spot where Infra builds the edifice of tension that makes up the game's core. Because despite the cinematic license with which Infra's story is presented, the Bad guys and monsters are entirely human, perfectly possible. The horrific scenarios that play out have happened in our world before and they are doing so right now, even as we sit here unaware of their unravelling beneath our feet. Perhaps what is more horrifying is that it doesn't take corporate malfesance and corruption on a grand scale for those little scenarios to play out time and again in the real world. All it takes is a moment's distraction for one person at one step along the long process of getting water from the city dam to your kitchen sink.\n\nGames like Infra should be made, they NEED to be made, and in greater numbers (and yes a little extra polish would be nice too), about things other than psychotically emotionless Space Marines turning the seemingly endless ranks of disposable mooks into hamburger (or some minor variation thereof). Because if Infra can give you pause the next time you take a ride on the subway, the next time you flick a light switch, or turn on a tap, then it has succeeded in a way that few other games can, because you don't have to suspend your disbelief very far at all for Infra to work its magic.", "timestamp_created": 1452942493, "timestamp_updated": 1452942493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 392, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890619", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20555669": {"recommendationid": "20555669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027102805", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507097608}, "language": "english", "review": "INFRA is a game that I first saw on Greenlight about a year ago. I was getting worried with the time it was taking to deliver BUT now that I have seen what they delivered I am blown away. The puzzles are great. They almost reming me of Myst in some regards. And the enviroments are amazing. I wasn't even aware the Source Engine could look this good and run so well. There are a few bugs at the time of this review (launch day) but I have confidence that they will be quickly attended to. The price of 14.99 USD is a very fair asking price for this game.  If you decide to purchase make sure you spend time to explore each area to it's fullest. There are little goodies hidden all around the map.  The subject of the game really is interesting. I found myself wondering about what sort of underground cities are beneath the city I live in and how much effort it must take to keep it running. When walking around INFRA I feel less like I am walking around river controls and steel mills and more like I am walking through an ancient tomb that has become overgrown and has started to decay. I can't wait to see what else these developers have in store for us.\n\nEDIT: This game has no real horror elements. It is more of a puzzle game. That being said  there were several points where I had a chill run down my spine or a feeling that something was not right was felt mostly due to walking through the decaying areas alone with nothing but the sound of wind and the structure creaking around me.

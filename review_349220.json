First thing that i met in this game was a hacker. HACKERS ARE EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!! i try to farm flower, grass and tree but hacker come take my crops and i cant progress so i must restart but this game is good because it has very good graphics and it is chill to play and talk with friends while playing and this is good because of that even if there is cheater in this game on every corner and front of the game.....I will keep on playing but i recommend you to fix the hacker ifnestation to attract more players to your game, if hacker is out, more people in. It is easy 1+1 maths so today i learned that this game has good graphic and crops and management, but ahcker destroy this game when i am a simple farmer to get money for upgrades and maybe i can afford the cat on roof. \nAnd now to the PVP part of the game.\nthis game has a pvp part where you fend of other hackers trying to attack your farm and crops byt steal and thief the crops you farm and now i tell you one thing: i owned one hacker and he dropped the crop back to me and i could use that crop to progress further. Pvp is fine but still there is hacker problem here as well.\nSummary is that this game is strong in graphics, crops, farm, money, management and of course you can boss and kill and feed animals till they die buy the food you feed them from crops and you sue the spirit to do slave labour for you. It may be a suble racist thing in here, but i will not talk much about that. SO overall i recommend this game if you like graphics and management, but i need to say this one mroe time: this game has a BIG, and i wrote BIG with capital letters because itis very BIG problem with hackers. If hackers will get vacbanned like in csgo, this game is perfect and perhaps even the bst gmae on my list. \n\nBefore i close this review totally, i jsut need to add that i sold my AK-FIRE SERPENT in order to afford it. The price is a little bit steep, but it's fine. It's totally worth it if you look away from hacker problem.\nThank you for reading.\n\nRegards,\n\nDaggerhill.", "timestamp_created": 1509916436, "timestamp_updated": 1509916436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.285953", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36270600": {"recommendationid": "36270600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142428056", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511742273}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u88ab\u5361\u5728\u4e00\u5173\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u60f3\u518d\u53bb\u770b\u653b\u7565\u7684\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u540c\u5b66\u8bc4\u8bba\u6211\u73a9\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u90fd\u4e0e\u4f17\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5403\u9e21\u5c0f\u961f\u7684\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e4b\u4e0b\u73a9\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d39\u65f6\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8868\u793a\u538b\u529b\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u5165\u624b\u597d\u7684\u663e\u5361\u540e\u51c6\u5907\u52a0\u5165\u5403\u9e21\u5c0f\u961f\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u6210\u4e3a\u7279\u5de5\u7684\u513f\u65f6\u5e7b\u60f3\u7834\u706d\u4e86\uff0c\u5f53\u7279\u5de5\u6709\u70b9\u9ebb\u70e6\uff0c\u770b\u5c01\u4fe1\u8fd8\u8981\u89e3\u4e2a\u8c1c\u624d\u884c\uff0c\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ec4\u6570\u5b57\u91cc\u9762\u4e00\u5b9a\u8574\u542b\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u5f85\u6211\u67e5\u67e5\u770b\uff0c73 32 107 110 111 119 32 121 111 117 32 119 105 108 108 32 99 111 109 101 32 104 101 114 101", "timestamp_created": 1509804159, "timestamp_updated": 1509804159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36191478": {"recommendationid": "36191478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066444318", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4498, "last_played": 1515662476}, "language": "english", "review": "I am now part of the illuminati.

Google is your friend and if you know how to use it, you also know how to isolate results in only the language you need. I'm not a magus that knows every little medicla term or knows 100% of everything. I'm a human that knows how to search on Google for my answers.\n\nThis said, I also want to address the issue of the lag: I've played a lot of games that run on Unity - while most of them were laggy, the fact that TBW utilizes the interface just to give you a small debrief of the mission in form of a video, an overview of how you're doing and what you have unlocked and a handy dandy chat to communicate with more seasoned players for help, helps a lot to keep the lag under control. I've never had any problem and I still don't suffer any of them to date.\n\nThe Immersion is absolutely incredible and, if I only lived much closer to the developers' zone, I would've definitely signed up for a more [i]immediate[/i] involvement with the game's mechanics.

At over 52 hours in game it is safe to say I enjoyed this.\n\nThe Black Watchmen is an awesome puzzle game.  Reading through the reviews I was wondering what I could add to from the positive or address from the negative because I absolutely love this game.  It certainly takes a page from the online games Godtower and notpr0n and if you are a fan of either of those then this is the game for you.\n\nYes, there is a level you can't skip and you have to wait until the office is closed and this did affect me, seeing as I had a time difference to deal with, too but the game is based in reality and you are pretty much role playing an intelligence agent.  So if you can deal with this for ONE level out of the lot then you will be just grand.\n\nSo, should you buy this game?\n\nYES, if you:\n\n- Enjoy using your intelligence to look for lateral solutions to puzzles \n- Are prepared to spend a day or two not advancing in the game at all and basically just hunting for a break in your current level\n- If you enjoy reading and learning new things\n- Can understand that some solutions have multiple solutions and whilst the one that you found might not make any sense, don't get angry because you probably went the long way around to get there\n- Are looking for that whoosh of euphoria when you solve insanely hard puzzles\n\nNO, if you:\n\n- Are incapable of the above\n- Dislike puzzles\n- Lack patience\n- Need 'a game' (Black Watchmen is barely more than a UI and you will spend a large amount of time on Google and other webpages rather than in the actual game)\n- If you can't avoid or help yourself from just looking up the walkthrough for every puzzle\n\nHere are some other things that I would like to add.\n\n1.  When you push the button to take you online, it is annoying to be taken directly to the Black Watchmen Forum page rather than say, Google.  An option to set your own homepage from that button would be nice.\n\n2.  Bear in mind this is largely a community game and you (and I) were very late to this party.  The forums have all the answers for the game in one neat and tidy thread. If you are buying this game in 2017 or later, my advice would be to get a friend to buy it as well and play it together and work as a team to get the solutions.  Stay off the forums and youtube walkthroughs.  \n\nEdit:  A friend and I made a podcast about this game.  SPOILER ALERT!  If you haven't played it yet then stay away.  If you have finished it or just don't care then go here....leave a comment if you liked the review or hated it.  \n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-31623090/episode-1-filling-the-gaps-the-black-watchmen", "timestamp_created": 1509091377, "timestamp_updated": 1515340507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696340", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35985879": {"recommendationid": "35985879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254796497", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513377530}, "language": "german", "review": "an AMAZING game!", "timestamp_created": 1508929512, "timestamp_updated": 1508929512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35890887": {"recommendationid": "35890887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413884135", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514715197}, "language": "english", "review": "First impression of this game before purchase - Oh my, it will be creepy. You know, it's love-craftian universe, and I am a typical woman who is afraid of creepy stuff XD But oh boy! Curiousity kills a cat, meow! Afterall I love solving mysteries. Worse case scenario would be not switching off lights at night, right? \n\nSo now I am 5 hours into the game - and still able to switch off lights at night, hooray! The trailer sounds creepy, but I guess it's not that creepy. WOW, I must say this is an A-Grade mystery solving game. \n\n[b]IT IS FOR YOU[/b]\n- If you like real images, real graphics\n- If you are not lazy to google and do research \n- If you are NOT looking for a short game. I think to fully enjoy the game you need to spend maybe at least an 1 hour to play a few parts. \n- If you have 2-3 monitors at home, helps A LOT with googling for facts.  \n- If you like mystery games. \n\n[b]IT IS NOT FOR YOU[/b] \n- If you think this is the typical point and click mystery solving game.\n- If you are really super super timid. *Hug your pillow*\n- If you are still a little kid (I think it requires critical thinking skills, you need to be at least able to think logically, lol) \n- If you have bad internet connection at home (because you have to load small videos, etc)\n\nI really enjoy this game and will continue to play soon.

It's a way of life.\n\nJokes aside, though, it's a fun puzzle game that takes immersion to the next level. Rather than having a main character following a story with cutscenes, the developers chose websites as their medium. YOU'RE the main character and the moment you start playing the game, the world around you becomes the in-game universe.\n\nThe game is simple: they give you a task and you figure out a solution to complete that task. That means opening up Google, facebook; heck I used Microsoft Paint to decode a cipher. The 'puzzle' aspect is being able to meaningfully jump from one website to the next without going for 'Red Herrings' (look it up in the dictionary). In the later levels this becomes very challenging for one person. It will take a literal team of players of different skill sets to complete the hardest puzzles.\n\nWhat is the game about? Well, this is an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) where they will take real world scenarios and have you solve puzzles to advance your career as a private security contractor. \n\nWhat sets this game apart from every other game, puzzle or otherwise is that many of its NPC interactions can take place in the real world. This means NPC's are actual people. Missions take place in your hometown. If you agree to their disclosure, they will send men after you in the real world (no joke). Keep in mind, though, this only happens when you sign the agreement, pay the fee and you're in a location where they can pull it off. If you're the average player like myself, you probably take more pleasure in watching/helping remotely. \n\nYou're going to have to pinch yourself hard to get out of the game. Really. It will distort your reality and ruin you from the inside. Where do you think I'm typing this review from? The comfort of my own home? Pah! I'm currently locked up for espionage and high treason.\n\nThe game gets a 10/10. One of the greatest puzzle games of our time.

Took me about 12 hours for the 25 missions (Bonus missions not yet unlocked, bonus information will be my next step)\nThe \"The Black Watchmen is not like any other game on steam\" is justified. It is like a pen&paper RPG come reality with you as a character. \nThe first missions are only tutorial missions, so you don't get immersed into the world of TBW. But then it gets started. With every mission, every puzzle you solve, you get deeper into the occult. You learn stuff about medicine and other things, you never thought you'd need or want to know. Sometimes the puzzles can give you quite a headache. There are some hints in TBW forums that might or might not help you. In some puzzles they didn't help me at all and so I found my own way. And that's what the game is about: find your own way. Even though some ppl have problems with some answers (they want one answer and only one sometimes) I never had that problem. Mostly it's just the first name or so you come up with. Sometimes you need to think rather less than too much.\n\nThe voice acting and the material you get is awesome. You get pictures, text documents, shrederred documents, blurred or partly destroyed pictures, voice recordings (even voice editing is required at some point), and even non-english language. Be it some demonic language or french, well might as well be the same. \n\nYou won't have it all ez pz, but all puzzles are solvable. Sometimes you just need to let it rest for some time and then look at the clues and your notes again, and then with a snap you realize how you overlooked an important thing. If you are into puzzles and want to immerse into such a darker image of our world, here ya go.

C'est pourquoi je vais d'abord vous pr\u00e9senter ce qui pourrait vous faire fuir avant de m'int\u00e9resser un peu plus \u00e0 The Black Watchmen !\n\nSachez d\u00e9j\u00e0 que vous avez int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 avoir un solide niveau en anglais. VRAIMENT. Pas tant au niveau de l'interface du jeu en elle-m\u00eame et la pr\u00e9sentation des missions, qui sont compr\u00e9hensibles. Mais plut\u00f4t pour affronter les centaines d'obscurs fichiers PDF, th\u00e8ses, vieux rapports, extraits de grimoires, etc... qui pourraient s'av\u00e9rer indispensables \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de vos objectifs.\n\nD'autre part, c'est un jeu o\u00f9 vous (et \u00e9ventuellement les autres joueurs) \u00eates le/la principal-e responsable de votre plaisir. Je ne parle pas de masturbation hein, je dis juste que si vous n'avez pas envie de vous prendre pour un analyste/agent secret qui d\u00e9bute, ce n'est m\u00eame pas la peine de jouer. C'est vous qui allez fouiner pendant des heures les recoins d'internet pour r\u00e9soudre des puzzles esot\u00e9riques sur des feuilles de papier qui joncheront le sol de votre pi\u00e8ce, alors vous avez int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 jouer le jeu ! Si vous voulez rester vous m\u00eame, ou vous am\u00e9liorer, ou retourner en enfance, je ne sais pas... ne jouez pas \u00e0 ce jeu. Si vous voulez devenir un-e Black Watch(wo)men, jouez-y. Vous comprenez o\u00f9 je veux en venir ? :D\n\nTBW demande une implication intellectuelle, temporelle et \u00e9motionnelle. SI vous ne pouvez pas (pas assez de \"fen\u00eatre de temps de jeu\" pour cause de boulot, famille, etc) ou n'avez pas envie de le faire, passez votre chemin.\n\nBon si vous \u00eates encore l\u00e0, vous vous demandez peut-\u00eatre ce qu'il y a de positif dans mon \u00e9valuation... j'y viens !\n\nPlut\u00f4t que de vous faire une fiche technique du jeu, je vais vous livrer deux ou trois anecdotes sur le th\u00e8me\n\"Depuis que je joue \u00e0 TBW\" :\n\n- On peut trouver dans ma liste de marque-pages des choses aussi diverses que : le repertoire des cabines t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques aux Etats-Unis ; les d\u00e9tails de fabrication et de crackage des cartes \u00e0 code ; un monitoring mondial des homicides ; le dictionnaire \u00e9nochien ; des donn\u00e9es d'observation m\u00e9t\u00e9o sur la foudre ; des outils de d\u00e9cryptage ; une liste de poisons et de leurs antidotes ; la carte des cables sous-marin ; la liste des symb\u00f4les occultes.\n\nCa a quand m\u00eame plus de gueule que Facebook, Lemonde et Youtube non ?\n\n- Tous mes comptes divers et vari\u00e9s sont s\u00e9curis\u00e9s avec des mots de passe comprenant 256 caract\u00e8res, le tout tr\u00e8s facilement et sans prise de t\u00eate, alors que je pensais que ce serait le contraire. J'ai appris \u00e0 crypter mes fichiers sur mon ordinateur, facilement \u00e9galement.\n\n- Je lance chaque nouvelle mission en sachant pertinement que je vais ruminer, rager, pleurer, d\u00e9chirer, gribouiller, raturer, hurler, fracasser (etc, etc...) devant des puzzles a priori insolubles, mais que par moi m\u00eame ou grace \u00e0 l'aide d'autres agents je triompherai de l'\u00e9nigme et me sentirais ULTRA BADASS. J'insiste sur ce point : rarement dans un jeu vid\u00e9o j'ai pu ressentir \u00e0 quel point la r\u00e9ussite dans une mission est quelque chose de gratifiant.\n\nJe suis navr\u00e9 pour celles et ceux qui attendaient une \u00e9valuation \"type\", mais justement, TBW n'est pas un jeu \"type\". Quoique presque confidentiel, il est n\u00e9anmoins connect\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres jeux vid\u00e9o (Perfect World, d'autres titres d'Alice & Smith \u00e9galement) d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre, ce qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 int\u00e9ressant en soi. La communaut\u00e9 autour du jeu est petite, mais soud\u00e9e est extr\u00eamement r\u00e9active en cas de gal\u00e8re d'un agent. N'esp\u00e9rez pas trop qu'on vous l\u00e2che la r\u00e9ponse en vous caressant le tralala pour autant hein, nous ne sommes que quelques centaines \u00e0 avoir triomph\u00e9 de toutes les emb\u00fbches... de toute mani\u00e8re, les adeptes de la facilit\u00e9 n'ont vraiment rien \u00e0 faire chez les Black Watchmen !\n\nChaque mission, chaque saison, chaque op\u00e9ration sp\u00e9ciale, chaque mission cr\u00e9\u00e9e par un-e joueur-se est connect\u00e9e \u00e0 un th\u00e8me plus ou moins \"confidentiel\", ce qui donne une atmosph\u00e8re tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8re au jeu et permet \u00e9galement - pour peu que l'on soit quelqu'un d'alerte de curieux - d'\u00e9tendre le champ de nos recherches et de connaissances, pour le plaisir de le faire.\n\nIl y a encore de nombreux petits \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9s et autres fonctionnalit\u00e9s, que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ne pas vous d\u00e9voiler. \"Je vous en ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 trop dit\". Quoiqu'il en soit, c'est \u00e7a passe ou \u00e7a casse : ou vous adorez et nous rejoignez au sein de la Division. Ou vous retournez \u00e0 votre vie ant\u00e9rieure.

For everything The Black Watchmen does right - the ciphers, the research, the obscene amount of notes you feel like taking for every mission to track your thoughts - the game also has some pretty glaring flaws.\n\nThat flaw is being vague as hell.  I won't give any spoilers here, but some missions ask you for a specific thing and give you a clue that has NOTHING to so - seemingly so - with what you're after.  It's so abstract that it becomes impossible to even get your foot into the door of your solution.  It's like this: what is 2+2 if you have ten pancakes on the roof of a flying saucer.  Using this solution, plug it into the amount of times the sun spins around and calcuate how many pennies Jimmy has if five fish are swimming in a bowl.\n\nYou ARE given clues in some missions and some of the research and abstract thinking is good.  You'll probably have to reach out to forums to give you a little nudge in the right direction or find out what others did to get to their solution.  It sucks but that's what this game's curse is.  Sometimes their intel just isn't enough to get you started.  \n\nBeyond the vagueness of the game, it's not bad.

Well it's an arg (if you don't know what's an arg, it's basically a puzzle that uses external resources (ex : external sites, sound/video/image manipulation programs, documents about real events, etc etc) but to summarize let's call it a puzzle) basically let's call it a puzzle, as an arg i does it's job really well in the way that it introduces people who didn't play args before, and as a puzzle it does it's job really well, it makes you feel dumb sometimes but none of the puzzles are impossible but that's nothing compared to when you're in a new season, i still didn't had the chance to experience it but as i understand the puzzles basically get harder to force you to get with the community and try to resolve it, and oh my god the holy community, i'll tell you all about the community to you in the \"secondly\" part. And there's live events, i didn't had the chance to experience it either but i seen recordings, again they try to make you communicate with the community (which is a good thing, again i'll explain why in the secondly part) and at this point they are creating this awesome brain with people instead of neurons in it which is really awesome, people are popping up everywhere with useful ideas, with all the competences of each member of this brain trying to resolve the puzzles one by one as quickly as possible and i just want to be at a live event. And as a cherry on the cake, there's this clearance thing which just adds a little immersion to the whole thing, you can receive phone calls, receive emails, receive mails or even be the star of a live event, it's so awesome (only happens during on going seasons). Secondly, how's the community ? I can't really answer this entire question since i wasn't there when there was an irc ingame, but i can answer for the time being which is on discord and on the forums (i don't go too often on the forums but from what i get the discord is a big resume of what it is but a lot less serious) So how to say, it's it's IT'S AWESOME, people are funny, helping and try to be as friendly as possible, they try to be open as possible to new members and they all have unique competences in their own domain that makes them all so smart, so honestly don't hesitate to pass on to say a little hello on the discord, you might end up having a really good time, and i'll be there to salute you too. And even the developpers are part of the community and are always kinda active (except anashel but he's so busy, at this point we're lucky he's here when he is to respond to our questions), you have these shitty big discord servers where there's a few people on the top and everybody is down there like pleb, this server is different, people are all on the same level, moderators are not the all seeing eyes that are almost never there no they're part of the community not the all seeing eyes of it. And people are always there to help, if it's about the game and it's puzzle or about problems about it. Thirdly (can we say that, \"thirdly\" ?), Is it worth it's price ? I will be short to answer this question, YES, YES IT IS, \n25 in-game missions\n65 puzzles to solve\n5 hidden missions (unlocked by obtaining \u201cpuzzle pieces\u201d or secret answers in-game)\nCommunity sandbox missions\nhow to say, ah yes, AT THIS POINT, IT'S A STEAL and the dlc to play the rest are so cheap compared to what they're worth soooooooo don't hesitate. TO CONCLUDE, Try it with the demo and if you love it THEN BUY IT, A&S (the developers) deserve your money, and then come visit us on the discord, i'll be waiting for all of you, even you timmy. \n\nAnd a last little side note to thank the devellopers for making this awesome game and for always looking after the community, they indirectly helped me put with some problems i had with myself that were making me be more and more miserable but since i discovered this game and the community i'm looking towards a more and more brilliant future, thanks you, all of you, even the community, i don't know how i've would have gone in the future if i didn't discover this game, so really thank you.\n\nP.S : sorry for the wall of text but to reference to someone on the discord : I apologize for the length of this letter. If I\u2019d had more time it would have been shorter. x)\n\n if you did really read all this way, thank you", "timestamp_created": 1498283912, "timestamp_updated": 1498283912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655770", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32700968": {"recommendationid": "32700968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084847327", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 418, "last_played": 1516427246}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game, it caught my attention instantly and I love it.", "timestamp_created": 1498257355, "timestamp_updated": 1498257355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32659546": {"recommendationid": "32659546", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978411127", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514144487}, "language": "english", "review": "The Black Watchmen is a sort of arg-style game with live missions and solo play components.

Each mystery is solved by scouring the web for a solution to a task, assisted by your favorite search engine and internet browser. As a member of The Black Watchmen, you must uncover various top secret investigations away from public scrutiny as you scour the internet in search of a solution to a lead given to you by the agency. The game is quite hard to do solo thanks to the large variety of skills and knowledge required to play, but many people on the TBW forums have supplied new agents with helpful hints that can bring their investigation to a close.\n\nThe developers allow you to choose your desired level of immersion; there are no days off for Black Watchmen agents! You start off on the basic Red Clearance level, which is nice and easy for casual players - when you aren't running the client, your experience ends. Upgrade to Orange Clearance by providing your phone number, and you may receive a voicemail, call or text from an important character with information you can share with the other agents working on the same case with you. Upgrade to Yellow by including your mailing address and you might receive important information in your mailbox. At Green Clearance you are required to undergo a medical examination and sign a waiver. If you're chosen by the other agents (and the game dev), your task would include traveling to select destinations and interacting with or avoiding NPCs as you perform an investigation with the help of the other agents. Black Clearance is the most immersive experience in the entire game, and likely involves serious roleplaying.\n\nThe game itself is fun on Red Clearance; it takes a bit of researching and wit, though. The game can be difficult at times, especially since the solution isn't always obvious to you at first. This game definitely isn't meant to be binged either, and I imagine the sense of reward from solving a puzzle would be much greater when a whole group works together to solve a puzzle they're all stumped on than it is working through all these puzzles alone or by researching other players' findings and reading their hints. Even so, this ARG is still quite a lot of fun, and twists many interesting narratives for people to follow.\n\nI tend to get frustrated easily if I can't find an answer to a puzzle immediately, but the clearance levels have locked my interest and the upcoming season has me excited for what's to come. If you aren't quite sure about this type of game, give the demo a shot. The game gets much harder past the training levels, but you'll also be doing cooler stuff like manipulating NPCs into giving you access codes or helping a squad place bugs in a medical clinic to eavesdrop important phone conversations.\n\nIf you like the mysterious nature of conspiracy theories but hate the destructive nature they tend to have, you'll love this game. If you want a unique mystery puzzle experience based on research, you'll like this game. If you liked roleplaying detective games as a kid, you'll love this game. If you wish you were James Bond, you.... might not. There's not much \"action\" unless you get to the much higher clearance levels, but those are honestly unlikely to happen to you and buying the game solely for the high clearance scenarios will leave you dissatisfied.\n\nOverall, this game comes highly recommended from me. The aesthetics of this game, the unrivaled sense of immersion, the active community and the gameplay all create a very enjoyably frustrating experience for me - much like a difficult Sudoku or Crossword puzzle.\n\nMUSIC: 6/10. It's FANTASTIC, but there isn't enough variety. The moody, downtempo soundtrack may end up inducing drowsiness by the end of your first Season.\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10. Co-operating with other players to solve puzzles grants you the opportunity to roleplay with many different people from around the world and create strong friendships based on the common interest of ARGs and the occult. Some investigation methods can be a bit finicky and purposely time consuming though, which might make some bingeplayers like myself a bit disappointed. [Live events have not been considered in this review as I've not participated in one yet.]\nVISUALS: 9/10. The aesthetic this game presents is second to none in its genre. The design toes the line between campy and immersive, but is definitely pleasant to look at either way.\n\nTOTAL: 9/10. The overall experience I've had this game has been overwhelmingly positive. I will update this review after the conclusion of the next Live Event.", "timestamp_created": 1493043946, "timestamp_updated": 1493043946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31324131": {"recommendationid": "31324131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078362972", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514165357}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said?

Even with how long you or I spend on the internet each day, the things that you find from lurking in the dark corners like this game makes you do is interesting, and to see the kind of things people believe in and write about is entertaining.\n\nThe Black Watchmen isn't just about researching however.

Sad because I have missed out on joining what will no doubt be a superb global effort, of thousands of players all staying up unreasonable hours, just because they are not quite able to understand just what that picture is supposed to represent, and why wings matter,\n\nThe game is literally centered around the real world.  You use a central tool to receive puzzles and enter answers, and through where clues and information are given out - but the rest is found 'out there', in the real world.  Professionally designed websites (that don't immediately stand out as obviously fake) are used, as well as authentic places around the world, are all used to give you that sense of PRESENCE that is sorely missing from other attempted ARGs.\n\nIt isn't without minor fault - the occasional typo, but really nothing that you wouldn't see in real websites I assure you!  \n\nI've yet to move up the agent rankings.  You start off as a Red agent, meaning world interaction is limited to just you initiating email based contact.  Later, you can optionally apply for other grades of agent interaction, from email only, to full on creepy - phonecalls in the middle of the night, strange letters in the post...  I am absolutely in for that, and will give the required info as soon as I am able!\n\nWhat I have yet to experience, and I cannot WAIT to do so, is the live events.  As you might expect, you collaborate with global agents via IRC, forums, the usual, in order to solve puzzles in real time.  Apparently, one agent is picked to experience this in a full-on 'reality show' - I know nothing about this other than what I've read, so I suggest you, dear reader, do the same.  I, sadly will never be 'picked' as I am not physically able, which is utterly sad, but nevertheless, I loook forward to the day I can help solve such events.\n\nBeing a puzzle game, based around the internet, you are inevitably going to come across spoilers.  However, in saying that, I have solved every single puzzle without 'bumping into' any obvious answers, which is nothing short of unbelievable.  There are solutions out there, in the exellent Blackwatch Forums, which should be visited daily.  The answers to particularly difficult puzzles can be found, but only after  you've worked your way though a lot of excellent spoiler hints.  This makes you feel like less of a cheater, and more as what you would have experienced had you been around at the time the community was solving it, just as you are now.  \n\nThe hints are very well done, asking YOU questions rather than just simply giving you the solution.  It makes you feel a lot better about seeking help, because you know you were not the only one a bit lost on how to continue - only to find the right track with just a smallest of nudges.  (There was one particularly nasty puzzle which I will not spoil, and I needed every clue they gave - and even then I STILL couldnt' immediately solve it - I really had to put the clues together).\n\nIn closing, you may initially buy The Black Watchmen, and feel like you didn't get a lot for you cash.  But, if you like puzzles, if you like something a little different from the normal, if you understand stressing over a number is fun, and solving a puzzle gives a certain amount of euphoria, you absolutely MUST buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1475486937, "timestamp_updated": 1475486937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25658820": {"recommendationid": "25658820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010787964", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488256155}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're considering buying, do yourself a favor & purchase.

Those of you who've played The Secret World or heard about it from others know the investigation missions were the real standout -- the kind of insane games artistry that could have (and should have) supported their own game and not a clunky MMO. Well that's what we have here. The Secret World's investigation mission team gives you a slightly spun-off world of high-tech and dark magical conspiracy to investigate. \n\nCrack ciphers, do real-world research, and use all sorts of real-world puzzle solving tools and methods to order nuclear contraband, investigate ancient secret societies, and stave off extinction-level events of paranormal origin. By and large, puzzles are ground in what makes *sense*. You need someone's password? You don't solve a matchstick puzzle. You phish their password with a real email! Need to place snipers for your strike team? Consult IRL maps outside the game application and find where you have sight lines. And you'll probably have to learn a bit about demonology, Chinese astrology, and nuclear reactors.\n\nThe Black Watchmen offer up some crazy mindbenders, and while most puzzles feel very fair, be prepared to give them some time.

Is it even a game? In the strictest sense, yes. But you may find it much more frustrating that some of the old hardcore 80s games that no one could get passed the 1st level.\n\nI won;t go into what this game is about, as there are a load of reviews that say what this is.\n\nIts not a game in the strictest terms, Its more of an intellectual excercise. A role playing game where you take on the role of an agent.\n\nSome missing are fun to do, others are down right ridiculous. For example, (possible spoiler alert) i just did a mission where it offered you a template to use, You have to research someone, fill in the blanks and then send an email to social engineer a way in. the issue is that if you were not 100% gramatically correct, you couldn;t get past it. And sending the same email over and over trying to get it right kinda breaks the immersion, as it simply wouldn;t work like that ITL. The rwecipient would have become a little suspicious.\n\nI'm finding more and more that i'm heavily relying on looking at spoilers in the forums trying to find out what on earth i'm supposed to be looking for this time..\n\nApparently the IRC and other help factors are still active, but i have never gotten a response on any of them.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a game that you can jump straight in, this is not for you. If you are looking for a game that is pick up and play, this game is not for you.\n\nIf you are looking for something that will challenge your intellectual and creative pants off., this game may well be for you.\n\nI strongly suggest trying the demo from their main website before buying the full game, But remember, if you find the demo hard, you won;t get very far in this game. The missions can be infuriating, sending you off with little idea what you are supposed to be looking for. and beyong the first few missions, the difficulty becomes greater exponentially.\n\nIf you want to try something new, give this a go. I got this so my wife and i could try and work together solving the missions. Sadly the UI was too small to have on the TV, so that idea went down the pan after a couple of missions.\n\nIs this a good game and would i recommend it? Thats a tough one, as it would be a different answer depending on whom i spoke to.\n\nThe idea is great, the missions leave a little a little to the imagination, and sometimes are truly baffling.\n\nI'm going to give this a thumbs up, purely that its a great concept.

They meet up with people and collect intel or other items to relay to the other agents to continue solving whatever puzzle there is at the moment. \n\nYou don't have to get super involved, the story missions are easily worth more than the price, but if you do get involved you will be warmly welcomed as we are always looking for more agents to help stop the summoning of mythological creatures by building paper boats and floating them in the pond for Dispatch.", "timestamp_created": 1462177069, "timestamp_updated": 1462177069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508060", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22383890": {"recommendationid": "22383890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064071782", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498583875}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0433\u0443\u0433\u043b\u0430.\n\u041d\u0435\u0442,\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430,\u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0451\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0447\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.\n\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c?\u0423 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u0442.\u043a. \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0443\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u044f\u0449\u0438\u043a, \u0442\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0441 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438.\u041d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u044f\u0449\u0438\u043a,\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b!\u0410 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439-\u0442\u043e \u043c\u044d\u0439\u043b.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1460497103, "timestamp_updated": 1460497103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22311126": {"recommendationid": "22311126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023671892", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452901011}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The main verdict:[/h1]\nTBW is billed as a spy game but the core experience is centered around googling Jeopardy facts.\n\n[h1]Extra Info:[/h1]\nSome of the community events are cool-- specifically the ones that encourage unique contributions from every player.

In that case, code-breaking knowledge, social media and social engineering skills will be your assets! Many training missions are provided for your preparation as well, and the players' community is very helpful if you are stuck on a single player mission.\n\nFurthermore, you can play with other agents using the game chat assets: you might even have the chance to actually go in field! Depending on your chosen clearance level in the agency, in Real Life you might be asked to analyse objects or document you receive by mail, or to go out in your town delivering documents or, in some cases, to meet actual NPCs, especially in the occasion of the game Live Events that involve collaboration of all TBW agents for a single mission that might go on for some days.\nTBW is a great game, I really think that it is worthwhile to give it a try.

I was a little reluctant to buy this game at first because I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a part of the ARG aspect of it. The great thing about TBW is that you don't have to do any ARG stuff if you don't want. Even the live missions can be completed without any of the extra stuff. However, now that I've realized how awesome the game is though, I've started to get into the ARG aspect of the game. \n\nBasically there are 5 levels of immersion. \n\nRed: The lowest level of immersion. The only thing required for red is an email.\n\nOrange: This level is a bit more immersive. You have to register your phone number and will sometimes get phone calls/voicemails for live missions.\n\nYellow: Yellow is the highest level conventionally available. To be a yellow agent you must submit your location and will receive mail and sometimes have to do things in your area. \n\nGreen: To be a green agent you must submit a full medical report and do a ton of real world stuff. Only 1 of 8 people are selected for green each season.\n\nBlack: Classified Info\n\nAs you can see, the game gives you a lot of different options to choose from.\n\nNow to the actual game. The game is very addicting and challenging enough to keep you wanting more. You investigate everything from illegal testing to cults to mutants to the apocalypse. The game does a great job of making you feel like you're somewhere you're not supposed to be. \n\nNot only is the game and immersion great, but the community is one of the most welcoming communities I've ever been a part of. You can go to the forums at forums.blackwatchmen.com and the IRC at  https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.blackwatchmen.com/division66\nThe vets will always be glad to help if you're stuck on a mission. \n\nAnyway, I love this game.

And what a game it is. \n\n>>AGENT: Ellis\n>>CLEARANCE: Yellow\n>>LIVE MISSIONS: 1\n\n>>START REVIEW:\n\nHave you ever looked into the history of games, and stumbled upon something called \" ilovebees.com \"?\n\nIt was part of a promotional campaign for Halo 2, that appeared for 2 seconds In one of its ads for E3 (or something like E3) that lead people to investigate details about the site, eventually finding coordinates to payphones around america, and a time for each payphone. \n\nEveryone appeared on time to each and every payphone on time, despite one of them being in the middle of a hurricaine at the time.\n\nThat, was one of the first ARG's, and is probably the most famous one to have existed.\n\nAn \"ARG\" is an \"Alternate Reality Game\". And ARG's usually involve investigating websites, history, places, and cryptology to gain details on a fictional story.\n\nBaisically Larping for the digital age.\n\nHowever, the difference between standard ARG's and The Black Watchmen, is that ARG's are normally used for promoting a product, and they usually end at some point. \n\nWhile the former is certainly the case (TBW is part of The Secret World MMORPG's lore), This game's selling point it that its missions don't go away after the ARG is over, but as far as I know (S1 Mission 16), these missions don't involve anything in the real world, and you don't need to go anywhere.\n\nIn Live missions on the other hand, you need to interact with the community via irc chats and their forum to solve specific events (e.g. Using google to Hunt down 5 german buisnessmen for sleeper agents to assasinate, because they know too much), and do tasks in the real world that're related to the event.\n\nHowever, you can also choose how involved you are with the game's world by choosing what clearance you want to be. \n\n>>RED CLEARANCE: Nothing irl will happen to you. You can play the game through the client and interact with the                                                 community, and that's about it.\n\n>>ORANGE CLEARANCE: You may get phone calls by providing your telephone number.\n\n>>YELLOW CLEARANCE: You may get phone calls and packages, and you may have to interact with actors playing a specific role.\n\n>>GREEN CLEARANCE: The most known amount you can get involved. You have to be voted for it, and supply a medical exam for this.

O que o diferencia de um ARG \u00e9 o fato de poder ser jogado sem a necessidade de ter acompanhado a hist\u00f3ria desde o primeiro dia assim como os ARGs tradicionais al\u00e9m de n\u00e3o ser restrito a campanhas pequenas.

Muito pelo contr\u00e1rio, o jogo apesar de possuir uma funcionalidade de multiplayer onde um jogador pede ajuda e outros (no m\u00e1ximo 3 pessoas) se juntam a ele para ajudar, \u00e9 um recurso pouco usado e ent\u00e3o o que realmente o torna um MMO \u00e9 a presen\u00e7a de uma vasta comunidade em [url=http://forums.blackwatchmen.com/index.php]f\u00f3runs[/url] e redes sociais em que os jogadores colaboram entre si para completar as miss\u00f5es de forma mais abrangente e n\u00e3o limitada a 4 pessoas como citado anteriormente.\n\n[h1]O jogo[/h1]\nChega de enrolar e vamos ao que interessa! Bem, o jogo funciona da seguinte maneira voc\u00ea recebe uma miss\u00e3o como \"identifique a empresa que realizou tal coisa\" (claro que n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma miss\u00e3o qualquer, h\u00e1 uma hist\u00f3ria que vai se desenvolvendo ao longo do game) e junto voc\u00ea recebe alguma informa\u00e7\u00e3o sendo assim voc\u00ea analisa a informa\u00e7\u00e3o e descobre a resposta.

Para entender melhor a din\u00e2mica do jogo recomendo que voc\u00ea baixe a demo, com ela voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 ter uma boa no\u00e7\u00e3o do que se trata o game.

It can get frustrating at times, but I love how difficult it can be - it makes it extra rewarding when you work out the problem!\n\nIt seemed a tad expensive when I first saw it, but it really appealed to me - and god-damn it's worth it! It really is worth the punt if it sounds like your kind of game. The user interface is simple, but clean and well polished.\n\nIt's a mix of puzzles, cipher/code breaking, hacking (things like email accounts) and researching (digging for information online). The story is great, if a little far-fetched/fantastical. I love how it ties in with the real world - I've even had real-life mail come through with a mission. The developers seem to be very dedicated to the game, adding many new events, live missions, and extra community sandbox missions.\n\nI've been off on so many tangents whilst researching to complete the missions. You can spend hours looking into the completely wrong thing, but you learn so much in the process. A lot of the story is based on medicine and occultism, and it is interesting to learn about these subjects. \n\nI really hope Season 2 is just as good and addictive. I think if all of us who enjoy the game can get the word out there, and get more players in the community, much bigger things will happen, including many more live events.\n\nThankyou, Alice & Smith, for creating this game!

The ARG itself includes puzzle solving, cryptography and online research.\nNo real life skills are needed however if you have experience with cryptography and if your Google game is on-par, you will enjoy the game. If you are unsure, you can always try downloading the demo before you decide whether you'd like to purchase the game.\n\nBear in mind at this point, you can buy the first season which includes a total of 25 missions as stated in other reviews. Currently sandbox missions are being added, which means user-submitted missions can be played. Once Season 2 is out, you can purchase the missions that come with it.\n\n[h1]Tell me more about this game[/h1]\nWhile you play the game, you will need to research topics and look online for answers. If you give up easily or don't feel like using wikis and Google is something you want to do, perhaps this game isn't for you and you should look elsewhere. Of course, if you're just having issues with the game you can always look for help in-game as well as in the Black Watchmen official IRC channel (linked in their official website) as well as in the official TBW forums - the community is great and spoiler-free! Furthermore, you can either collaborate with others who are on the same mission as you or seek attention from folks who have already passed the same.\n\n[h1]What about the staff?[/h1]\nFrom my brief, however positive experiences I can say the staff members are excellent, supportive and exceptionally well-mannered (I tip my digital hat off to Santiak and and Anashel, who were more than happy to provide me with all of the assistance and additional information I needed regarding the game).\n\n[h1]So is it worth it?[/h1]\nI have personally enjoyed the game so far. I'm currently on Mission 7, I've been blazing through missions so far and Mission 7 stumped me (Mike is to blame for this).\nShould you buy it? Yes, absolutely.

If you want to know what an ARG is, look at the first part: \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/riningear/recommended/349220\n\nTl;dr it's a puzzle game with some online-RP/LARP aspects. \n\nLet me make this clear right now: No. It\u2019s not for everyone. I really do respect that. Especially with the \u201cLive Missions\u201d aspect -- some of the stuff is time-sensitive, and it can be a lot to keep up with. That\u2019s part of an Alternate Reality Game like this. And not everyone wants to opt into receiving phone calls and/or packages. That\u2019s really fine, but I understand it can leave some players feeling just a bit underwhelmed by the content because of their lack of choice to do so. (If you opt out, you\u2019re not useless -- you can help those players figure out the puzzles. It really does help.) \n\nIf you want to get a feel for what's going on, download the demo, chat with the community in the IRC (there's a guide to that in the guide I linked), and poke around the game's forums to check out the gameplay that's happened. \n\nWith that said, if you do choose to play this game, there\u2019s a lot of considerations to be made. \n\nSomeone I\u2019m friends with at school saw me playing this and asked: \u201cWhy Steam?\u201d I think that\u2019s an important question. This is really the first major, recent attempt at a business model for an Alternate Reality Game. ARGs are usually constructed by third parties as promotions for existing or upcoming products -- Ingress, for example, has an Alternate-Reality platform to support its Augmented-Reality platform. In fact, The Black Watchmen is the direct product of The Secret World\u2019s ARG promotions, run by the same company. \n\nWith that said, as someone who joined in during the Kickstarter, reaching out to a broader audience and trying to pull people into a niche from the mainstream definitely is a challenge. I think that\u2019s where I saw a bit of a struggle with the devs, especially with \u201clive\u201d missions. It\u2019s easy to come from a background of appealing to more hardcore ARG players and later have issues trying to ease into something more palatable. \n\nThat\u2019s where we get into something that could have easily made or broken this game -- the devs. I literally cannot have enough praise for them. While many ARGs attempt not to break the fourth wall in helping its players, there\u2019s a mutual understanding between the devs and the players that this is a new exploration of the genre, a real attempt to make something bigger out of what\u2019s been a niche genre. So there\u2019s been a lot of conversation between the players and devs, and I really appreciate that, as both a player and an \u201cinvestor\u201d (I mean, it was only $25, but I didn\u2019t have much at the time\u2026). \n\nIt really showed in the final \u201clive\u201d mission. All the complaints and criticisms led up to a very involved, very well-thought-out kind of experience that roped in a lot of players. I had my own personal approach to it, but I had no time to manage everyone, and so they did it on their own to great success. \n\nI guess that\u2019s something else that\u2019s kept me in: the community. A strong backbone to an ARG is its community, and this community has always been really warm and welcoming to new players. I had to squeeze in back during a much more difficult mission during the Kickstarter, but now it\u2019s certainly opened up nicely. It\u2019s something you have to get involved in to believe. \n\nFor those of you wondering about the gameplay and puzzles\u2026 unless you\u2019re a savant of some kind, you definitely need help on some of these missions. But that\u2019s fine. In fact, the devs encourage it. And these missions are immersive and exciting, especially towards the end, and even if I didn\u2019t have live missions available, the $35 I would have spent (soon $15 for this season after the sale/month ends) would have likely been worth it to more intense puzzle fans. (Though in a market of $10 puzzle games\u2026 eh.) \n\nBut some of these puzzles that dig deep into the oddest parts of your knowledge and trivia, and your Google search skills. It\u2019s pretty cool. I definitely recommend at least working through the puzzles if you want to try \u201csomething else.\u201d Once you get to know that little noise effect from a successful answer, it'll be your best friend and the warmest feeling in the world. \n\nThe client\u2019s odd and bulky in some parts and we\u2019re trying to exchange feedback about it. A lot of it's left over from the beta versions. But you won't be using it that much anyway, given the game involved a lot of real-world research. \n\n[b]Summary:[b] Great puzzles, great people. Definitely invest if you want to be a part of something new and exciting. But it\u2019s not for everyone -- try the demo, check the IRC, get a feel for it. \n\nJust don\u2019t be rude if it isn\u2019t for you.

Like the slogan in the old ARG Majestic from EA: \"It plays [b]YOU[/b]\" Will clarify later.\n[*]The game on Steam is only 25% of the actual game. [b]It takes place in real-life, on websites created specifically for the game, and on social media.[/b]\n[/olist]\n[quote=Santiak]It's an astounding epiphany to realize just how helpful every thought process can be; overanalysis, stray thoughts, daydreaming, incoherent thought produced by sleep-deprivation, they all have a place of import in the TBW Agents toolbox.[/quote]\n\nBefore I start with anything, I would like to make this clear: This game will be one of the most unique experiences you will ever have, and it will [b]take over your life[/b] (I am saying this again for emphasis). They will make calls to you, they will send you packages, etc... If they need to contact you, they will, be it social media, e-mail, phone calls, you name it.\n\n[h1]BUT, BEFORE YOU BACK UP, SAYING \"EHH, THIS SEEMS SHADY\", KEEP THIS IN MIND:[/h1]\n\nYou absolutely [b]DO NOT[/b] have to give them any info. All these things are [u]completely optional[/u] and will not work against you if you decide to not do so. They only act to increase the immersion of the game. \n\nYou have [b]FOUR[/b] types of Agent Levels:\n[list]\n[*][b]RED[/b] is the lowest level of immersion. Interactions with red level agents will take place through the mission hub and by email.\n[*][b]ORANGE[/b] is more intense: voicemails, references to your area of operation - an aerial view of a nearby intersection, for instance - live streams from your hometown, and even live calls to, say, a phone booth at the end of your street.\n[*][b]YELLOW[/b] is the highest level of immersion conventionally available. It involves phone calls (which might come at any time of day), suspicious packages sent by mail, and real world interactions with NPCs.\n[*][b]GREEN[/b] is only open to the bravest agents. If you are selected to experience the deepest level of immersion, you must submit a full medical exam and sign a personal injury waiver - just in case any harm should come to you during your mission. Green level is not for the faint of heart, but if selected, you will remember the experience for the rest of your life.\n[/list]\n\nLet me actually clarify some more on the Green Agent level. This is not one for the faint of heart. This is THE most immersion you will get out of this game. Packages in the mail, phone calls, [b]a black van sitting outside your doorstep[/b], really anything! Make sure you have plenty of time if you are going to do this, though. It makes you a mission-imperative agent, and the success of missions will depend on your cooperation.\n[quote=Nikel][12:03:12] <@nikel> \"Isn't this somekind of illuminati witchcraft simulator?\"[/quote]\nThis game covers tons of different topics.

Instead of just adding a new mission to the client, they will send either a phone call to a select few agents, or an e-mail message (usually both). It is then up to the community to do the following:\n[list]\n[*]Figure out clues that are left in the small amount of info provided\n[*]Communicate effectively, figuring out solutions that would otherwise be impossible to do alone\n[*]Update Dispatch daily with their progress, providing them with information, pictures, or whatever they need at that time\n[*]Do things not just in-game, but in real life! [spoiler](For example, we all had to find an iron statue, and draw a sacred sigil, aiding in the fight against some crazy cultists)[/spoiler]\n[*]Meet up with other agents out in the field, or work together with non-player characters.\n[/list]\n\nWhat I listed here is only the tip of the iceberg here, folks. In Season 2, it is bound to get even more crazy and more immersive than ever before.\n\n[h1]SO, TO SUMMARIZE, WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?[/h1]\n[b]ABSOLUTELY![/b]\n\nThis is definitely one of the most unique gaming experiences I have ever been a part of, and I am glad to have this game in my library.\n\nDo you like games that constantly break the norms, and keep you on your toes?\n\nThen this game is for you.\n\nDo you love it when games constantly keep things fresh and interesting, without too much handholding on new missions?\n\nThen this game is for you.\n\nHere are some words from our IRC group:\n\n[quote=AgentFellowship]\"Got into TBW late in the season and I STILL had a blast.

You have to use your brain, social engineering and research. You learn many things on the way - it's extremely fun, I just planned a Mission Impossible infiltration yesterday.\n\n It's also very spooky since it includes secret organizations such as the Knights Templar or Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. You sometimes have to infiltrate and decode the things sent to them/by them - and it somehow manages to make you feel as if you were actually doing it - extremely realistic.\n\n If you do decide to buy the game, never look at the things you see in the game generally. They all often require thinking outside of the box and you have to brainstorm to find out what they mean. Tell me if you decide to play - I've finished the game all by myself in twelve hours. I'll help you out.\n\n If you buy it now until the end of the September, you'll get Season Two for free. I highly recommend it.\n\nEDIT1: The game doesn't end when you finish the missions it throws at you.

But i will try and keep this review un-biased as i can...\n\nI think first you need to understand something about this game. This is not just a puzzle game. I can imagine the developers had a hard time deciding what they would describe this as, genre wise. And how to market a game on Steam that is more than a computer game.\n\nBecause thats what you have here. Something that breaks down the fourth wall. Not break through, it gets rid of it. you step off the stage as a person, as you. Or at least you if you were in a different reality. Its a game that expects you to put some real work into it. By using real life resources such as search engines, and even websites generated for the game. real websites. Not websites shown by some in-game UI. A real website that you access through your browser of choice.\nThis game asks you bring skills to it or at least learn them.\nThere is even an aspect (which is optional. See below) that requires you to get out of your chair and head into the world. \n\nLets look at that last aspect for a moment. As it is probably the only one i can see being somewhat controversial. There is an aspect to this game that seeks to turn it into a LARP (Live Action Role-Play) like experience. Understand that it is optional. But it is where this becomes a hobby in itself rather than just a game.\nYou may, if you so wish, provide your phone/mobile/cell number. And if you wish to go one step further, your address. By doing this you are immersing yourself in the game world. You can receive phone calls giving you clues to new or existing mysteries. Or a package in the mail that holds some object that is part of a current mystery or is something new. All in the style of an X-files like conspiracy theory narrative.\n\nAnd this game does have a narrative of sorts. As i stated it is a little like a LARP. There is an on-going player driven story. What you and others as players do in the game world has consequence. It affects what happens next.\n\nCommunity is a very big part of this game. Whether you go the full immersion route or not. You all play as a group working together towards a common goal.         \n\nI feel this is a game that needs to be experienced to truly appreciate what it is. I just found a new hobby. And all I did was buy an Early Access game. I or anyone else can try and describe this until blue in the face. But I don\u2019t think it can be described. Words don\u2019t do this game justice. \n\nAnyway, this review is long enough.\n\nLook, the small answer to whether you should get this is simple:\nIf you read the description, watched the trailers, and found you were intrigued. I say give it a shot. At worst you will play through the first episode, get some entertainment through the puzzles and then move on. At best; you will be hooked. And you will participate in something you most likely have never experienced that is a work of genius. Something that, as a gamer, you will have fond memories of in the future. \n\nI hope to see you in-game.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1440637376, "timestamp_updated": 1440637376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 157, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17719516": {"recommendationid": "17719516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034306037", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462166498}, "language": "english", "review": "Really interesting concept.

This game is so incredibly unique that it is almost hard to write an accurate review on it. Basically, the \"game\" is a beautifully-minimal dashbord that makes you feel like you're a secret agent of a paramilitary group almost instantaneously. You are given a Briefing Video that explains the situation (in a very cryptic way), and afterwards you are given a mission. The mission is usually one sentence, then you are given a clue or two (some sort of evidence). It is up to you how you solve it. Use the internet (wikipedia, google translator, cryptography sites, etc.) or maybe go to the library. Whatever. Point is, it's completely up to you. If you're stumped or need help you can \"Ask a Senior Agent\" or use a \"Call for Help\". Community is key for this game. You are also given the opportunity to give the game your personal info (phone #, address). If you do this, an \"agent\" will call you and give you a mission or discuss something with you. You will recieve a package in the mail with evidence in it. This game is so different. It has been getting a lot of negative comments due to the price and the confusion of \"Season 1\". Basically, you are paying for to own the first season, and the money is going towards the development of the second season. It is very lengthy and completely worth every penny. The money is going towards paying the developers, the writers, the actors, put up all the fake websites, the artists that make all the evidence feel real and more. IT IS WORTH IT.

Unfortunately, The Black Watchmen disappoints.\n\nWith Majestic, the game drew you in with phone calls, faxes, and emails.  Fake websites were created and false news stories were inserted into reputable news sites like CNN via the client software.  The game was an immersive experience.  Characters in the game would frantically call you with secret messages or informing you that their cover had been breached.  This is how the game made all the research fun.\n\nThe Black Watchmen fails to engage.  I've now completed 11 missions and I am not sure if I am interested in playing further.  I'm definately not engaged and while there are some very friendly, helpful people in the forums the promise of the game requiring cooperative effort from the agents is only true because the missions are so badly written that it takes a community to figure out exactly what the game wants.\n\nTo me, this is a huge disappointment.  The story is unimmaginative and the gameplay is unengaging.  The community is for the most part unintersted in working together outside of the forum which would have made the game much more engaging.  I don't want to go into details about what the story is about for fear of spoiling it for someone but just think an episode of X-Files you've seen a dozen times.  As far as the gameplay, the only elements of the story that are woven into the gameplay are those directly related to a \"go here and do this\" sort of thing meaning there's never a joy of discovery.  So far, after 11 missions I've come accross 2 websites created for the game.  The interactions with the sites is stupid.  Hacking a site results in you magically getting just the file you need at that moment.\n\nI will still look forward to the next interesting ARG.

Therefore, I will no longer update this review as long as I hold that position.\nAlso; to make room for this update, I removed the \"Updated\" list at the end of this review.\n\n[h1]Content:[/h1]\nWhile the amount of content seems limited, it is worth making a huge note that the Content of any ARG is not found primarily in what you are presented with - in this case, what you see when you start the EXE file - it is the secrets you can find based on that initial presentation.\n\nCurrently there are, officially, 6 In-client missions available, in addition to 1 Live-event that's been concluded.\nThe unofficial tally, however, is much more than that; there are hidden solutions for in-client missions, logins on related webpages to uncover, files in archives to discover, and so on.\n\n[i]Edit:[/i] There are, in fact, still numerous ongoing investigations based on those first missions, that the community has either yet to solve, or have just recently solved - reports of the current missions being \"done and over with in a matter of hours\", mainly come from people who never thought to look deeper.\n\nTo name but a few of the yet unsolved puzzles as of the time of this edit, the community is still working on:\n\n- Finding all hidden solutions to 3 of the 6 current In-client missions.\n- Finding the password(s) for websites and communication channels found based on the in-client missions.\n- Finding hidden Archive entries.\n- Finding out how they relate to what we know.\n- Finding out what the meaning is behind the information found in the logins that have been cracked, so to speak, such as images, odd product information, and the like.\n- Solving the significance of a series of cryptic phonecalls to some agents; finding where and/or what they lead to.\n- Participating in the discussion of what our next step should be in preparation for the next Live-Event.\n- And tieing up loose ends left over from the Live-Event, such as an unsolved cipher that the community managed to by-pass.\n\n\nMost of these come from the In-Client missions, with a subset being left over from the Live-Event.\nWith the exception of the hidden mission solutions, none of these routes were \"indicated\" to the players; they were discovered by the players themselves. \n\nYou can see the potential amount of gametime if you compare the time of this update, with the time TBW was launched on Steam, and the amount of unsolved missions and loose ends.\n\n\n\n[h1]Live-Events[/h1]\nLive-Events are not \"show-and-tell\" via IRC; IRC is merely the place where most Agents brainstorm during Live Missions, while they work on the clues and puzzles that come up in the course of those Live Events. \nMeanwhile the \"official updates\" during those events can come in the shape of either emails, phonecalls, video or audio files discovered, dead- or live-drops intercepted by players in real-world locations, or Dispatch (Devs) or NPCs (Actors) joining IRC in order to directly interact with all Agents, to name but a few methods that have been used previously.\n\n[i]Edit:[/i] Some misconception exists surrounding the Live Events as being the \"Bread and butter\" content. \nWhile they certainly demand a lot of resources to do - actors and writers willing to interact with Agents at potentially any location in the world, and around the clock - missing them is by no means tantamount to missing out on the majority of the available content.\n\nAs hinted at above, there is [i]a lot more[/i] to be found in the In-Client content, and by no means is the majority of content found in the Live-Events, neither in terms of gametime nor money. Nor vice versa.\n\n\n[h1]Pricing:[/h1]\nFirst and foremost; it is not subscription based. It is Episodic. The distinction is important because;\n\n- \"Subscription\" carries with it a connotation that one pays a monthly fee, in return for access to a game, regardless of whether or not new content is added. (e.g. MMOs)\n- \"Episodic\", on the other hand, means one pays for new content, knowing roughly the expected amount of content to be gained. (e.g. Episodic Adventure Games)\n\n\n[i]Edit:[/i] As mentioned above, In-client and Live-events make up the content, so it is also pertinent to tackle both of these seperately, in terms of what costs they each involve:\n\n\n[u]Live-Events include[/u]:\n- Actors to pose as NPCs, be it at an arranged meeting spot, as people who call or otherwise contact players, and in some cases do so well outside regular hours for their timezone.\n- Writers who \"flow\" with the actions of the community, ready (and able) to adapt if the community decides something unexpected.\n- Arranging dead- or live-drops, which includes actors, items, and research.\n- Production of videos, audio, photos, and so on.\n- Production of clues, websites, logins, and so on and so forth.\n\n\n[u]In-Client content include[/u]\n- Production of video, audio, photos, and so on. Including hiring actors/voiceactors for recurring roles.\n- Production of missions, hidden missions, archive documents, hidden files, and so on, which must all include a coherent and believable narrative, that is at the same time both \"supernatural\" in feel, but also very much grounded in fact.\n- Setting up professionally made websites that look and feel as the \"real-deal\", including customer service phone numbers, email, location, and so on - basically so however much players research, they can never be entirely sure it's not an actual place.\n- Arranging phone-calls or physical objects to be sent out in some cases, or responses to Agents contacting \"Dispatch\" (Devs/NPCs), either as part of the interaction with the abovementioned websites, or as part of a more elaborate \"hint\" function than the typical 'press this button'.\n\n\n[u]Free-to-Play Live-Events?[/u]\nFinally, another rising misconception is that Live-Events are things that people who haven't bought the game can interact with \"for free\".\n\nAnyone participating outside of the client will not have the framing - by way of the overarching narrative - to follow the \"what\" and \"why\" of what happens in a Live-Event, and the main component of ARGs is exactly that narrative.\n\nLikewise, alerts to Live-events are given out to Agents (i.e. players who bought the game), either via email or the Situation Room (Red level), phone (Orange), or mail (Yellow).\nAs such, anyone who is not actively partaking in the community or did not buy the game, is many times more likely to miss out on the live-events, as they simply do not get an early warning.\n\nIn addition, the first steps of Live-Events have thus far involved the Situation Room, and may well involve entering information into the Client or reacting to updates in the Sitaution Room as the event unfolds.\n\nFinally, you will arguably not be eligible for intercepting a live- or dead-drop if Dispatch (Devs) can not confirm your involvement with them - so you'll also miss out on that potential interaction with the game.\n\n\n[h1]In Summary:[/h1]\nWhat you get out of The Black Watchmen is highly dependent on what you put in:\n\n- If you only start up the client, do the presented missions, and leave it at that, you won't get your moneys worth, nor will you enjoy any ARG.\n\n- If, however, you go beyond the client, look closer at the things you were presented with in the client, wonder what connections there might be, poke at the websites you were introduced to, look at the sourcecode of sites you were pointed to, try to find hidden files in archives, see the correlation between two disparate documents, manipulate images and audio files you find, discuss your thoughts with other agents on IRC, google docs, forums, voice chat, and so on, you get your moneys worth. \nIf not to say a whole lot more than you bargained for.", "timestamp_created": 1435883422, "timestamp_updated": 1442660317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16851851": {"recommendationid": "16851851", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968283518", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494197949}, "language": "english", "review": "Who knows where it might lead.

You CAN, but DO NOT HAVE TO, put in your phone number, and address. This puts you in a pool of people who can, but will not necessarily, be contacted by the game with special clues. \n\n2) 'The devs are screwing people by asking for $35 up front. I mean, the game is only in early access, they only have 6 \"missions\" actually finished!'\n\nThis game works somewhat like a TV series or a Telltale Games game. The content is episodic in nature. 3-4 missions are released every 2 weeks. The \"early access\" bit is misleading, as all content for the game is pretty much finished, save for the pieces of the plot that the players can impact. The game will be off early access after the first two weeks, assuming that there are no technical problems with the game. As for the price, the developers put the price at $35 based on the ideal of paying $1/1 hour that you can get out of the game. Of course, this is only an estimate, and those gifted with a high intelligence may find that they are completing the game faster than this. This price will drop as the season progresses, because some of the content, such as the live missions, will no longer be avaliable. If you only want to play this game for the puzzles, without any of the community content, I suggest waiting for the price to drop. \n\n3) \u2018Full enjoyment of this game can be achieved without too much effort.\u2019\n\nThis is a part of the game some people dislike. The truth of the matter is that this game will require a lot of attention to get the full experience out of it. The 19 missions that the game will have on steam can be completed at your own pace, but other content such as the live missions MUST BE DONE in real time. In other words, if you aren\u2019t keeping up to date with the community, you\u2019ll probably miss out on stuff. One of the major selling points of this game is the community that surrounds it. If you don\u2019t like this, that\u2019s ok. It just means this game probably isn\u2019t for you. \n\nTL;DR: You should probably read up on everything that you should expect, and will be expected of you, before buying this game. It is a unique experience that many other games on Steam cannot provide, but that experience may not be for everyone. Be sure you know what you\u2019re getting into.\n\nEDIT 1: The developers of the game just announced 5 more missions for the first season at no additional cost to those who have and will buy the game. For those with doubts as to the motivations of the developers, this should be a good sign.\n\nEDIT 2: Season 2 announced.

Es ist immer die Rede von \u201eaugmentierter Realit\u00e4t\u201c und ihr fragt euch vermutlich genauso wie ich (bevor ich das Spiel gekauft habe) was darunter in diesem Fall zu verstehen ist. Eigentlich ganz einfach, das Spiel verschmilzt die Realit\u00e4t mit Inhalten aus dem Spiel. Grausame Experimente die in der Realit\u00e4t passiert sind werden in die Dichte Story nahtlos eingewoben und verschmelzen zu dem Erlebnis das ihr aus diesem Spiel gewinnt. Ihr \u00fcbernehmt in diesem Spiel allerdings \u201enur\u201c die Rolle eines \u201eSchreibtischhengstes\u201c. Man f\u00fchlt sich praktisch wie ein NSA Mitarbeiter und \u00fcbernimmt die Detektivarbeit nur vor seinem eigenem Computer. Doch das Ganze tr\u00e4gt nur weiter dazu bei, das man sich so f\u00fchlt als w\u00fcrde man zu der virtuellen Agency geh\u00f6ren. Man sinkt ein in diese Welt die voller Geheimnisse, die mit unserer realen Welt verschmilzt. Das Spiel ist also rein gar nichts f\u00fcr labile Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten die an so etwas wie Chemtrails glauben.\n\nDieses Spiel ist voller R\u00e4tsel und geistigen Herausforderungen und interessanten sozialen Kontakten mit denen man sich gemeinsam \u00fcber die Teils (alleine unm\u00f6glichen) R\u00e4tsel den Kopf zu zerbrechen und erf\u00fcllt gleichzeitig einen Bildungsauftrag indem es \u00fcber vieles das real ist aufkl\u00e4rt. \n\nIch empfehle jedoch ein gutes englisches Vokabular mitzubringen das auf einem soliden B2 Niveau basiert, da dieses theoretische Konstrukt komplett auf Englisch basiert. Wer also schon Probleme hat mit der Sprache wird sich mit den Teils spitzfindigen R\u00e4tseln schwer tun, die oftmals einiges an Fachwissen im Bereich Naturwissenschaften abverlangt und man ohne das entsprechende Vokabular erst einmal eine \u00dcbersetzungsrunde starten muss.\n\nF\u00fcr jeden der sich also damit anfreunden kann und auf theoretische R\u00e4tsel und komplexe Inhalte steht kann ich dieses Spiel uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen.

What the hell, I thought. There was a sole thread. You've made it. \n\nAs other strangers arrived we got to discussing what the hell was going on, who was this person, why are they seeking our help? What do these images mean? Why us? Why have we been targetted? Over the coming days the buzz of activities heightened, the sense of urgency to solve this mystery was on. We all worked together deciphering images, clues, morse code, sonar radars until we finally uncovered the truth.  It was a viral ARG for The Secret World announcement.\n\nARGs are all about following clues, deciphering images, looking for meaning in things, researching real world events, connecting dots, going down rabbit holes and coming up short, stepping back and realising that you might be overthinking things.  The Black Watchmen does all of that and more. Like others, I was aprehensive about giving out my personal details, but I haven't disclosed one piece of personal information and have had a blast with the first 6 missions so far.

If you go deep enough down the rabbit hole you are bound to discover some disturbing things \u2013 things almost too plausible to be true. Blood rituals, human sacrifice and experimentation are mainstays of the silver screen, there\u2019s no way that they could be taking place beneath our very noses, or could they? There are agents worldwide investigating these disturbing reports and this weekend I joined them to get to the bottom of some shadowy people and their dealings. This is how I became a member of The Black Watchmen.\n\nI initially mistook The Black Watchmen as just a game, but it is much more than that. I am now part of a secret reconnaissance cell partaking in undercover investigations. My basic training involved learning to crack codes \u2013 binary, hexadecimal and rot13 enciphered messages \u2013 a cinch given my degree in computer science, but things soon became more difficult. My fellow agents and I were tasked with investigating the disappearance of an antique collector \u2013 and that\u2019s when things took a decidedly more sinister turn. The case files we were given, drafted by the first agent on the scene, consisted of nothing but seemingly innocuous images of books, dolls, crucifixes and bottles. The keen-eyed among us were able to identify a rot13 enciphered code in one of the images, which we were then able to decipher manually. The code pointed towards a pastebin link with details of an antique script called \u201cFolio 13\u2033, the kind a collector would love to have in their collection, but how did it tie in with his disappearance?\n\nA Google search for \u201cfolio 13\u2033 and \u201cCipher MMS\u201d lead me down a rabbit hole of religion, conspiracy, secret societies and the occult. I was suddenly in over my head, reading up on ancient Jewish sects and Pope John Paul\u2019s teachings \u2013 certainly nothing that could be attributed to the disappearance. I was over thinking things, going way too deep and missing an answer that was right in front of me. The organisation that penned the document wanted it back and was willing to go to any lengths to get it.\n\nAs the case was solved I gave myself a pat on the back and put my feet up, but my respite didn\u2019t last long. The agency had heard word that a clinic tied to rumours of human experimentation had reopened its doors and I had been asked to investigate its staff members for any signs of illegal activity. By cross-referencing each staff member\u2019s employment history I was soon able to establish a link between them and illegal human experiments \u2013 all those years of Google-fu were finally becoming useful.\n\nWith a link established it was tie to go deeper and find out exactly what was going on at the clinic. An undercover team was dispatched after closure to bug the building for remote monitoring. And then silence. The agency ceased contact until Sunday when all agents abruptly received an email informing us that the alert level had been \u201craised to 3\u2033. With urgency we made our way to our usual channels of communication (IRC) and began to converse about what could be happening, and there it was. In our game clients was an image coded in braille.\n\nThe image was surprisingly complex, containing not only the braille code, but a map that could be uncovered by applying various filters, and behind that were words which turned out to be street names. Some very intelligent deciphering later we had uncovered a restaurant in Portland called \u201cThe Fried Onion\u201d.  Initial reconnaissance of the location yielded no results, but now as the restaurant opens for business, we have agents on route for a face to face with forces unknown.\n\nNow we wait\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nPreviewed with a promotional key from developer.

It teaches you to think outside the box, analyze details carefully, and especially do your homework and deeper research into the subject in mind. For example, for one scenario, I had like ten tabs open just to research this one point. The sense of reward and accomplishment also in completing the hard task of figuring out the answer to an investigation is just too good.\n\nAnd then, there comes the moment where you have to give out your information. Oh dear. In order to truly rise above the ranks and reach the top (so to speak,) you'll need to give out information such as your phone number, address, and to quote the game, \"You may be contacted via phone calls, at all hours of the day or night, receive packages from the mail, and experience real world interactions with our assets in the field.\" Now, let me go ahead and say that this is not [i]required[/i] in order to experience the game. But if you expect to fully complete the game without giving this information out, good luck with that. I know someone who's actually been basically traumatized by this experience, but that's a story for another time that I wish to keep out of this. I understand that some are much more comfortable in giving out this information, and by all means that's A-OK. But personally, that is not something I'm doing any time soon. After all, this is the very nature of a game that's permanent alternate-reality.\n\nTo conclude, some of the game's puzzles (Being the few I've tried, hah,) are excellently thought out and I absolutely love them. The fact that I have to give my personal information out in order to get a full 100%, however, I don't. While I wouldn't personally recommend the game to people like myself, I would absolutely recommend it to others in a heartbeat. The experience doesn't look like any other.

That may seem obvious, but the reason I say it is that this game is most definetly not your \"typical\" game, and I can totally understand that a lot of people will hate it. If you don't like doing challenging puzzles where you have to look outside the game itself to find the answer, if you really don't like being part of the online \"community\" of a game, and if you don't have a certain tolerance for bashing your head against puzzles and skin-crawling creepyness in storylines, this game is not for you.\n\nAwesome Thing #1: Permanent ARG\n----------------------------------\nThe concept of a permanent ARG is really interesting. Basically the client is only part of the game, the *real* game is the overarching plot being run by puppetmasters (they are evil and sadistic and we love them). \n\nI'm crap at explaining this, but it's a really cool overal effect of a kind-of-real-world story going on. If you know what an ARG is and/or have participated in them (for example, the ones that were done around events/releases in The Secret World, which were run by some of the same people as this game) then you have some kind of familliarity with how it works. I dunno, google it I guess. \n\nAlso, get used to googling things. And going off on tangents and chasing red herrings and having a really weird and sometimes frankly disturbing browser history.\n\nAwesome Thing #2: The Community\n--------------------------------------\nI've been around this game and its community since the first kickstarter attempt, and first, let me say it's pretty hard to separate the two, and that's a good thing (usually). Unless you are some kind of puzzle solving supergenius, you *will* get stuck at some point, and many members of the community are totally willing to help without being too spoilery. There are also real world missions (yes, really, this has already happened in Alpha and in previous games) so it's actually requred for the community to find someone in a city where the clue leads to go pick up some dead drop somewhere. It is awesome when you get to be a part of something like this, even if it's just watching a webcam feed to see if/when an agent shows up...\n\nNeutral Thing #1: Hard Puzzles\n--------------------------------\nThe solo puzzles can be pretty hard (judging by some of the alpha and beta puzzles) but this version of the game starts you off pretty easy, and there's always the community to help. Check the forums, check IRC etc.\n\nI really like the challenge of the puzzles. I like think-y games more than action games. This is a think-y game x 1000. I get that a lot of people won't like that, but there it is.\n\nSometimes the leaps of logic required can be a *liiittle* too far, in my opinion, but it's generally pretty fair, if hard.\n\nNeutral Thing #2: Creepy Shit\n-------------------------------\nAs for the creepyness, well. It just is. Some of the subjects in the puzzles involve illegal medical/psychological experiments on humans. One previous mission (may or may not be linked to in this game) involved tracking a serial killer. Some folks might find these things too disturbing, and I get that.\n\nMe, I like spooky games. This one is spooky. If you don't like spooky, maybe not a good fit.\n\nNot So Awesome Thing: Missing Out\n--------------------------------------\nMy main complaint for the game is that partly because of my own bad timing/luck I've missed a bunch of the cool things that happened during testing. You really need to keep up with the game and be connected with the community (which may not be convenient for a lot of people, myself included some of the time) or you can miss things. Which leads to being confused as to what the bleep is going on when you try and jump back in to chat/forums, and some dissapointment at missing the coolness that went on while you were away...\n\nOther than that though, this gets a thumbs up from me. I'm really excited to see where this game goes, and I hope it gets extended for more than one season. And that we don't get too many (fictional!) agents killed.\n\n...And that I get kidnapped.", "timestamp_created": 1435291047, "timestamp_updated": 1435291047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682887", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16711765": {"recommendationid": "16711765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003776372", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514167364}, "language": "english", "review": "Look, you need to read this.

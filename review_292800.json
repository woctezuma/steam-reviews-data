Through a complex and layered narrative, the player is guided through child-friendly lessons on nutrition and anatomy, with the added dimensions of allusions to geopolitical conflict, diplomatic relations, freedom of expression, the complexities of the legal and penal systems, as well as to the Marxist master-slave dialectic fundamental to the capitalist mode of production.\n\n     This is made absolutely evident in one of the opening scenes of the game: our protagonist finds himself in the candy-cane jail, to await trial which is set for the next month; an obvious symbol for the consistent failures of the justice system, due in no small part to its bureaucratic inefficiencies. Sharing his jail cell is a broccoli named Florette, a delegate for the food group peace conference (a not-so-subtle allusion to the United Nations) who is being held as political prisoner. Florette asks our protagonist to help her escape imprisonment, and to rescue the other delegates so they may safely reach the peace conference. Clearly, the antagonistic Sweet State has as motive to keep the delegates (each representing an essential food group) away from the conference so as to maintain a nutritional hegemony without sanction. \nIn the much cited section on estranged labour in Marx's 1844 Manuscripts, he posits four dimensions of alienation suffered by the proletarian class as a result of the capitalist system: alienation from the object of production, from the sum-total of labour activities, from his species-being, and most importantly, from fellow men. Following the fourth dimension of alienation of man from man, workers see other people the same way they see their own labour; as being alien to them, and therefore hostile. In PS3 (Pajama Sam 3), our hero must free the delegate Bean #47 trapped atop a girder in a quarry, overlooking a workers uprising due to internal factionalism between the Jelly Beans and the Kidney Beans. This conflict is orchestrated and clearly a result of greed and negligence on the part of the foreman, who represents the capitalist bourgeois proprietor of the means of production. This section of the game is a not-so-veiled representation of this fourth dimension of alienation. The Jelly Beans and the Kidney Beans see each other in the same light that they their own labour: they are estranged from it, and therefore confront it with hostility. When spoken to, the foreman shows little regard for the plight of his workers, but rather claims repeatedly that he has counted them, while shuffling through a number of blank documents; he is putting up a front of a caring boss, but his reluctance to provide any useful information until the third interraction with Pajama Sam shows that his care is only on a very superficial level, and that he still sees his workers in terms of their commodity values, and means to an end.\n\n     One by one, the player then helps Pajama Sam find and save the other delegates and sends them on their way to the conference. In the final scene of the game, the six delegates, all in the peace conference (strongly resembling the United Nations Security Council), begin to bicker and argue with each other over which food group is better, rather than continuing deliberation with decorum. In response to this, Pajama Sam gives a rousing speech in which he implores the delegates to remember the original spirit of diplomacy between food groups: to address the concerns of human physiology, and to ensure their continued prosperity and collective autonomy.\n\n     Many children across north America that enjoyed the many Kellogg's breakfast cereals that included the game in one of their boxes was then exposed to the leftist rhetoric overlaying the themes in PS3. Could these quasi-subliminal messages have influenced the political leanings of millenials? As was made evident from the last presidential election in the United States with the overwhelming support for candidates like Bernie Sanders by youth, this could very much be the case. The evidence points to this, and given the right statistical analysis of distribution and demograpgics related to PS3 and its players, it can be claimed that this is all due to the Pajama Sam effect.", "timestamp_created": 1510453648, "timestamp_updated": 1510453648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554913", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36325130": {"recommendationid": "36325130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097644433", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 209, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455151529}, "language": "english", "review": "Only have because played when I was younger.\n\n\nBrings back memories of old clunky white DELL computer.", "timestamp_created": 1509985293, "timestamp_updated": 1509985293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36282174": {"recommendationid": "36282174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278937744", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477855653}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me think of my childhood i love it", "timestamp_created": 1509833883, "timestamp_updated": 1509833883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35920161": {"recommendationid": "35920161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112470513", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508638680}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 just like dark souls", "timestamp_created": 1508677799, "timestamp_updated": 1508677799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35093393": {"recommendationid": "35093393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091454340", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477477790}, "language": "english", "review": "restored my faith in humanity\n\nedit: sam gets arrested its rated m", "timestamp_created": 1505948041, "timestamp_updated": 1511592983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747272", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34765989": {"recommendationid": "34765989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223679020", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504652137}, "language": "english", "review": "the mouse keeps sliding around and I can't click on anything at the begining of the game. this game was a waste of money.", "timestamp_created": 1504652224, "timestamp_updated": 1504652224, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34552226": {"recommendationid": "34552226", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985592260", "num_games_owned": 926, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401187628}, "language": "english", "review": "The Pajama Sam series holds an important place in the Humungous Four.

As the games progress, they really do get hard and the map in this one was HUGE (or felt huge). It was a little difficult, but as with anything, you do something enough times and you'll be fine. I'm not the biggest fan of how they laid out the body (the eyes were surprisingly far from the brain) and how they portayed the whole argument of the food pyramid but it worked. I actually liked the lesson Sam learns. Very redeeming and very true.\n\nThe biggest plus of this game was \n\nOne: We get to meet our favorite orange friend again\nTwo: We get to go on another crazy Pajama Sam adventure\nThree: The writers of this game didn't get too preachy about eating right. They didn't make fruits and vegetables superior to the other groups and that's a good thing. It all comes together at the end with Sam's lesson even though the game as a whole seems scattered and jumbled.\n\nIf you liked the first two games then it's your duty to give this one a try.

I'm glad Humongous got back on track for Pajama Sam.\n\nI don't think companies should stick to a solid formula if they create a franchise. Nintendo has managed to evolve the Mario franchise over the years, but with very few distinct changes. That's honestly one of the biggest problems with series. How far do you go to make a sequel distinct and different, while also keeping the same general formula of your previous installment(s)? \n\nI think Pajama Sam 3 did alright. I liked what it did. It was different, but it was still distinctly a Pajama Sam.\n\nThe story is similar to the other installments, where Sam has a problem and some supernatural imaginative event carries Sam to a separate world where he learns the error of his ways. Although, this is the first time in the series where Sam doesn't deal with a fear: it's more or less a personal flaw of overeating.\n\nThe world, much like the Land of Darkness from the first game, is incredibly imaginative. It's a massive rendition of Sam's body, as he goes around and \"restores balance\" to the food groups. There's no B.S, random conflict that comes out of nowhere. No random World Wide Weather business complex. It's simple imagination- like the first Pajama Sam.\n\nBut, despite what good things there are, there are still plenty of bad things. The mini-games are absolutely awful. I hate the bean-sorting game and the ski slopes. And some puzzles were a little vague, especially if the game was made for kids. Like specifically finding the sand castle for the bag to fill for the Cheese Delegate guy. And, the voice actress for Florette the Broccoli sounds like she's just reading a paper in front of her face.\n\nHowever, the game follows the original Pajama Sam formula, without using the first game as a crutch, like Pajama Sam 2 did. It tells a new story with new characters, while keeping the charm, subtle humor, small symbolism, and story of personal growth that the original game created. And I enjoyed the time I spent playing it.

Along the way, funny and lovable Pajama Sam will meet a number of nice characters, visit a variety of interesting locations and play mini-games as he completes the larger task of getting a representative of each food group out of a pickle so they can get to an important meeting. Along the way he will solve a lot of smaller puzzles and click on many objects that dance or act out funny events.

As they flee, Sam searches for a logical place - the pantry. The door shuts, trapping Pajama Sam into a world full of scrumptious sweets, delectable delights, and tasty treats.\n\nYou play as Sam, a little boy looking to stop the general from declaring war. How does Sam do this? He needs to find members of each food group so they can hold a conference together. The only problem is...they've gone missing! Pajama Sam will need to consume candy canes to escape prison, drive on a donut, resolve balance between beans, and much more. The cool thing about this game (and the other Humongous Entertainment games) is that your second gameplay might be different than the first. The different food groups might be in different places next time, so replay value is actually fun.\n\nI loved the creativity put forth in this game. Foods  of all sorts come to life with memorable personalities.\n-Strong, beefy muffins draw cupcakes on the coast. \n-Candy canes substitute jail bars.\n-The names. Plums nicknamed \"plummers.\" A granny smith apple named Granny Smythe. The sweet troops marching around.\n\nFans who have not played this game yet will love the cameo appearances.

In PJS3: YAWYEFYHTYF Sam is facing the pressing issue of invasive consumerism, as he's pushed to eat 20 boxes of cookies in one sitting in order to acquire enough box tops to get a prize of his role model, Pajama Man. This excursion ends up ruining his appetite for supper, this is then paralleled in the game by Pajama Sam eating a giant cake and being forced to pay the consequences by being thrown in prison. In this allegory for his actions Pajama Sam (not to be mistaken with the non-imaginary \"Sam\") Must seek out and rescue all of the delegates for the peace council, who have all become incopacitated in some way, Luke Wigglebig not included. This small detail makes me believe that the candy people were attempting to prolong the war by delaying the delegates, in order to cement candy as the one true food group.The first delagate you find is your prisonmate, Florette the Broccoli who was arrested due to Anarchistic Insurection. The second you find is Pi\u00e9rre le Pain of the grain peoples, who is found on top of the Ferris wheel, being humiliated by the muffins who used to be his friends, however they have a separate agenda and would rather follow their art careers than help ensure the peace of their people. Later on you find a race war breaking out between the Jelly Beans and the Kidney Beans and the quarry, because although they are both beans, the only thing that matters is the colour of their outsides. This causes them to stop working and partition themselves, with the Bean Foreman being powerless to stop the conflict, Pajama Sam ends up using circular logic to convince them to argue the opposite side's point without realization. This causes the agression to simmer down, and allows Bean #47 to attend the peace council without fear of being jumped by the local Jelly Bean gangs. The next delagate we run into is Granny Smyth of the fruits, who is being harassed by a group of unrepresented canned goods, in order to passify this group you need to promise funded community programs. This convinces the canned goods to free Granny Smyth, allowing her to go to the peace council. The final delagate you find is Chuck \"Cheese of Adventure\" Cheddar, who's flee via hot air balloon was halted by becoming lodged in the cotton candy clouds (who were possibly working for the candy kingdom), preventing him from leaving the country. You will end up blackmailing him, that if you save him from dying, by dislodging the hot air balloon that he'd be required to go to the peace council, which he accepts. With all the delegates rounded up, the negotiations descend into chaos, with all sides becoming more entrenched in their positions, while also yelling slurs at the other delegates and attempting to discredit their positions. It seems as if peace is impossible, until Pajama Sam chimes in as a neutral 3rd party, convincing them of equal representation in an oligarchy style food government.

Savant \u2013 Ascent is extremely well polished but falls short in terms of content.\n\n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Both the graphics and sound track are excellent - the style reminds me of exceptional retro games, such as the Castlevania series. \n[*]At the beginning gameplay is very basic. You shoot/aim using your mouse, and dodge left and right using your keyboard. However, as you collect CD fragments, more abilities become available to you, making gameplay more dynamic and skill based. With these abilities in your arsenal, you will be put to the test in the endless mode and semi-secret story mode. \n[*]Since you have to deal with large numbers of enemies, I really appreciated the small details included to help the player. For example, there are indicators at the edge of your screen that show where enemies are coming from. There are also audio cues when a specific enemy (Fodders) hurl themselves at you. These are small details, but they really help you organize yourself amidst the chaos.\n [/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]My biggest complaint is that Savant \u2013 Ascent is far too short. I would say that most players will be able to beat the main story line in about 20 minutes. It\u2019s such a shame considering how beautiful and well made this game is. Upon beating the story mode, you unlock time trial and endless modes, so replay value lies in improving your high score or time. Needless to say, this gets quite repetitive. However, I did like that a secret extension of the story mode was included. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Conslusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 You decide[/h1]\nSavant \u2013 Ascent is not bad by any means. The graphics, sound track, and gameplay are done exceptionally well, but there just isn\u2019t enough content to keep me entertained for very long. I don\u2019t care much for improving my completion time or score, so the other modes aren\u2019t very interesting to me. Instead, I would have loved to play through a longer story mode. If you\u2019re the type to spend countless hours perfecting the game mechanics and improving your score, then Savant \u2013 Ascent might be for you.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

The energy blasts are wild and the animation conveys a real sense of force. As you unlock power-ups, that destructive power increases dramatically. Once you are fully powered, you will tear through the first portion of the game with little effort. Fortunately, an expansion was released to bring back some challenge and you can start from any level that you've unlocked.\n\nControls are simple. Aim the curser in the general direction of enemies and fire. The hero is also able to deftly avoid incoming threats by jumping in place, jumping between two platforms, or rolling between the platforms. If an enemy drops a portion of a CD, highlight it and alt fire to rope it in. This is how to unlock power-ups and new music tracks. The power-ups add some more variety to your arsenal and they are straightforward to learn.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is how easy it is once you obtain all of the power-ups. As far as I can tell, there is no way to selectively drop them. The samurai battle requires more rote memorization than strategy. There is, however, an endless mode that gets extremely challenging, although it always requires you to start from the beginning. Another problem is that, on Linux, GOTY mode is unable to load some assets, which causes the game to crash.\n\nI am not a fan of mobile ports. Usually, they feel out of place on PC, but this one was done right.

It's a really fun and cool little arcade shooter and I really like the mechanics, artstyle aswell as gameplay. I've been a fan of the musician savant for a long time (which gave a little hype for the game I guess) and I think that his music is very hit or miss in the sense that you might like some of it, all of it or none of it, if that makes sense... \n\nBesides his music being hit or miss were I finding myself enjoying the soundtrack in my playthrough even though I found some of the songs worse than others. But going away from the music and over to the game, It's really fun. It's not that long and There's not a lot of depth to the game but the game you play is well polished and fun. The story is quick to complete so you're going to spend most of your time in time attack or endless trying to gain the last of your ultimate powers.

Ritornato con i piedi per terra dopo qualche ora di prova, posso confermare che ci\u00f2 che il gioco offre \u00e8 assolutamente commisurato al suo costo: una breve quanto intensa esperienza arcade, corredata da una pixel-art di altissimo livello. Che comunque NON \u00e8 poco.\n\nIn Savant - Ascent impersoniamo il mago Savant, spodestato dalla propria torre da una misteriosa sfera di luce. Nel nostro percorso verso la sommit\u00e0 dell'edificio dovremo affrontare ondate di nemici meccanici utilizzando la nostra magia. Una volta eliminati, alcuni avversari speciali rilasceranno dei frammenti di CD che potremo raccogliere e collezionare con un duplice scopo: in primis acquisire nuove abilit\u00e0 che andranno a modificare la nostra arma principale, i dardi magici, e secondariamente sbloccare nuove tracce da utilizzare come musica di sottofondo durante il gioco.\n\nScopo del gioco \u00e8 distruggere nel pi\u00f9 breve tempo possibile gli avversari che ci attaccheranno da tutte le angolazioni, eventualmente schivando con un salto o con un passo laterale (gli unici due movimenti possibili) i pochi che riusciranno a sopravvivere alla nostra salva di proiettili. Si tratta di un gioco in cui riflessi e velocit\u00e0 di reazione rivestiranno un ruolo molto importante, in maniera simile ai canonici SHMUP aerospaziali a cui eravamo abituati da bambini: un parallelo che regge anche in termini di difficolt\u00e0, che soprattutto nella modalit\u00e0 \"Endless\" raggiunge in breve tempo un livello veramente ostico.\n\nSul versante della grafica non c'\u00e8 molto da dire, se non che la pixel-art in Savant - Ascent \u00e8 decisamente eccezionale nel suo essere colorata, ben disegnata e - come direbbero gli angolofoni, con un termine che tradotto in italiano non rende bene l'idea - decisamente \"crisp\". La poca variet\u00e0 di ambientazioni e personaggi in questo senso lascia un po' l'amaro in bocca - nota a margine: gli sviluppatori norvegesi D-PAD Studio riusciranno a farsi perdonare soltanto qualche anno dopo rilasciando lo sbalorditivo Owlboy. Ottima la colonna sonora originale di stampo elettronico scritta dal musicista norvegese Savant, che come il protagonista del nostro gioco ama esibirsi in pubblico con il volto coperto dalla maschera di Guy Fawkes. Coincidenza? Io non credo... (cit.)\n\nSavant - Ascent \u00e8 un gioco particolare: la modalit\u00e0 storia di esaurisce in meno di un'ora e da l\u00ec in avanti le uniche opzioni sensate saranno la modalit\u00e0 \"Time Attack\", in cui gareggeremo per terminare il gioco (di nuovo) nel minor tempo possibile, e una modalit\u00e0 \"Endless\" pi\u00f9 hardcore, dedicata ai veri fans degli shooter. Non si tratta di un gioco per tutti i palati: tolto l'aspetto competitivo di migliorare il proprio record e l'esigenza collezionistica di sbloccare tutti i CD/potenziamenti, quello che rimane potrebbe essere troppo poco per il giocatore occasionale. Per questo, nonostante il prezzo molto contenuto, mi riservo di consigliare Savant - Ascent solo agli sfegatati degli SHMUP, che con una spesa irrisoria potranno aggiungere una variante semplice, divertente e visivamente appagante alla propria collezione.\n\n[i][b]Se questa recensione ti \u00e8 piaciuta clicca \"Segui\" sulla [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogamingcafe/curation]pagina del Curatore[/url] del mio gruppo: sarai sempre aggiornato con i miei personali consigli e le recensioni dei migliori titoli indie/retro/roguelite in circolazione![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1501461561, "timestamp_updated": 1501492474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522746", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33847883": {"recommendationid": "33847883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073040659", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511889341}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo excelente para treinar reflexo e agilidade com o mouse.

afflitto da diversi problemi, primo fra tutti: la durata, se siete giocatori abili del genere il gioco durera' anche meno di 30 minuti. il secondo problema e' il controllo del nostro protagonista, legato, vincolato da pochi moviementi, non ci sono alternative: o stai qui o stai li....letteralmente il personaggio si puo' muovere esclusivamente su due piattaforme per evitare i nemici, appiattendo cosi un gameplay a dir poco gia antico di per se'. infine piu' che un problema, una critica: avendo a disposizione una colonna sonora cosi' valida, e volendo fare uno sparatutto perche non puntare a

A really cheap game made by the same studio that gave us Owlboy, based on the work of one of my favourite musicans? I just couldn't resist buying it, and man - that was a good purchase.\n\nIn Savant - Ascent you play as a powerful Alchemist who is very close to gaining control over a powerful Orb. Suddenly, the Orb violently throws him out of his tower, and takes control over his lab. Of course, our hero is not going to let some shining ball bully him like that, so he crashes back in, ready to fight his way back up. And so begins his Ascent.\n\nMechanicaly, Savant - Ascent is similiar to One Finger Death punch. You shoot enemies by pressing left mouse button, after gathering enough power can blast them with the right mouse button, and you can jump between two spots to dodge attacks in two different ways - either dash left and right  with A and D, or you can press W to do sick flips from one spot to another. You can also hold S to charge up your power metter, and that's it.\n\nBut there's so much more to Savant - Ascent. It's pretty much a bullet hell game where hordes of enemies circle all around you, and you protect yourself by firing [b]MAGIC MISSILES[/b] at a very fast rate. While this is realisticaly your only \"weapon\", this attack sounds, looks, and feels awesome. To make things even better you can listen to Savant's songs like Fat Cat Shuffle or Kali 47. If you're a Savant fan, you will really enjoy this game, and if you're not - you will still listen to some really good music while destroying hundreds of enemies.\n\nNow, the thing with this game is that it's both a great stress reliever, and a pretty difficult game. Gitting gud might take you a while (and the game requires you to survive for a few minutes in endless mode just to unlock the final chapter, which is not easy to do), so you will probably get frustrated quite a lot.

This was and still\nis your house, this tower; and you will\nshow them who is the Master here!\n\nAfter a tense introductory level where\nthe machines fail to overpower your\nawesome might, the centerpiece of\nthe game is the seemingly-endless\ngrand elevator rising to the highest\nlevel of the tower. More varieties of\nmechanical enemies greet you, and \nyou return their hospitality in kind\nat the end of your chains and fist!\n\nBlinking away as the last of the \nmechanical line of defence falls, the\nelevator fades to a halt through a haze\nof white.

The game was made using GameMaker and won the GameMaker GOTY award for 2013, it also won Gullstikka Norwegian GOTY 2014. It\u2019s got much replay value with beating previous high-scores and attempting to be ranked in the leaderboards. It is based on real-life EDM artist Savant (Aleksander Vinter), who also provides the soundtrack straight from some of his albums. Savant - Ascent is available on Steam, Google Play, and the App Store.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nShooting and dodging are the game's main gameplay mechanics. The player shoots a burst of bullets before the shots become rapid-fire, dodging and taking down mobs also builds up energy that make your shots stronger. When enough energy is collected the player can shoot a powerful shot that mostly one-hit-kills enemies.\nThere is a variety of enemies in the game, ranging from small ones with different amounts of mechanics to big worm-like enemies with destroyable sections. There is also boss battles, which are challenging if the player fails to notice patterns and are careless. The enemies come in hordes, and if they\u2019re not picked off in the order they spawn then you may have some crowd control to deal with, the burst shots help a lot with that. Throughout the whole game there are CD fragments, four of which form one full CD. CDs unlock more songs on the soundtrack and also unlock different abilities and buffs for the player.\nThere\u2019s Story Mode, Endless Mode, and a Time Attack mode. You unlock latter two modes by beating the Story Mode. In endless you can try and beat your highscore and also rank high on the leaderboards; same with the timed mode, you can try to beat your time and rank high on the leaderboards. Good old arcade-style gameplay model, which give the game a high replay value.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nFor this game he chose most songs from his dubstep-sounding albums: Alchemist, Cult, ISM, Ninur, Orakel, Vario, and Overkill. Not including the musical scores made specifically for the game.\n\nAll in All Savant - Ascent  is a really nice Action Game! \n\n10/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep\t[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1477824787, "timestamp_updated": 1477824787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739033", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26281316": {"recommendationid": "26281316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083626675", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458384779}, "language": "english", "review": "For the price its a fun little game with great music. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1477710319, "timestamp_updated": 1477710319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26236465": {"recommendationid": "26236465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052941330", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414816762}, "language": "english", "review": "Savant - Ascent is a simple, but very fun, retro game that is easy to get into, but hard to master.

I'm normally a plodding puzzle game player so this was quite a shock to the system. My poor nerves are still jangling.\n\nYou control a masked Guy Fawkes-esque character with a purple cape on a central platform with only two positions, left and right. You dodge and jump from side to side avoiding enemies coming at you from 360 degrees, shooting at them round the clock with unlimited ammo. One certain type of high-hitpoint enemy drops quarter sections of CDs which you collect by flinging your chain-grabber out, and at this point the action is frozen for one second. It doesn't sound like much but it gives you enough of a pause to target the next enemy.\n\nAfter each 3-life death, of which there are many, the parts you've collected are pieced together and a whole CD awards you a powerup and a new song. You're resurrected at the start of the level you were at with your new abilities allowing you to hopefully progress further than last time. At a certain point you ascend to the next level (of 5) with ever harder, faster, more numerous enemies, culminating in a boss. I'm embarrassed to say I'm still struggling on level 4, it's bonkers! Please don't look at my hrs on record.\n\nAfter level 3 Time Attack and Endless modes are unlocked for your competitive replay career.\n\n[h1]Linux[/h1]\n\nThe control settings are a bit flakey in the Linux version. I did manage to get it working with keyboard/mouse at one stage after a lengthy session of plugging/unplugging devices and poking around in the game settings which kept reverting back to what I didn't want, but for the most part it seems to prefer a controller and who am I to argue - I'm happy as long as I can avoid having to boot into that other horrid OS. It works in fullscreen (at full 1920x1200 res) or window but I don't think anyone in their right mind would choose a window for this.\n\nA point to note here is that most Linux-enabled Steam games these days seem to be made with Unity, which simply packages the Windows binary and DLLs with mono to run it all in Linux whereas this game has a proper native Linux binary and music files in open-source OGG format. I for one appreciate the extra effort even if it goes unnoticed 99% of the time.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\nIt's all about the music. Having done a bit of googling I've learned that Savant is a prolific Norwegian electro/dance musician ([url=http://www.savantofficial.com/]check out the website[/url]); the whole game is based on his music and artwork. 6 striking tracks from various albums are showcased in the game and they are top quality, very catchy. Makes a change from the usual forgettable generic tunes in most games. In some places I noticed the enemies moving to the beat and maybe it would be even more apparent if I was a competent player.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nGraphics are easy on the eye but primarily designed for speed and efficiency. There are no overly fancy 3D or artistic elements, just well-designed functional 2D enemies that swarm in packs on a static screen. The result is a highly responsive twitch-reflex environment with zero lag. Any mistakes to be made are down to human error and can't be blamed on the computer, as much as I'd like an excuse for my pathetic scores.\n\nApart from the slightly flakey Linux control setup it all works smoothly, no glitches, no problems. The menu system is straightforward and includes an integrated achievements list and level selection.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nOne word...\n\n[b]DEAD[/b]\n\nThis is what appeared on my screen every 10 seconds for hours on end (and haunted my dreams) and for quite a while this was followed by \"Highscore: 0\". I was proud to eventually receive my first points. If there was an achievement for a bazillion deaths I would get it in no time. I daresay if you're a 14 year old with housefly-like reflexes you should fare better than I did.\n\nWhen using keyboard/mouse, part of the challenge is keeping track of your aiming cursor which can easily become lost in the busy pyrotechnics of gunfire. It has to be placed near the CD part to pick it up. With a controller this doesn't seem to be necessary, you just pull the trigger and the part is retrieved even if you're facing in the opposite direction. The mouse does feel more natural though so it's a tradeoff.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\nNo cards. 14 achievements. I haven't managed to get any yet but hope springs eternal. Apparently some of these achievements tie in with the gameplay, unlocking new abilities. This is an interesting concept I've never come across before. Steam leaderboards are also included but I won't be troubling myself with that.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nEverything about this game is tight and compact and the (full) price is no exception. The story mode, at 5 levels, is short but there's a lot of replay in Time Attack and Endless modes. Excellent value.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nThis game makes me feel like a doddery old fart* who accidentally wandered into a rave party. I shuffled around on the dancefloor with lasers bouncing off my bald pate, blowing a whistle and waving a glo-stick, surrounded by a gaggle of attractive young ladies who said I was sweet. Now I need a nice cup of tea and a lie down.\n\nI highly recommend this to all young whippersnappers in a hurry to shoot stuff.\n\n* Disclaimer: JimDeadlock is an unfeasibly handsome bronzed adonis, in the prime of life and sporting a magnificent mane of golden hair.

I played it a while ago, a really short story with just 2 levels and a boss fight. It also had time attack and endless mode. I messed around with time attack for a bit. Overall, very difficult game, took about two hours to get good and beat it. Very fun. The one part that confused me, the ability list seemed to have some empty spaces, but I couldn't find any more abilities. In any case, I stopped playing there.\n\n\nI wound up starting it up sometime later, poked around through the menus for no real reason, and discovered there were some more achievements I hadn't gotten. I think they said something about scrap metal? Unsure what this was about, looked around some more and realized that there were two more abilities you can get in endless mode! So I jumped in and damn it was hard, but after many tries, I fought through long enough to collect those abilities.\n\nThese two new abilities were... odd. Spin charging was cool, but still felt slower than shooting enemies... eh whatever. And then chain throwing. Very strange, you have to stop shooting to gain a full charge up while spinning, then you can throw chains to kill a bunch of enemies. However, it seems less effective than just using a regular charge attack, and uses your whole charge guage in the process. leaving you doing very little damage with your regular attacks. Very confusing, no idea why they would include something like that. To make it worse, they have this tendancy to fire off when you try to use a regular charge attack right after a spin, screwing you over.\n\nPretty much done, there was one thing still bugging me. There was still one spot left in the ability list, left blank, but none of the modes had any more to collect.\n\nLeaving that aside, I decided to run through the story once more with the two new abilities. At some point during this, I realized that spin charging had hidden mechanics that made it more useful than I'd initially thought. But not the chains. I got to the boss and... well, discovered something I was not at all expecting...", "timestamp_created": 1473194897, "timestamp_updated": 1473194897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25374809": {"recommendationid": "25374809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049036874", "num_games_owned": 775, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473130184}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty, but it's terribly repetitive.", "timestamp_created": 1473130317, "timestamp_updated": 1473130317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25361972": {"recommendationid": "25361972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097370416", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473071489}, "language": "english", "review": "ok seriously its good\n\nGreat Music, Design and awesome Art too but TOO BAD Story Mode is short that there are only 5 levels  if im not wrong , i even finished in less than 25 minutes lol well its interesting though\n\nbut not just Story Mode,  there are also other modes such as Time Attack and Endless\nit was more difficult than Story Mode\n\noh Gameplay is simple but challenging\n\nwell, its only $1 so worth to buy it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1473072720, "timestamp_updated": 1473072720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498753", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25357772": {"recommendationid": "25357772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282036248", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503675110}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is harder then i thought it would be xd. destroyed 500 robots in endless", "timestamp_created": 1473045031, "timestamp_updated": 1473045031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25356944": {"recommendationid": "25356944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119360301", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513978003}, "language": "english", "review": "This game I got for 90 cents and personaly for that price I would certainly get that game, but if it were for anything more I would wait until its back to that price and 100% recommend it to anyone.Yet is incredibly short and if your good (without glitches) you can beat the enitre game in about 5 min.

Any time you take down enemies, you feel like you're in power especially with the numbers you are taking down while still maintaining a lot of challenge.  \n  Music is outstanding.

If anything, the only reasons I felt like I died is not because of the enemies, but really more of the camera throwing itself out there.

I bought this game on sale for something like 75% off...and now its extremely cheap. I'd still buy at full price. Its a great game...it has a bullet hell feel to it but at the same time allows you to be the one giving the bullet hell and rewards you for growing in skill and knowledge of the game. Being able to on demand change the soundtrack thats playing is nice, the extra modes are nice. The music is S+ Tier for a game this cheap. I wish this person would make more games like this or continue to add onto this game with DLC or something, because this game is super fun to just hop on and blow stuff up in. I still havent beaten the final boss cuz I simply am not good enough. (Not the initial 1st boss...you will know the actual final boss when you finally actually get to him if you can figure it out)", "timestamp_created": 1469782862, "timestamp_updated": 1469782862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24542645": {"recommendationid": "24542645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126469921", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490930465}, "language": "english", "review": "A very enjoyable game, which has an exponential difficulty difficulty curve.

The game has a very intimidating appearance and rightly so. This game is not easy. I highly doubt there's many people if any at all that finished the game on there first try.  Actually the game is rather setup so you have to continue and die many times. But each time you come back you do a little better each round. Either cause you gained a new power-up or cause you know what to do. It does carry the classic syndrome of being put on tilt due to dying to the same thing over and over again. So you gotta deal with that. I warn you now if you're one of those people that dying to stuff you couldn't see, cause you dodged wrong, or your focus was on the wrong enemy. You're going to be frustrated and hate the game. Cause all this will happen.  Thankfully the game is generous enough to give you the option to start on the level you left off at. [spoiler]You thought Undertale Sans was hard you haven't played this then.[/spoiler] \n\nThe best part of the gameplay is how extremely well it flows with the music. I feel like all my moves are controlled by the killer soundtrack. \n\nI'm also thankful for multi controller support. I didn't want to use my mouse or keyboard for this game. \n\n[h1]Music and Sound[/h1]\n\nI love it. The soundtrack is just too good for words. You can find it on Youtube or some other place to give it a listen yourself. It works so well with the game it's like I'm conducting a symphony. I did have some issues with the game's music just suddenly cutting out at random when it loaded a boss fight at times. But it fixes itself. Honestly the best part is unlocking a new song to listen to. You can try all of them till you find your beat. \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nTook me awhile to figure out the character's design. I didn't realize he was wearing a mask till I stopped and took a closer look. The sprite designs outside of the main character and bosses are pretty unique and memorable. This game does a great job keeping up with the action No sign of slow downs at all. \n\n[h1]Dissapointments[/h1]\n\nThese are rather minor gripes. The game is short. But what you expect for that kind of price tag? The difficulty does shoot up quite a bit as you progress. You have to bring your A game to the table. The extra ending might leave you wanting more depending on your taste. And I'm not really in favor of having to play the other game modes to get my last couple of power-ups. \n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nThis game is a great way to spend a couple of minutes. If you're waiting on something or someone. Just want to relax to some tunes. Want a challenge. Or you love getting high scores and showing off. This is your game. It's worth the small price tag and then some.", "timestamp_created": 1467782269, "timestamp_updated": 1467782269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24112938": {"recommendationid": "24112938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232216240", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506139310}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sencillamente fant\u00e1stico, un juego con una de las mejores relaciones calidad-precio, barat\u00edsimo para el contenido tan entretenido que brinda.

They are unlikely to have played the \"full game\" as there multiple hidden stages and modes, which admittedly can be tricky to unlock. This is because throughout the game you unlock 7 CD's that unlock skills for your character. 4 CD's can be unlocked in the main game and represent your basic abilities. 2 CD's are located in the Endless Mode, unlocked after beating the Story Mode once. Using these 2 CD's it is possible to unlock hidden stages in the Story Mode which (amongst other things) contains the last CD.\n\nThe progression of the game is pretty much designed to have you repeat some stages as the order of stages to unlock all CD's is the following: Story Mode (first time), Endless Mode, Story Mode (hidden stages). At the time of writing I have played for 5 hours and have gone through the Story and Endless Mode as well the first hidden stage. I have not even touched the additional free content that was added with the GOTY update and am definitely looking forward to it.\n\nAnother concern raised in other reviews is the playability of the game using a controller. I have beaten Story Mode with the controller however in order to unlock the 2 CD's in Endless Mode I had to switch to the keyboard and mouse. However I can't say I was disappointed, as switching to the mouse quadrupled my score. This is simply due to the precision the game requires later on in the harder stages which are incredibly fun to play and represent the main meat of the game. In reality the Story Mode and its 3 levels are essentially a tutorial that explain each of the mechanics in the game and after mastering these one is supposed to play the Endless Mode as well as the Time Attack Mode and the hidden stages in the Story Mode.\n\nTL;DR Overall the game is amazing but fails to tell you that you are supposed to play the Story Mode more after unlocking some new skills in the other game modes.

The game was made using GameMaker and won the GameMaker GOTY award for 2013, it also won Gullstikka Norwegian GOTY 2014. It\u2019s got much replay value with beating previous high-scores and attempting to be ranked in the leaderboards. It is based on real-life EDM artist Savant (Aleksander Vinter), who also provides the soundtrack straight from some of his albums. Savant - Ascent is available on Steam, Google Play, and the App Store.\n\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nSavant has been expelled from his tower by an evil Orb, as a result he needs to shoot and dodge his way back up the tower, defeating waves of enemies as he ascends.\n\nHigher up the tower are even more powerful enemies, enemies against which your skill will truly be tested. Are you ready for the challenge that lies beyond the tower?\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nShooting and dodging are the game's main gameplay mechanics. The player shoots a burst of bullets before the shots become rapid-fire, dodging and taking down mobs also builds up energy that make your shots stronger. When enough energy is collected the player can shoot a powerful shot that mostly one-hit-kills enemies.\n\nThere is a variety of enemies in the game, ranging from small ones with different amounts of mechanics to big worm-like enemies with destroyable sections. There is also boss battles, which are challenging if the player fails to notice patterns and are careless. The enemies come in hordes, and if they\u2019re not picked off in the order they spawn then you may have some crowd control to deal with, the burst shots help a lot with that. Throughout the whole game there are CD fragments, four of which form one full CD. CDs unlock more songs on the soundtrack and also unlock different abilities and buffs for the player.\n\nThere\u2019s Story Mode, Endless Mode, and a Time Attack mode. You unlock latter two modes by beating the Story Mode. In endless you can try and beat your highscore and also rank high on the leaderboards; same with the timed mode, you can try to beat your time and rank high on the leaderboards. Good old arcade-style gameplay model, which give the game a high replay value.\n\nNow, the Void Update.\nWith the Void Update a whole other section was added to the game, and this section is much, much harder. It adds more enemies with different mechanics, and it also adds a new boss, which is a pain in the ass to beat, to say the least.\n\n\n[h1]Visual:[/h1]\nThe graphics are an overload of visual stimulation. The sprites are fairly detailed and animations are fluous. Explosions and shots are brightly coloured and debris and particle effects are eye candy. Amazing art. Just wait until you fight the space-samurai, just wait.\n\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n8-bit sound effects and Savant\u2019s music make this game\u2019s audio something unique but at the same time nostalgic. Aleksander Vinter (Savant) has savant syndrome, this makes him able to remember every musical sound he\u2019s ever heard as well as make massive amounts of music in short periods of time. In his lifetime he\u2019s made over 10,000 songs; since adopting the alias \u201cSavant\u201d he has released eleven albums, seven EPs, and twelve singles. He has no definitive genre or sound, and is constantly experimenting with his music.\n\nFor this game he chose most songs from his dubstep-sounding albums: Alchemist, Cult, ISM, Ninur, Orakel, Vario, and Overkill. Not including the musical scores made specifically for the game.\n\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\nGameplay this simple and this addicting takes ingenuity to develop. D-Pad Studios took a world based on Savant\u2019s music and fleshed it out into a full universe. The Alchemist from the album Alchemist, Vario from the album Vario, and the Samurai from the album Protos.\n\nPersonally, I bought this game simply because I\u2019m a huge fan, had \u2018Savant\u2019 in its name, and because the trailer was featuring his music. What I was surprised to encounter was a ridiculously fun game with an amazing soundtrack and crazy good visuals. A must have for Savant fans and twin stick shooters alike.", "timestamp_created": 1464634759, "timestamp_updated": 1501567814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685135", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23258755": {"recommendationid": "23258755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042460330", "num_games_owned": 2114, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464462797}, "language": "english", "review": "Savant is a fast-paced, difficult game with beautiful pixel art and a neat approach on a platformer.

This game doesn't have any pretense of being too long or involved and really isn't. The hour or so it will take most people to get through the story mode on this is a fun hour w/ really no dull moments. If you are fine w/ that, this game is for you.\n\n2. It sort of feels like an old shareware title from back in the nineties where you got the first episode of the game for free and then had to pay to get the rest. Only in this case you pay up front and there is no more game when you're done.\n\n3. Just kidding, there are actually two extra modes unlocked once you've finished. Not the same as more levels but, hey, it does add some replayability beyond just going for a high score. \n\n4. This game goes out of its way to call attention to its soundtrack but the music is only pretty good.\n\n5. Graphics are also pretty good. \n\n6. Overall presentation strikes me somehow as just feeling very loud, almost feels like the game was designed to stand out in an arcade. I suppose the avalanche of indie titles these days does approximate the din of a packed arcade though so fair enough. I never would have played this were it not for the black metal sounding intro music in the trailer (which sadly devolves into some wubby techno). \n\n7. This controls better w/ mouse and keyboard than with a controller but it controls really well either way. There are definitely frustrating moments in this game but it's because you are a palsied and ill-coordinated nerd and not because you didn't doge in sync w/ your inputs. \n\n8. If you quit before you finish on your first session, you have to start at the beginning again but you maintain all your power ups so it's a bunch easier.\n\n9. There is a weird mechanic in this where you don't get to use any of your powerups until you die. This would make for a great hardcore challenge--to beat the game w/o dying means you don't get to use powerups--but *spoiler* you can't kill the final boss w/o the first power up. I saw an explanation from the devs about this and it still doesn't make any sense.\n\n10. Don't worry. You are almost certainly going to die on your first attempt and many times after that. Nobody who has seen the sun in the past fifteen years has spent enough time playing shmups to crush this thing on the first go. \n\n11. I dig that this is a Game Maker game. I once tried to make a Game Maker game to snowball into the indie game avalanche and only got as far as making a couple sprites flit about randomly while you shot bullets at them that did absolutely nothing.\n\n12. Games don't have to be big and complex to be good. They just have to be good.\n\n13. At the end of the day, my judge of an aracady shmup type game is if when I beat the final boss I give out my secret aracady shmup boss beating victory yell and I did that w/ this game.

What a strange beast of a game. Part twin stick shooter, part platformer, Savant - Ascent is a whirlwind of color, music, and exploding robots.

It's a weird game.

Very straight forward, but it works well.\n\nSavant is extremely short, however; with determination, you can probably beat it in a sitting, 100%. It's tough for sure, but nothing patience can't fix. If I had a problem with it, it's that when you aim at an enemy, the camera pulls towards them, leaving you blind in the opposite direction. Expect many, MANY, deaths because of that.

N\u00e4m\u00e4 pelin muutaman tasot, ovat hyvin haastavia.\nPeli on tarinansa puolesta lyhyt, mutta peli panostaa haastavuuteen joka tuntuu helposti murskaavan vaikealta. Peliss\u00e4 ei ole kontrollien puolesta kovinkaan paljoa opettelemista ja peliin p\u00e4\u00e4see sis\u00e4lle eritt\u00e4in helposti.

It revolves around a mysterious figure, who aims to climb a tower in order to find the secret source of magic. Countless and diverse types of enemies try to hinder him and you need to help him getting rid of the evil forces that guard the philosopher's stone.\n\n[h1] Design & Art [/h1]\nThe game is nicely designed and features an original gothical artstyle. The character and enemies look very detailed and well animated. In my opinion, the visuals were crafted with tender, love and care, they positively enhance the atmosphere of the game.\n\n[h1] Controls [/h1]\nControls are pretty straightforward; you aim with the mouse and the game offers a tutorial for the moves you are able to do. Also, the Savant - Ascent features complete controller support, for people who want to play that way. Nice!\n\n[h1] Sound & Music [/h1]\nThe soundtrack is what keeps this game alive. The game features a set of electronic/dubstep songs, that accompany you during your play. In my opinion, the music is really awesome and makes the game feel more arcady, even without repeating chiptunes!\n\nSounds are nice too. Overall, the sound of the game enhances the gameplay and lets you feel the action from start to finish. It really feels like you are playing an arcade game!\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThe gameplay is kept simple: you, enemies, shooting, surviving. You aim in the general direction enemies are in and shoot. That's it. Disc parts you can find or unlock throughout the game will give you a new track you can listen to, but they also grant you a special power (more damage etc.). There are different powers and all of them make you somewhat stronger. Try to find all of them, in order to beat the endgame content this game has to offer! \n\nChain up kills to increase your score multiplier and reach that sweet, sweet highscore in the leaderboards. But be careful not to get hit, since it reduces your multiplier, aswell as your lives. Three hits and it is game over for you!\n\nNext to a small story, this game features and endless mode, in which you have to survive as long as possible (and consecutively gain very many points). Lastly, there is a timed mode for the storymode, in which you will need to beat the game as fast as possible. Small eastereggs are also included.\n\n[h1] Weakpoints [/h1]\nUnfortunatly, music is (as always) a matter of taste. If you feel a strong dislike for said music, I would advise against buying this product.\n\nBe aware of the fact that this game is short and might not keep you engaged for a very long time. Fortunatly, the shortness is compensated with its price. Consider it a tasty snack you discover, so tasty you want to savor it by not eating it too often.\n\n[h1] Concluding Thoughts [/h1]\nSavant - Ascent is a game that could really be called a new age arcade game.\n\nFor a game that small in size and content, I really had lots of fun with it. The soundtrack enhanced my complete experience with it and kept my heart pumping and my head banging. The gameplay feels overly satisfying, wrecking some enemies with POWER OVERWHELMING has never felt that good for me. \n\nSo you should definetly give it a try, because Savant - Ascent took the term \"Brevity is the soul of wit.\" and \"Sometimes, less is more.\" very literal. So literal, that I can't even believe I didn't spend more than two dollars on this game.\n\nFriendly advice: Just be careful not to headbang too much or you'll wake up with neck muscle hangover the next day.", "timestamp_created": 1459076022, "timestamp_updated": 1459076022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22080041": {"recommendationid": "22080041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155438387", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494564816}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Incre\u00edble, sinceramente es un juego muy \u00e9pico que en tu biblioteca no debe faltar.

Like many other Steam users, I bought Savant as a part of a Humble Bundle and as with most of those bundles, a few games go unnoticed (especially if you have a massive library). Still I tried it and I was instantly hooked... for about 20 minutes. You see, for some reason (limited budget maybe?) the story mode of the game is only two levels and a boss fight, and while all three are challenging the first time around, still I finished all three stages in around 20 minutes. \n\nAnd it's a shame cause I really dig the mechanics of Savant - Ascent. Basically you control a character that can only move between two spots either by rolling or jumping. No there is no platforming, no level scrolling, nothing. You basically move between those two spots on the screen while shooting everything in sight until the end of the level. Get hit thrice and you are dead and you have to restart the level. Shoot enought enemies and you can fire a stronger shot that can destroy instantly multiple/harder targets. \n\nSimple stuff really, but done really well. The main problem is that there is so little on the plate here. Given the simplicity of the gameplay I would imagine making dozens of levels would be easy, since as said you never move in a level. \n\nStill, what little we have here is pretty amazing. The visuals are great, 2D well drawn characters, units and backdrops (not the \"cheap\" pixelated stuff we see on most indie games ou there), the music is amazing and the controls once you get used to them are pretty spot on. \n\nI would love a more complete product and even for the price I'm not sure I should recommend Savant -Ascent. It's like those classy gourmet meals you get at a fancy restaurant that you enjoy but never fill you up. If you have it in your library and never tried it, give it a go.

It took me 30 minutes to beat (with deaths), as it has 3 stages and some bonus stuff after that. It's good fun. 2 bucks is pushing it, but it does go on sale for 1 occasionally.\n\n[u]Graphics-[/u]\nDefinitely pretty for what it is. Textures have a nice painted look to them, everything is stylized nicely. No complaints.\n\n[u]Sound-[/u]\nMusic is a matter of taste. I have a pretty big range of musical preference. If you want to know whether you'll like the soundtrack or not, just look up the artist \"Savant\". I'm sure I'll botch the genre if I name it, everything has a specific subgenre and whatnot nowadays. Dubstep/electronic/wub wub. There you go.\n\n[u]Gameplay-[/u]\nPretty fun. Gets relatively challenging, you might die a few times. Overall not super super hard though. Very short. Basically 2 stages where you collect upgrades and the like, and are almost expected to die in order to collect and use them when you restart the stage you died in. Then there's a boss stage that's pretty easy. The boss fight was kind of a bummer to be honest. He literally says (spoiler I guess?) [spoiler]\"it's a me, Mario!\"[/spoiler] upon arrival and it just rubbed me the wrong way as a really lazy attempt at humor. Other than that, the controls are pretty simple. On a controller you use the right stick to shoot, left stick to dodge right, left or up, RT charge shot, LT grab upgrades. After you beat the game through once, you get access to some after stuff.

C'est surtout la prise en main qui met du temps au niveau difficult\u00e9, notre vision est en partie obstru\u00e9e sur le bord oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la vis\u00e9e et cela n\u00e9cessite d'\u00eatre un minimum vif et concentr\u00e9 pour suivre et exploser les vagues. On a un viseur dirig\u00e9 par la souris (jouable \u00e0 la manette aussi) qui nous permet de voir dans quelle direction tirer ce qui r\u00e9duit notre visibilit\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9 et le tir est au clic, on peut se d\u00e9placer entre 2 plateformes (ou plus suivant le stage) afin d'\u00e9viter les tirs et/ou de couvrir la vague par un flanc ou l'autre, d'autres \"comp\u00e9tences\" se d\u00e9bloquent apr\u00e8s r\u00e9cup\u00e9rations de morceaux de C.D. (ce qui d\u00e9bloque aussi une nouvelle musique \u00e0 chaque CD complet) et nous rend le jeu plus int\u00e9ressant par ses diverses capacit\u00e9s \u00e0 exploiter.\n\n\n[u]-Les Bonus[/u]\n\nD'autres modes de jeux sont disponibles si on r\u00e9ussi certains objectifs ce qui rel\u00e8ve encore le challenge!

The soundtrack alone would be a steal but you get an excellent game too!\n\nThe core gameplay of Savant - Ascent is quite simple but don't let that deter you. Its fluid, pulse raising action is a blast to play. The difficulty curve is just right for most of the game but got a bit steep for my liking right near the end. A steady stream of unlocks keeps things fresh throughout the main story and avoids overwhelming you. This isn't a very long game but it includes a few extras like time trial and endless modes that will please you if you like a challenge.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the final boss gets away from the frenetic gameplay and instead becomes an exercise in memorizing a static sequence of attacks. While the fight has an epic air to it, it lost the fun factor for me and became a chore to overcome in order to see the ending. Without spoiling anything, the ending suggests that the developers had more planned but it's unlikely that we'll see an expansion telling the rest. That is disappointing but considering that the story is told solely through short, nonverbal cutscenes, you can't claim that story was ever this game's strength or focus.\n\nIf you like electronic music you should enjoy the fantastic soundtrack. All the songs are accessible in .ogg format in the game's main files folder (typically C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\SavantAscent ). It's a testament to their quality that many of the tracks have found their way into my music library.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1445217029, "timestamp_updated": 1445217029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18547500": {"recommendationid": "18547500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017416715", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473108299}, "language": "french", "review": "best game EVAAAAAR", "timestamp_created": 1445170264, "timestamp_updated": 1445170264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18516199": {"recommendationid": "18516199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098082049", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445117125}, "language": "english", "review": "best dubstep game ever that all 10/10 love this guy music", "timestamp_created": 1445049536, "timestamp_updated": 1445049536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18510014": {"recommendationid": "18510014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027295232", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445025807}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice graphics, Challenging gameplay.

I've been wanting to play a game like this! A really simple yet so awesome game!\nAlright, back to reviewing. \n\nThis game is a 2D Shooter where your character (Savant) can only moves to one of the two available platform, where you can only dodge and shoot the enemy. Not to mention, the enemies came from EVERYWHERE, literally. \"But if the enemies came from everywhere, then how are you going to dodge their attacks???\" Don't worry, you got to kinds of dodge movement; jump and platform switch. Though there's no invincibility frame when you're doing that, unless you picked up a piece of CD from some fallen golden enemy. \n\nThe gameplay is easy enough after you got all the power ups (or CD). But don't wish that you will easily get them all, as they're time tracked rather than random drops. (you should know between normal CDs and Power up CDs from their color) The last CDs, you can only get them in 'Endless Mode' by surviving for 4-5 mins if i remember. \n\nThe boss battles? Well, they're quite easy after you figure out what you need to do. (Thou, the samurai boss battle is kinda hard, as he can just 1 hit kill you) \nThe hardest level? Probably the void update's level, as you need to keep your ARSEteroids save from all the enemy that tries to destroy your platfrom by drilling it. \n\nOh yeah, almost forgot to mention this one thing! This game's OST, 10/10, best soundtrack. Why? Because the OST is just full of Savant's greatest songs!(Imo) Such as I**, K4****, S******, and others. (Don't want to spoil you on this one) \n\nWell, this is just how this game from my point of view. \nOfuya n'ya Outo", "timestamp_created": 1443315318, "timestamp_updated": 1443315318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18194397": {"recommendationid": "18194397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072042052", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450043502}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple dual analog control with tri-platform game makes for a fun and challenging game.

The most important things to know going in are that it's a high score and achievement driven game. The more achievements and collectibles you get in game, the more your character grows in power. I personally still find some of the camera decisions poor, but they are at the least tolerable and only get particularly annoying in the endless mode. The art direction for the game is superb and I look forward to seeing more of it from this studio's future titles. The fact that some of the non-obvious secrets lead to essential power-ups for post-game content is a bit unforgiving. However, this problem is easily corrected by just checking one of the Steam guides when you get frustrated with why you are having so many problems while this game is sitting at 95%+ positive reviews. The final boss design is pretty terrible, though - one-hit kills until you slog through the pattern once and realize what you are doing wrong at each step. Then you just have to sit through it until you can deal enough damage to the boss to make it stop. And while I appreciate that the soundtrack is mutable (you will need to do this after about 5 minutes), the final boss music still plays. Maybe a bug, but it's stupid to give players the option to mute the music and then force it to play regardless. Overall, $1-2 game - it's pretty good if you reference a guide when you start having problems. I've had this sitting in my 'junk' category for a couple of years and it turned out to be all right when I went to mine some trading cards.", "timestamp_created": 1442791143, "timestamp_updated":

For those who don't know, Savant is an electronic musician who composes in countless genres and has an extremely fast output rate with well over 10,000 tracks composed in his lifetime.\n\nPros: \n- Tons of replayabiilty with time attack mode, and endless mode.\n- Outstanding soundtrack.\n- Worldwide leaderboards.\n- Very challenging boss battle with the Samurai that requires you to memorise his moves.\n- Great design on the stages - has a gothic feel like the Cult album artwork.\n\nCons: \n- Can be a bit hard to get all the cd's at first, but when you do the game is even more fun.\n- Only 7 of Aleks tracks featured in the game. Please add more soon!!\n\nSummary:\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone hesitant to get it. It's a fantastic price for a fantastic game, and who knows, maybe after a listen to the soundtrack you'll also become a fan of Savant!\n\nPS: Please add trading cards!!

Really nice indie game made in GameMaker Studio. Graphics makes this game more retro-styled and it's awesome. Plus, you can collect in-game disc parts and once you have full disc, you will unlock Savant track. Perfectly suited for every battle, every level and you will feel so strong and powerful. Wait. No.. You ARE strong and powerful ! Crushing every enemy with super-powers obtained from discs. Sadly this game is short, BUT, with the new Void update it's slightly longer ! Because, Vario boss was hard for the first time, but if you know what to do, you can easily beat him. And with powers from discs even faster. However, 2 new stages including Void boss has been added with an amazing soundtrack called Overkill. Void is really, really hard to beat and it will take it some time, to learn what to do, and how to NOT get killed.

I really liked Savant before I even knew about this game, and when I found out that this existed, I had to get it. It was amazing from day 1: Pure, no-nonsense ass-kicking, and Savant's awesome music. But, then the Samurai shows up. Up until that point the game is all about skill and speed, after, well, it's just pattern recognition. It makes me feel like a three-year-old with a Little Einsteins toy. 'Press this key when this sound plays' that kind of thing. Another thing that gets me is how out of place some of the songs are. I can get behind ISM and Melody Circus, they sound adventure-y and damn badass, I can even understand butterfly, maybe even Kali 47. But, things like Organismical and Bach to the Phuture seem out of place. Where's No Time For Pussy? where's Splinter? Anything from his newer albums? But, that's all in all just a minor gripe. My big problem is with the Smaurai. He could be a fukcing badass boss that you would have to think outside the box to beat. He could've had all kinds of complex attacks and powers and strategies. Instead we got Robot-Samurai-Dubstep-Little Einsteins.

You are essentially rooted to two spots on each level, you can roll between them to avoid enemies, jump up and down, and that's it - although this sounds like it is restricting, you soon realize that it's all you need, and you probably don't need an extra thing to think about, so having just two positions is quite a good idea. \n\nThe art style is very nice. A lot of games are taking on this graphic style, and rightfully still as it does look good. The sprites of the main character and all the enemies look awesome too. Now, the music, if you are into electro/dubstep music, you may just have stumbled upon a gold mine. The sound track to Savant is amazing, there are about six different tracks to unlock and each of them is probably one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear. I am surprised they haven't released the sound track as its own download to be honest! \n\nEach of the levels is presented very well; the aim is to just kill everything on screen for a number of minutes, nothing too complex. The game does get increasingly difficult though, it will probably take you a few tries on each level before you get to grips with what you have to do. The last two stages probably had me raging more than any other game I've played. That brings me onto game length, the game is very short, I managed to finish the story in just about an hour, while this is short, there are two other game modes that will keep the replayability going. I can see some people have over 100 hours in this game purely from these modes bringing them back for more. \n\nI would say Savant - Ascent has a place in most people's library, it's short and sweet and for \u00a31, 59, you can't really go wrong can you?\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I have to admit that I have no idea about what I should talk about first. When I bought, for 2$, I never expected it to give me so many hours of fun. I thought it would be a 15 minutes game and that I'd never launch it again after finishing it. Looking at my time in game might inform you of how wrong I was. \n\nShort version : If you're looking for a 2D shmup with an awesome OST, go for it.\n\nLonger version : I was already a fan of Savant and his other works (as Vinter in Hollywood/Vegas, and his other band names) before knowing the game. When I discovered the game, I didn't think I'd appreciate it so much. First of all, the songs of the OST, which are Savant's work from different albums (Alchemist, Overkill, ISM, Vario, Orakel and Cult), fit perfectly in the nervous gameplay. The difficulty which increases along the levels is here, but it isn't too big, and it permits to have fun even after the twentieth try (gotta admit I ragequited a few times, but that's another story). And when you're finished with the five levels and if you love tryharding and competition, you'll love the Endless and Time Trial mode, which require some patience and skills (and ragequits) to master. Also, the characters from Savant's lore like Vario, the Samurai (spoiler : they are the bosses (spoiler: they're fucking hard at first)) and the Alchemist (the protagonist, who can be seen on Alchemist's album cover) aren't too much (I don't know how to say it, so I'll just assume you got the idea). The only thing that's bad for the game in my opinion are the bugs, but they're funnier than boring and the developer listens to the player and push updates from time to time.\n\ntl;dr savant memes tryhard godlike ost GOTY (got it ?) game 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1428519471, "timestamp_updated": 1428519471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511408", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15263400": {"recommendationid": "15263400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041745686", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427994463}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Savant Ascent [/h1]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Game Stage[/th]\n        [th]Score[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Early Access[/td]\n        [td]N/A[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Beta[/td]\n        [td]N/A[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Complete/Updates[/td]\n        [td]4/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1428496136, "timestamp_updated": 1483105869, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15250820": {"recommendationid": "15250820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089102913", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510065571}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3068\u3066\u3082\u9762\u767d\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\n\u5e8f\u76e4\u306f\u5c11\u3057\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u611f\u3058\u307e\u3059\u304c\u6163\u308c\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3068\n\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306b\u653b\u6483\u3092\u304b\u308f\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306e\u306f\u304b\u3063\u3053\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1428418188, "timestamp_updated": 1428418188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15231306": {"recommendationid": "15231306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087766230", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452112119}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen Juego, Balanceado en Graficos y Jugabilidad, Excelente Banda Sonora, Por favor... es Savant Joder!! *-*", "timestamp_created": 1428305484, "timestamp_updated": 1428305484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15227871": {"recommendationid": "15227871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036478094", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486798976}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, when I saw this game it was on saly for $0.99 (usd), I was VERY bored, and was looking for something to keep me busy for about 5-10 minutes.

Odd. Highly out of place. You'd expect some sort of title music in most of your games to give you a sense of what to expect, depending on the overall theme right on entry.\n\nPress Start, and your're treated to - what essentially boils down to - a slide show of stills showing you the story of what has occurred that leads up to your adventure as you \"ascend\" the tower. Quite literal. While not the most engaging, it's highly effective in its presentation. The lack of animation here is actually something I appreciated. It was out of place, much like the lack of title music, but it gave me all I needed to understand and infer the plot.\n\nNext thing you know, the game begins! \n\nYou're treated to a short tutorial explaining the basic functions: X or Left Trigger to grab CD pieces, Right Stick to shoot your glowies of color, Left Stick to dodge. Simplistic.\n\nThe only thing is, you will die. \n\nIf you manage to continue at your base from New Game, I applaud you. But you WILL die. It's actually necessary that you do... If you've been collecting those CD pieces. They act as both your BGM and as your Power Up. \n\nDUAL FUNCTIONALITY! \n\nEach CD amounts to four pieces that you get from specific mechanized enemies that give off a yellow/goldish sheen. Take them out, and the piece is yours; you can get up to six CDs, each one adding a different mechanic that is NECESSARY to your progression. \n\nAfter death, you begin again at the section that you left off, rather than starting back at the beginning. If you pause, you may choose to restart your section if need be. (FYI: It becomes handy, and almost needed, to begin at the beginning when you get your 5th Power Up and a certain \"stone\".)\n\nFor each CD you collect, you get a different musical style to accompany you. Most of it falls under the general genre of \"Dubstep\" and \"Electro\" - two of which I'm familiar with. While I don't like Dubstep too much, it adds to the retro-style look of the game with Chiptune themes and flourishes. The first four CDs are Dubstep, with the fifth being Drum & Bass.

The chiptune-ish, 8-bit feel gave his music a kick that other songs never quite captured, and the overall melody and chord progression of his style was simply unmatched. So, like many, I was caught off guard when I learned that he was creating a game. After purchasing this and playing it for a while (I downloaded it onto my phone thanks to buying through Humble Bundle, and I racked up nearly ten hours alone on my phone version.), I have to say that this game is worth the price tag offered. Maybe even more. Not only do you get to hear several amazing tracks by Vinter, but you also get to experience a gorgeously made game with simplistic, but engaging, game mechanics. The difficulty progresses at a steady, but manageable, rate, and the rewards come easy enough that they would not cause frustration when trying to obtain them while still keeping the feel of difficulty and challenge.\nOverall, for what went into the development of it, this game is worth the price tag and worth the time.

You just spent the entire time holding down the analog stick and spraying shots at guys. The lack of character control is made further worse as dozens of guys spawn on the screen faster than you can kill them, and come at you in packs. hopefully one of the 2 spots is open or your rolling will just get you hurt and you take damage no matter what you do, which is a major game flaw. You can only get hit 3 times per level before you die, which is dumb based on how many guys come at once and how many waves there are.

Why do only two of my friends have it?!?!?  This is $1.99?!?!?  Is that even legal?!?!?!\n\nIn all seriousness though this game, oh man.  I had about 3 bucks left over in my steam account from the 2014 Winter Sale.  I was browsing the cheapest games.  Most everything was trash, but this caught me eye.  I saw the reviews were good and the soundtrack was cool.  I'm a sucker for soundtracks so I went ahead and got it.  I installed it and loaded it up.  About 10 minutes in I was having some fun, the beats were sweet and the controls were tight.  Then I got to the second level which upped the difficulty and I was getting into it.  Then I unlocked the next soundtrack.  I was listening with my crappy laptop speakers but then I put my headphones on.  It was like a barrage of beats penetrating my ears.  It was pure euphoria.  The game apparently at launch was only 3 levels but now there are two more, an endless mode, and insane upgrades.  Hands down the best $1.99 I ever spent.  When I played the endless mode I was hooked.  The night I got it I played for 2 hours straight.  That is really rare for me.  What are you waiting for?

Bits and pieces of something kept popping in all over the screen while I tried to figure out how to get the game to function with a Logitech controller - which it won't, by the way. That said, you won't really need a controller for Savant, it's played mostly with the mouse, which is not in itself a bad thing.\n\nAnother minor problem is that I none of the resolutions on offer fit my screen, all of them leaving part of the screen behind my taskbar. One of them changed the position of the window, placing the top of the window above the screen, making me unable to drag the window until I changed the resolution yet again. There is no full-screen or windowed full screen option.\n\nAnd the music is unremarkable.

C'est d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able de perdre tout le temps, de mourir \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9titions, de ce retaper le m\u00eame niveau cinquante heures durant. C'est pour cela que j'aime la musique, sa me d\u00e9tend. Je vois la vie diff\u00e9remment, sous un autre angle, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plus positif que le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Mais la musique me donne aussi du courage, tel un chant tribal avant la bataille, ou un verre de whisky avant la demande en mariage. Dans tout les cas  la musique joue sur mes sentiments, mes \u00e9motions.La musique mais pas que, les jeux-vid\u00e9os aussi. Oui, me direz-vous, mais lesquelles\u00a0? Et bien un en particulier. J'ai ressenti de l'admiration envers ce jeu, de la haine, du soulagement, de la col\u00e8re, de la satisfaction, j\u2019eus m\u00eame ri quelques fois. Mais au final je ne peux lui en vouloir.\n\n\tVous ne voyez toujours pas de quelle jeu je veux parl\u00e9\u00a0? Savant-Ascent. Un Shoot'em up-like. D\u00e9velopper par DPad studios et paru le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2013, ce petit jeu \u00e0 fait un bon bout de chemin et \u00e0 pas mal gagner en maturit\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces nombreux patchs. Il poss\u00e8de tout ce qu'un Schump doit avoir\u00a0: Une certaine difficult\u00e9 mais des contr\u00f4les simples et bien rod\u00e9s, des ennemis occupant 90\u00a0% de votre \u00e9cran du fait de leur nombres, et enfin des boss. \n\tJusque l\u00e0, rien a redire sur S-A mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 rajouter. Certes,  la prise en main et simple et intuitive (3 actions de base\u00a0: sauter, aller a gauche, aller \u00e0 droite\u00a0; plus 1 action d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9e plus tard qui consiste a charger son \u00e9nergie en appuyant sur \u00ab\u00a0s\u00a0\u00bb) mais la difficult\u00e9 est pr\u00e9sente et ce imm\u00e9diatement. Ce n'est pas le gameplay la difficult\u00e9, vu qu'il ne consiste qu'\u00e0 tirer sur des mobs pour les occire et \u00e0 ramasser des morceaux de CD d'or. Nan, la difficult\u00e9 ce situe sur la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter les informations que le jeu nous envoie, et \u00e0 s'en servir \u00e0 bonne escient. Le nombre d'ennemis ne faisant qu'augmenter cette difficult\u00e9.\n\n\tJe vous parlez de ramasser des morceaux de CD d'or, et si vous \u00eates un peu curieux, vous devez vous demander ce que cela a \u00e0 voir avec ce jeu. Le lien est d'une simplicit\u00e9 et d'une logique \u00e0 toute \u00e9preuve\u00a0: Lorsque l'on ramasse un fragment on gagne un peu d'\u00e9nergie (n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'envoi de sort plus puissant), une fois arriv\u00e9 a 4 fragment on recr\u00e9er un CD d'or. Celui-ci nous d\u00e9bloque de nouvelle comp\u00e9tence mais aussi de nouveaux soundtracks. C'est ici que le jeu d\u00e9voile toute sont inventivit\u00e9. Je veux dire, Savant-Ascent n'a pas r\u00e9inventer son genre, mais il y a ajouter sa touche personnelle. D\u00e9bloquer des comp\u00e9tence en m\u00eame temps que de somptueux soundtracks, que l'on choisit \u00e0 chaque mort ce qui permet de ne jamais avoir la m\u00eame musique, et vraiment une bonne id\u00e9e. C'est b\u00eate mais fallait y penser n'est ce pas\u00a0?\n\n\tJe ne vous est pas tout d\u00e9voiler de ce jeu. J'ai m\u00eame essayer de vous fournir une approche tr\u00e8s \u00e9pur\u00e9e de celui-ci. J'aurais pu vous parler de ces graphismes correct, voir m\u00eame bon, ou j'aurai pu approfondir l'approche de son gameplay bien penser, simple et fun \u00e0 jouer. Mais non, je veux que vous soyez curieux, que vous allez chercher par vous m\u00eame directement dans le jeu, achetez le. Il en vaut le coup, de plus il n'est pas cher.

Baddies charge at you and you need to get out the way; this gets tricker as the game goes on and is great stuff.\n\nThis all falls apart due to one fatal flaw which is the moving camera, you see the camera moves in the direction you are shooting in so you are blind sided from every direction except the one you are shooting. To make matters worse, moving prevents shooting, so you can't just hop around to avoid getting hit otherwise too many enemies will appear and you will die.\n\nEverything about the game is either good or great. The art direction the various soundtracks (yes you can pick different soundtracks as you play!) the controls (although admittedly they are limited and simple) are good but the whole challenge of the game is dodging enemy attacks or enemies altogether so its a huge, huge promblem that you can hardly see where the enemies are coming from in order to dodge them.\n\nIt's a handicap that ruins what is otherwise an amazing gaming experience and while progress in the game will unlock ways to help deal with this, it is clear it was a design intention but sadly a misguided one because games like Contra are hard; like Metal Slug are challenging but those are great games! No will look down on you for copying the tried and tested method of making a run and gun game! \n\nIf you can deal with the camera moving around all the time then you will enjoy the game but for me I really really tried hard and everytime I got into the game I just couldn't look past how much better the game would be, without giving me motion sickness. :(\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews", "timestamp_created": 1421523756, "timestamp_updated": 1427848211, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14031921": {"recommendationid": "14031921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022888360", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421791276}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que vicio!!!

I'm just disappointed, and where to start.\n\nWell, it's a one-stick shooter. The store description makes Savant sound agile and mobile. You CANNOT walk, and only jump between 2 platforms on screen. Oh, but it's a game about climbing the tower? That involves one screen of fighting enemies until the elevator starts moving, a second screen as the elevator flies to the top, and a third screen with the boss fight ending. An update did add 2 more sections, but they don't change much. The core game can be easily beaten in 10 minutes, with some time attacks under 2 minutes.\n\nGameplay is simple, jump and shoot. There are some extra mechanics with the first shot, charge shots, and grapples, but they are unlocked by beating the game. So the early parts are only difficult or time-consuming because you have no damage or abilities unlocked. Once you collect everything, the game becomes trivial enough that you hardly need to jump to avoid damage. There are only 5 enemy types, and combat switches between bullet-spongy grinds to easy mode once you unlock the last CD.\n\nOh yea, the music is a thing. It's not what I expected from the store video. I like maybe 2 of the 7 tracks, but they are all short enough that they loop and repeat. Music tracks only switch when you pause the game to select a new one, unless the game decides to switch to the Wyrm spawn song. I know the game is absurdly short, but the soundtrack should at least vary enough to last the length. Some people argue the cost is worth for the songs alone, but there is so much free music available now from generous artists, I can't recommend this game's music unless you already like the specific artists. If you are a chiptune-dubstep fan, you can probably find free songs from other artists.\n\nThere may be more content coming, but at this point I have to consider the game effectively complete. The Void update nearly doubled the game content, which is nice, but I'd think there should've been some big Early Access banners for how short and incomplete the game was. Simple bugs still remain, navigating too far in the music selection will crash the game. \n\nThe graphics are amazing and I love the style, but the game just stumbles too much to end so soon. It feels like a demo, and only gains depth once the game is nearly finished. That leaves score attack content as the only reason to replay, but I expected a complete game. I suppose it was a fair deal at 50% off, completing everything in 4 hours. I still feel misled, as the store neglected to point out that walking around was not a feature. It feels like a Newgrounds game with excellent art, but I can't recommend unless you know what you are getting here.", "timestamp_created": 1420264736, "timestamp_updated": 1420264736, "voted_up":

The dubstep music is very welcoming and is easily the star of the show, but the gameplay is very well planned out as well.  At first, the dodging system feels a little too limited, but the dodging became far more useful as the game progressed.  Shooting things, while initially fun, seemed like it was going to become repetitive.  Boss battles, however, are extremely challenging, and you constantly have to experiment with strategies to figure out how to win each battle.\n\nThe challenge is the biggest hurdle.  The game gives you very little get-to-know-the-game time before throwing challenges at you, but as you unlock CDs, you also unlock abilities which make the game a little more bearable.  I found myself rage-quitting at the third big swarm battle because I not only had to protect myself but I also had to protect my platforms, which were honestly not very easy to protect, even with the dodge-to-regain-power ability.

Sure enough, they have and my opinion of the game has changed slightly. I would still only recommend this game to the hardcore gamers, but after figuring out that you can unlock new attacks and skills through collecting golden disks, gameplay got a little easier. But the game never really explains this unless you actually read the description of the disks after you unlock them, which I hadn't done before. Getting one disk in particular (disk 6) is a nightmare for me though because it requires you to play the game's \"endless\" mode and survive past wave 4 which might sound simple but is truely a test of skill to behold. This is where the game turns into controller breaking frustration as your progess is pretty much halted if you can't get this one disk to acheive the true ending to the game. At $2.99 current price, I'd say pick it up just for the experience at least.\n\n-----\nOld Review:\nPersonally It's not my cup of tea. It's got vibrant animation, great sound track and crisp, clear graphics. It's a fast paced shooter with plenty of thrills and kills to go around. For many people who love bullet hells, you might just like this one. Me on the otherhand feel that the difficulty of this game can rival that of Darksouls, and unfortunately that's a turn off for me. The game is meant to be difficult of course and I'm not faulting it for that, but there are times where there is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent an innevitable death as the enemies clutter up the screen faster than you can shoot them down, and your only means of dodging are jumping between 2 platforms in an effort to get out of the enemy's line of attack.

Tras este nombre se esconde Aleksander Vinter, un productor noruego de m\u00fasica electronica que sufre del \"S\u00edndrome de Savant\", el cual se define como un transtorno derivado del autismo que confiere a quienes lo sufren capacidades anormalmente amplias en campos como el arte, el c\u00e1lculo, la memoria y la capacidad cerebral. Aprovech\u00e1ndose de su transtorno, Aleksander se ha convertido en pocos a\u00f1os en un autor inquietantemente prol\u00edfico, de talento desmesurado, y ante todo, extra\u00f1o; el cual aliado con un t\u00edmido pero poderoso D-Pad Studio, nos trae un divertido videojuego con un impresionante apartado art\u00edstico y una esencia dif\u00edcil de encontrar en otros s\u00edmiles.\n\nLa trama en s\u00ed, no representa mucha complejidad. Expuesta tan solo mediante una breve cinem\u00e1tica de introducci\u00f3n al comienzo del juego en la cual se deja ver como Savant, convertido en una especie de alter-ego inspirado en los villanos m\u00e1s t\u00edpicos del mundillo (el cual tambi\u00e9n \"encarna\" en sus canciones), se cae de lo m\u00e1s alto de una torre debido a su contacto fallido con una extra\u00f1a esfera de energ\u00eda. El concepto de nuestro objetivo, de nuevo se presenta de forma simple: debemos subir de nuevo al piso m\u00e1s alto para controlar esa energ\u00eda desatada.\n\nLa sencillez, en este caso es una virtud clara. Si bien los creadores pudieron haberse extendido m\u00e1s dando explicaciones sobre el lore creado por Savant, o simplemente extender esta rama que nos concierne,  ajustaron sus movimientos para crear una historia corta y nada barroca que sin embargo sintetiza en una aventura fresca y eficaz. Es as\u00ed como, h\u00e1bilmente, se crea un videojuego equilibrado que nos oferta oleadas de diversi\u00f3n sin exceder demasiado en sus capacidades, d\u00e1ndonos los justo y nada m\u00e1s. Se agradece a la par el nivel de dificultad, ciertamente elevado, el cual nos concede un desaf\u00edo m\u00e1s duro; adem\u00e1s de la forma de solventar la corta amplitud vital del t\u00edtulo con diferentes modos de juego y una buena capacidad rejugable.\n\nEl apartado jugable tambi\u00e9n peca de sencillo, pero quiz\u00e1 no congenia tan bien como lo hace la trama. B\u00e1sicamente, el juego nos sit\u00faa entre dos plataformas est\u00e1ticas, situadas una a cada lado de la pantalla, siendo nuestro \u00fanico escenario. Solo podremos movernos entre esas dos, bien rodando, bien saltando, para esquivar a los enemigos y disparar a todo lo que nos parezca amenazador en un \u00e1ngulo de 360\u00ba. Es un hecho, adem\u00e1s, la ausencia pr\u00e1cticamente total de lo que tildar\u00edamos de errores o 'bugs', compensando esta simpleza; adem\u00e1s de contar con un h\u00e1bil sistema de poderes desbloqueables bien equilibrado; y con un ritmo fren\u00e9tico y astuto que nos har\u00e1 ansiar la mayor puntuaci\u00f3n posible en cada una de nuestras partidas. \n\nEn lo tocante al tema visual, estamos ante uno de los puntos fuertes del producto. Los artistas de D-Pad Studio muestran una habilidad y un talento asombroso a la hora de dibujar, como podemos ver en el prometedor e inacabado proyecto de la misma casa, \"Owlboy\". Cada apartado, desde el personaje protagonista hasta los enemigos, pasando por unos cuidados efectos visuales, muestran una dedicaci\u00f3n a cuerpo y alma desmesurada en calidad de p\u00edxeles. Adem\u00e1s de estar tan bien concepcionados, el hecho de que se muestren tan sincronizados con el ambiente creado por la soberbia intervenci\u00f3n musical y la din\u00e1mica del juego, aportan bagaje a lo que no deja de ser un producto extraordinario. Todas esas tonalidades oscuras, la calidad gr\u00e1fica de los entornos, y lo adecuado de sus efectos, nos hacen una grata aproximaci\u00f3n a lo que ser\u00eda la visi\u00f3n del m\u00fasico de su propio mundo imaginario y art\u00edstico.\n\nHablando de temas fuertes: la m\u00fasica. Si el juego, basado en la figura de un m\u00fasico de la figura de Savant pecase de mediocre, no estar\u00eda escribiendo este an\u00e1lisis. Es un hecho que el comprador, fan o no del compositor, espera una impecable caricia a sus o\u00eddos, cosa que se cumple con creces en este nuestro analizado. Con varias de las canciones del joven introducidas directamente en los escenarios (d\u00e1ndonos la posibilidad incluso de elegir entre ellas) nos deleitaremos en cada disparo con las obras de este genio musical. Si a esto le a\u00f1adimos un buen pu\u00f1ado de efectos de sonido muy adecuados al estilo de m\u00fasica de Savant y que adem\u00e1s acompasan a la perfecci\u00f3n con el resto de apartados, tenemos la perfecta combinaci\u00f3n. Quiz\u00e1, es cierto, una opci\u00f3n acertada hubiera sido la de ensanchar la cantidad de canciones dentro del juego, ya que se pueden volver repetitivas para nuestra audici\u00f3n tras varias horas de juego si no somos ac\u00e9rrimos seguidores del autor.\n\nEn resumen, estamos ante un producto muy notable, con una gran calidad dentro del apartado audiovisual y una astuta organizaci\u00f3n jugable que nos har\u00e1 divertirnos un buen rato machacando botones. Si eres un fan del m\u00fasico, es claramente un producto que debes comprar; si no, es un buen comienzo para llegar a conocer su vasta obra. Una pena que se disfrute en pocas horas y que la presencia del m\u00fasico en el desarrollo del juego no se haga tan patente como debiera.", "timestamp_created": 1419380820, "timestamp_updated": 1419380841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13555103": {"recommendationid": "13555103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156903274", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421280208}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, awesome graphics, awesome music \\m/ Highly addictive :)", "timestamp_created": 1419371315, "timestamp_updated": 1419371315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13549907": {"recommendationid": "13549907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044313549", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514413465}, "language": "english", "review": "this s ne of the best hidden steam gems there are atm \n\n- addicting gameplay\n\n-tons of  awsome music\n\n-really well thought bosses designs\n\nI cant really think of a reason why you shouldn't buy this game totally worth those 2 bucks", "timestamp_created": 1419357501, "timestamp_updated": 1419357501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13549061": {"recommendationid": "13549061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025788133", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452117360}, "language": "english", "review": "Savant - Ascent has to have been my best 79 pence I have spent all year. As a fan of Dubstep and the man himself since he released ISM, its amazing to see him rise to prominence, even if it includes a video game.\n\nThe simplicity of the game bedazzles me, basically its an Arcade/Action style shooter, where you fend off hoards of enemies whilst on either two available platforms, or an elevator of some kind. Facing off against these enemies can sometimes be a challenge especially for me, especially on the Time Attack and Endless game modes this game offers. Some enemies in this game will offer CD pieces when destroyed, and can be collected to form full CD's that offer 1. Sweet music from Savant's previous albums and 2. Exclusive powers to give you an advantage during play.\n\nThe game offers limited controls, Left, Right, Mouse Control for aim and Space for Jumping. This makes it a simple game to play for anyone who wishes to reminisce over old arcade shooters. Like myself.\n\nThe music you collect through CD's can be selected at will, they are offered as Savant's old songs from his previous albums, they are Ascent, Bach To The Phuture from the Ninur album, ISM from the ISM album, Kali 47 and Butterfly from the Cult album, Fat Cat Shuffle and Melody Circus from the Alchemist album, Organismical from his recent Orakel album and Vario 64 from his Overkill Album.\n\nOverall, I love this game not because I am a fan of Savant, but because this sort of game is so challenging it makes me want to bash my computer in with a Sledgehammer (No pun intended)\n\n- 9/10 - Great gameplay, simplistic, adrenaline pumping music and not enough Manslaughter (No pun intended)", "timestamp_created": 1419355025, "timestamp_updated": 1419355025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13544184": {"recommendationid": "13544184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059231569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505144615}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really fun.", "timestamp_created": 1419338216, "timestamp_updated": 1473768784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.981901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13541144": {"recommendationid": "13541144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965676253", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419415436}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fantastic game.

First of all I purchased this game to support Savant, he's an awesome artist and a cool guy in general. I didn't expect much looking at the pricetag so I entered the game with very low expectations, the first few minutes of the game were confusing but I noticed (and instantly liked) one of savants songs playing as I shot laser beams at the flying metal robot things. I died a few times and got kind of frustrated but then I noticed that I had found 4 parts of a Golden CD. I was pleased to find that I had unlocked a new song and a new ability so I figured, why not play some more! A few minutes later I had found another CD with a new and epic ability and I really started liking the game, however it is not a long game by any means, I was done after half an hour or so... Again I was going to put down the game, generally pleased with how it played out... But then I noticed  the \"survival\" and \"time attack\" modes with leaderboards. So far I have had a blast with those for 2 hours and I do not think I will stop enjoying them soon.\nOne of the greatest things about this game is the community (the steam Community Hub that is) I went on the forum only to find that some guy were giving out free games to whoever beats his incredible leaderboard ranks, and generally people seem to be very friendly and polite to eachother.\n\nGreat fucking game! 10/10 Considering it's price. Would buy again, over and over.\n-Derpagon\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2hbn2pRaUk]A short video of me playing Time Attack!", "timestamp_created": 1419105509, "timestamp_updated": 1419105509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13479457": {"recommendationid": "13479457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098539869", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461399092}, "language": "english", "review": "BUY THIS NOW ITS AWESOME great soundtrack, and very addicting", "timestamp_created": 1419103476, "timestamp_updated": 1419103476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13473734": {"recommendationid": "13473734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005273400", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436466066}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "This game will make your fingers contort, eyes cross several times, make your eyes bleed rainbows, and it will all feel so damned good!\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1419086866, "timestamp_updated": 1419086866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13468691": {"recommendationid": "13468691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065141595", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431160509}, "language": "french", "review": "Pour 2\u20ac (un en solde!) ce jeu est vraiment un bonne investisement, avec une durer de vie de 2-3h pour un joueur lambda, elle peut monter facilement \u00e0 10-20-30h \u00e0 qui veut le finir \u00e0 100%!\nDe plus les grafisme sont tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able et le gameplay bien qu'inabituel est plaisant.\nBref acheter ce jeu, c'est de l'or!", "timestamp_created": 1419070187, "timestamp_updated": 1419070187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13466338": {"recommendationid": "13466338", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974698125", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423042763}, "language": "english", "review": "Great 2-d graphics and animations, banging soundtrack!!! simple to play yet tough to master..

Savant, your character, is stationed at the center of the screen, on one of two platforms, and your goal is to survive the hordes of enemies around you. You can \"dodge\" by quickly switching platforms, which will keep you alive much longer if used correctly. Power-ups, unlocked by collecting CD pieces dropped by certain enemies, make the the game a little more interesting, and the levels get more difficult, but the basic gameplay remains the same.\n\nIt's fun blasting away enemies, having to decide which enemies to target, how best to use your abilities to defeat them. But the pixel graphics and the amazing soundtrack by Savant (no, that's not a coincidence) aren't enough to conceal the repetitiveness of the gameplay. This game is more of a score attack than a constantly evolving experience, since most of the replay value comes from attempting to beat previous scores.

It's fairly hard at first but as you collect these in-game objects that are CD pieces and complete them to become full CD's, you unlock powers that makes the Savant stronger, such as shooting missiles after rolling.  Not only that but completing each CD unlocks a new soundtrack to listen to and every soundtrack is awesome and matches the hectic pace of the game.

I had no idea what I was stepping into (like most games I get from humble bundles), but I actually really liked it.  You need to focus during this game.

You have infinite bullets, and can only occupy two positions.  When getting to the opposite position you can either slide to it or jump to it (basically your dodge ability).  As you kill more enemies, they drop quarters of discs that unlock both new music and new powers.  Once you are dead, you restart from the level you started at on that playthrough, but when you die, all the discs you collected are formed together to create your powers and music.\n\nI was hesitant to recommend this game at first, but it eventually stood up to it's name.

There are a couple of things worth noting before making that steep, steep investment of $2. \n\nWub Wub Wub\nIf you like dubstep, you will love the soundtrack. An integral part of the game is collecting pieces of CDs that simultaneously expands your powers while expanding your listening options. \n\nIf dubstep really isn't your thing, this game won't change your mind. You may be inclided to mute the sound and listen to your own music instead.\n\nYou Will Die - A LOT. \nAt the start of each game, you are allowed to be hit three times before you die. The game saves your progress each time you ascend to the next level, and will start there each time you pick the game back up. Your survival along the way will rely on your ability to dodge and shoot at the same time. The game's fast speed and high degree of difficultly are what make it engaging.  Whether you rise to the challenge or rage quit will depend on your tolerance for it. In fact, a good portion of the game's difficulty arises from the next point.\n\nTight Camera Focus\nThis is the only pure negative I have about the game. The focus of the camera is zoomed in on the character, leaving your surroundings unseen. Your first dozen or so deaths will likely result from the fact that when enemies appear, you aren't even aware of their existence until they attack. This is clearly by design as one of the powers you get will grant you more insight as to when and where they appear by way of flashing the screen and red arrow indicators. It is helpful, but I would much rather have a zoomed out view so I can see everything that's going on.\n\nWhen you shoot, the camera shifts in that direction. When you release, the camera shifts back to the character. If you are attacked from behind while shooting, you won't even know what hit you. WIth this camera shift also comes another, external, hazard. If you are prone to motion sickness, this game will turn your stomach upside-down. It did me. Within minutes, the constant camera shifts might have you clicking the X and grab some ginger root. \n\n\nIf none of the above bothers you, the asking price is an enormous value for a game that lends itself to so much replay and fast, engaging action.

GREAT GAME ! [/b]\n\n[h1] OVERALL [/h1]\nThis game is pure awesomeness, I've been a fan from the electro house DJ from a couple of years now and when I found out that he had a game I had to play it and boy I wasn't letted down. This action game is a shoot 'em up that needs a lot of coordination if you want to progress, also as you collect Golden CDs you unlock new songs to play in the background and Savant is an exquisite electro house DJ, for $2 you can't go wrong!\n\n[h1] REPLAYABILITY [/h1]\nYou may beat this game in 2 or 3 hours, but once you get to the end boss you can still fight your way to collect 2 more Golden CDs, which mean 2 more songs and 2 more abilities, I haven't been able to get the 6th and last Golden CD and that frustrates me... but things get pretty hectic in Endless Mode and I have just been able to get the 5th GCD, the last one is way too hard! \n  \n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\nThe gameplay has a nice difficulty curve, even if you keep dying you will be accumulating golden CD pieces and once you get 4 you unlock a new song and new abilities that will help you a lot to progress, creeps that were given you a tough time will be vaporized in a breeze after getting the 4th Golden CD, you may also learn to evade hits more efficiently, overall it's easy to just use your Mouse on one hand and a few keys on the other, the only complaint will be the lack of variety in the levels, you only have The 1st Floor, The Elevator Climb and The Boss Stage.\n\n[h1] AESTHETIC [/h1]\nI love this game look, it's a great realization on Savant's previous cover art for its albums and singles, plus it captures this magic atmosphere that was very well transmitted in his songs, specially on the album titled \"Alchemist\", we get \"Melody Circus\" from that album as the 5th track you may unlock.\n\n[h1] STORY [/h1]\nThe story is simple and yet very cool, specially on the Boss Stage when you'll fight some unexpectedly familiar foe. You play as Savant, a alchemist who tries to control the mysterious great power of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone and fails, getting blasted by an explosion who throws you out of the tower of your castle and you need to climb back and try to master this bizarre energy.\n\n[h1] MUSIC [/h1]\nDo I need to tell anything more?

I have sunk several hours into this game outside of Steam.\n\nHave you ever played an awful game that just completely captured you with a stellar soundtrack? Well replace that bad game with something of epically fun proportions and you will get Savant Ascent. When you first crank this bad boy up, I implore you to have a good set of headphones ready to rock. The music will melt your face off with its genuinely heart pounding syncopation of the blisteringly fast gameplay. This game is not for the faint of heart. I come from a background of solid training in the SHMUP (shoot em' up) genre, yet I still found a pretty good challenge in my first few playthroughs. \n\nThe core of Savant Ascent's gameplay is built around dodging waves of enemies and blasting them with rapid shots at the same time. You are also tasked with collecting various CD pieces that will drop from specific enemies. These pieces are extremely valuable as they will unlock new soundtracks to compliment your destructive rampage, as well as give you new abilities for your character. Things like charge shots, a spray of missiles, and alerts when encroaching enemies are coming towards you. Speaking of enemies, there are only a few types. Each of them are very discernable from one another, an attention to detail that I greatly appreciated. Some will simply slowly move towards you. Other's are much more menacing as they require several shots to take down and will lunge at you at high speeds. They game is not afraid to throw multiple types of baddies at you to induce panic. \n\nControls are very simple. Three keys are used for dodging or jumping left or right to the only 2 predetermined spots you can occupy. the mouse is used to move a cursor around, and you simply click and hold the left button to unleash a steady stream of magical bolts. \n\nThe game has only three modes to choose from. Story, Time Attack, and Endless. Endless is by far my favorite and it is truly what the game was built to provide it's players. However, I would very much recommend that all players start with story mode. \n\nSavant's story mode starts with a scene very reminiscent of Castlevania Symphony of The Night. A gothic castle-esque interior painted with deep intense variations of purples, blues, and greys. Suddenly, our pixel perfect hero comes smashing through a glass window in all of his glory. He looks like if V, from \"V for Vendetta\", had a love child with a Sith lord. Get ready for about 30 seconds of hand holding before the game completely dumps you into the shark tank. You will die relatively fast on your first attempt. I lasted about a minute, as I recall, before meeting my untimely demise. This is just one of those video games experiences that abuses you in a good way. It says \"Hey stupid! wake up and pay the hell attention to what is going on around you!\". I seriously felt like I was learning the basics of gaming all over again. I was punished with a gameover screen and my score tally counted up. Then something awesome happened. I watched as all the cd parts I had managed to collect formed into a new disk. The music instantly changed into another heart pumping rhythm and offered to throw me right back into the fray with a new ability. The sense of defeat was met with a small form of progress that many games these days seem to neglect. I didn't even have time to take a bite of the big fat failure cake I had just made myself before I spawned back at my last check point. The story mode itself is very short. Only three stages long with the last being a pretty fun, yet intense, boss fight. I won't spoil the surprise, but there are some awesome references to a certain popular gaming franchise in the final stage. \n\nOnce you finish the story mode and clean up your pants, you are now ready for the meat of the true game. Endless mode! This is exactly the same setup as the story mode sans boss fight. If you couldn't guess by the name, it just goes on and on until you die. You will still have various cd parts to complete new soundtracks while you challenge your best score. I managed to get over 40,000,000 once, and have yet to best myself. The action just constantly gets more intense until you cant take it anymore. \n\nTime attack was simply a test of how fast you are able to clear stages by killing all the enemies. I have never been much for time attack modes and found very little innovation here. It was very considerate of the developer to cater to that crowd. There are many very avid time attack players out there that will blow your mind with skillful, yet torridly fast completions. \n\nSo what do we have here? A fast paced game. A fun game. A low priced game. I paid $2 on the steam store for my copy of Savant Ascent and have loved every second of it. I will mention that I ran into a few minor UI glitches that were in no way game breaking. That aside, this is a special treat in a world dominated by games that want to baby you with tutorials the whole way through. You can play this game for 20 minutes and accomplish something, or you can dive in for hours if that is your choosing. It is always there to tailor to your specific needs. That, my friends, is a mighty fine deal! \n\nI write for Beast League Gaming!\nCheck us out on Facebook\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BeastLeagueGaming", "timestamp_created": 1410068945, "timestamp_updated": 1410069093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12000497": {"recommendationid": "12000497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115246447", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447076590}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043b\u0434 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0445\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445\u0442\u043e 59 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441 \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1410016068, "timestamp_updated": 1410016068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11998529": {"recommendationid": "11998529", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997189169", "num_games_owned": 1449, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410005194}, "language": "french", "review": "Savant - Ascent est un shoot'em up 2D d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par DPad Studio, un studio ind\u00e9pendant. Initialement le jeu propose une mode histoire compos\u00e9 de 3 niveaux dont le niveau du boss. Une fois le mode histoire termin\u00e9, vous aurez acc\u00e8s \u00e0 deux autres modes : le mode \"Time Attack\" dont le but sera de finir la partie avec le meilleur chrono et le mode \"Endless\" o\u00f9 il faudra rester en vie le plus longtemps possible.\n\nDans un premier temps, vous verrez qu'il sera bien difficile de finir le jeu, malgr\u00e9 sa dur\u00e9e tr\u00e8s courte. Les ennemis arrivent \u00e0 un rythme effrein\u00e9, sans que vous ayez fi en finir avec les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Votre objectif sera alors d'am\u00e9liorer votre personnage en r\u00e9cup\u00e9rant des 4 fragments de CD qui vous donneront une nouvelle capacit\u00e9, facilitant ainsi votre progression. Dans le mode histoire vous pouvez am\u00e9liorer votre personnage 4 fois (ce qui fait 16 fragments \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer).\n\nLe gameplay est assez original, vous visez avec votre souris, vous tirez avec le click gauche de la souris, et vous n'avez que 2 positions possible pour votre personnage o\u00f9 vous pouvez y acc\u00e9der soit en glissant du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit au c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche (et inversement), soit en sautant.\n\nBien que difficile de prime abord, Savant - Ascent est le genre de jeu dans lequel il faut perseverer pour en profiter pleinement dans le mode histoire. Cependant une fois les 4 am\u00e9liorations effectu\u00e9es, le mode histoire devient trop court et trop facile. Intelligemment les d\u00e9veloppeur ont cach\u00e9 2 autres am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir dans les autres modes, ce qui augmente consid\u00e9rablement la dur\u00e9e de vie et le challenge. La difficult\u00e9 ressentie \u00e0 vos d\u00e9buts reviendra vous hanter, relan\u00e7ant l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et l'espoir d'am\u00e9liorer son niveau de jeu.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 succ\u00e8s, il ne va pas suffire de finir le simple mode histoire, mais aller bien au del\u00e0. C'est un peu dommage de ne pas avoir quelques r\u00e9compense dans le niveau histoire surtout que le jeu ne comporte que 14 succ\u00e8s.\n\nGraphiquement, Savant - Ascent est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able, et vous plonge dans un univers \u00e0 mi-chemin entre un Castelvania et V pour Vendetta. L\u00e0 ou certain studio ind\u00e9 se limite au style pix\u00e9lis\u00e9, ici vous aurez droit \u00e0 des sprites de qualit\u00e9.\n\nSavant - Ascent, un Easy-to-Finish Hard-to-Master, comme le sont la plupart des bons jeux.

It is more a defense game than anything, as you only move from one spot on the level or another, and become stationary at either point. The wizard must shoot enemies and ...things that drop pieces of records. Getting full records upgrades your firepower (I think) and advances the stage. You're essentially a turret that can jump or move to another point on the level, as you shoot in 360 degrees while dealing with a limited screenview that requires you to be catious and prioritize certain targets as the enemies have different attack patterns. The limited vision is very annoying for me, but I can see that it was an intentional design decision. It's unfortunate that I can't play it full screen or expand it to my 2560x1080 resolution. I don't really get why there is a gothic, Castlevania-like visual theme mixed with Dubstep and 8 bit sound bytes. Savant has a nice style, but it's strange.\n\nThe game is pretty fun and it's mostly a hardcore score attacker's delight. The game is absolutely brutal, and I can't get past the 2nd level for the life of me. I might be able to get further if I really hunker down and practice this game for hours, but I don't feel like doing that at the moment. It's a solid game, especially for $2 or less, but realize that you're getting a very simplistic and hardcore, almost arcade like experience that has an extremely short story mode (From what I read) and an endless mode that is just about score and survival. .", "timestamp_created": 1407907276, "timestamp_updated": 1407907276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542760", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11654557": {"recommendationid": "11654557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086386284", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430765420}, "language": "english", "review": "5/5 Music.\n5/5 Gameplay.\n5/5 Story.\n5/5 Graphics.\nOverall 32/5 would play again.", "timestamp_created": 1407778629, "timestamp_updated": 1407778629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11622990": {"recommendationid": "11622990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043971033", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397534220}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended.

The game is played like a twin stick shooter but you play with a mouse. Essiantly you have three levels of killing stuff to get back to the top. In the game you have to kill robots and collect CD parts to get power ups. The game also has an endless mode which is alot of fun. The game has a kick ass soundtrack with great toons which you listen while killing alot of enemies. The game also has a few flaws. The game doesnt explain how to kill the final boss so it takes quite a bit of time to get it right. The game is also quite difficult. Overall theres nothing more to say about this little gem.

What makes it brilliant, you ask? Several reasons.\n1. You have only 2 platforms on which to move about, with 2 ways of achieving movement between them (Jumping through the air or just dodging left and right.)\n2. The number of enemies you face in even just the campaign makes this beat-based defense tricky. \n\nEven when you can predict /when/ the enemy is coming, can you predict how many and where from?

For the price of the game, it is a EXTREMELY well made game, which if put on a mobile platform would put other mobile games to shame. But, even with this game's extreme high points, with it's beautiful art, and beautiful music, the game really is only a time waster. The added modes are helpful in keeping one entertained, however the game does lacks in essence and content. My main complaint is that what should be a more satisfying part of the game (I.E. The Story Mode) feels more like a longer, dragged out version of the Time attack and Endless Modes. I was there where more sections added onto the game, which would allow that final boss to be much more intense and satisfying. I also wish that I knew more about the background lore in the world of which the devs had made. Who was Savant? How is he able to shoot light energy from his hands? and what's the background of the villian, Vario? This game has much potential into being something great, but I would think that the game needs a little bit more content before I consider it a full game. None the less, for the price of a whopping $1.99, I think the game is very much worth giving a try. 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1406428559, "timestamp_updated": 1406428559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11418096": {"recommendationid": "11418096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097540862", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395168703}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1406377212, "timestamp_updated": 1406377470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11416614": {"recommendationid": "11416614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136021805", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406364811}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\n\"+\"\n- \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\n- \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\n\"-\"\n- \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1406368477, "timestamp_updated": 1406368477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11408900": {"recommendationid": "11408900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029498382", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432964320}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a very big fan of Savant before the game was made, so this review is going to be a bit biased.

If you dont know who Savant is let me tell you. Savant is music producer with great talent of: Singing, Playing piano, Acoustic guitar, Electric guitar and making Electronic music. Adding him to a genre is impossible because his music is very uniq and actually i never heard anyone making music simillar to his. But if i should tell what genre he is making it would be Glitch hop, Dubstep and Electro. If you dont like any of these genres then this game is not for you... But if you do like me you should buy this game even without knowing who Savant is... The story is short (very short) and there are 6 songs that you can unlock by collecting pieces of broken disks (4 each) and by every unlock you will get new \"Alchemist\" power to make even more score.

The Alchemist doit remonter la tour tout en d\u00e9truisant des objets anim\u00e9s par la pierre philosophale )et n'ayant qu'une envie: tuer leur ancien proprio), puis d\u00e9truire a pierre (SPOILER!)[spoiler] Sauf si on a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer tous les cds, car dans ce cas on peut aussi reprendre la pierre, ce qui finit le jeu sans affronter Vario [/spoiler] , ce qui d\u00e9truit Vario.\nJ'avais bien dit bizarre.\n\nNote personnelle: J'adore Savant. Le fait de pouvoir jouer avec ses musiques est tout simplement \u00e9pique\n\nNote finale avant la M\u00e0J du 22/10/14 : 8,75/10\n\nAvis post 22/10\n\nIl y a eu une grosse mise \u00e0 jour du jeu le 22/10, rajooutant un cd, 2 niveaux, dont un boss, et des am\u00e9iorations.\n\nGraphismes: 10/10\nOn reste dans un esprit de jeu 2d \"\u00e0 l'ancienne\", \u00e0 savoir plut\u00f4t pixellis\u00e9, ce qui garde le grand avantage de pouvoir laisser la possibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les configs de faire tourner ce jeu, mais avec quelques am\u00e9liorations.\nJ'ai particuli\u00e8rement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la refonte du mode Overdrive. Avant la mise \u00e0 jour, toute son apparence passait par un filtre de couleur (son masque changeait lui aussi de couleur). Avec la mise \u00e0 jour, chaque Overdrive a un skin associ\u00e9, de sorte que ce masque reste blanc.\nPour rester sur l'Overdrive, j'appr\u00e9cie aussi le fait que le niveau max n'a plus une seule couleur, mais qu'il change de couleur continuellement, et de mani\u00e8re fluide.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nPeu d'am\u00e9liorations, mais un ajout dans les derniers niveaux (les nouveaux) de pouvoir d\u00e9truire les plateformes, ce qui rend le jeu plus compliqu\u00e9, ce qui le rend encore plus excellent.\n\nDur\u00e9e de vie: 9/10\nBien que le contenu n'est pas \u00e9norme, cette mise \u00e0 jour permet de se rendre r\u00e9ellement compte que le jeu sera mis \u00e0 jour \u00e0 chaque nouvel album de Savant, ce qui prolonge \u00e9norm\u00e9ment la dur\u00e9e de vie de Savant\n\nHistoire: 8/10\nUne grosse prolongation de l'histoire avec deux nouveaux niveaux.\n\nDans ces niveaux, apr\u00e8s avoir vaincu Vario en mode normal (pas en Vario mode), le haut de la tour explose et envoie l'Alchimiste dans l'espace.L\u00e0, il doit d\u00e9truire tous les ennemis (comme d'hab), puis il arrive au niveau du Samourai, un guerrier robotique extr\u00eamement puissant (il d\u00e9pop, m\u00eame si t'as tes 3 coeurs). Ce niveau est un pur Die and Retry, car si tu ne sais pas ce qu'il va faire, tu ne peux pas le vaincre. Pour ceux qui veulent savoir comment le vaincre: [spoiler]Premi\u00e8rement, il vaut mieux avoir le 6\u00e8me cd, afin de passer les niveaux Overdrive, et lui infliger mass damages.\nAu d\u00e9but, il faut charger sa jauge de puissance en sautant (pouvoir d'un des cds), et aller tout de suite apr\u00e8s sur la plateforme de droite.Il d\u00e9truit la plateforme de gauche, qui va r\u00e9appara\u00eetre.\nIl va ensuite lancer une attaque qui va le faire rebondir de plateforme en plateforme (je rappelle qu'il d\u00e9pop tout), il faut donc faire gauche-droite-gauche-droite-gauche-droite-gauche. Il va ensuite d\u00e9truire la plateforme de droite, et va projeter la v\u00f4tre vers le haut.\nIl va ensuite aller sur celle de droite (qui sera r\u00e9apparue), et le haut du corps va se d\u00e9tacher afin de vous attaquer(un coup,qui vous tuera)\nL\u00e0, je conseille d'aller vers celle de droite afin de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des d\u00e9bris et monter l'Overdrive en attaquant les jambes du samourai, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le haut de son corps soit tout pr\u00e8s de vous. L\u00e0, lancez l'attaque ultime(les 5 tirs super puissants) sur le corps du samoura\u00ef.\nIl va perdre de la vie, se t\u00e9l\u00e9porter, et de nouveau vous attaquer.\nAllez rapidement sur la plateforme de gauche en sautant(et en continuant \u00e0 sauter) afin de recharger votre barre d'\u00e9nergie.\nAttaquez le corps avec les gros rayons.\nSautez sur la plateforme de droite et rechargez votre barre d'\u00e9nergie\nIl fait mine de lancer une attaque, mais il n'a en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pas le temps.\nRelancez votre attaque ultime si il s'approche trop de vous\nEnsuite, le haut et le bas vont se rattacher, et i va partir vers la gauche.\nSi vous n'\u00eates pas sur la plateforme de droite, allez y.\nPuis, il va faire une destruction de plateforme.\nIl va d\u00e9truire la plateforme de gauche.Puis celle de droite.Puis re celle de gauche.(en tout, il d\u00e9truit 8 plateformes).\nAttention \u00e0 changer de plateforme d\u00e8s que l'autre appara\u00eet, car \u00e0 moins que vous ayez des r\u00e9flexes de fou, vous ne pourrez pas l'\u00e9viter au dernier moment.\nEnfin, il y aura 5-6 secondes de calmes, o\u00f9 vous devrez recharger votre barre de puissance.\nPuis, une plateforme appara\u00eetra sur la droite, et un \"mec\" balancera un rayon destructeur sur l'une des plateformes (al\u00e9atoire, et une seule \u00e0 la fois) une fois toutes les 5 secondes (\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s)\nAttaquez le mec, car il permet de charger votre overdrive tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s rapidement.\nAu 4\u00e8me rayon, le samoura\u00ef va de nouveau envoyer son haut du corps vous attaquer.\nBalancez votre attaque ultime, puis rechargez la en sautant(balancez l'attaque au bon moment, car les rayons vont continuer (il en balancera encore 3 ou 4, mais il arr\u00eatera apr\u00e8s ces 3 ou 4).\nContinuez \u00e0 l'exploser avec votre attaque ultime. Enfin, \u00e7a recommence depuis le d\u00e9but, et ce jusqu'\u00e0 ce que toute sa barre de vie soit vide. [/spoiler]\nSPOILER!!!\n[spoiler] de toute fa\u00e7on, apr\u00e8s l'avoir explos\u00e9, il r\u00e9appara\u00eet, vous balance vers le sol, vous fait retraverser toute la tour en chute libre, et vous finissez en dessous du premier \u00e9tage, transperc\u00e9 par une lame brillante.  [/spoiler]\n\nBref, ce jeu est encore mieux qu'avant.\n\nNote finale: 9.125/10", "timestamp_created": 1404248517, "timestamp_updated": 1414145714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.968543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10991516": {"recommendationid": "10991516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064571682", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426308285}, "language": "english", "review": "great soundtrack and intense gameplay and worth the 2 dollars", "timestamp_created": 1404185424, "timestamp_updated": 1404185424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10988717": {"recommendationid": "10988717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141451943", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410049188}, "language": "english", "review": "For what this game is, it's absolutely essential!

There's a dynamic element to the music that changes as the enemies get more aggressive, which stretches the admittedly small music choice (7 songs, total) out quite a bit. \n\nAt the end of the day, I've gotten hours of enjoyment from a game that I paid two dollars for.

I was almost not going to buy it at all, because I thought it would be a waste of money. But alas, Aleksander Vinter is one of my favorite musicians, so I decided to buy it.\n\nIt. Is. Fantastic. Truly fantastic. The gameplay is smooth, the aesthetics are outstandingly well-done, and I can't stop playing it. After the main story is beaten, you unlock Time Attack and Endless modes, and Endless is where I spend the most of my time. The gameplay is fast-paced, and the soundtrack is almost perfectly paced for it. There is a song or two that can underwhelm the action of the game, but this brings me to my favorite part of the game; the soundtrack is 100% interchangeable. You can convert one of your own songs to .OGG, rename it, and replace any of the songs in the main folder that have the prefix \"ost\", and also edit the english configuration file to change the text as you please, so that you can fight your way to the top to your own beats. I personally replaced \"ISM\" with \"Nightmare Adventure\" and \"Melody Circus\" with \"Mother Nature\".\n\nThe menus, however, took me a second to figure out. Settings is an icon in the corner of the home screen, and Master Volume only means the sound effects, not the actual Master Volume, so it doesn't affect the background music. It actually had me bummed for a bit, because the sound effects were severely overtopping the great music, but I didn't think I could affect the SFX itself without also affecting the music. This too, however, is fixable in the english configuration file.\n\nOver all, I got a drop-dead EXCELLENT bargain for 99 cents. I would have gotten an amazing deal for it's original asking price of $1.99. I would have even paid up to $4.99 for this game, though maybe that's just my inner Savant Fanboy speaking.

I didn't think of this much at first to be honest. When I started it and realised that the character wasn't moving freely, only hopping between two possible spots while shooting enemies, it seemed very limited to me. Everything was happening in this confined area without the possibility of going anywhere. That early impression wasn't fair. As it turned out the strength of this game lies elsewhere.\n\nThe gameplay is generally about shooting swarms of enemies with your character's powers, who can fire magic missiles from his hands at really high speed. Lots of sweeping action as you clear them out while dodging them when they charge. Music plays an important role in this game and while I may not normally listen to this sort of music, it's very appropriate for such a fast paced game.\n\nThe real fun comes from obtaining new abilities and learning how to use them effectively to become even better. In fact... Every ability you unlock is something new, but having a big impact on the gameplay. It forces you to change your habits to get used to the new mechanic, as it gives you decisive advantage that helps you make even greater progress. The abilities are unlocked along with new music tracks that you collect as you play and once you have them all, you can also obtain a secret ability (if you figure out how or look it up) which leads you to possessing unbelieveable power that you'll need to prove your true ability in the Endless mode.\n\nOverall this was fun!", "timestamp_created": 1402362743, "timestamp_updated": 1402362743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707739", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10405437": {"recommendationid": "10405437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020454601", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419375749}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the music.\n\nLove the game.\n\nWhat more could you ask for?!\n\nWell, maybe a \"make your own\" and \"play other people's\" levels.\n\nStill,for the price and what it is 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1402313246, "timestamp_updated": 1402313246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10397799": {"recommendationid": "10397799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054813787", "num_games_owned": 1631, "num_reviews": 471, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498853060}, "language": "russian", "review": "[b]\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c[/b] \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b-\u0448\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438.\n\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c - \u044d\u0442\u043e 10 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1402253842, "timestamp_updated": 1402253842, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10385907": {"recommendationid": "10385907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069283386", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393713474}, "language": "german", "review": "Also das Spiel ist zun\u00e4chst mal mega komisch, man wird einfach reingeworfen und - zumindest ging es mir so - ich hatte keine Ahnung was ich machen muss.

It's a post-dubstep genre called brostep. You'll find no use of low-frequency oscillators in their music. But I digress.\n\nYou could call Savant - Ascent a twin-stick shooter. You could also call Savant EDM or Cannibal Corpse rock. Do you see where I'm going with this? This game loosely resembles a twin-stick shooter in that you control your character's position with one stick and fire with another, but holy god is this a bad twin-stick shooter. The player has virtually no control over their movement, for one thing. This is problematic when the game is based around the concept of killing things and not letting them kill you. The in-game tutorial (which is not programmed to detect a gamepad) uses the word \"dodge\" to refer to the limited lateral movement possible, but unlike dodge moves in sensible action games, the dodge movement confers no invincibility frames. Not much of a dodge as it is a spastic move from one static position to the other. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the whole point of the game is drowning you in enemies and then giving you not-enough time to kill them before they come zooming at your face. One would then assume that one could safely dodge out of their way and continue playing. One would be wrong. Movement throws the player into enemies as often as into safety.\n\nOn a related note, the right stick (or maybe the mouse? I don't know how you'd even attempt to play this without a gamepad, honestly) controls your shots AND the camera movement. Seems useful, right? Help ya see what yer shootin'. Except for the aforementioned game design philosophy of \"drowning you and enemies and then giving you not-enough time to kill them before they come zooming at your face.\" While you were aimed at the bottom of the screen trying to kill one of the enemies with 5 zillion hitpoints because those are the ones that drop the MacGuffins and actually let you progress like some sort of jackass, the game spawned 30 grunts and now they're coming right for you oh god the pain! Also you only get 3 HPs. I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure you get minimal-to-no invincibility frames when you take damage.

The enemies always come in the exact same way, and you can't collect multiple gold records from the same enemy making it a good way to make replaying easier since you won't have to concentrate killing the tough gold record character and instead focus on staying alive until you see a new gold record holder.

A difficulty setting would have been nice to newcomers but the difficulty in the game is there for a good reason. The game is very short. When you've completed the story mode, you will find out that it takes about 5+ minutes more or less to beat the game. Even so, it took me one and half hours to beat the game after many failed attempts. Making the game difficult was obviously a good call so persons can have a longer playthrough of the game, and with enough practice beating the game won't feel as difficult as it first did. \nThe gameplay is pretty simple, basically shoot the enemies while keeping a steady evasion rate, but beware, it's harder than it actually sounds. I find the keyboard and mouse mouse works better than a game controller because the camera moves around the screen very irritatingly with a controller.\nI personally would have liked a longer story mode for the game, at least two levels. The two other modes are great for score attacking but nothing else. Also there are only 2 resolutions, since the artwork of the game is pixel art, if you don't have the supported resolution, there will be a noticeable difference of how well the games looks. \n\nFor $2 you'll be getting a pretty good but very short game. If you're a fan of shoot em up or bullet hell games, you'll definitely love this game. If you're not fan of the genre but like intense games, this is well worth the experience.\n\nRating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1393617926, "timestamp_updated": 1393784851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9290397": {"recommendationid": "9290397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039738772", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451469582}, "language": "polish", "review": "Najlepsze kawa\u0142ki Savanta i do tego totalny rozpierdziel na ekranie, rze\u017a mechanicznych stwor\u00f3w, ostry dubstep i electro w tle.

Ascent is a fantastic little gem with an outstanding soundtrack by Aleksander Vinter (aka Savant). This game sees you play as the alias of Savant who originally appeared on the album art for Alchemist. The controls are rather simple, but fluid, using the mouse to fire magical missiles at enemies and the \"wad\" keys to dodge. As you progress through this short storyline (2 enemy stages and a boss stage) you can collect CD fragments which snap together to unlock a new ability and a new soundtrack option which can be changed at any time on the pause menu. Songs include Kali 47, Melody Circus and Back to The Phuture which combine classical, rock and electronic into a fantastic meld of genres. Once the story has been completed, \"Time Attack\" and \"Endless\" game modes are unlocked, providing more replay value. These are certainly challenging, but also give you the oppurtunity to unlock 2 additional soundtracks and abilities which may make it slightly less punishing. For \u00a31.49 there's no reason you shouldn't pick up this game.

Well, the music is fantastic. It is made by Savant himself. If you don't know him, you can check his music at his YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ur2L6Zu4oCShmtFw9UTfQ) or his Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/aleksander-vinter). It might look like I'm promoting him or something, but it is worth it. Because you might thank me for that.\n\nLet's talk about the art style now. It is great. It reminds me a lot of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. And if you know what I'm talking about, I don't need to talk about it anymore. \nBut if you don't know what I'm talking about, here is a little summary for you. The art style looks like it draws from Renaissance and Gothic styles of architecture. And thanks to that, some of us might feel nostalgic about this game. Others will say that the style looks good and I can't agree more. I will just add that it is very atmospheric.\n\nSo, is it worth paying the amazing amount of 2 \u20ac?\nYes, it is.

And, I suppose that is what\u2019s to be expected for a 2 dollar indie title. Though, here is the thing.\n\nSavant for me, was an amazing purchase. If you are someone that 'needs' a good story with their indie game, you might want to look elsewhere. This is a game that is all about style. With its odd look of Cyber Punk-Fantasy and loud Dubstep blaring in the back ground to get your adrenaline running. Savant is more akin to games such as Realm of the Mad God or even Hotline Miami. With its tight controls and literally taking no time to lean. It\u2019s an 'aim with the mouse cursor' game, a game that is fast to get into, and even faster to get out of. \n\nFinally, while it may not be as hard as Hotline Miami, Savant is still pretty challenging. But that is exactly why I would still suggest picking it up. I mean... its only 2 dollars! When games are cheap and have such a great amount of polish on them like Savant does, it\u2019s hard to say no.", "timestamp_created": 1392339553, "timestamp_updated": 1392339553, "voted_up": true,

I saw it on sale for 99 cents and bought it. It took me all of 30 minutes to beat it. There was no story beyond some weird character falling off of a tower and coming back to fight his way back up it to destroy whatever shiny round thing knocked him off. I later found that the \"hero\" character is actually the alias of some musician (Aleksander Vinter), and the character is dressed up as he dresses on stage. And of course this game just happened to be released on the PC just days before his new album...surprise surprise.\n\n+ Really nice art. Too bad there is so little of it.\n+ Apparently there will be additional content added for free. Leaderboards for a 20 minute game that doesn't penalize death? Hurray!\n+ If you are into this artist \"Savant\" or dubstep, you will love the music, apparently...\n\n- This seems like a showcase for the artist, his music, and his on-stage persona, not about a complete game with compelling gameplay, story, or characters.\n- There is no substance to this game. Your progress in the game continues at the last death, thus removing any impact to death. You simply crunch through the easily defeated waves of enemies until you grab enough pieces of \"cds\", a ridiculously obvious allusion to the modern real world which makes this game feel even more like part of an album promotional campaign of some kind, giving you extra powers. Then you die, new powers completed/retained and then you start anew with no penalty whatsoever.\n- End boss is ridiculously easy. This fits the general sensibilities to this game though.\n- This is an iOS port of a game developed in just five weeks.

What's a Savant?\"\n\nLet's pretend, shall we? Let's pretend you, like me, had no idea of what Savant is before buying this. You've stumbled across this page because it's cheap, you don't have a lot of cash left to spend, you want a new game, and the art for this looks slick. The trailer is sweet and for two bucks it seems well worth the risk.\n\nSo, is it, then, worth your money?\n\nI'd say yes. Savant is what I'd call an arcade-ish shooter, and you can beat the (regular) story mode in one sitting, easy. The music is good, the gameplay with mouse and keyboard is tight, and I can think of far worse ways to spend two bucks. The game is simple yet has enough depth to warrant a few more sittings of gameplay, and the mechanics are easy to pick up. Oh, and did I mention the art here is gorgeous? Great stuff, pixel-ish with good detail work.\n\nNow, the downsides. First off, I had another reason for buying this title. I had just got a controller to hook up to my PC and I wanted more games to play with it. First off, it doesn't automatically detect the controller, you gotta switch to it via the options. Second off, the controller set up... Isn't great. The right thumbstick, which you use to aim your shots (if you've got a 360 pad as I do), automatically zooms the camera out in that direction, something that only happens with the mouse if you edge your pointer far out. Grabbing CD pieces is wonky, and, overall, I gave up after about ten minutes and used keyboard and mouse instead. Speaking of that, you can't rebind keys. The defaults are fine, but that's always a nice option to have, and it's a bit disappointing when a dev doesn't allow for it.\n\nOther than that, the only other real gripe might be length. It all depends on what you expect from a two dollar title. For me, this game exceeded my expectations and provided a fun evening's worth of play, and there's still content I haven't unlocked. But the story mode is easily beat under an hour, and if I had to guess on how long it would take me to unlock EVERYTHING, skill aside, I'd probably bet on four to five hours. This might disappoint some, but I guarantee you that the slick gameplay, good presentation, and sweet music makes up for it.\n\nSo, we come back to the question, what is Savant? See, that's what makes this game notable to me. Savant is a band, and, though I've never heard of them before playing this, their stuff isn't bad. That makes this a tie-in game of sorts. And if you're like me, you probably grew up with a lot of god-awful tie-in games in your childhood. This title is an exception, and that is a pleasant surprise to me. Combining slick gameplay, great 2D graphics, and hectic action, Savant stands above most every other tie-in game I've played and is a title I would recommend to anyone willing to drop two bucks for a night's worth of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1389345565, "timestamp_updated": 1389345565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8642896": {"recommendationid": "8642896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016208353", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512844590}, "language": "english", "review": "You start the game in story mode, the other modes will be disabled untill you complete the story mode. \n\nWhen I first started playing it, it felt pretty fun and it didn't took a lot of time to get used to the controls. For example aiming is done with the mouse but I think it can also be played with a controller. During the game you can collect cds, each consisting out of 4 pieces, you can collect these by destroying a certain guy. These cds contain songs from an artist called Savant, he makes some kind of glitch hop. \n\nI have to say it is pretty much awesome how it all comes together. As soon as I finished the story mode, which was much fun, I started playing endless mode. This mode becomes more difficult after time and helps you to become a better player.

Check it out, it looks like a really nice Metroidvania-style game with old school pixel art.

To me, Candy for the ears.\nGameplay : 9/10 A bit frustrating a first, you die really easily and you just have to start over. Powerups help overcome this, and you'll feel like a badass blasting everything away. Its a very good system with no bugs to speak of. Aiming with mouse works very well.\nStory : N/A not really relevant in this case, as its basically an arcade game.

There is not much of a story, the emphasis is on the gameplay and presentation.\nIf you dislike the music that this guy makes, or these genres in general, then this game probably isn't for you. The game is basically built around this guy's music, and the music is probably part of the appeal to the people that really enjoy this game.\nIf don't like \"retraux\" games where you die a lot and the controls are simple, this game probably isn't for you either.

It's two dollars at most, and it'll most likely be worth it.\n\nIt also helps if you don't find the music too obnoxious. I honestly like it, and the fact that you can switch soundtracks whenever you want was nice. I also drooled a bit over the pixel art, the main character and enemies aren't those crappy \"retro\" 8-bit platformer characters that are just square stickmen that you see in some games nowadays. This is real Metal-Slug-like pixel art, though they've taken some liberties.\n\nBut the gameplay is most important. You will get a new power that changes the way you play slightly every five minutes, on average, for half an hour. After that it's basically the same thing, but by the time that happens you'll have two difficulty levels, one mode that changes the graphics slightly, and you'll have unlocked two additional game modes that I haven't really explored yet.\n\nTo me, it was definitely worth it.

Not that it's a bad game, but a game that can be finished in roughly in 1 hour. After that you still have Time Attack and Survival Mode, but I couldn't care less really. I usually play games for their story and when I finished the first level of Savant Ascent (or so I thought) it actually booted me back to the main menu, with the new gameplay modes unlocked. That's it ?! How the hell is that a story ? This game didn't raise the bar for action games. It didn't raise the bar for anything. And not that it's bad, it plays just fine, but it's so just frustratingly short and incomplete.\n\nOh man, Owlboy...

So i tried the game pad and what do you know, the A button acts as SPACE. So than i continue to use my game pad to read the controls that are explained for the keyboard - the device that the game no longer allows me to use.\n\nAfter that i was thrown into the middle of chaos, enemies coming from all directions, a game pad as my only choice for controls which i do not know how to use since the game never told me the controls for the game pad, so i'm blasting in all directions, some how taking hits without so much as a second of time to react and about 15 seconds after the start of the game i died. i barely knew what happened, it was over so fast. \n\nNow i'm not very fond of games where i see the GAME OVER screen within the first 60 seconds of launching it but even still, i decided to give it another try. Pressed START on my game pad to try again and there i was, blasting away in all directions, i managed to dodge a few hits, i think, but with only three i knew i wasn't going to last long. I got hit twice but still going, maybe 30 seconds of living this time and right before i could get hit a 3rd time, the game crashed.\n\nto summarize the game play, you can fire in any direction, you can only move between 3 positions in the room and they are very close together, enemies spawn from all directions, and you can only see 1/6 of the room in the direction you are firing in. you mostly get hit by enemies off screen, out of view. it takes many hits to defeat a single enemy and some take quite a while to destroy. 3 hits and it's game over.\n\nso, my time with this game was breif, confusing and a bit frustrating. bad design and bad programming. all i can say is at least the game was really cheap, so i didn't lose much at all. except for a piece of my soul...", "timestamp_created": 1388047155, "timestamp_updated": 1388047155, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8290131": {"recommendationid": "8290131", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975384619", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388038995}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a phenomenal little game.

On the contrary I actively detested it, but it seems I must have been hearing the wrong stuff, as more and more I find myself eating my own words as I fall in love with some immensely talented artists who make up the genre. The latest of those is Aleksander Vinter A.K.A Savant, a musician whose catalog is a blur of sounds and styles, and who is now the protagonist of his own video game: Savant Ascent.\n\nA mixture of up-scrolling shooting and quick back and forth jumping, Ascent feels and plays unlike anything before it. Simple controls compliment the hefty difficulty as you attempt to stay alive through the onslaught of enemies, only able to move from one platform to the other as you make your way to the top of the tower. Enemies occasionally drop pieces of CDs, which on top of giving you a new slice of the soundtrack, rewards you with a new ability to use in combat. It's arcade nature lends itself very well to hi-score chasing, and the relentlessly quick pacing makes it hard to put down no matter how many times you die.\n\nSavant Ascend is nothing less than an absolute blast, and although it's a short run (I beat it in an hour, though it will likely take less for most players) it is abundantly replayable whether that be going for a new best score, racing through time trials, or seeing how long you can last in endless mode. It looks brilliant, sounds even better, and costs less than a cup of coffee!\n\nWith blistering action, tight gameplay, and loads of wub wub, whether you are already a fan of Savant or not this is something you ought to be playing!\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2013/12/13/quick-thoughts-on-savant-ascent/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1386975266, "timestamp_updated": 1427248263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720580", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8033229": {"recommendationid": "8033229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084455663", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487101965}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440", "timestamp_created": 1386970840, "timestamp_updated": 1386970840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8033030": {"recommendationid": "8033030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051490695", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448936925}, "language": "english", "review": "A awesome game with a fantastic soundtrack, short game but funny.", "timestamp_created": 1386969749, "timestamp_updated": 1386969749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8032586": {"recommendationid": "8032586", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972519844", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388904162}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, sweet, and to-the-point.

When the bass drops in certain parts of the soundtrack I can clearly define the audio for enemies spawning and enemies attacking. I think these small details really does bring out the enjoyability of the game.\n\nI enjoy the rogue-like dungeon crawler paired with a shoot em up. I find that it brings a bond to the character to see it grow as it learns new abilities and techniques. Sometimes I was able to develop my own personal strategies to defeat levels after levels.\n\nOne intersting suggestion that I like to see maybe implemented in the future to add difficulty is I noticed that during the second level when you are in between two escalators that when one of the moves higer than the other i was able to dodge to that escalator even though it seems like it is impossible to roll up. I think that adding a constraint to that for the player to jump to the higher escalator instead of simply rolling would add some extra challenge. (Maybe it is already implemented, I have to play more and find out)\n\nOverall I had a blast playing this game and the amount of thinking involved of creating a fun game through its plot, game mechanics and user experience and UI design won you a fan.

I will say ive Listened to some of Savant's stuff so it wasn't hard to pick up the flow of the game since its theme and composed by Savant (Aleksander Vinter) and themes arround his common style images of V for Vendetta and Mario both clearly and obviously refrenced. But to the game play, a smooth ryhtmically synced action shooter where the full map is avaible for attacking and to be attacked, and your limited between 2 spaces and 2 forms of dodging and neither of which make you invincible thus making who you attack and what you attack at what angles builds this into strategy and time management. The game is on its own very brief (i mean its 2 bucks i bought it by selling left over Trading Cards, lets be real) a rough time attack after beating the game twice ebbed at 4:11:33 (m/ss/msms), Endless Mode provides more abilites, powers and music than story mode will offer you to you keep going as well. The game does lack alot of diversity capping at about 5 enemies total but even then its the right amount of things to keep it on track smoothy and not over or under balanced. Also the art style feels very Sega Saturn which struck home with me personally, im aware its a much smoother newer astetic along with the days abilites but it has a feel to it that is very reminding, ya know what i mean?\n\nSide Note (subject to change as they announce it): The devs have heard alot of feedback about the desire for a customizable personal track set the players can use and have with in 2 days of the game launch already gone back to discuss this feature due to the fact it is a music heavy game, Either way the musical aspect is enjoyable and has a flairing taste for most people even if its just one of the tracks.", "timestamp_created": 1386315155, "timestamp_updated": 1386315366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7935199": {"recommendationid": "7935199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028511307", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386310541}, "language": "english", "review": "THE SOUNDTRACK IS BUMFUCKING MINDBLOWINGLY AWESOME AS RE\"DICK\"ULOUS FUCKING AMAZING GREAT!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1386309930, "timestamp_updated": 1386309930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7935089": {"recommendationid": "7935089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112741514", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450626984}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend had suggested this to me.

Which is a great game. Let's just get that straight. NOW onto the review itself.\n\nSavant: Ascent has a hectic, fast paced and heart pumping gameplay inside a wonderful aesthetic vision. Together with a fantastic soundtrack from the electronic composer Savant, all the elements of this game works and compliments each other extremly neatly. I find myself time and time again tapping my feet to the beat of the music, while at the same time ruining the rhyhtm with my excessive mouse clicking. Many, if not all elements in Savant: Ascent is tied together with a very simplistic, but very effective game design. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple, where the difficulty of the game is elegantly increased by more rapid enemy spawning and more powerful foes. I think the controls are tight and right to the point, and works well together with how the game tells you where your enemies are located at all times. It feels very balanced through all stages.\n\nI recommend this game from the bottom of my heart. It is worth every penny (which is not that many). It is truly worth your time.

It does, of course, come with pros and cons:\n\nPros -\n+ Straightforward, no bullshit game. Click and shoot and survive. Nothing to it! A nice, quick challenge for those seeking one without really jumping through hoops of fire.\n+ The pixel art is pretty darn good. Haven't seen this kind of quality since the SNES/PS1. Even for a port, it looks nice.\n+ Cheap. 2 dollars is pretty piddly so you can pick it up, play for a bit, and put it down at your leisure without feeling like you dumped an investment.\n+ Upgrades carry over from death, so you can start again with stronger abilities if you unlock them.\n+ It's a sledgehammer. The Savant music is an awesome addition if you're a fan of their works. It's in the title, so one has to assume people who play this are fans of the music too. Duh.\n\nCons -\n- Goddamn difficult. Don't expect to beat this in one sitting. It picks up in speed fairly quick and can be tough to progress if you aren't paying attention.\n- Only one track during the actual game, which can be pretty monotonous. (Not sure if you can change it in-game or not).\n- Really fast. Like stated before, you have to pay attention and things can slap you silly if you're not looking.\n- (Controller) Weird camera issues. You have to use the right stick for attack, but unless you abuse the five missile charge attack, you're constantly going to be off focus from your character, \"hiding\" some enemies from view, like the sawblades or Trapjaw.\n\nOverall, its a great game, its cheap, its challenging, and it has Savant music.

That is why I picked up this game. For those of you who do not know Savant, he is an EDM artist, with a unique style.\n\nI went into this game expecting some awesome music and exciting gameplay, and was not disappointed.\n\nThe game is essentially a really fast paced shooter, like a lot of \u201cshoot-em-up\u201d games. Although I feel like the game would have worked better as a flash game, the price is reasonably low, so it\u2019s justifiable. The game begins with a very primitive story told in a series of pictures, featuring the man himself, with his own music playing. Although the story is really not necessary, it is a nice little touch.\n\nYou\u2019ll find yourself engaged in combat as soon as you\u2019re in control of the game. A series of robots float around the screen before tumbling towards you if not killed quick enough. There are different types of these machines and you\u2019ll need to keep on shooting at them to be able to progress the level. There are three levels total, with the last containing a surprisingly difficult boss battle.\n\nIt took me quite some time to beat the last level, but the game only took me around 40 minutes to beat. The game has some replayability in the form of high scores, and for me, speed runs. The only real difference in running through the game again is to use the power-ups earned through collecting four disc pieces. These pieces will assemble to form a new power-up.\n\nThe game has its fair share of technical flaws, however. It cannot run at a resolution of 1080p, which I found quite irritating. There are checkpoints in the game, but my game crashed at one point and, upon reloading it, the game failed to place me back at my previous checkpoint, even though I still had the abilities that I had unlocked prior to the crash.\n\nI was also surprised by the lack of documentation on how to even play the game correctly. Sure, it looks self-explanatory, but I found myself confused on how to progress through the game. I figured out after about ten minutes of mindless blasting, but I would have liked to have known what to do from the start.\n\nOverall, the game certainly appeals to fans of Savant and just about all EDM fans at that, but it lacks heavily in content. If you\u2019re up for some fast-paced shooting with great music playing, then this is the game for you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwTe_M55lOc", "timestamp_created": 1386192944, "timestamp_updated": 1387059828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7916572": {"recommendationid": "7916572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064195531", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414724350}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 I love it.", "timestamp_created": 1386192913, "timestamp_updated": 1386192913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7916387": {"recommendationid": "7916387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025370374", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395512393}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would bang", "timestamp_created": 1386192132, "timestamp_updated": 1386192132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 244, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637979", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7916143": {"recommendationid": "7916143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029176793", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498399785}, "language": "english", "review": "SUCH SAVANT, MUCH GOOD, WOW!", "timestamp_created": 1386191250, "timestamp_updated": 1386191250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444260", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7915930": {"recommendationid": "7915930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025765896", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420712274}, "language": "english", "review": "Instead of buying 2 Snickers u can buy this and can enjoy awesome music with awesome Gameplay for 3-4 Hours and have great fun and honestly.. 2 Bucks for Savant Music, Very good gameplay which feels amazing!! and it isnt easy !! it get very hard over time(endless mode) and.. come on guys.. its SAVANT !! :) I Just headbangd my Diplay while playing this xD !!", "timestamp_created": 1386190455, "timestamp_updated": 1386190455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7915779": {"recommendationid": "7915779", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999565021", "num_games_owned": 3162, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417710511}, "language": "french", "review": "Je ne sais pas qui est Savant, mais je connais Dpad Studio de part leur projet Owl Boy.

It's fast, fun, simple enough to pick up in minutes, and deep enough to warrant long discussions and in-depth guides, and still leave room for new discoveries. The first release from D-Pad Studio (to my knowledge), made in collaboration with the titular musical artist, Savant (Aleksander Vinter), this is definitely a good example of how to make a game the right way.\n\nStory mode is pretty short, consisting of only 5 levels that each take 2-5 minutes (except perhaps the final boss), and the gameplay itself is very simple, consisting of attacking enemies and moving between 2 platforms (and sometimes not even the latter). However, the game really shines through in its ability to stretch everything it offers to the limit. Story mode done? Try to race yourself, your friends, and the rest of the world with time attack, or go for an all-time highscore in endless mode. Maybe [SPOILERS] don the mask of the vanquished Vario and replay story mode with different attacks and movement for a change-up. During play, collect CD pieces from special enemies to unlock bonus soundtracks and new abilities, working your way up to obtaining the ultimate power that is the whole reason you're at the tower. Then try to take on the final boss, a lighting-fast, teleporting robot samurai in space with laser-shark friends who want nothing more than to see you reduced to a pile of ashes with a silly hat. And when all of that's done, maybe think about unlocking all of the achievements in the game. There aren't a lot of them, but when you accomplish them for the first time, they are certainly deserving of the name; the devs intentionally made them difficult to accomplish so it would actually be worth getting them and not just some extra stuff they threw in on a lazy Friday.\n\nThe music and visuals of Savant - Ascent also need to be mentioned; and they are both spectacular. The soundtrack is entirely composed by Savant himself and each song goes perfectly with the crazy, upbeat feel of the game. Some parts of the game even feature specific music not available in the 7 records you unlock, and the final boss seems to fight you to the beat of the music playing in the background. The graphics are simple, 16-bit images with that nice comfortable, retro, pixel-y feel while still being grand and beautiful (seriously, take a second to look at the background in the screenshots or during play). \n\nFor a while, there were two extra unlockable versions the game: GOTY and X-MAS versions, which changed the look of the enemies and added a nice little change. They aren't currently available as of writing this, but maybe X-MAS will come back for the holidays, and perhaps GOTY will come back in a patch or a further update.\n\nNow for the price. I'm sure this is a big issue for a lot of people, and it definitely is a factor for me. Luckily, this game costs only $2! If you can't quite afford that, maybe it'll go on sale for 50% during one of steams big sale events. I would say this game is definitely worth more money than just 2 dollars, but I'm more than happy to pay just that to play the game.\n\nAlright, this is getting lengthy... In summary, I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone, even if it's just to try the unusual gameplay for a few minutes. The music is great, the visuals are stunning, the features play off of each other perfectly and the Devs obviously knew what they were doing when designing the unlockables, achievements, special abilities, enemies, and levels.

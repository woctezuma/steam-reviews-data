Charts are well written and work great with an index playstyle so it's a shame that the difficulty level never went up to anything interesting.\n\nThe battle system is difficult to learn as it's hard to keep up with what is going on and what affects what all while following the steps. Later it gets pretty easy to cheese the bosses and it becomes a slog of playing through the same sounding chiptune inspired synth-pop over and over for a majority of the game. Instead of saying there is variety in the music, I'll say there are some exceptions but just too few and few inbetween for it to be significant.\n\nThe way the game is presented, they did a great job, it looks great. Props to the artists. The interface doesn't support the mouse for reasons unknown. Either that or it's because I have an X360 controller plugged into my PC. The game used button prompts labelled with X360 buttons even though I'm using the keyboard.\n\nThere's no way to set it to upscroll, more of a nitpick but it would be really nice to have the option instead of being forced to read downscroll.\n\nI can't say anything on the story or the voice acting because I literally skipped all that. Big thanks for making it skippable, I really appreciate that instead of forcing me to watch all the cutscenes.\n\nI'd strongly just recommend StepMania over this. (Why not both?)

I will say that the RPG aspects of the game are quite small and it focuses more on the rythm game aspect but it still makes for an amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1511385788, "timestamp_updated":

Serious review. Deadpan serious.\n\nThis is literally DDR with an RPG laid overtop of it. Down to the song menu and difficulties. If DDR doesn't appeal, tread carefully and watch your time played in case you want a refund. I only have a bit clocked as of this review but I can tell you it's DDR with an RPG.\n\nIf you're into rhythm games like DDR, FFR, and Stepmania then you'll find yourself at home rather quickly as the game gently insists there's totally room for an RPG in Stepmania. (And there is, apparently.) Like DDR, you get to select a song which you preview in the menu (it even looks like DDR's menu). Once you choose a song, that begins the battle.\n\nOnce in battle, you switch between one of four characters' step charts, and follow the arrows like in DDR; you can stop after activating an attack at a first, second, or third power level. Switching is smooth, and the game will only start tracking your steps once you start input on one character. It's highly designed for fluidity. Thankfully, the step charts are most of what you have to pay attention to.\n\nBut legitimately, DDR with an RPG inside of it.\n\nTo think I grew up beliving Mario Paint was the wildest combination of games-- a coloring book, a music maker and a minigame all in one...\n\n...now look where we ended up.", "timestamp_created": 1511125385, "timestamp_updated": 1511125385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36384988": {"recommendationid": "36384988", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992229015", "num_games_owned": 537, "num_reviews": 275, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510181033}, "language": "english", "review": "Rythm game meets RPG light. There's a ton of great songs in here and the gameplay is addictive enough to carry you through the game easily. Once you've beaten the campaign, there's still more DLC tracks, challenges and all that kinda stuff for you.\n\nBasic gameplay is a \"dance-off\". Your group of 4 vs. the enemies. You can outfit your troupe with different skills and items. After that it's simply \"hit the correct colored input buttons on your controller\" (or other input device). If you can match and mix your attack types you can also do bonus damage vs. certain elements, e.g. lightning vs. water.\n\nThe game is a decent challenge for people who are not used to button combinations, even on easy, because you WILL need both hands (I used the left stick on A,B on the xbox controller to get through the game). You will quite regularly have to combine two different inputs: left/down or up/right or left/right, up/down. I guess, it's possible with a keyboard, maybe even a programmed mouse if that even works or a different input device. I'd have liked to actually try out a real dance mat, but oh well. No place, no time, no money. If you turn the difficulty to medium or hard, be prepared to just feel inadequate. At least there will never be more than 2 button prompts at once, but the general speed those prompts need pressing increases to kinda double the easy mode rate. \n\nIt's a good game, got a decent play time, and it's cheap. Only caveat is that you kinda have to like rythm games and dance music (mostly electro, but there's 1 or 2 rock songs and some jazz-y titles).", "timestamp_created": 1510181605, "timestamp_updated":

If you use a X360 controller and obviously that includes if you use something else that makes yours emulate one and show as one in your control panel then you WONT be using the triggers as controls. For me that is a must, to use rb, lb and the triggers. I come from the DDR game that was on PS3 in the past that you can no longer play and the controls were like that, the outsides were the triggers and L1, R1 were the center and hopefully someday someone that knows what I am talking about reads this and they will save themselves from buying it.

El orden de las magias, ataques y demas, altera su funcion en cuanto al orden en que se va tocando el ritmo. Por ejemplo: Un personaje tiene un ataque basico como primera habilidad y la segunda, una que inspira. Por lo tanto, cuando elijes este personaje y vas acertando al ritmo para ejecutar estas habilidades, notaras que sera en vano que tanto acertarle a los botones solo para dar a una habilidad no tan util como lo es \u00a8inspirar\u00a8 y que tu ataque no es tan fuerte. Asi que decides, invertir el orden, prefieres poner la habilidad de inspirar como primer beat y el ataque basico, como el ultimo. Pero te llevas una sorpresa.... El ataque basico, al ponerlo como ultimo ritmo, sera mucho mas potente que otras habilidades. Por lo tanto. la ultima habilidad de acorde al ritmo, es mas potente que la anterior.\n La dificultad, para mi, ha sido y sera muy desafiante, en muchos de los casos, injusta. Ya que, estar pendiente de cambiar de personaje para ejecutar un ataque, curacion, defensa y aura, mientras sigues el ritmo de la musica, se siente como si jugaras al guitar hero en 4 consolas diferentes\n Lo malo de este juego, son los dlc\u00b4s, que en si, no aportan nada nuevo, solo musica nueva para combatir, pero nada de personajes nuevos, ni items, ni historia adicional. Solo eso.....Musica adicional. \n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1506616654, "timestamp_updated": 1506616654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500052", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35265079": {"recommendationid": "35265079", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970390847", "num_games_owned": 825, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508338661}, "language": "japanese", "review": "[h1]\u97f3\u30b2\u30fc+RPG[/h1]\n\u97f3\u697d\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u5165\u529b\u3057\u3001\u653b\u6483\u3084\u9b54\u6cd5\u3092\u767a\u52d5\u3057\u3066\u6226\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3002\n\u5165\u529b\u97f3\u304c\u306a\u3044\u5206\u3001\u7d14\u7c8b\u306b\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u697d\u3057\u307f\u306a\u304c\u3089\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u697d\u66f2\u306f\u3069\u308c\u3082\u30a4\u30ab\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3067\u3001\u304a\u6c17\u306b\u5165\u308a\u306e\u66f2\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u30ce\u30ea\u30ce\u30ea\u3067\u6226\u3048\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n4\u4eba\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c3\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb+\u81ea\u52d5\u767a\u52d5\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001T1\u3001T2\u3001T3\u3068\u6bb5\u3005\u5f37\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3001\n\u52ff\u8ad6T3\u306b\u306a\u308c\u3070\u304b\u306a\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u767a\u52d5\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u305d\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u6c7a\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u70ba\u3001\u304b\u306a\u308a\u6226\u7565\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\nT1\u306b\u56de\u5fa9\u3092\u7f6e\u3051\u3070\u3001\u7d20\u65e9\u304f\u56de\u5fa9\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u3051\u3069\u5c0f\u56de\u5fa9\u3001\nT3\u306a\u3089\u767a\u52d5\u306b\u6642\u9593\u306f\u639b\u304b\u308b\u3051\u3069\u5927\u56de\u5fa9\n\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u611f\u3058\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u3088\u304f\u3042\u308b\u5c5e\u6027\u306e4\u3059\u304f\u307f\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5c5e\u6027\u306b\u3069\u3046\u5bfe\u51e6\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3082\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\n\u9244\u677f\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u69cb\u6210\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306b\u59d4\u306d\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u97f3\u30b2\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u904a\u3076\u306e\u306f\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001\n\u7570\u8272\u306eRPG\u3068\u524d\u3082\u3063\u3066\u5224\u3063\u305f\u4e0a\u3067\u904a\u3076\u306a\u3089\u304b\u306a\u308a\u9762\u767d\u304f\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506614225, "timestamp_updated": 1506614225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35250482": {"recommendationid": "35250482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065934871", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506799045}, "language": "english", "review": "The songs sound great, the beats are fresh, and the gameplay is satisfying.

I am a pretentious DDR player who played for 4 years and beat almost all content DDR, ITG, and Stepmania had to offer.  So this game strolls along and is all like \"look at me, I'm a dancy game\" and I thought it was just stupid, I mean look at that guy with the afro, is he a wizard, is he a disco dancer? wtf is this game?!\n\nThen I played The Metronomicon at pax and ho-ly-crap I was instantly addicted.  Everything just made sense, the step charts were smooth, the rpg element was smart, the team building was in depth, it just felt right.

It is one of those rare, precious concepts that only come around every once in a long while, and, for the price, you get a big bang for your buck.\n\nThe Metronomicon is a mix of DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) and other rhythm games such as Rock Band/Guitar Hero. The DDR aspect is that you have four arrows coming down a lane and you must hit them mostly according to the beat of the song (as opposed to mimicking instruments in games like Guitar Hero) as they pass through a threshold at the bottom of the lane. The Rock Band analogy comes in the form of four different lanes that sort of mix beats and certain instruments, with certain lanes being more difficult/having more notes than others.\n\nYou have three attacks/spells that you can trigger by hitting those beats in streaks. A certain number of beats will trigger an attack, and longer streaks allow  you to trigger those different, higher level attacks.\n\nThe innovation and challenge comes in the form of four lanes that you must manage at the same time, according to your needs. It is certainly a lot of information to handle in the beginning, and I gotta say that the difficulty is pretty high for beginners. The game expects you to have at least some familiarity with rhythm games, which is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nFor instance, none of my friends wanted to even give it a try because they thought it was just too much for them to handle. It can be intimidating. Keeping the beat and hitting notes in sequence is hard enough by itself on a single lane, let alone four of them, while you also have to keep track of your health, the enemy's, status effects, strategy, vulnerabilities, openings and special attacks. \n\nFor beginners, maybe there should be a mode with only a single lane in a tutorial mode of sorts. Or at least a practice room. The tutorial that is in the game now teaches the basics competently, but you already start with four characters and for those who still need to get used to rhythm games it is a hurdle they are mostly often not willing to overcome.\n\nOn the other hand, this game has lots of charm. I was pleasantly surprised. What attracted me the most was the premise of controlling several characters in a RPG-like environment through the mechanics of a rhythm game. I must confess the trailer on the store page is very confusing and frustrating, as I was hoping for at least a demonstration of the mechanics, but they make it funny and flashy at the expense of actually presenting the game in a clear and concise way for newcomers. I appreciate the flashy presentation, but a second video showcasing gameplay would be very welcome; I tend not to buy games without having a clear understanding of their core mechanics beforehand, and I suspect some other people might be as bewildered as me the first time I came across this game.\n\nThat aside, the amount of polish and love this game has is amazing. The developers are truly passionate about it, and you can see that love clearly even on their store page, with beautiful graphics and colorful descriptions. It is one of the best looking store pages I have come across on Steam in many years. The same care and polish is in the game itself, with its environments, enemies, menus... everything is very bright, colorful and so beautiful and fun to look at. Animations are hit and miss, but given this is an indie developer, you gotta hand it to them for adding so much detail in what must've been quite a tight budget.\n\nAnother plus is that the game is very generous with new players. Want to play on easy? No problem! You get the same rewards as anyone else. Difficulty changes only the amount of beats/notes you get per segment, and that only affects your score, for leaderboards purposes.\n\nI myself am not very skilled. I am very uncoordinated, but I love rhythm games. I find it appealing that you get the same rewards no matter the difficulty you play in. That is a great way to balance the game for many different skill levels. I love playing the songs on easy and just relax after a long day at work. If I'm feeling adventurous, I play one or two of my favorite songs on hard, and after a couple of songs I feel very accomplished and entertained.\n\nI used to be a big fan of DDR back in the day. Unfortunately I developed a serious knee injury and had to stop playing on a dance mat, but I kept playing on the controller on my old PSX. This game is an improvement on all aspects of what made rhythm games fun for me. The soundtrack is very diverse and excellent, and I gotta say I appreciate the lack of mainstream artists... it makes it feel unique, all the while presenting excellent artists that for sure deserve a lot more attention; an amazing showcase, for sure.\n\nWhat worries me is that a lot of people are requesting co-op/multiplayer, and it would be quite sad to see the game change focus from a single-player experience to a mutliplayer one. I wouldn't mind a multiplayer mode, but I feel that fundamental changes would have to be made to the game for that to happen, and that could change the core experience of the game.\n\nAnyway, those are my two cents.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/416790][b]As always, the final choice is up to you.[/b][/url]\n[h1][i]Go there, save the day![/i][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1481720399, "timestamp_updated": 1481720902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747405", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28317501": {"recommendationid": "28317501", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971111481", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504510063}, "language": "english", "review": "DDR-RPG what's not to like?

So far i've heard 14 of the 38 songs and have done most of them on easy and medium difficulty, with a couple on hard.\n\nI was initially worried that having 4 scrolling bars along with health bars, abilities, and enemies to keep track of was going to be a bit too much, but i was gladly wrong.  The use of colors and highlighting is subtle, but really helps bring everything together and makes it easy to get all the information you need at a quick glance.\n\nThere is a quick and easy tutorial which does a good job introducing all of the mechanics.  It was short, informative, and didn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThe soundtrack so far has been amazing, great songs that work well for all difficulties.  Sometimes in DDR/Stepmania songs can seem harder on lower difficulties because its difficult to simplify the beat, but i have yet to experience that.\n\nThere's also a lot of replay value. The arena is updated after beating each zone which offers preset challenges to face.  There is also a lot of customizing you can do with party selection, equipment, ability order, team attack, and passive selection that lets you change the play style so the experience is different.  While some items are stat sticks, there are some available that can drastically change how you play.\n\nThey also recently added the ability to create your own tracks as well as support for stepmania file types so tons of replay value there.\n\nThough not something I personally care about, they do keep track of your best score for each song/challenge, as well as show you leaderboards for the community which could be a plus for some people.\n\nSupport is ongoing, they have released a couple song packs which add some songs and a special item to get for each song at very reasonable prices.  I expect i'll be picking these up during the next holiday sale after i've beaten all the default songs and challenges.\n\nControls are easily customizable which was good because i wasn't a fan of the default layout they had set up.  They mentioned controller support but I have yet to try since i'm happy with the arrow keys.\n\nI think the only negative i can think of is the lack of mouse support for the menus, but it is functional with the arrow keys as if i was using a controller.\n\n\nOverall, i highly recommend this game if you are a fan of rhythm games and/or stepmania.  I can already tell this is going to be a game i keep coming back to after i finish all the story missions and challenges.\n\nUpdate: New update added endless mode and multiplayer support.  Endless mode is interesting, it adds randomized songs with modifiers being added to make it more difficult, but also increase the points you receive.  You can then spend thess points on new unlocks.

I found this game to be truly exhausting to play because of how hard I had to focus in order to play effectively (Sort of ties in with the previous point.)\n- It can be very difficult to do guitar parts on higher difficulties on a keyboard (My fingers are already clumped up on WASD and you expect me to do constantly changing chords in rapid succession? Or to shred up and down the 'fretboard'? Fuck that noise.)\n\nEven those that last point probably sounds like I'm really complaining, it's honestly not that big of a deal. Let me put it this way, I was able to beat the entire game on Normal with relative ease. A couple songs gave me a little trouble, but it only took me a couple of tries for those trouble songs.

After having played through all of Before the Echo I was hoping to see more of that particular style of game, and sure enough Kasedo Games managed to deliver! The Metronomicon has a ridiculous amount of polish to it, with outstanding character models, fluent animation, an easy to learn gameplay, and of course fantastic music. With well over 40 different tracks to dance to you will not be bored of this game for a long time, and if you're one who is already familiar with the concept of dance arrow games like DDR or Stepmania this should be insanely easy to pick up. Additionally there's no need to worry about benched party members being underleveled, so no matter where you are in the game you can always change up your team with no hassle.\n\nThe only thing I really don't like about the game are the arena challenges. While the specific challenges are really creative and enjoyable I do not like that a majority of them force you to use a fixed team, and because of that certain challenges are specifically designed in a way to be down to the wire so if you mess up once you fail. While it's still a fun mode, it would be a lot more enjoyable if you could pick your team for all of the challenges, to add that bit of flexibility and creativity when approaching each challenge.\n\nOverall though The Metronomicon proves to be an unbelievable gaming experience, and is a welcome addition to any rhythm game fan especially. Everything was programmed with the utmost care, and aside from one certain achievement, just about everything provides a fair, but challenging difficulty scale. It's also really disappointing that this game isn't getting enough attention because the polish and the time that went into this game is beyond a professional level.\n\nIf you've ever been curious about this game then you should definitely get it, you will not be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1476632601, "timestamp_updated": 1477630644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545880", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26056423": {"recommendationid": "26056423", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998919486", "num_games_owned": 662, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484164558}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended. \n\nA balance between RPG and Rhythm.

The tracks are overwhelmingly worthwhile and fun to play, the difficulty levels are well balanced, and it even has leaderboards for every song and challenge. The only complaint I have as the rhythm game goes is that I had random occasional stutters that usually cost me my combo. That's not a huge deal in this game, but it's extremly annoying. \n\nIf you're buying it primarily as an RPG, don't. The RPG battle mechanics are here to spice up the tired \"falling gems\" rhythm game, and while they certainly succeed in that sense, they're meant to play second fiddle. As such, you don't need to think about them much at all, and they're not going to make the game worthwhile for you if the rhythm gameplay isn't enough on its own. The story is passably entertaining, but maybe a thousand words at most and not something you're going to remember. None of this is enough of a flaw to be remotely concerning if you're here for the rhythm game. \n\nThe \"side quests\" offered just a few regular songs with the leaderboard set to track something other than score, like max combo or damage healed. They're not very entertaining, but the ~two dozen arena battles go a step further in also modifying environment and other mechanics, which is fun. \n\nOn a last note, while the acting in the voice acting is well done, several characters clearly weren't recorded in a professional studio and their voices are distractingly low quality.

You cannot experience glee. It is not over until the winning  is done. That is what Patapon taught me.\nAs the great one, these are the things I invested into my eyeball warriors.\nAnd they're champions.\n\n\nIts not hard, really, so as long as you can get a feel for the beat right away, which you will if you're not deaf, and provided  you can keep your teams needs in check.\nthe games music, while absoutely suburb, in my opinion, also has a very obvious beat, just like in Patapon. I feel honestly the music should present you a challenge but none  exists. Just don't get lost in the music and you cannot fail.\nThe story is very meh thusfar, and Violet is mega annoying.

Its really really good. \nAnd if you're not violet, your voice acting is excellent.\n\nOne last thing. In patapon, your goal was nearly always in front of you.\n\nHere, its not clear what you're supposed to be doing....so you just kinda keep making attacks until you get a result so...keep your goal in mind when it tells it to you.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1476078921, "timestamp_updated": 1510210815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506549", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25933383": {"recommendationid": "25933383", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971034574", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509303042}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love this game.

I didn't buy the accompanying soundtrack at first, but now I'm considering it.\n\nFantastic difficulty curve: This one is important, I was kind of worried when I first tried some hard songs that I would never get good enough to beat them.  A couple weeks in, and I can beat every song on hard and am working my way up on some leaderboards.  It really is addicting because I never felt \"stuck\" in the game where I stopped accomplishing things.\n\nCool RPG elements:  At the end of the game, you have enough equipment and unique abilities to really create some special task forces for accomplishing certain goals (like most damage on a song, most enemies killed on a song, most spells cast).  Creating a party around specific goals is actually really fun too, it's not just all about the rhythm game!\n\nOverall for a summary of the game, I would definitely say this is a rhythm game first and an RPG second.  But it's a really well done fusion of the two.  Pretty much all skill levels are welcome; I think most anybody should find easy doable, many can probably jump in on medium.

The soundtrack is more diverse, but that's probably the only advantage of Metronomicon (personally, I liked BtE soundtrack a lot more, but everyone has different tastes I guess).\n\n1) The gameplay is a lot less skill-based and a lot more random. If your enemy wants to do damage when you don't have enough HP, it will do damage. If it wants to stun you, it will (and this will affect your final score). There is nothing you can do to control the situation (except for boss attacks, that actually give you a way to prevent the damage, like you normally can in BtE), so you kind of have to guess if you should heal one more time or try to kill one more enemy to get one more kill for the challenge.\n\n2) Interface tries to annoy you any time it has an opportunity to do so. You just finished one enemy and want to see the element of the next one? Well, here is an enemy, but it will take a few moments for its health bar to appear, so unless you want to memorize all the ugly sprites and their corresponding elements, you have to guess blindly. Any reasons to not show you an important UI element? Nope, just game being annoying. Another example: game convinced you that Water skills are blue, Fire ones are red, and Thunder ones are yellow? Basic color coding, works for every skill. Nice. Ok, quick quiz: as your cast spells, your battlefield changes from blue into red into yellow. Does it mean that it changed from water into fire into thunder? Of course not, it means \"first, second, third skill slot\", duh. It would probably kill the devs to be consistent, or to use different colors for unrelated things.\n\n3) Progression system is so broken that it makes the scoreboard system completely pointless. Want to compete with your friend and compare scores? The same song on the same character level may become a lot easier or harder based on the order in which you first completed these songs in the campaign (and this is permanent), so if you picked some other order, you may never be able to beat someone else's record, no matter how hard you try (the difference in mob levels will stay forever, even when you'll reach the level cap). Why they decided to implement this system is beyond me. And BTW, devs don't care about their game anymore, and have no intention to fix that.\n\n4) Performance. It's hard to believe, but a game that looks like a simple 2D arcade manages to drop frames at random moments on a powerful modern PC. Oh, and 1-2 seconds-long hickups every time you fiddle with the menus will make you hate the UI even outside of the combat.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun rhythm game, try Before the Echo instead.", "timestamp_created": 1475864437, "timestamp_updated": 1475865748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444472", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25907519": {"recommendationid": "25907519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255802108", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487687394}, "language": "english", "review": "Though, i did get this game for free which means i'm disqualified from the\"worth buying territorry.\nIt really does depend whether you like have hair or not.

Are you an RPG fan looking for something completely different? Do you wish to do battle with a Giant Tentacle Monster with glow-in-the-dark body paint?[/h1]\n\nIf so, look no further than The Metronomicon.\n\nDeveloped by Puuba and published by Kasedo Games, The Metronomicon is a Rhythm/RPG game. Simply put: it's what would happen if you took away the menus of Final Fantasy, and replaced them with four music tracks in the style of Guitar Hero, Dance Dance Revolution, or Rock Band.\n\nThe resulting game is near-perfect blend of the two genres, with players having to think, strategize, and time their skills correctly to destroy their enemies, buff their allies, and keep the team alive, while also giving an immediate (and if I may say so myself VERY fun) challenge with trying to hit a long enough series of notes to actually cast those spells and abilities.\n\nThis, accompanied by the incredible soundtrack,* a great amount of choice and depth with the player characters, and the many interesting and unique difficulty modifiers make for a great game with a lot of content and tons of replayability\u2014whether you're an expert gunning for the top spots on the leaderboard, or a newbie who keeps dying but keeps coming back for the music and the fun.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\n[b]Blended To Perfection[/b] \u2013 Match your attack's element to your enemy, get massive damage. Achieve a high streak in the double digits, watch your teammates perform new attacks and abilities that help lay the smack down on your enemies. Do both, and decimate your foes.\n\nNeither the RPG or Rhythm Game elements are overwhelming the other, or just feels like a gimmick\u2014both systems are woven together, and quite well.\n\n[b]Accessible[/b] - Not so great at rhythm games, but a master at RPG mechanics of abusing enemy weaknesses, healing, and buffing? You're good, the game provides items that give flat stat bonuses and a leveling system to gradually overpower the enemies and destroy them through superior stats. Great at rhythm games, a master of high streaks, not so much the synergies of abilities? You're also good, the game also provides items that provide boosts for the streakers among you. Suck at both? Don't worry, the penalties for missing notes and breaking streaks is very forgiving, and the Easy mode is just that\u2014a great mode to learn the nuances of Rhythm games without the game over screens.\n\n[b]Variety For Days[/b] \u2013 You know that old saying, 'Variety is the spice of Life'? The Metronomicon has it in spades. \n\nWith the music, unless you've got a thing against modern music like rock and dubstep, you'll most definitely find a handful (or a lot of) songs that you will replay the stages of constantly or chill out with in the DJ Room.\n\nWith the combat, you can mix and match to your heart's content with a very deep system. Do you run with a full damage build of a Berserker, a Thief, a Warrior, and an Exploder, believing that the best defense is kersplodinating everything before it has a chance to even attack? Do you play the Protector more as a tank, soaking up damage for the rest of the party, or as combat support, stunning enemies, dealing damage right back, and even healing the party? Do you want to take advantage of your streak building skills and use an item that automatically buffs your party as you hit the upper double digits, or do you use an item that gives your characters a substantial raw boost in power standard?\n\nAnd if you find vanilla combat too easy or too boring, there's also a large number of ways to vary up your experience. Too easy? Rack up the difficulty. Looking for something different? Try the arena challenges, where you fight with preset teams, and have modifiers like constantly falling rocks to dodge, spinning and wobbling notes, or trying to \u201cbefriend\u201d monsters for an entire song, healing and defending yourself as they try to rip your face off.\n\n[b]Awesome Music, Awesome Track Choreography[/b] \u2013 Worried that the notes won't match up, rendering the music background noise to a game of memory? Fear not: from my experience, all three difficulties and all four tracks at any given time sync up to the music, and you can even adjust the latency of your inputs for devices and monitors with delays.\n\n[b]Silliness[/b] \u2013 A fantasy world is being terrorized by mysterious night clubs falling from the sky, attracting monsters who destroy everything around it by morning. A school is established, teaching humans how to dance and fight at the same time, in an effort to produce graduates who will infiltrate these parties, shut them down, and ultimately destroy the source.\n\nThe Metronimicon is very, very, VERY aware that this is a very silly plot, to say the least, and it runs with it.\n\nYour black mage Violet is called the \u201cExploder\u201d and true to form, she's positively giddy at the prospect of \u201ckersplodinating\u201d legions of bad guys, and any day where the world is due to be destroyed and she needs to blow up the biggest baddie in the world is a great day indeed. Enemies include haunted disco balls that produce weapons and tools out of neon lights, feisty hermit crabs wearing sweet bling, mermaids with rayguns, giant bears in wife beaters, the aforementioned giant tentacle monster with neon glow-in-the-dark face paint, and even creepy tiny lizards who need to stand up on a box to actually reach you. The descriptions for your sidequests involve saving the arena's hotdog stand from ravenous monsters, wearing experimental shades from the laboratory that make you completely colour-blind, and going through three strong straight while the arena mistress goes off for lunch.\n\nAnd this isn't even getting into the equipment, like the \u201cDirt Endirtener\u201d which is useful for killing lightning elementals and building sick sandcastles, the \u201cFull-Body lipgloss\u201d that'll make you shine like the sun, and the \u201cBottom Flappy Bit,\u201d the most important part of any piece of armour that you should open before using.\n\nIn an industry filled to the brim with games trying to be taken \u201cseriously\u201d with \u201cmature\u201d plots and themes, The Metronomicon bucks that trend with a swift kick that's part of a sick series of dance moves, all to the tune of awesome music.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\n[b]The Buff and Debuff UI[/b] \u2013 Both are given as tiny icons on the bottom of the screen, with only two colours: opaque \u201cactive\u201d and a blinking\u201d about to \u201cwear off\u201d mode. Neither are very helpful in terms of information, how long it will last, and oftentimes, you'll have to develop an instinct to know how long a certain buff lasts before you need to cast it again\u2014and oftentimes, in the heat of a complex series of notes, you really can't check and only notice until it's long run out.\n\n[b]Silliness[/b] \u2013 Obviously, such a lighthearted, not-serious, and colourful game will have people that find the humour and the comedic elements lacking, annoying, and falling flat.\n\n[h1]Should I get this?[/h1]\n\nAbsolutely. Rhythm game fans, RPG fanatics looking for something different, even just people willing to jump into a new genre if it means getting away from the \u201cGritty, Realistic, Modern\u201d games and their \u201cserious\u201d plots for \u201cserious, mature\u201d trend the AAA industry is so keen in going down.\n\nBuy it, play it, tell your friends about it\u2014The Metronomicon is a real gem that is more than worth your time and money.\n\n* Favourites include \u201cLive It Up\u201d by Shiny Toy Guns, \u201cI Thought The Future Would Be Cooler\u201d by YACHT, \u201cFor The Love Of God\u201d by Rosie, and of course, the game's theme song: \u201cFighting with the Melody\u201d by Jimmy Urine of Mindless Self Indulgence.", "timestamp_created": 1475639966, "timestamp_updated": 1475640009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25862546": {"recommendationid": "25862546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072680419", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513832337}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, it scratches that guitar hero itch ive been having.

The next thing is a bit of exposition, followed by a brief combat scenario that acts as a tutorial for the Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution inspired RPG.\"\n\n\"The story of The Metronomicon follows four students of a dancing combat school (of sorts) where they are trained to fight the monsters that have been invading their realm with the power of dance. The invading monsters have brought with them unruly music, throwing raves all across the realm, disturbing the peace, and unsettling the locals. It\u2019s up to the player and their band of plucky adventurers to dance these monsters to death while meeting friends and gathering loot along the way. I may be paraphrasing a bit, but the story itself, while cheesy in a lighthearted and somewhat charming and funny way, is entirely forgettable. But that\u2019s okay, because the meat of the game, the note hitting EDM infused RPG combat, stands on its own without any need for exposition.\"\n\n\"If you\u2019ve ever played Guitar Hero or Dance Dance Revolution, you already have a pretty good idea of how this game plays. Players will enter battle with a party of four heroes, each with their own unique set of skills and equipment. As monsters are defeated and songs are cleared, the heroes will level up, increasing their base stats, the strength of their skills, and learning some new skills along the way. While in combat, only one hero can act at a time, adding a layer of strategy and forethought to the game. Players will toggle between heroes, hit the notes in the track as they fall to the bottom (as in the aforementioned inspirations), and perform an attack, buff, or heal based on what skills the hero currently has equipped. Skills can be equipped in three slots \u2013 low, middle, and high. The higher the slot, the stronger the skill\u2019s effect will be. Using different skills is based on how long the string of notes hit is on the selected hero. It only takes a few notes to hit each tier, but hitting higher tiers can be tricky, as any mistake will break your chain thereby defaulting your move to the last tier you successfully hit. There is a risk/reward aspect to character builds, as placing vital skills in higher tiers can both help immensely when activated, or cause you to effectively lose a turn  if missed or interrupted.\"\n\n\"There are a variety of game modes available to keep players coming back for more, grinding out levels, earning gear, and obtaining Street Cred (the game\u2019s currency) to build new facilities and unlock gameplay features. Free play allows players to casually play any unlocked songs, while the Arena offers sets of challenges to push player\u2019s skills in an effort to earn more loot to strengthen your heroes. There are side quests to complete and three difficulties for those looking for an even greater challenge. Those looking for a reason to dust off their USB guitars and DDR mats can also do so here as the game supports both input methods. But for all the content on offer, don\u2019t come to this game expecting a deep and engrossing experience. Though it never deliberately bills itself as such, it\u2019s easy to focus on and get lost in the RPG aspects of the game and find the experience to be lacking. This is a game intended for short play sessions, not lengthy binges. It is a rhythm game at its core, with a role playing layer on top, not vice versa. For as much variety and replayability as the RPG mechanics can add, they are relatively shallow and those looking for an RPG may leave disappointed. The songs may not appeal to everyone either, and while there is definitely some variety, expect a heavy dose of techno, house, electronica, and dubstep in most worlds.\"\n\nTL;DR: Overall, it is an easily recommendable game.

That being said, I will be giving my full and honest opinion of the game.\n\n==The Concept==\nThe Metronomicon is the fusion of rhythm style Rock Band and Guitar Hero style lane gameplay with a fully fleshed out RPG with unique and voiced characters, skills, equipment, and detailed storyline.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Metronomicon immediately throws you a curveball going with four lanes of notes instead of just one. Each lane corresponds to one of your four party members. To cast various abilities set by the player, notes must be played on rhythm with the music in order to charge up and cast their abilities. Think of Chrono Trigger style active combat except instead of just waiting for a bar to fill up, you play musical notes to charge up your abilities.\n\nEach song plays out with monsters coming at you. Defeating them earns you currency you can use to unlock songs as well as a chance at equipment drops. Each stage also comes with a mini-boss that can be defeated for a special type of currency to further enhance your party members.\n\nAs you defeat enemies and stages your party members will level up (just like an RPG!) giving them access to new skills and making them stronger. As you continue your adventure through the various lands, you\u2019ll be gearing up, refining your character loadouts, and farming up loot drops just like an RPG but to some dope ass music! Normally I\u2019m not a particular fan of the straight up Rock Band/Guitar Hero gameplay, but the RPG framework tying everything together struck the perfect chord with me. (GET IT?! That\u2019s a music joke!)\n\n==Music==\nWith the included original songs composed for the game, the Metronomicon offers 50 tracks, some with and some without lyrics. The soundtrack is amazing. Every song was hand choreographed and feels great to play on all the difficulty settings. I personally play on Easy and Medium difficulty, with Hard being a little out of my league. For those rhythm game fanatics out there, I think Hard will definitely prove a decent challenge.\n\n==Controls==\nThe game can be played with a controller, mouse and keyboard, and even a dance pad, or quite frankly, just about any device that can be bound to keys! I play with a mouse and keyboard and have had no issues. The controls can be completely customized, so find a setup that works and is comfortable for you.\n\n==Conclusion==\nAs I stated above, I received the game for free and have been playtesting it. Take everything here with a grain of salt of course. This review has probably sounded like a big ad for the game, but honestly, any negatives I found I had with it while playtesting were changed or addressed during development. I love this game. I wouldn\u2019t have already put 30+ hours into it already if I didn\u2019t love it. I know I\u2019ll be playing it all over again now that the game is being released.\n\nI can definitely recommend this title to anyone who enjoys this genre of gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1475161467, "timestamp_updated": 1475161467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466489", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25766601": {"recommendationid": "25766601", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966527290", "num_games_owned": 2724, "num_reviews": 388, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475773391}, "language": "french", "review": "\"On pourra reprocher beaucoup de choses \u00e0 The Metronomicon, comme une certaine r\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9, l\u2019absence d\u2019un mode \u00ab Extreme \u00bb qui proposerait un gros d\u00e9fi pour les habitu\u00e9s du genre ou l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y jouer \u00e0 plusieurs\u2026.

It's the game design and how it uniquely emphasizes the strategy element that really shines here: every decisions that the developers made seems to have been well thought out. The chaos of trying not only to juggle the 4 different characters and their spells, but doing that while keeping yourself alive and noticing elemental weaknesses and the such, it all really works. While it's more leinant in the rhythm genre then others, it works due to the RPG elements. And the soundtrack for the most part gives a good variety of songs that are of a reasonable quality, despite there being a few duds in there. Granted, there is a rock/pop focus, but every now and again you'll get a surprise of a 8 bit tune. In the end, The Metronomicon not only feels a lot different from a lot of the rhythm games on the market, it ends up being addictive and something that you won't want to put down. A definite day one purchase for rhythm gamers out there, and a great gateway game to the genre for those who have always wondered if they'd enjoy it. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f44R5PEkOGo\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] This may seem like a weird ass comparison, but the dual gameplay with the rhythm and the strategy element reminds me a lot of the World Ends With You. You need to focus on the rhythm, while the back of your mind is focusing on what spells you need to cast. It REALLY works.\n[*] The spell element and knowing when to move on and when to keep going in terms of the levels to cast works well here in the strategy element. Taking into account enemy's elements, and what your party needs, you'll have to stay on top of things.\n[*] The game design as a whole. For example, while the game is more leinant then most rhythm games in terms of timing: it's done due to the strategy element that's played out here. It's purposeful, it makes sense given the implementation, and feels like they really thought about how all these pieces fit together. That's the sign of a well designed game.\n[*] Good variety in the characters to allow for a wide variety of strategies. Defensive, offensive, buff wise, etc. \n[*] Good Difficulty curve. No grinding needed, but enough challenge so that you consider getting a level or two. The hard difficulty is a good challenge. \n[*] The ability to switch characters and how it affects gameplay is implemented well. Timely switches when you're in trouble or when you need to cast a spell right now puts the strategy at the forefront.\n[*] Like how the status effects actually effects your ability to stay on rhythm. \n[*] For the most part, a very, very good soundtrack. There's some highlights here that really stand out, and there's a good variety despite there being a pop/rock focus.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The UI could be designed a little better, as the focus on the middle of the screen needed to be taken advantage of. Some elements on the edge are hard to see when you're trying to focus on hitting notes.\n[*] The story really takes a back seat to the gameplay. It's not bad, it just feels like more can be done with it.\n[*] Wanted to see more done with the attack animations in terms of the dance theme. Some times it works, but other times it really, really doesn't. \n[*] There's a few bad duds in the album here. Like bad bad ones.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1475161377, "timestamp_updated": 1475161390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39468395": {"recommendationid": "39468395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036446642", "num_games_owned": 1773, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "last_played": 1516466073}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad tenia mis dudas por el precio que ten\u00eda, pero la verdad es que los vale.\n\nSi os gustan los juegos de ritmo, este os va a encantar, pues ajustar la dificultad a tu gusto, tiene toques de rol y la musica esta bastante chula.", "timestamp_created": 1516398813, "timestamp_updated": 1516398813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 178, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 189}}

You honestly feel like a normal guy, going around doing his job and not being an ass along the way. You don't get a backstory, name, or any of that jazz, but it doesn't take away from the game in the least, in fact given the brief nature of the game I think such things would have felt forced and unnessicary anyway.\n\n-Don't like the soundtrack? Switch it for another tune you can buy at one of the shops. there are a total of... seven, I believe? Each one still feels like it fits the game, but has a different-enough feel that at least one should appeal to your tastes.\n\n-Feeling a little prudish? Got someone around you don't want to give a bad impression? Switch on the censor mode, it only gets rid of the bits that make things \"Too\" revealing, so you still feel rewarded without looking like a total perv.\n\n\nAs far as problems with the game go, I could only count one, though perhaps it was actually an easter egg... trying to give yoga-girl an item after getting her picture will give the prompt \"Do you want to quit the game? Y/N\" with her sprite attached, as though she is speaking. Sure enough it'll do just that. Given that I initially tried this with a rose, some part of me hoped this would start a mini-game. It did not.\n\nOh, and burger-man is still depressed after you help him, instead of happily flipping burgers as a burger-man should rightly do.\n\nIf you're looking for a story intensive game, or anything that'll get the adrenaline pumping(Shooters, smart-ass), you're in the wrong place, but this game is a good cross between relaxing and being engaged at the same time. if you just go around talking to people, satisfying your own curiosity, and, well, touching things, you can pretty much solve any problem that comes your way, and make progress in the process.\nI'm not a fan of giving decimals with my ratings, so I'm slapping a solid 9/10 on this game. You get exactly what you're paying for. This is no dating sim, there's no complex story to it all, or a thousand choices to make. It's not a dungeon-crawler, there are no \"bad ends\" here. Its a game about wandering a beach-side city in search of a few hot girls, all while listening to some killer tunes. For that I have to say it's a small gem, one that has me excited at the prospect of potential expansions, or the sequel implied by an in-game character.

The camera is sort of looking towards you at an angle from above, and the game has a kind of older, and fairly simplistic style and feel overall.  I really like that about the style, as it does have improvements over something from that older time, yet it added newer polish without spoiling the soul of that older feel...  \n\nAs you start, you'll find and grab requests from various women you encounter. For a game that reminds me of an updated older flash game, it's quite fun!  I do wish there were a little bit more art for potential research purposes.  It's nicely done artwork, but the game is quite short overall, and one can finish the entire game in around an hour or so. I played through twice though just to snag the rest of the achievements I missed the first go, so I personally enjoyed it very much.\n\nThe music was not too bad, so that's a plus.  Problem is, you have to buy new tunes at a store, and your game money is a little limited if you try to fit all the achievements into your first run through the game and have no idea what you're doing, or spending a little recklessly (on bananas, for example).\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\nEnjoyable gameplay, if you like small chains of tasks. I found it very addictive overall though!\n\nGoal-oriented: You get to see anime tiddies in most pictures, and a few butt shots along with those in several, so it's nice having that motivation to press forward in your questing!  Varied poses and props in the images, and it kept things interesting as I completed a quest chain and got to snap a new \"foto\".\n\nArtwork is well-done when you earn your final shots with each of the ten gals you encounter, most having that playful or humorous vibe to them.  The overall oldschool feel with more polished graphics is also nicely done.\n\nPretty easy to complete the game, if one likes something that is not too difficult. Aside from confusion in some spots, and wandering around with the different requests you're getting in the game, that's about the worst of the difficulty.  Pretty laid back.\n\nTwice the pay-off!  A reward from each girl, but you also get paid in game money when you return it to the pin-up magazine business with your \"foto\"!\n\nThe quests were slightly varied in a few cases, so that made things a little more fun and interesting.  It worked well and helped break some possible monotony, in my opinion.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\nThe game is not very long. For some this might be a pro I guess.\n\nNot enough women to take shots of!   Could use more cleavage shots, or some extra photography subjects.  A little bit more of either would have been nice.\n\nEnvironment is fairly small overall.  Confusing as well at times, so a map might have been nice.\n\nGlitched item + shop quit option. Using the catalogue on the woman in coffee shop for instance brings up a \"Do you want to quit\" option, for some reason.  Needs fixing as of the time of my completion of the game.\n\nYou get music you can buy as you go, but by the time I felt confident enough in having plenty of money to do all that I needed, I didn't really have a chance to listen to the tunes.  Would be better if they had been added in as rewards for finishing goals, or something similar.\n\nIt's a little above what I would consider a reasonable price for the amount of gameplay and research involved.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI suggest grabbing this game sometime when it's on sale if you like shorter ecchi games.  Maybe try some of the Frank's Adventures games first if you are on the fence, since those are free, to my knowledge. \n\nEven though one can probably complete the entire game within the Valve policy time limit and return it, that's not cool at all!  Why would you want to do that?!  I guess if you are really that unhappy with it...  but, I think they are counting on you taking a bit longer, once you have acquired all the pictures.  Anyway, I liked it a lot!

For those who get that reference I would imagine that should be enough to tell you if you'd be interested in this or not.\n\nFor those who may not get that reference, however, Foto Flash is a scavenger hunt at its core.  You play a photographer for a pin-up magazine who needs some new photos to feature in their next issue, and it's your job to go around town and find women willing to pose for pictures.  There are ten women in all to find and photograph, but each one will require you to find one or more items before they'll be willing to model for your magazine.\n\nThe visuals for the game are appealing, with some good pixel work for the characters and environments done by the developer Daner (who also did the great soundtrack as well) and some amazing artwork for the models done by an artist named Raf (her Twitter handle is @Rafchu if you wish to see more of her work).  It should be noted that most of the photos you get from the women who model for you do feature some nudity (typically some nipple slip or straight toplessness), but the developer did add in a censor mode if you wish to block that portion of the content.\n\nAt the end of the day there is very little actual gameplay here and the game is fairly short (my first run through took a little less than an hour and I got all but two of the achievements).  That being said the game is priced very fairly at $2.99.  Coupled together with the game's beautiful artwork, quirky humor, fun little scavenger hunt and catchy, upbeat soundtrack, Foto Flash makes for a light, but ultimately enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1518111941, "timestamp_updated": 1518112124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39933683": {"recommendationid": "39933683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077535456", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517958167}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fun.\n\nI also felt like absolute trash while playing it.\n\n20(baseballs) / 10 would buy bananas from a clown again.", "timestamp_created": 1518108427, "timestamp_updated": 1518108427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39932330": {"recommendationid": "39932330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040061503", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518104264}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u307e\u3041\u305f\u307e\u306b\u597d\u304d\u304b\u3082\u3063\u3066\u611f\u3058\u306e\u304a\u4f7f\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\n\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3067\u3082\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u304b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u611f\u3058\n\u5589\u304c\u6e07\u3044\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u3053\u308c\u3092\u8cb7\u3046\u3068\u3044\u3044\u3088", "timestamp_created": 1518104244, "timestamp_updated": 1518104244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39930733": {"recommendationid": "39930733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100325347", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518283940}, "language": "english", "review": "A game similar to Frank's Adventure?

The premise is simple. You are a pro photographer called in to help a magazine that somehow forgot to get any models that month.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple. The game is played from a top down view and you can talk to people nd interact with certain objects with a single button. The game boils down to walking around picking up objects and finding the right person to present them to. There are 10 girls scattered around the map each with a 'quest'. Once completed they will give you a risque image of themself to give to your boss for some cash which you can use to complete other objectives or buy different BGM. \n\nThats all there really is to it, which to be fair is all its inspiration ever was. Some characters and even the location seem to be lifted straight from Frank's adventure. On the plus side though this game has entirely original art unlike Frank which just had images ripped from various H-games. The art is appealing (at least to me) although I do wish the photo's you were hunting for had actual backgrounds. The soundtrack is also funky and fun enough for the hour (or less) you play the game.\n\nKnow what you're getting into before buying I guess. Play the free Frank's adventure online and if you have fun with it then this game should be good for you. If you are looking for anything beyond a timewaster with boobs though I'd say look elsewhere. I do think $3 is just a bit much considering the amount of content here. $2 seems more fair. You should be able to beat it in one sitting.\n\nI liked this but I do hope the developers go a little further with the next release. The Frank's Adventure series improved over time so hopefully this will as well. The ending sets up what sounds like a copy of Franks Adventure 2 but I hope the devs go a little wilder with their own creativity instead of just making 'Frank's Adventure 2 HD'. Have some more involved or crazy quests. Have some more unique girls, etc.\n\nSo again, light recommendation. There isnt anything really wrong with the game objectively.\n\n+Art of sexy ladies\n+Chilled out music\n+Cheap\n+Easy 100% Acheivements\n~Short\n~Almost the same thing as Frank's Adventure\n-Some characters can be spoken to from the sides while others cant.

As such, we won't be talking about that in-depth. If you don't enjoy the plot given on the Store Page, then this game won't be for you. If you are interested in my opinion of the \"H Pictures,\" see the category: Art and Music.\n \nBefore you close the serious review for what's more or less a comedic game, let me say that it was very enjoyable and it garners my recommendation. It was a palette cleanser to me after all the games I've played in the interlude. For the better, it's very casual and the puzzles are easy enough to solve. If you're looking for something short and funny, pick this up at your nearest convenience.\n \n[h1]Settings[/h1]\n \nThere are a decent amount of settings for the game. The only criticism for this category is the option for windowed mode. If not in fullscreen mode, you cannot specify a resolution. This is otherwise a minor gripe as there are there are other ways of exiting the application while keeping it running. Fret not ye who have others in your place of staying, you can still prevent shame.\n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n \nOf my playtime, there were no cases of frame drops, crashes, or any other bugs to note. However, interacting with characters proved a bit difficult at first as you need to be directly in front of most characters to be able to interact with them. Only when giving them items could you be in a tile adjacent to them in any direction. This is remedied over time by the player but hopefully will be changed in future games. The puzzles are simple enough if you pay attention to the dialogue and most of the time is spent in exploration. As such, the music plays a large role.\n \nFor those who have trouble with direction, you would think a map would be nice. Maybe and maybe not. A map might make it a bit too simple and it wasn't a bother to explore in the slightest. Once again, this is because of the music.\n \n[h1]Art and Music[/h1]\n \nThe overall aesthetic is very bright and colorful. Just enough to look beautiful but not enough to look blinding. I suppose this is a decent enough place to talk about the pictures which most people will buy the game for. [b]If you're looking for material, you should know the art style makes it so the girls are portrayed in a way that I don't really know how to describe. The closest style would be something akin to Huniecam Studio. As such, I don't think this is particularly what you're looking for if that's exclusively the reason you're buying the game. Otherwise, I think it's quite nice and provides a good incentive to complete the given quests.[/b]\n \nThe music is also very nice. Pass by the record shop in-game and pick up all the music when you have the money. They're all a joy to listen to. Even the default track is nice so you won't find yourself bored.\n \n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\n \nIt's only $2.99 and is a good pickup for when you're bored. There are a few gripes but nothing is glaringly bad and is instead inexplicably fun. Enjoy the ride and do try to hide the fact that you own this game. Not because of its quality, just its subject matter.

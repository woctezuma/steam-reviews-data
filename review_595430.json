Not only does Sky Knights make you feel like a Top Gun pilot, but it looks really cool while doing it.\nThis is a no-brainer, and you should definitely be adding this to your collection.\n\nThe controls are basic and easy to get into, and covers what you'd expect for an arcade flight simulator.  Throttle up & down, Turn left & right, Fire primary & secondary weapons... and then of course there's the afterburner and the \"maneuvers\" mechanic. \nPush the manevuer button and you'll pull back on the stick to shoot  into the air where you can then position yourself for a kill (or escape!). As your own experience grows you'll be able to perform amazing dogfights - where air tactics actually play out as you'd expect... AND you can see it all due to the beautiful contrails. Just watch out for the sides of those cliffs though!\n\nThere's a good selection of US & Soviet fighters to choose from, and each with a particular role ranging from ground attack to air supremecy.  Matches are 4v4 skirmishes where you need to destroy 3 of the enemy's bases before they get yours, and it generally lasts about 20 minutes a match.\n\nAs you level up you unlock special abilities which then become available in matches, to be purchase with currency you get by destroying enemy units.  This is a very well thought out progression system for both your own level as well as the skirmish map.\n\nAudio and video quality is of equally high standards than the rest of the game design and mechanics. It's not trying to be super realistic with visuals, but it's own unique style works extremely well.\nThe game is still in Early Access, so there's only 2 available maps. I'm sure we'll be getting more maps and expanded features down the line. [b]Even for an Early Access game it delivers a wonderful, fun and solid experience[/b].\n\nAll in all I'm strugling to find anything negative about this game. It is super fun, well designed, and I get to feel like a fighter pilot! I'm extremely exciting to see where this will be going, and based on the Discord channel the developer is very interactive.\n\nSo... Get it, it's good :)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514466991, "timestamp_updated": 1514466991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38722189": {"recommendationid": "38722189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295420585", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 109, "last_played": 1514407641}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun game I enjoy it", "timestamp_created": 1514345425, "timestamp_updated": 1514345425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38558571": {"recommendationid": "38558571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041681580", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 316, "last_played": 1514842136}, "language": "english", "review": "To all my friends and my millions of Steam followers: BUY this game!

The game has a lot of spirit to it and the maneuver/stamina system hits the sweet spot of easy to learn, but hard to master. While only controlled with a single button, the maneuver system adds a whole new dimension to the dogfighting and interacts well with other flight mechanics. A confrontation between two planes doesn't just come down to turning speeds and a well-played A-10 can get the advantage over a Su-27. The tutorials in-game, guides, and matches against bots allow for newer players to get the hang of flying their plane, while the actual matches can get intense and competitive. I've witnessed many games come down to a single bombing run on a base. Your contribution to your team's success is also very noticeable and the result of the match doesn't feel arbitrary or random. If you're looking for a nice multiplayer game with both strategy and skill involved or are into fighter jets, Sky Knights is a wonderful game to pick up.\n\nNow, as with any indie multiplayer game, the life of the community is very critical to its success. The Sky Knights community is small as of right now, but is growing. Bots will have to fill up the empty slots on most matches, but chances are very high that you'll play against at least some players. Joining the Discord server can also help a lot with finding matches and playing during peak times on the right servers will definitely be rewarding.\n\nOne common criticism of Sky Knights is the lack of content. This is unfortunately true to some degree. There is a limited selection of planes, maps, and gamemodes. However, the content that is present is good. Each of the planes fills its own unique role and the balance between them is good. There are only two maps so far, one offering a greater emphasis on skill and the other on strategy, but both hold up to gameplay. Woodlands runs slightly slower than the other map, but still offers good gameplay. A recent patch made the map run a lot smoother and will hit a manageable FPS on slower computers. The game definitely needs more content in order to grow, but the developer updates it regularly and is very involved with the community. This game definitely has a future as long as the community stays as active as it is.\n\nAlso, there's no microtransactions. You just pay the $10 for the game.

It's such a little gem to me. And it has potential... great potential. There are a couple caveats, but read on.\n\nIt's very approachable, but has enough depth to allow player skill to actually influence a match. You can get in a plane and use strategy - lay in wait, make the right runs and decisions, and perform with little actual skill, just patience and strategy. Or you can master your aerodynamics, make turns other players can only dream about, and smoke half the enemy team's superiority fighters while flying a multirole. And the best part is, their strategy can still give your skill a run for its money. Keep in mind that all the while, this is a 2 1/2 dimension top-down arcade game, too.\nI can't speak to the PC controls, although I'd be concerned about precision in them, but I absolutely loved the XBox controls, having played a bunch of Ace Combat before.\nPersonally, I find the matches a bit short, but they can pack in quite a bit of action. The choices you make and upgrades you buy are crucial, and require an eye that understands the flow of battle. If you're excellent at air superiority, a good option is to swat down attackers and base rushers, limiting your losses and strafing ground targets in your spare time. If you're more of a ground pounder, you can jump in an attacker and shred the ground forces, doing significant damage to enemy bases and paving the way for your ground armies to conquer. And you can surprise a cocky fighter or two and gun them down, too. Or you can be a jack of all trades: with skill in both areas, you can almost instantly change modes and tactics. Buzz around the middle and create your own no-fly zone, realize the match is at a breaking point and bomb a base in seconds.\nThe disparity between players lies mostly in skill and choice, and I love that. There's not really a tier system, as planes are generally equally useful with equal pilots. There is a progression, as you unlock additional perks and upgrades until you reach level 20. That's not a huge grind, and you can do it without facing a single player, as the PvE rooms grant mostly the same rewards as players, with the exception of Ranks for finding a place on the leaderboard and Wings for buying decals (and hopefully soon, camos and skins).\nWith the recent addition of the MiG-21, it shows there will be achievement-based ways to unlock new aircraft and that excites me. It paves the way for craft like the A-4 Skyhawk, the A-8 Crusader, the F-14 Tomcat and the MiG-31 Foxhound. Indeed this game has great potential, if it can survive......\n\nThe two things it lacks is, first, content: because it's a one man job in his spare time, the maps probably take a while to make, and the game was only recently feature complete, it's barely in beta. That will come with time, and hopefully, community involvement. I strongly recommend the addition of campaigns, semi-historical scenarios, and multiplayer co-op. The dev plays a lot of Wargame: Red Dragon so I trust him ;)\nThe second thing is a playerbase. While some of us are quite active and dedicated, there are very few of us. This alone is the number one reason why this second issue is not fixed: with so few players, more players are very reluctant to commit by purchasing this game, and it stays in this state. Bankler is doing what he can with this sale and with ingame events, but that alone may not enable this game to take off (punny).

That time you will spend is enjoyable to the last drop. The game is fast paced and intense, full of moments where you will feel like a superhero from a movie, and also times where you get shot down for being cocky. Now, at the time of this review the game does not have a lot of content, meaning some would consider this an investment, this game is in early access and it is obvious from the gameplay, though I believe this game is the early access others should aspire to be. It shows promise, and is a very good buy in my honest opinion, but perhaps if you are paranoid about early access titles, you should watch a few videos or talk to people that own the game. Another thing that differentiate this early access from others is the active developer that is super down to earth, and has no problem talking to you about improving the game, not like other more corporal early access games. \n\nTL;DR:\nIf you like planes and dogfighting, or like quick arcade games, get this game.

The gameplay is rather simplistic if compared to other titles of this kind, as for now there is a kinda restricted number of upgrades and skills with which you can enhanche your vehicle during the match, and also generally just 3 classes of planes are sort of small choice, anyway the gameplay concerning PVP is good.\n\n===\n\n[h1] Gameplay Analysis [/h1]\n\n\n[b] General Gameplay [/b]\nSky Knights plays out as any moba can be: there are two teams composed by 4 players, each has 3 FOBs, Forward Operating Bases, which they have to protect. FOBs are also defended by fixed anti-air cannons, which act as Towers and can be destroyed by players and ground units (Creeps) alike. The first team to take out all 3 enemy FOBs will win the game.\n\nThere are 3 classes of planes currently available: Air Superiority, designed to bring down other aircrafts and equipped with the best PvP gear, it is made specifically to destroy enemy fighters and ground strike planes. Then we have the Fighter-Bomber, which is a middle class which can both be decent at dogfighting and ground attack, but is not great at any of those, a bit of a jack of all trades, has both bombs and missiles for planes. Last but not least there is the Ground Strike plane, designed to destroy ground targets such as Towers, vehicles, and FOBs, it comes equipped with anti-tank missiles which can 1-shot any ground unit, an autocannon to inflict pain to ground targets and bombs to inflict more damage to FOBs than any other weapon.\n\nAll planes share a common pool of upgrades you can buy with gold, which is earned by defeating enemy players, bots, ground vehicles, towers and FOBs. Some upgrades only apply to certain planes, for example extra bombs will only have an effect on planes that carry bombs, and so on.\n\nThe geam currently features leaderboards, a rank system, achievements, and passively unlocked upgrades, skins and other stuff you get by leveling up with XP, which is obviously earned by playing!\n\n\n\n[b] Combat System [/b]\nCombat in Sky Knights is fast-paced and i'd say equally skill and loadout based, as it is in all MOBAs after all. In combat each plane has a cone in front of it which defines the area its main gun can target, each plane has its own machinegun with its own damage and rate of fire, and also its own loadout. When engaging another plane, two things will make the difference, first is using the Afterburner, which consumes extra fuel but gives a great speed boost for a short time, useful to get closer, or farther, from enemies.\n\nThe second important thing are Manouvers, performed with Spacebar by default, if you do a manouver your plane will start doing a full 360 degrees turnaround, which can be oriented with direction and even stopped in the middle to perform some crazy stunts and catch an enemy unaware, of course you can shoot during this ability. These stunts cost Stamina though, and if you run out of it a great vision and maneuverability penalty will be inflicted, so also Stamina Management is important while fighting. What gear you got on your vehicle makes a big difference in combat, as i will better explain later in this review.\n\nAlways keep an eye out for how much ammo you have left for each weapon, if you run out, go back to your airstrip, land successfully without crashing and get repaired and rearmed in no time.\n\nCountermeasures are also availablle and are used to deflect heat-seeking missiles, but are impotent against radar-guided ones or machinegun fire. For now the amount of weapons availbale is pretty small but we do hope to see improvements in the future.\n\n\n[b] Content [/b]\nFor now content-wise, this game is pretty limited, expected to be as it is an early access alpha, the current content is somewhat solid but the presence of only one map, only 3 plane classes and not so many weapons and upgrades is underwhelming. General structure of upgrade system, progression system, leaderboards and achievemts is there, and overall there is barely enough content even for an alpha game, further updates will hopefully get this aspect better.\n\n\n[b] Balancing [/b]\nBalancing of weapons as far as statistics such as damage, range, quantity, etc. is good, except for SAHR missiles which are drastically overpowered as they cannot be dodged unless you have an upgrade... which can be unlocked only after some levels. And this is the amin problem of balance in this game: in MOBAs each player is supposed to start with different heroes but with the same potential, not being tied in any way to things such as levels.\n\nIn Sky Knights the situation is different, as many upgrades you can get during a match will have to be first unlocked with levels, so by playing many other matches before, and so players of many levels superior can face new low-level players and have a major advantage on them because of all those upgrades they unlocked with experience that the new, or low level players won't have. This is a major game design issue which could suit an MMORPG mayber but is totally out of place in a PvP MOBA-like game like this one. In the future i really hope this is resolved because it is one of tha major issues encountered with this game.\n\n\n[b] Challenge [/b]\nThe game system is simple to learn, it will take some time to fully understand how manouvers work and get used to stamina and fuel management mechanics, but overall the challenge will be derived from player skill and not from the complexity of the game system which is rather easy to learn at the moment.\n\n===\n\n[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]\n\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nGraphically, you can deduct just with a glimpse that Sky Knights is not exactly top-notch modern graphics, which is not always a bad thing, considering this is a low-budget indie early access game there is large space for improvement in teh future, and looks is not all in a game, but certainly does it part. Said this, graphics are rather simplistic, artistic pictures such as character portraits, plane portraits, backgrounds and UI are good, actual 3D models and game environment are on par with sufficent standards but barely, with the standards of 2017, this is barely sufficent even considering its low budget. Hopefully we will see resources invested in getting also this aspect better in the future, as for now all aspects from models, to efects, to particles, are just sufficent and barebones.\n\n\n[b] Sound [/b]\nSound effects are nothing spectacular, could have used with some more soundtracks and some chatter when enemies get destroyed, bases get hit, vehciles get smashed and so on... weapons and combat sounds are decent, could have used some better quality especially on gun sounds.\n\n\n[b] Performance [/b]\nVery low-impact game, could run on any current machine, and probably old ones too unless prehistoric or very low spec.\n\n\n[b] AI [/b]\nAI of bots is very primitive and completely cannot stand against human players, this combined with low playerbase results in the team having more players almost always winning because they can just feed upon AIs and get all the upgrades in the blink of an eye.\n\n[b] Quality of Life [/b]\nUI is decent, upgrade menu during matches could be improved with categories relative to which upgrade belongs to which plane, right now all upgrades are slammed in a window which becomes kind of a cluster later on when more and more upgrades get unlocked. Apart from this bad thing, nothing else is to be said about quality of life now.\n\n[b] Bugs / Issues [/b]\nNothing in particular to report.", "timestamp_created": 1503704488, "timestamp_updated": 1503704668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34410630": {"recommendationid": "34410630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156372923", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503649662}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun, Action Packed and modern jets beside the fun gameplay if any problems do arise the developer is there straight away and willing to help in anyway nesscary, great customer service and very nice person.

For anybody having doubts about the game or anybody wanting to write a negative review of this game I want you to realize that this game still is in early acces and that Bankler is a sole dev behind this game as of right now, he's working very hard on improving the game and adding content to it, if you have any questions or suggestions he's open to them (he created a suggestions forum/thread on Steam) and for questions you can approach him on the game's discord server.", "timestamp_created": 1502802959, "timestamp_updated": 1502802959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34231897": {"recommendationid": "34231897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326302375", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504450163}, "language": "english", "review": "Very guud tovarisch\nThe game its awesome, its worth if u want to buy it \nAproved by me", "timestamp_created": 1502702405, "timestamp_updated": 1502890018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34220070": {"recommendationid": "34220070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260043945", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1513887172}, "language": "czech", "review": "Really nice chill out fun multiplayer game.", "timestamp_created": 1502649787, "timestamp_updated": 1502649787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34186040": {"recommendationid": "34186040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299390717", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502984987}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fde\u4e0d\u4e0a\u7f51\u4ec0\u4e48\u60c5\u51b5", "timestamp_created": 1502525007, "timestamp_updated": 1502525007, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454013", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34169463": {"recommendationid": "34169463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261978659", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502528652}, "language": "schinese", "review": "add chinese server and chinese pls!!!!!\nWe Need It", "timestamp_created": 1502461130, "timestamp_updated": 1502461130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34119189": {"recommendationid": "34119189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214158169", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502177018}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyunu ku\u015f bak\u0131\u015f\u0131 olarak oynuyorsunuz oyunda objectiveler var binalar kara hedefleri u\u00e7aklar gibi bunlar\u0131 imha ettik\u00e7e oyun i\u00e7i geli\u015ftirme puan\u0131 al\u0131yorsunuz u\u00e7a\u011f\u0131n\u0131za ekstra yak\u0131t roket gibi \u015feyler ekliyebiliyorsunuz oyuna girmek zor, \u00e7ok fazla oyuncusu yok ve oyunlar\u0131 kendiz veya ba\u015fkas\u0131n\u0131n host olarak kurmas\u0131 gerekiyor oyun e\u011flenceli ama \u015fuan tek map var ve oyuncu \u00e7ok az ayn\u0131 \u015feyleri yapmak s\u0131kabiliyor.", "timestamp_created": 1502261271, "timestamp_updated": 1502261271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34110456": {"recommendationid": "34110456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971311419", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503096181}, "language": "english", "review": "Saw this on Jingles \"Casual Saturdays\" and thought I'd take a punt on it.\n\nLost an hour to it the first time I put it on.\n\nIt's a lot of fun for such a simple premise.

Overall, a lot of fun to play in short bursts, and that Danger Zone-type music is catchy!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJFd0YPpStw", "timestamp_created": 1501412238, "timestamp_updated": 1501412238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33901924": {"recommendationid": "33901924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136164702", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511687052}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fde\u4e0d\u4e0a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u554a\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1501411514, "timestamp_updated": 1501411514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500644", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33897027": {"recommendationid": "33897027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041364974", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513048742}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the cheapest and most addictive games i've bought.\n\nTakes 10 minutes to learn the ropes then off you go!\n\nHave already thrown a few hours into it and no idea where they went....just can't seem to put it down for long.\n\nBig thumbs up the developer.\n\nConsidering EA - hoping a few more maps / perks / planes come along to keep it fresh but otherwise a big thumbs up!", "timestamp_created": 1501390507, "timestamp_updated": 1501390507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33889307": {"recommendationid": "33889307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008768479", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501359316}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Este jogo \u00e9 muito viciante adorei, acho que o segredo dele est\u00e1 na competitividade.

Two teams have three foward operating bases each. Each team will also have a plethora of tanks and AAAs (basically \"adds\") to help them out. Teams can be comprised of 2-4 players or AI each. Your team's objective is to destroy all three of the enemy team's bases. Combining the arcade flight genre with MOBA is a very interesting take, something that I believe has not been attempted before. Kudos to Hampus Bankler for trying something unique!\n\nFlying the planes is as simplistic as possible -- it's arcade, not simulator, so you'll only have to press one button to begin your takeoff. The camera is top-down; don't let the promotional screenshots on the store page fool you, there's no third-person chase camera available. There's also only one altitude that you can fly at, except when you're landing and taking off. As I said, simplistic. But it doesn't take a lot away from the gameplay, it just allows you to focus on the important stuff: flying to your objective, destroying everything in your path, and evading enemy missiles.\n\nThe major gripe I have with this game is that little is explained. The tutorial mission, while very well-done, only introduced you to the flight mechanics as well as how to use heatseekers and standard bombs. There's a couple of weapon types that were omitted, flares were skipped over, and the entire premise of upgrading your aircraft mid-battle was not explained at all. There's also a loot crate system (???), and some sort of passive abilities that you earn by leveling up. There's a whole lot that needs to be explained, whether in a second tutorial or in an easier-to-access game menu (there is a second text-only tutorial section hidden in the main menu's tutorial option).\n\nI'm also fearful that this game may not live for very long. I enjoyed it, as I'm sure many others would (hence my recommendation), but indie multiplayer-based games tend to drop off very rapidly these days. I hadn't even heard of Sky Knights until Ace Combat Fan published a video on it and provided me with his second key to help promote the game's multiplayer (thank you to both him and Hampus for providing the key!). The game needs a lot more promotion to bring many more players in to help populate the servers and get things rolling.\n\nBeyond the game's need to explain a few things and maintaining its population, I'm impressed by Sky Knights. It definitely deserves a buy. Particularly at its $10 price point, you can't go wrong.

The developer's kindness has no affect on my opinion on the game, but I felt it should be noted.\n\nThis game is pretty amazing. When I first watched it, I thought it was a cool concept, but was skeptical about how it would actually play. The gameplay is actually quite fun and fluid. Each plane I have used so far feels different. \n\nMatches are easy to start, due to empty player slots being replaced with AI. I have noticed that the AI seems to be quite overpowered at some points, but other than that, it's fine.\n\nFor being an early access title, the game is not very buggy. I've only run into 1-2 bugs so far, and neither of them were game breaking. The game is also very smooth. I don't believe I ever dipped below 60fps. But at the same time, the graphics aren't amazing, but they're decent. Before full launch, I hope to see the graphics improve greatly.\n\nThat's essentially it. If you're looking for a good, fun game to sit down and play with your friends, I suggest this game. It's very fun, and to some extent, requires good teamwork to ensure you complete the objective with the variety of planes and the upgrades they offer.\n\nEDIT: Just played a game where the one of the AI pretty much killed you right off of spawn, while the rest did nothing.

If you enjoyed the Ace Combat games on Playstation over the past two decades and want to relive the glory of that type of action-packed, aerial combat game then Sky Knights is for you. \n\nThis game has a great online community of both competitive and casual players. The community is very friendly and supportive. Sky Knights is easy to get started with, but difficult to master, thus it is a deep, skill-based, multiplayer, aerial combat game. \n\nThe visual style is distinctive and succeeds in every way due to the clever use of minimal graphic design, models, textures, and landscapes. The soundtrack is quite good for such a small developer's first game. The developer is always communicating with the community via Steam and the official Sky Knights Discord channel, and he listens to community requests and bug reports. \n\nThere are also very few bugs, if a new bug appears with a patch, the developer works hard to eliminate it quickly and so far there have never been any serious bugs. For an early access title, Sky Knights features incredible polish, and the game is very well-optimized for a wide array of PC specifications. \n\nThis game will run great on low-end PC's while still looking beautiful. Ony a high-end PC it will run buttery smooth and it even supports 4K UHD and Ultra-Wide aspect ratios. \n\nThe core gameplay mechanics are extremely solid, and highly addictive. After playing this game in multiplayer for over 60 hours now, I don't see myself getting bored with this amazing game any time soon, especially with the constant and regular updates and new content additions! \n\nI can't recommend this game enough, so do yourself a huge favor and pick this title up, it's a true masterpiece!\n\n10/10, see you in the skies! :D\n\n-Yopo", "timestamp_created": 1519402489, "timestamp_updated": 1519402750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40213290": {"recommendationid": "40213290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970358346", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519571601}, "language": "english", "review": "Thrilling, easy-to-learn, challenging-to-master, top-down view, modern aerial and air-to-ground combat game focused on 4 vs 4 PvP battles with options for bots to fill slots. Thrilling and rewarding to play, with a leveling system that unlocks passive modifiers, and also a pool of traits that you can pick a couple to use depending on your play style.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1306418944\n[H1]Aircraft[/H1]\nThe game's balance is based on the NATO and Russian forces each picking from three aircraft of three types: Multirole, Close Air Support and Air Superiority.\n\nFor NATO forces, that means F-16 (Multirole), A-10A (Close Air Support) and F-15A (Air Superiority). For Russian forces, you choose from Mig-29 (Multirole), Su-25 (Close Air Support) and Su-27 (Air Superiority).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1099825801\nWhile the main objective is fairly simple -- destroy 3 enemy bases before the enemy destroys your 3 bases -- the ever changing mix of player and bot plane choices, and the impacts your decisions have on the ground forces battle below you helps make the game anything but predictible. :)\n\nThe game's rich weapons tactics become more evident the more you play it, and the more you sifft through the game's own built-in Fighter School tactics page, which gives a lot of valuable insights into evasion and best use of weapons.\n\n[H1]Controls[/H1]\nWhile the game offers partial controller support, keyboard and mouse default controls generally work fine, and you can change key bindings.\n\nDefault is steering with A and D keys, with W and S serving as your throttle. Shift kicks in your afterburner for planes that have them; the ground attack specialist aircraft like the A-10 lack an afterburner.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1306412041\nDespite the top-down view perspective, the game does provide a sense of changing altitudes, and you can use the Maneuver key (default is spacebar) to pull off loops and Immelmann turns, which isn't quite something I've mastered yet. \n\n[H1]Multiplayer[/H1]\nThe game offers multiplayer game lobbies based on region (U.S., Europe, Asia, Australia and Japan). There's a global chat lobby, and simple text chat within the game itself.\n\nIf you get the game, don't let relatively low numbers of games on the various regional servers scare you off. Most of the time, if you start an open game, other players will eventually join you. You can fill any slot with an AI bot player, and they'll auto-fill in if a player leaves. The bots are really quite effective, even devious at times. :)\n\nAlso, the game seems pretty forgiving in terms of lag, so don't be afraid to check the various servers available. I'm U.S. East Coast, and the game has run fine when I've joined sessions in the other regions.\n\nNOTE: The game is NOT a cockpit-view flight simulator, so if you need a game for your HOTAS throttle system, this is the wrong genre. Saw a lot of confusion on that when this first released in early access. :)", "timestamp_created": 1519014135, "timestamp_updated": 1519014439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581047", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40212575": {"recommendationid": "40212575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026782773", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520142208}, "language": "english", "review": "simple but fun", "timestamp_created": 1519011585, "timestamp_updated": 1519011585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40202275": {"recommendationid": "40202275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078560585", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518981220}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0451\u0431\u0438\u0449\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438", "timestamp_created": 1518981285, "timestamp_updated": 1518981285, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40191433": {"recommendationid": "40191433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112410528", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519318026}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, lots of fun to shoot things down and become an ace.", "timestamp_created": 1518959815, "timestamp_updated": 1518959815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40090739": {"recommendationid": "40090739", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983403268", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519027460}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome and addicting game.

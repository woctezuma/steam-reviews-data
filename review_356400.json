The audio and visuals match perfctly and the rythm gets me right in my chest every single time. I first saw the game on you tube and it doesn't do it justice. I highly reccomend experiencing this masterpiece for yourself. \n\nOne thing I found so alluring about this game is the way it makes you feel both powerful and vulnerable at the same time. The unsettling build up to bosses which send shivers up your spine in anticipation are beautifully placed. The minimalistic design is an interesting and, in my opinion, a great choice, simple yet just enough detail to keep the eye entertained when the break periods come, but not so much that it distracts from the gameplay. Last little detail I loved are the little break periods which come once every level, they really do give your brain, eyes and hands a much needed rest which was a nice touch.\n\nFinal bit about the technical aspects of the game, I have one tiny complaint and It's that sometimes turns are hard to see when you're in tunnels if there are 2 or more one after another. Though I will admit that as the game progresses and your skills improve you'll start to pick up on audio cues telling you which obstacles and how many are ahead of you. Other than that, the controls are a dream, easy to catch on to and a challenge to master. a nice balance of difficulty and fun.\n\nAll in all and absolutely incredible game to test your reaction times and skills in a fun and exhillerating way.

The songs are minimalist, the rhythm of your actions doesn't always fit the beat, and you can't always see what's coming ahead of time. It also gets blisteringly fast.

You won't be using your ears to input commands, you will be using your eyes, which is awful since a lot of the prompts are not even visible. You can input commands wrong/skip commands entirely and not be punished at all, but then die to a wall not even visible until the second you need to respond to it. \n\nThe music is 100% forgetable and at no point do you feel a part of it.

It's not often you see a game with such a unique premise as this, and even less often you see one so well executed. Everything is excellent, from the music to the visuals to the controls (even on keyboard). The music and visuals speak for themselves from the trailer, but I do really praise the controls. They feel so precise that when you inevitably mess up you have no one to blame but yourself. The difficulty curve too, is perfect. It starts you off slowly, and as soon as I found myself thinking, \"I feel like I could take on a bit more,\" there it was. So far nothing has felt bullshit either, everything has been very fair and when I mess up it's my fault.\n\nThe only nitpicks I have are: \n1. It took me much to long to figure out how to recenter my headset\n2. The synth-y non percussive elements of the music could be a bit louder, I sometimes have to focus to hear them and you can't afford extra focus in this game\n3.

It's trance-inducing, beautiful & strange, but the void is full of surprises.\n\n[b]Be one with the Space Beetle[/b]; it all starts out calm, introducing you to the basic control scheme through the first set of stages & how to combine them, but your peaceful existence quickly ramps up. Before you know it, it's a hardcore, ludicrously fast challenge of your reflexes. As with other rhythm based games, the longer you go without mistakes the higher your score will become. Mistakes don't often spell the end of the run, but too many in sequence & the [b]Space Beetle[/b] will not be happy.\n\nAll the controls are boiled down to a single button & directional input combinations. Although simple, it did feel a little counter-intuitive for me, taking a short while to get a grip on the timings & position of the hit zones. Using both press & hold actions for the button adds some complexity as you transition between flying above or gliding on the track. Whichever move you make, they all have a great tactile response. Grinds feel heavy, jumps hit the ground with the impact of a super hero & glides through the air have that light touch.\n\n[b]Pure Rhythm?[/b] There are sections very precise with the rhythm timings but as it speeds up & the adrenaline pumps it loses some cohesion. Relying on the rhythm for your action timing can become problematic in later stages & throw you out. The music adds a massive amount to the experience, but does veer away from being more pure rhythm based gameplay as it gets harder. Outside of the alignment to the music, the levels are well designed and generally flow well.\n\nAlthough I enjoy a challenge, the main drawback with [b]Thumper[/b]  [i](for me)[/i] is the overall difficulty level increased too quickly. It goes from very easy to crazy fast in just a few levels, which limits the level variation you can access without pushing through. If you are a mere mortal & get stuck like I did a lot [i](& still am!)[/i], then the repetition of the levels may discourage frequent replays & just lead to abandonment. I still like to come back and play as it is truly a great game, but wish a \"Play[b]-[/b]\" mode was added for those less rhymically inclined like myself to at least experience the full game. For the price, it\u2019s a little light on the content; more levels or random mode would also be welcomed.\n\nMost aptly titled, [b]Thumper[/b]  certainly lives up to its name. Thumpin' audio & visuals & Thumpin' physics & controls, it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind experience that will melt your synapses!\n\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857016/]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1513828549, "timestamp_updated": 1513844756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741848", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38438680": {"recommendationid": "38438680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015783511", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505426136}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good in VR.", "timestamp_created": 1513717111, "timestamp_updated": 1513717111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38423843": {"recommendationid": "38423843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039941234", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513919088}, "language": "spanish", "review": "EL final del nivel 3 me dio dolor de cuello :v", "timestamp_created": 1513658529, "timestamp_updated": 1513658529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38398021": {"recommendationid": "38398021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420684596", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513751910}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game", "timestamp_created": 1513599735, "timestamp_updated": 1513599735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38379745": {"recommendationid": "38379745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220273860", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514672193}, "language": "english", "review": "Starts slow, but goes up in difficulty real quick.

The tension is structured so well that although it is frustrating, I forgive the game in minutes while playing it. I went through levels 1 to 3 on keyboard and went for S rank. Succeeded through determination. When I tried level 4 I could not keep that up at any sublevel/part of level 4 (read checkpoint). I got through those hard and awe inspiring levels this way but the final boss was so hard I had to beat him with a traditional controller. \nStaying adapted to the switching of lanes was possible because of it.\n\nIf there are any professionals out there that can finish this game without a controller I would like to see them try. Just don't wreck your keyboard. Thumper looks unique and the only rhythm game that stood out to me enough to buy, but don't risk breaking your keyboard over it. \n\nThis requires a traditional controller to keep going for a longer time at your best skill. The only game I have that requires that controller to a greater degree is Attack on Titan: Wings of Freedom.\n\nAlso, the certainty of having a failed turn when you could have sworn you had that perfect turn is a reccuring event akin to and more common than the \"can't place that there milord\"s of a stronghold game. It just doesn't have the same memeable ring to it.  But the almost explosion like movements going on when you take damage (just what flies of of your beetle, it doesn't affect your control) looks amazing. The death explosion looks incredible too.\n\nFrustration, beauty and sound come together to lure you into and pull you out of gaming. It also gives a pretty consistent adrenaline rush.

Thumper, though barely a year old, carves out a similarly fresh niche with its unsettlingly organic surreal-futurist hellscape. More than anything else, Thumper feels intense. Thumper makes your palms sweat and your heart race. At once mercilessly unforgiving in its execution and yet completely fair in its rules, Thumper teaches you everything you need to know and then expects that you will learn and understand. Thumper throws a tremendous amount of light and noise and motion and discordancy and trusts that you will sort out the information that you need from all of the madness and push through the maelstrom it sends your way. \nAnd then there's the last level. Christ, the last level. It may be brutal but it's worth the entire effort of the rest of the game to see how the last level subverts all the rules you've learnt up to that point. \nIf you enjoy the merest concept of a rhythm game that effects an actual physical response from the player, play Thumper.

Everyone's tastes differ, obviously, but I'd like to say I know what I'm talking about!\n\nThis is probably my most favourite rhythm game of all time - for the super-satisfying, visceral, heart-pounding experience, for the exciting but fair challenge, for its crazy abstract aesthetic, but also for being a really excellent GAME.  EVERYTHING about it is good - the visuals, the controls, the challenge, the soundtrack, the game design.  More on that later...\n\n*****************************\nWILL I LIKE THUMPER??\n\n- If you enjoy rhythm or music games, Thumper may be for you.\n- If you enjoy feeling a fast-paced, highly visceral connection to what you're playing, Thumper may be for you.\n- If you enjoy psychedelic imagery and abstract, transcendant experiences, Thumper may be for you.\n- Check out gameplay videos of Thumper on YouTube - does it excite you, or give you ASMR-like satisfaction just from watching it?  Thumper may be for you.\n\nIt did all of these things for me.  I was dying to love Thumper, but will I ACTUALLY like it??\n\nAs far as I can tell, people who wanted to like it, but didn't enjoy Thumper mostly have a problem with the fast-paced nature of the game - they claim it requires memorization or unreasonably fast reflexes.  I **strongly** disagree.  I had this problem with the game Cosmophony - the final level required careful memorization and practice, and could only be done through painfully learning the sneaky parts that WILL kill you the first time.  I like hard games - challenge isn't the issue - but having to memorize passages defeats the purpose of music games for me - I want to respond and react to the sounds as they happen, not be concerning myself memorizing button sequences.\n\nEasy solution!  Watch a YouTube video of the final level of Thumper, Level 9.  Notice you can hear audio cues ahead of time for each obstacle, as well as clearly see where obstacles appear further down the track most of the time.  This is as hard as the game gets.  If you're interested in Thumper, and it seems reasonably doable to you, GET THE GAME.  ITS SO GOOD.\n\nThere's also another portion of \"didn't like Thumper\" because they didn't like the soundtrack.  Again, just watch a bit of it, and decide for yourself if that's something you can get into.\n\n*****************************\n\nThumper is an **excellent** game with a carefully constructed difficulty curve.  There are tricky passages of course, but you have the equivalent of two hit points, and if you lose any, you have the ability to gain them back with skill.  There are also regular checkpoints, so you never have to grind levels from the beginning.  The controls are beautifully simple and approachable - Left Right Up Down X - and yet you'll find there's a lot you can do with those basic buttons if you really want to get into it.\n\nUltimately, it's fairly simple to learn the basics and sail through the levels and simply survive, but there is a ton of room for precision and expertise - if you want to up your challenge, you don't even need to try different play modes.  Thumper lets you make it harder on yourself just by attempting trickier moves.  For example, don't just survive the corners - perfect them for stacking bonuses!  But if you mess up the timing, you might die.  Do you just get by, or do you risk going for the bonuses?  \n\nThe better you get at the game, the more challenge it has to offer, and is extremely satisfying to \"get right.\"  I can't recommend this game enough.  My ONLY warning is some people have problems \"seeing\" the track ahead of time - just check it out on YouTube first!\n\nOh, and a note on controllers: YOU DON'T NEED A CONTROLLER.  The visceral feedback from controller vibration is awesome and super satisfying, but I actually find keyboard to be a much better for this game.  You need accuracy and precision if you really want to master the game, and I find the millimeter I need to twich my finger faster and easier than having to roll my thumb around on a D-pad or joystick.  Or maybe I just have tiny thumbs.  Whatever.  Point is, controllers not required.\n\nPlease support this game.  Aside from it being an awesome game, I had some technical difficulties and lost my game file due to an unrelated computer problem - the developer promptly addressed my problems and sent me a replacement file so I didn't lose any progress.  They seem awesome.

A lot of it is memorizing patterns rather than pressing buttons to the beat, but even then it's real satisfying when you thump and slide to the drums. The music is great and you will feel it in your core, especially when you die. \nSome cons I find in the game is that sometimes it feels off, like to not miss the \"thumps\" I find myself having to press the button a bit before the beat, which is slightly annoying but eventually you kind of get use to it and its not as bad. I found this mostly a problem in level 1-2 when it's slower and not as complex. \nThere's also been times when the track waves quite a bit (like during boss fights and special moves) and it waves so much that it hurts the beetle. This did get annoying, particularly on difficult levels that I had to do over and over again. I would finally make progress and this wave that acts like a turn hurts me and ruins the score. Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad if it was consistent but sometimes it doesn't happen. I'm not even sure if you can turn as there is practically no warning.\nOverall I found this game worth the money. If you like rythm games this is the game for you, and if you want a challenge go for S ranks, if not, then don't. I'd probably would have finished the game by now if I wasn't going for perfect ranks.

Not to mention all dem flashy lights ... My god so many light effects ...\n\nI feel like the name of the dev/publisher is quite fitting: Drool. The game sure as shit makes you drool at one point either out of pure concentration where you enter a I want to say state of trance by simply playing the game and going for an [b]S[/b] rank or 'cause you're sensitive to all the effects that are going on and stuff.\n\nRemember all those lil' notifications in other games which tell you to play in a well lit room and to take breaks every now and then? You did all those things in those games? Yeah me neither. In Thumper though ... I strongly recommend it.\n\nAt one point it felt like [url=https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sensory_overload]sensory overload[/url] ... It just became too much for me. Now keep in mind I shoot for a S rank in every level/world and I restart as soon as I miss something ... Now doing that at 22pm or 2am ... yeah not such a good idea.\n\nAnyhoo let's get into it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1136242895\nThumper does a fairly good job by providing a simplistic tutorial and it teaches you nothing more than what you need at the moment. Basically it goes like this: Hit A when there's a field on the ground. Hold A for those vertical thingies, hold A and tilt the left stick in order to turn, tilt up and hold A in order to fly and so on. Nothing more.\n\nNow the first few levels and even worlds ... I consider world 1-3 tutorial worlds since things get faster and more hectic in world 4 in my eyes.\n\nAnyway you get points for everything.\n\nThere're 9 worlds in Thumper and each consisiting of different amount of levels. Now you can just rush through the game and not caring 'bout your rank as long as you manage to stay alive. I'd say that's the best experience. Being able to experience the game or rather each world in one sitting would be the best course of action since the levels seamlessly transition and if you do care 'bout your rank or if you just wanna take a break then fear not my friend. There's a checkpoint at the end of every level which you have to hit in order to activate. So there's that.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far, I'm on world 4 level 27 as I'm writing this, there're two bosses in every world which you have to beat. One is a mini-boss and the other is the big ol' meanie.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1136242832 \nNow how does one actually beat or rather kill stuff in Thumper? By the magic of those green glowish tiles. You'll know which I mean once you see'em and there's even a small tutorial for those as well so it's all gonna be good lil' Timmy.\n\nNow let's get to a crucial part: The OST.\n\nI'm not gonna say it's bad or anything but it's fairly generic and all of the tracks kind of sound the same but then again I'm barely paying any attention to it while playing. The OST was made for that game with it's goal in mind; being a rhythm-action game.\n\nHere's just my two cents. I've played Osu! before and I would consider that a rhythm game but Thumper? Yeah dunno about that. To me it's more of a test-your-reflexes-kind-of-thing-while-your-eyes-are-melting. Guess that sums it up quite nicely.\n\nThere's even a New Game+ which I haven't touched yet but I'm guessing that it's just the same old shit just way harder and more flashy.\n\nIf you're like me and dig arcade games and stuff then go ahead and pick up Thumper.\n\nI'm not able to play the VR version of the game but I'm guessing two things would happen: I'd either go completely insane and the game would be hella dope.\n\nPeople been going on 'bout the psychedelic-mumbo-jumbo but meh. I'm not a 420blazeit Kiddo so that shit don't matter to me.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1144834607\nWhat matters is this: Solid gameplay. Nice visuals.

Manejamos a un escarabajo que se desplaza a toda velocidad por una v\u00eda infinita en el hiperespacio y debe sortear obst\u00e1culos dispuestos seg\u00fan un ritmo musical infernal hasta enfrentarse, al final de cada nivel, a una cabeza alien\u00edgena demon\u00edaca gigante. Es tan alucinante como suena.\n\nEl juego tiene un control sencill\u00edsimo, podr\u00eda manejarse literalmente con un mando de una consola antigua de Atari: necesitamos un stick de control (recomiendo pararse en las opciones para ajustar un poco la sensibilidad de la palanca) y un bot\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n. A medida que nuestro escarabajo se desplaza por los ra\u00edles, aparecer\u00e1n unos indicadores luminosos siguiendo el ritmo de la m\u00fasica: si presionamos el bot\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n cuando estemos encima de ellos, aumentaremos nuestra puntuaci\u00f3n al final del segmento del nivel, y si encadenamos varios indicadores lograremos cadenas de combos que aumentar\u00e1n a\u00fan m\u00e1s esta puntuaci\u00f3n. Estas cadenas de combos, por cierto, son la \u00fanica manera que tendremos de derrotar a los jefes: tenemos que \"clavar\" cuatro secciones para lanzar cuatro disparos al enemigo y derrotarlo, sin fallos.\n\nA medida que pasamos niveles se van a\u00f1adiendo nuevos obst\u00e1culos que requerir\u00e1n distintos movimientos, y aqu\u00ed entra de nuevo el bot\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n: si lo presionamos, protegemos a nuestro escabajo, y esto es imprescindible para sortear las curvas, recodos y trampas del escenario. Pero no podemos mantener presionado todo el rato el bot\u00f3n: primero porque sino jam\u00e1s lograremos cadenas de combos, y segundo porque mientras estemos protegidos el escabajo estar\u00e1 fijado en uno de los ra\u00edles (y por tanto, en el momento en que haya m\u00e1s de uno en pantalla tendremos un problema). Tambi\u00e9n podemos hacer que vuele el escarabajo moviendo el stick hacia arriba, y as\u00ed podremos desplazarnos incluso estando protegidos manteniendo el bot\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n; y si movemos el stick hacia abajo para aterrizar justo cuando estemos encima de un indicador luminoso lanzaremos un disparo (imprescindible para eliminar unos escudos que aparecen a veces para proteger a los jefes).\n\nComo vemos, el control se basa principalmente en moverse a los lados (y en determinados momentos arriba y abajo) con el stick manteniendo pulsado o no el bot\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n. Es muy sencillo, y sin embargo el juego est\u00e1 tan bien dise\u00f1ado que constantemente despliega situaciones variadas y complejas.

This one hooked me in when I first saw glimpses of gameplay. Perhaps it is due to my lack of experience in the genre, but this game feels like it does everything in it's power to have the gameplay/movement and visuals directly correlate to the music/beat. \n\nIt starts off nice and easy to get you into the mood, then after a while it ramps up difficulty and chaos just enough to still be fun. The visuals are great and complement the music which can be hectic yet still have a sort of luring pattern to it. \n\nMy only complaint is that in the later levels (I've only made it to level 4 btw), the music and beat become very sperratic and the gameplay turns into a constant test of reaction time more than following the beat (which may become drowned out by the sound effects in-game). \n\nOverall, it is a game that feels very satisfying when you play well.

The way the game assaults your senses is both exhausting and immensely satisfying. My play sessions were usually not much longer than an hour because I started to have trouble focusing after a while due to the intensity. This also meant that I never felt bored or like I was grinding. The 30ish hours I played feel like much much longer due to that intensity.\n\nMy first casual playthrough was a great experience on it own. I encountered a difficulty spike somewhere in the middle and another one later on but eventually got past it. When I replayed for S-ranks I started to appreciate the game on a whole new level. On my first playthrough I was just focused on surviving, which was tense enough as it was at my skill-level. When playing for S-ranks you have to play near-perfectly and you have to learn a bunch of new techniques that you didn't need when playing casually. I really got to appreciate how the levels slowly teach you new concepts and then just keep building on them more and more. It was also funny how on my first playthrough the bosses were the most difficult, but with S-ranks it was the levels themselves and the bosses almost felt like a break where you could relax a bit.\n\nI usually don't replay games and the reason I did for Thumper was because its actions were so satisfying to perform and the state of mind I had to be in. If I got too stressed or frustrated I would make too many mistakes and would be unable to proceed. I had to remain calm in the face of repeated failure and the sensory overload the game throws at you. Every time I tried to learn a bit more or improve my muscle memory.

But as a designer, I can't recommend anyone I know to buy this game.\n\nSimply because for all this game's uniqueness and beauty, it's pytrid when it comes to design choices.\n\nColor schemes render level elements borderline invisible. I've been blindsided by so many quick turns on red levels that the game literally stopped being fun for me midway my playthrough and I don't see any reason to go back.\n\nSecondly, the control scheme. The hardest bit of this game is the fact that you expect players to use from at least two to almost all four direction keys within a singular second. I know you want to appeal to the 'oh lol git gud' crowd of gamers, but with manufactured difficulty and faulty design, this game falls far beyond most other games with such an extremely punishing gameplay loop.\n\nSecondly, the varying lengths between two stages. Fuck, sometimes I have to wait up to fifteen seconds for the next bit of gameplay to begin, and sometimes the next button press is mere milliseconds away from the last level's end. This is confusing, bad, and honestly absolute shite design. \n\nMoving on to level progression itself. I reached level 5 before the game began bodying me completely, and I consider myself a decent player. What's the point of making a game that 70% of the people playing will never be able to beat? Games like Dark souls - which have exceedingly tough gameplay - allow players to level up and get stronger in lower-levelled areas so that they have an edge if a boss or an area is too tough for this. This game, unlike those, has no comeback mechanics. And before one compares this to bullet hell games, one must also consider that BH games allow players to have upgrades that do the same. This game has none of those.\n\nit's not all bad, though. The game is unique and the soundtrack and visuals are beyond stellar. There's a nice progression where you teach the player how to use every new mechanic that comes in, but the mishmash of mechanics the player is left with in the later stages is so confusing, it ends up getting the player killed over and over again. Quality, not quantity - something that your design seems to miss.\n\nI can see the love that the devs have put into this game. I can see their soul in every level I did enjoy. But in the end, the beauty of the game is almost completely soiled by the mostly mediocre - some hinging on absolute garbage - mechanics.\n\nThe game's like the country of France.

This game will challenge you as you progress through the levels, and it will fustrate you sometimes. Keep in mind that you need to be focused on the screen on later levels because there's a chance that you might miss a \"block\" if you aren't careful.  Also I used a PS4 Controller on the earlier levels and used my keyboard for the rest, and tbh, I would recommend a keyboard since I was able to hit some \"moves\" that weren't possible for me when I used the PS4 controller (or I was just really bad).

Also, I got it on sale for 11 or 12$ and haven't played with VR.\n\nIf you like what you see in the trailers, then you'll probably like what Thumper has to offer.\n\nThumper's a rhythm game centered around just pressing button prompts in response to various threats and signals. There's barely a story to speak of and the most I've seen so far is a recurring boss that kind of changes with each level. I've seen Thumper constantly compared to rhythm games, but it's not really like any other rhythm game I've ever played. There are no standout tracks and rarely any moments where I find myself bobbing along the rhythm. Instead, Thumper just commands your attention with these heavy metallic drum noises that dictate almost all of the game's music, and instead of feeling like you're playing a song, it feels like the great music is more of a byproduct of you playing the game.\n\nThat's not a bad thing, though, because Thumper is a unique premise with excellent execution. It has all the simplicity of the Runner games with all the intensity of something like the new DOOM. Think of super simple gameplay with a very harsh atmosphere and brutal difficulty. And by brutal difficulty, I mean repeating whole sections over and over because you didn't pull off a sequence of button presses without making a mistake. This brings up one of my only problems with Thumper: the game is so hard at times, you're forced to memorize levels which leads to a trial-and-error sort of gameplay. I feel like this is a side effect of simply not being very good at the game and not paying attention to certain cues, but I can see it turning off some players. If you don't like repeating yourself like in Super Meat Boy, Runner, or 1001 Spikes, you might not love the game's later levels.\n\nBut if you DO like punishing gameplay and everything you see in the trailer, then I'd say Thumper is worth your time. Not only is the main campaign tough as nails, getting S rank on every level will def keep you occupied. And there's even a NG+ which basically adds permadeath to each level with no healing and makes you start from the beginning of the level if you quit. That may sound ridiculous, but I LOVE that it's a feature because it fits the hardcore nature of this game so well. And just to cover all bases, the game looks and sounds good, runs great, the controls feel tight, and the atmosphere is very unique. My only problems are the tougher bosses and the fact that, during long play sessions, you can get a little burnt out because the game CONSTANTLY demands your attention. I guess that's what happens when you play Breath of the Wild for 3 weeks and then move to something like this.

I'm only giving a thumbsdown to help personally balance the game from currently a very positive to either Mostly Positive or at most Mixed.\n\n     The game presents itself as a psychedelic hardcore rhythm game. It certainly is beautiful and very engaging to the eye, but it doesn't feel like any rhythm game at all. Each stage has it's own kind of beat and feel to the rhythm, so each stage does feel unique; but personally only the first 3ish stages had rhythms that I could predict/feel. After the first few stages the beat doesn't seem... \"there\". \n\n      The first 3 stages I can tap my foot to and almost predict what is going to come up next and how it'll sound; it's generally pleasing to my ears. The next 4 stages I got to feels like there's no beat, and takes a kind of \"dubstep\" feel to how the notes are placed, I can't for the love of me find a beat to tap/nod to, doesn't feel satisfying once you hit all the notes and \"complete\" the song, and doesn't actually sound like anything but random instruments/pots&pans banging about; every note comes as a suprise to me and I end up playing the game not by following the rythm, but by trial and error and just memorizing the placement of objects (no rythm needed). \n\n     There's a slight neutral nitpick and that's the preemptive sound for each note. In the background you'll hear a note play to what's about to come up, and you kind of gauge when to hit that note; In the first few stages this is used along with the sound of you hitting the notes to make a nice beat/song to play along to. Later on the game gets faster paced and has more notes to hit, so it comes to a point where you just hear background notes overlapping and obstructing what beats you're hitting and just generally ruining the \"song\" that the game is trying to get you to make.\n\n     One finally nitpick is turns. For the life of me some turns feel like they're programmed differently than others. You hold Actionbutton ([A] on controller) then left/right for what direction you're turning. You can also wait til the exact moment to actually hit the turn button for extra points and a nice \"ping\" sound that makes the song sound better. Some turns feel like their exact moment to hit the turn perfectly is placed differently than others. 90% of the turns seem to have a general rule on when to exactly hit the turn, and some feel like they're way sooner than before, making me take damage and costing me a retry or death. This can get very infuriating later game when all the sounds of preemptive notes and notes you're hitting overlap adding to the bad design type of difficulty; making it feel like the game isn't a skill-based hardcore where I can learn from mistakes, but rather a game that changes core rules randomly to make you hit a small bump to artificially impede progress.\n\n     I want to like this game, but the only thing I can like about it is the sound (when they work), and the beautiful graphics; with that it is less of a game and more of something just to watch someone play than to play yourself.

There's barely any lyrical sections of the music within the tribal drums. I would say that this game is close to something like being in a drumline or auxillary-only percussion ensemble. It's a lot of call and response in which the call inputs get so convoluted that you have to depend on reactions and muscle memory. In all, I would say that this is a great game - the whole \"story\" of the game is pretty vague, but I'll let that slide since this is primarily a rhythm game after all. The graphics get kinda weird, but I guess they wanted to make this a horror game. I found myself really apreciating the different cadences the developers used, so thumbs up for that.

The abridged version is: [b]buy it[/b]. I have been obsessed with this game for the past few days and that train, much like the space beetle you play as, is not stopping anytime soon. If you\u2019re interested in reading about how I believe Thumper applies play conditioning, minimalism and cosmic horror to create a brilliant game filled with gorgeous graphics, an intense score and absurd replay value \u2013 go ahead!\n \nThis strange game is an incredibly satisfying trifecta of psychedelic art, rhythm-based play and horror tension. Seriously, somehow developers Drool have managed to make a game described as, [i]a space beetle travelling through the void[/i], a uniquely terrifying and intense experience. I want to focus the majority of my review on a concept I think Thumper executes brilliantly. It\u2019s a term known as [b]play conditioning[/b], and it\u2019s not mine \u2013 I first heard its use by film and games essayist [b]Hbomberguy[/b]. He coined the term vis-\u00e0-vis Thumper; so, with this in mind, I believe it to be intellectually honest for me to present his argument given that I will proceed to apply, expand and comment on it.\n\n[b]Hbomberguy[/b] argues that Thumper is a difficult and unforgiving game. As a space beetle, you are constantly speeding through a nightmarish void filled with traps, aggressive abstract geometry and horrific giant heads. It\u2019s like a racing game \u2013 only you\u2019re a beetle with two lives and you will relentlessly respawn at the beginning of each level because in this game, the dead shall rise again until you escape hell. It\u2019s a fast-paced adventure that requires great reaction time in a psychedelic environment that constantly assaults your senses. Nevertheless, Thumper is made in such a way that the more you play it the more intuitive the controls become. Your actions match the score in the background and, if done well, sync and contrast with the environment around you in such a way that it feels [i]good[/i] to pass a course with an S ranking. \n\nFrom a technical standpoint, [b]play conditioning[/b] is where, why and how should buttons reflect in-game actions. Thumper achieves such that with the help of mechanical minimalism the player is conditioned to play a fast, aggressive, relentless and intuitive game -- or so at least it is designed. Your controls are simple, WASD and SPACE BAR, but the combinations of moves and trap responses are almost infinite. Yet, throughout all that, your hand is comfortably numb, clicking away up to five keys to safely speed through a course in a truly melodic way. By the end of a course, the overall sync of action, score, color and learning curve resemble the moment when a guitarist learns a new song. That has been my experience \u2013 I have been obsessed with this game. It has tapped into my completionist vein and I will relentlessly redo a course until I get the highest mark. [b]Why?[/b] Because of this game\u2019s incredible application of [b]play conditioning[/b]. The way the game mechanics are built promotes a type of gameplay that is challenging, rewarding, and ultimately, highly enjoyable. I have more fun failing a course over and over again, with each new time learning the course's inner mechanics like a new song, until I finally complete it with the highest mark than simply breezing through each score, ignoring certain optional obstacles, losing lives and achieving C, B or A marks.\n\nThumper also has an actual effective training method to introduce you to what we\u2019ll call \u201cthe level\u2019s learning curve\u201d. At the beginning of each level, the first few courses focus on showing you a particular new skill or combination of actions \u2013 usually with a HUD display that will indicate exactly when to do what. Moreover, as the level progresses it incorporates learned skills, with current skills and the occasional unreferenced unlearned skill. It\u2019s a way of avoiding monotony, increase replay value and keeping an element of surprise during each level (which has approximately twenty courses). All in all \u2013 great game, gorgeous graphics, intense score, beautiful mechanics and arguably one of the most recent games where mood, theme and immersion have nothing to do with story or characters.\n\n[h1]If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group!

I've played through all of Play and three stages of Play+, and my initial feelings of awe and excitement have not dwindled. The issues I have with this game are so few that I have to list them specifically to fill out my cons side.\n\nGraphics: \n\nPros:\nWhile I don't play on VR, the game itself is not demanding. With a GTX 1070, I've pushed 8x MSAA with 4K rendering at 144hz, and I haven't seen a frame dropped yet. Aesthetics, as others have mentioned, are very trippy. Bright lights and flashing objects fill the screen in a compact pleasing manner. I find this to be one of the key parts of the game, offering powerful imagery. \n\nCon:\nAt some instances, mainly the last stage in Play+, the visuals get so intense and saturated that it becomes nearly impossible to see. \n\nAudio: \n\nPros:\nFor me, the music is a standout from other rhythm games. Where most other games will hardly ever tour away from straight 4/4 rhythm, this game has no qualms in handing out the grungiest offtime, polyrhythmic, additive timing beats. It's a refreshing breath of air, and I wish other reviewers understood the timing was on purpose. The mixing of the soundtrack gives it enourmous space, strengthening the games aesthetics. \n\nCons:\nWithout a good audio setup the drums can get washed out in the reverberations and game's hits, making it difficult to play ontime. The snakes in the game appear with a high hissing sound, when they appear multiple at a time, any speaker set with a high frequency range can hurt your ears from the intensity. I recommend gamers play two decibals down from their max listening volume, to save on ear coverage.\n\nGameplay: \n\nPros:\nThe gameplay is tight and responsive, and hitting notes are very satisfying, The game's difficulty curve is very smooth, except for stage 7 which I found the most difficulty in beating. The general opinion differs from stage to stage though, so I feel that it's a personal issue. General movements across the menus is fluid and fast. \n\nCons:\nSometimes the stages can feel a bit repetitive. My biggest qualm comes from turns. Getting perfect timings on them can be frustrating because it's so unforgiving for pressing late. I've raged more than a few times repeatedly dying to turns that I feel I've hit properly.\n\nMy rating: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1500495418, "timestamp_updated": 1500495556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33658051": {"recommendationid": "33658051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052746444", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512753601}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful Game for developing your sense of rhythm.", "timestamp_created": 1500493110, "timestamp_updated": 1500493110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33636605": {"recommendationid": "33636605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038078241", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500406155}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool little Rythm game that is very well payable in VR, but not worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1500406328, "timestamp_updated": 1500406328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498907", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33634719": {"recommendationid": "33634719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023827801", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501296125}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a rhythm game with a psychedelic twist which is awesome.\n\nPros\n- Cool effects (i didnt have tried VR with this, but i can imagine it will be quite a trip)\n- Rhythmic beats (although it isnt really any modern-ish music, but i like it, i think it fits really well)\n- Beautiful yet dreadful atmosphere that immenses you\n- Well thought interface (Checkpoint-style playthrough, without having to go through the entire stage just because you missed that one thing)\n- Easy and fast restart (this may not seem like much, but rhythm games player will know what i mean, which really shows that the developers are those that really into the game)\n- the difficulty and learning curve seems pretty well balanced, rather intuitive as well.

At the start of each level you're introduced to the perils that lie before you in the abyss, and slowly eased into the level itself. \nWell.. that's up until level 5, when that piece of shit lazer cockring starts blasting your ass like the death star, while kicking you off beat with it's skrillex soundboard. God I hate that thing. But after a blood sacrifice and some really hard headbanging I managed to become one with Satan's bongobeats and, while jumping around in my couch like a disgruntled teen on a cybergoth concert, kicked level 5's ass into oblivion.\n\nThe music, which usually is the main focus in rythm based games, is suprisingly lacking in this one. The tracks aren't bad in any sense, don't get me wrong. But concidering that the visuals of the game really just punch you right in the tit with their fantastic sci-fi interpretation of Dante's Inferno, I'm very suprised that the music lacks the same kick. In comparison it at times feels, flat, monotone and quiet. That's of course understandable in the \"pause\" parts of each level, but when the action's on I'm really missing some hard clear rythm. I would really expect more bass and robotic rape noises. Go search up the noices the reapers in mass effect make, that's the kind of sound I was looking for with this music. In really intense parts of the game this problem kinda disapears because the sounds from all the obstacles you're smashing through just becomes a nice rhytmical beat in and of itself. The background music is just a bit pale when compared to the visuals is my point. \n\nFor serious though I truly am enjoying this game, even though the learningcurve breaks after level 4 and that the music isn't as heavy as I'd like I would still recommend it to anyone that thinks Dark Souls isn't pissing them off enough, cause boy is this shit unfair at times. \n\n7/10 highly enjoyable and frustrating, will play it more \n", "timestamp_created": 1500326585, "timestamp_updated": 1500326585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33605993": {"recommendationid": "33605993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315049681", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501134499}, "language": "english", "review": "yep this game is good", "timestamp_created": 1500291334, "timestamp_updated": 1500291334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33602082": {"recommendationid": "33602082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353782022", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500274193}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u624b\u6b8b \u62ef\u6551\u4e0d\u4e86 \u73a9\u4e8615\u5206\u949f \u653e\u5f03\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1500274538, "timestamp_updated": 1500274538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33600335": {"recommendationid": "33600335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208196096", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505589003}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1500265786, "timestamp_updated": 1500265786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33600308": {"recommendationid": "33600308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240479878", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500996792}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc9c4\uc9dc \uc2e0\ub098\uace0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc74c", "timestamp_created": 1500265651, "timestamp_updated": 1500265651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33599922": {"recommendationid": "33599922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068595395", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500338155}, "language": "english", "review": "The new season of Game of Thrones premiered today and I'm playing this instead.

The rhythms are complex, the soundtrack so utterly heavy and percussive.

There are plenty of other rhythm games that I'd recommend over Thumper. I list some of them in the sections below.\n\n[h1]Music Selection[/h1]\n\nLet's start with the music: It's droning percussion without a lot of variation or movement. Find a youtube video of someone playing Thumper. If you like what you hear, then great, maybe this game is for you. If you don't like what you hear, bad news: that's basically all you're going to be hearing the whole game. Most rhythm games have a selection of songs that you can play at your leisure; if there's a song you don't like, no big deal: just don't pick that song, and instead pick the songs you [i]do[/i] like. Unfortunately Thumper is structured as a linear game where you play the levels in order, one after the other. And you can't play level N until you've beaten level N-1.\n\n[b]Games that did it better:[/b] The Bemani series (Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania/IIDX, Guitar Freaks, DrumMania, etc.), Rock Band, Guitar Hero, etc. all have varied song lists in different genres and style, and let you pick which songs you want to play.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Aesthetics[/h1]\n\nThis is arguably Thumper's strongest selling point, but graphics are only enjoyable insofar that you get to see them. And to see them, you have to actually play through the game. That might sound tautological, but there are rhythm games which understood that a core appeal of their game were the trippy graphics and the synesthetic experience, and thus let you just coast through the game, even if you did extremely poorly, so that you can enjoy the full experience. In contrast, Thumper is fairly unforgiving: your beetle has 2 hit points, and if you make 2 \"mistakes\" (failling to turn, crashing into a barrier, failing to jump over an obstacle, etc.), you \"die\" and are sent back to a previous checkpoint.\n\n[b]Games that did it better:[/b] Rez has beautiful visuals that evolve with the music, and shares a similar aesthetic style (though its tone is less gloomy than Thumper's).\n\n[h1]Mechanics[/h1]\n\nThe core mechanic behind Thumper is call-and-response. The game will present a rhythm involving both audio and visual cues, and then you're supposed to perform the rhythm back to the game. Unfortunately, there are several flaws with the way Thumper implements this mechanic that makes it unsuitable for fans of rhythm games.\n\nFirst of all, of the 5 or so different cues that the game presents, only 1 or 2 (depending on how you count them) involve timing. That is to say, the majority of the gameplay in Thumper does [i]not[/i] involve rhythm. There are 5 possible inputs that you can send to the game: Up, down, left, right and action. When there is a glowing spot on the floor, then you need to press the Action button just as the glowing spot passes underneath your beetle. And when you need to perform a stomp-maneuver on the glowing spot, then you need to press the Down button just as it passes underneath your beetle. That's it. For every other cue, you can send the input way in advance of the cue's arrival, and if there are several such cues in a row, you can just keep the relevant button held down to trigger all of them.\n\nFor example, there's a horizontal barrier which you can only \"break through\" if you're holding down the Action button. It's not unusual for these barriers to appear in a syncopated rhythm (e.g. note note pause note pause note note note), but it's not clear what the point of that rhythm is, because what you're supposed to do when you encounter such a cue is to just hold down the Action button through the whole thing.\n\n[b]Games that did it better:[/b] The Rhythm Heaven series is kind of like a Wario Ware for rhythm games: Each song/stage uses the controls in different ways, as if a completely different mini-game. While some of the games might have a \"just have the input be held down\", they do so for variety's sake, and the majority of the games do ask you to actually perform your input to a rhythm.\n\n[h1]Input Timing[/h1]\n\nThis is somewhat related to the previous sections of mechanics, but the input timing on Thumper is completely off, and the reason it's completely off is a direct result of the design decision they made that the inputs should be \"held down ahead of time\" as opposed to activated as per the rhythm of the music. Find a video of someone playing the first level of Thumper, and then tap your hands on the quarter notes of the song. While you're doing this, pay attention to when the beetle performs a turning maneuvre.\n\nNotice that the beetle turns, and then as the turn ends, a chime plays, and this chime is on the quarter note beat (i.e. synchronized with when you tapped). This is the [i]end[/i] of the turning maneuvre, which means that this is the point at which it's okay for the player to actually release the inputs. Which means the player [i]must[/i] have entered the input at some earlier time, not on the beat.\n\nThe game essentially forces you to enter in your inputs \"not on the beat\", which is very frustrating for a rhythm game. I completely understand their desire to have the chime sound effect land on the beat, or else the game would be frustrating for auditory rather than tactile reasons, but it seems like they could have fixed this design flaw by simply having the chime occur at the [i]start[/i] of the turn, rather than at the end, and have the player perform the inputs for the turn on the beat of the song.\n\n[b]Games that did it better:[/b] Dance Dance Revolution, In The Groove, Beatmania/IIDX, Guitar Hero, etc. all have some concept of \"holding down the input\". However, they ensured that both the start and the end of these inputs occur on the beat. Further more, they ensured that the \"attack\" (the moment the player actually presses the input) must occur on the beat (as opposed to Thumper's approach to let the player press the input at any arbitrary point before the beetle needs to perform the maneuvre), which leads to a much more satisfying input experience.\n\n[h1]Cues[/h1]\n\nProbably Thumper's weakest point as a rhythm game is the quality of its cues. The game uses both audio and visual cues in its call and response system. The audio cues by themselves are not unique enough that you can solely rely on them to play the game without memorization. For example, a \"turn\" will be signaled by a handclap sound effect. However, you won't know, from just hearing the sound clap, whether you need to turn left or right. And again, Thumper only lets you make 2 mistakes before your beetle dies and is sent back, so simply guessing based on the audio cues is not sufficient.\n\nThen what about the visual cues? Here, Thumper struggles due to overprioritizing its aesthetics. The beetle is travelling along a narrow corridor with opaque walls, and the corridor twists and turns. While visually interesting, the end result of this is that when the corridor turns, it blocks the player's view of the upcoming cues. The level design seems to be unaware of this problem, as it repeatedly uses an anti-pattern in several of its stages where the beetle is cued to turn to one side, and immediately needing to turn in the opposite side with no warning (because the cue for the second turn was hidden behind the walls of the curving corridor). When this happens, Thumper is no longer a rhythm game. It becomes a game of reaction time, and/or memorization as you die and then replay that section, but now knowing that two (or three or four) turns in quick succession are going to come.\n\n[b]Games that did it better:[/b] Groove Coaster is a rhythm game in which your avatar follows a curving path. However, it's able to avoid the pitfall that Thumper falls into by having the path be a simple line with no walls, and thus nothing to \"block\" the cues.", "timestamp_created": 1498910376, "timestamp_updated": 1498910376, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595015", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33073550": {"recommendationid": "33073550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282762959", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499159255}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy shit!

It gets to you in a way that I dont think any other game has managed to. It builds this constant progressive dread that seems to never end up to a never reaching climax. And it does that just by asking you to hit a button when a blue square reaches you, slide on some walls and fly over some obstacles.\nI wouldnt go as far to call Thumper a horror game as in its not trying to scare you like Resident Evil or Outlast would, but its a compelling candidate for existential horror, the kind of horror Lovecraft was so enamoured with. And it manages to accomplish this just by the abstraction of its aestethic and its incredible sound design and  industrial techno soundtrack.\nIn Thumper you are in control of a silver beetle stuck on a track on its journey to the beyond. The game clearly establishes very early on that this is serious business just by the tone of the music playing and it gives you a very brief tutorial before sending you on your way, without much care if you will survive or not. Very quickly you will be struggling to press the button on time with the blue notes that pass by you and the music simply wont let up.\nBut up until this point, the only punishment you seem to get out of missing these notes is a reduced score. No big deal.\nThen, real danger starts to show up. You will have to turn the beettle in time with the turns of the road, and hold down the button when some barriers show up alongside the track. You fail to do this, you lose the beetle's armor. You fail to do this twice, you are dead.\nThe great thing about Thumper is that the control scheme is very minimal and easy to understand, so the game takes that opportunity and throws you the most violent sequences of notes and obstacles to deal with, leaving you in a constant state of (positive) stress. Sometimes it seems impossible, but the game always gives visual and sound indications of what the next obstacle is, so you soon learn how to deal with it and its immensely satisfying to get an S-Rank on a segment.\nThe game also has bosses that truly test your skill up to that point and really stand as a barrier to those who arent ready for the next level. The final boss does what great final bosses do: test your skills to the max while also providing a new challenge to overcome not seen in the whole game up to that point.  \nIts an amazing and thrilling experience with some of the best surrealist visuals and music to complement it. It leaves you in a state of trance where you stop seeing the notes and just start guessing and predicting where they will be by sound alone, and thats the best compliment I can give to a Rhythm game.", "timestamp_created": 1498613182, "timestamp_updated": 1498630645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738573", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32867002": {"recommendationid": "32867002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246706520", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498637117}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e)\n\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0436 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c.\n\n\u041e\u0442\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0432\u0441\u044e \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438 \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435))\n\n\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u0443\u0436 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u044f, \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430-\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434, \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044b \"\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u044b\". \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441\u044b. \u0412 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442.\n\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. 10 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0435\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1498584755, "timestamp_updated": 1498586082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32863054": {"recommendationid": "32863054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027321868", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498761394}, "language": "english", "review": "Immersive, intense and a great difficulty curve.", "timestamp_created": 1498583177, "timestamp_updated": 1498583177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497679", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32857729": {"recommendationid": "32857729", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997850900", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501927891}, "language": "english", "review": "It's discounted below the magic HKD100 mark for me and been on my wishlist a while. If you enjoy any beat-driven game, Cytus (if you have an ipad you MUST get Cytus), Audiosurf, anything with a beat, then get this game now. \n\nA really nice benefit is you can play any level you like, it's not like a shitty arcade game where you have to start from the beginning each time. If you even decide to quit halfway though a level, it will save your checkpoint. \n\nThe difficulty and pace of the game is set just right, slowly building up to more complex manouvres and you never have to start too far back if you die. \n\nIt doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's a solid, entertaining game for anyone who likes to hit things to a beat!", "timestamp_created": 1498574881, "timestamp_updated": 1498574881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618603", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32843686": {"recommendationid": "32843686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068458641", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499212132}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel like this game was made for me. \n\n\n\nPROS\n\n-Feels good to play (responsive, never feel cheated out of a life)\n\n-High and stable FPS (nice on 144hz monitors)\n\n-Intuitive. There's no real walkthrough or in game guide, but it's easy to catch on to (almost) everything\n\n-Wide skill range. This game isn't as hard as some of the noobies that left negative reviews might convince you to believe. With a controller and a little bit of time and practice you can beat the game in less than a week, AND there is a high skill ceiling if you want to go for all S rank, AND a much higher skill ceiling if you want to improve your score on the leaderboards (and of course the much more unforgiving newgame+)\n\n-Visuals. The atmosphere is just amazing, fast, and scary just like I never knew I wanted it to be.\n\n-Sound. The sound is 70% of everything good in this game. I cannot give the sound guy enough props. It gets the adrenaline pumping while keeping you on beat and letting you know the beat to come. Brilliant.\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n-I wish there were more levels, or at least user made levels. I beat the game twice in <20hrs (1st playthrough + S rank) and even left the game open for a few hours. There's still newgame+, but they're all linear levels. Good for practicing, but it does kill the replayability a bit.\n\n-Lack of an in-game guide. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, but trying to figure out how to stay in the air during turns to hit those high arches consistently was a bit difficult without a guide. Everything else was mostly covered at points in the early levels. \nNote: There is a PDF guide if you right click the game. I found it after I beat it the second time.\n\nOVERALL: 9.5/10\n\nShould you get it?\nYeah.

"Casual gamers stay away from this. At first it seems like its fun but  right around stage 5 it gets unfair. The only reason I'm still playing is because I just want to complete it. Now it feels like a chore ratrher than fun. Graphics are not the best thing to look at and game play is ok but will be frustrating as hell to begginers unless you are fans of games like rock band or guitar heroes stay away.  I know its gotten rave reviews but I found it to be not quite as fun as I hoped and more difficult than I imagine. the check points are ok but I really wish the Beetle could take more damage or have a health bar. I just completed stage 5 the moves was so fast that I just ignore most of them and just suvived until the boss battles. if I complete this game I most likely will never play it again.", "timestamp_created": 1498412793, "timestamp_updated": 1498413088, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514436", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32779609": {"recommendationid": "32779609", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972603130", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498279679}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls at least with the VIVE are unresponsive and don't really work.

Really good. I'm used to rhythm games so it was quite easy to pick up the new things the game threw at me so far, though for some people it might take some practice/getting used to. There are music ques that you hear before you get to it, so you can use audio ques to know whats coming even if you don't see it. Sometimes its hard to pick up, mostly when you are doing some moves (which makes noise) while the ques ahead are still playing. The overlap is short and workable so far, I'm confident with more playing of the levels I can pick up on the ques while doing stuff at the same time.\n\nGame sounds great on my bose speakers/subwoofer. Pretty good through my cheap sony extra bass headphones too.\nIf you like rhythm games, pick this up!

I WANT to recommend this game. I just can't.\n\nWhen it's doing what it's trying to do, the experience is AMAZING. Intense without being frantic, relentlessly heavy and nightmarish in a surreal, visceral way that puts you in a cold sweat. The interface is simple enough not to need words or symbols and demanding enough to always feel desperate and NEVER like you can relax. It demands constant, almost exhausting focus which only adds to the psychically malevolent atmosphere. It's the best worst medicated fever dream you've ever had.\n\nBut as exceptional as the abstract horror aesthetic is, the game itself too often falls apart around it, sometimes serving that aesthetic at the player's expense- and not in a positive way like deliberately taking control or awareness away from the player to stress them out. Sometimes for no good reason. During more intense periods the track itself can become warped and distorted- to the point that the visual cues can no longer be read, or they distort in random or unreliable ways the player can't properly parse. The rhythms often get so syncopated that they lose any relation at all to the plodding drums that make up the soundtrack. And in busier passage the hellish noises that come with hitting beats completely drown out the audio cues for the notes still coming- which can be a problem when, as noted, the track becomes too distorted to read.\n\nI grit my teeth and powered through these problems as well as I could for a while because again, when the game works it WORKS. But then new more sophisticated and complex moves were introduced that, without any verbal explanation of any kind, made the TUTORIAL impassable. The moves themselves are baffling to try to execute correctly (by methods that will never be illuminated) with such distorted and arcane feedback that the trial and error to puzzle through them is hopeless.\n\nThis would've been one of my all-time favorite rhythm games, but a few core issues make the entire experience too frustrating to revisit, or recommend to anyone. That the issues are so fixable and the game under them is so good just makes it tragic.\n\nMaybe you'll have more patience for it than me! A lot of people clearly did!

Listen to the track before you buy to make sure you are into the type of music in the game. If you aren't, that will be a problem. Unlike other rythm games, this one is not built around diverse choices of music, different songs, etc. There is really only one \"song\" in this game, and it plays the through the entire game.  This does not detract at all from the experience, since this game really masters the atmosphere it is trying to create. See if that atmosphere looks awesome, and if it does, you will like this game. \n\nAlso, a warning that this game is challenging. I have beaten the first 7 levels and the 7th took me a couple of hours. Rythm alone will not help you succeed in the later levels, because there are tons of off-beats and minor fluctuations to keep you off balance, and you have very little visual time, or audio cues to react to these changes since everything is moving very fast, and sometimes appearing from around a corner. In order to beat the uber-boss on level 7 I had to memorize the pattern. This has turned some people off from the game, but I can say that if you are looking for a challenge, then this game rewards you with intensity, frustration, and that wonderful satisfaction when you finally get that S rank on a difficult part. \n\nI give the game a 10/10 not because it is the best game ever, but because it does what it intends to do, and does it very well.

That feeling is too incredible to miss. Would recommend.\n\nI'm always wary of games that rely purely on their ambience and feeling. Life is Strange and Undertale are mediocre games that I cared about because the characters were sympathetic and kind to me. Payday 2 was an amazing game that really conveyed the feeling of pulling of a heist as if I were in the movie Heat; now it's a continuous, dying meme tumor. Elite Dangerous' sound design and user interface are incredible, and very good at hiding that the game is actually a cash cow which the devs will never develop in a meaningful sense beyond what is required to make people pay for cosmetics. Like pre-ordering, buying a game based entirely on its ambience is something I simply don't do anymore.\n\nOf course, all these rules have an exception. Every so often you hear people raving about a game so hard that you just cave and do it. I made that mistake with Fallout 4, preordering the entire game and its season pass before I realized it was a hunk of trash, like most games directly developed by Bethesda. I'm presenting all these examples, by the way, so that you, the reader, can realize how low my expectations were for Thumper. I assumed that I would be bitterly disappointed, because I couldn't find anything besides the ambience to recommend it. But the ambience, I had heard, was worth it on its own. So I bought Thumper, and prepared for it to be another big mistake in my abusive love-hate relationship with the modern videogames industry.\n\nBooting up Thumper, you're shown a screen that (I believe) just shows you the road your space beetle runs along, without any intensity or scariness to it. You have to push a button to be shown the menu, then you push another and you're thrown right in. The game shows you your first technique - a [i]thump[/i], which is a completely appropriate name for it. The game invokes the same feeling that Dark Souls combat does, a kind of call-and-response viscerality that demands what feels like perfection, but is really just unforgiving enough that when you finally get that timing down, you really feel like [i]you[/i] killed something. This doesn't come through in the tutorial - the tutorial is free of consequences and of major audio or visual impact. When you [i]really[/i] get into it, you're doing turns, crashing through barriers and doing the aforementioned thumps to a percussion-heavy, violent rhythm, like something from a Hans Zimmer film. \n\nAt this point, it becomes clear where the devs were going with the ambience of the game. Knowing when and where to use music is a key part of game design - the early Tomb Raiders, for example, used no music at all unless you did something key to advancement or discovered a new area. They used music to highlight important things, and as such the music really hit you when it happened. The later Tomb Raiders just put music wherever, designed not to be noticed. While I appreciate that videogame soundtracks are often designed not to be noticed, as modern videogames often try to follow the cinematic ideal of having a complete start-to-finish 'score' while also tackling the conflicting issue of players not always proceeding in time with the arranged music like a film would, I think that music for the sake of music is one of the most disappointing things that's happened to the videogame industry today.\n\nThumper does not have music for the sake of music. For a start, it's a reactionary game, requiring you to do split-second-perfect inputs to 'kill' the barriers, turns, etc. that you face off against (and the devs have called them 'kills', and they're right to do so). The music is vital in setting you up to expect the next thing. The screen is too busy - you need the music to time it perfectly, and even then you don't always get it. But besides that simple, utilitarian function, Thumper's music is constant, oppressive. It feels like being at the bottom of a diving pool, the constant pressure, the darkness and the strength of it making the entire game feel like a struggle, even though the challenge is completely appropriate to a satisfying gaming experience. When I say the devs are right to call the overcoming of an obstacle a 'kill', I mean it - the game makes you feel devastating, and I absolutely let an evil grin cross my face more than once in my half-hour of playing.\n\nThe visual design, too, is designed to enhance the ambience. Even doing nothing, your space beetle shakes as it travels, scraping on the ground with a faint hiss. The visual and the sound combine to give an idea of incredible speed that simply wouldn't be possible with a less visually complex game. You are a tiny, destructive silver bullet, and every action you take reflects that. The thumps let out devastating booms as you distort everything for just a moment to [i]destroy[/i] the timed points you thump on. The crashes make you hug the ground, shaking even more violently and throwing up sparks as you [i]obliterate[/i] the barriers in your way. The turns are skin-of-your-teeth, even if you prepared for them well in advance. You feel like a tiny, unstoppable force in a whole universe turned against you. I can imagine that if they existed, this might be what demigods felt like on their incredible, mythical labours. A beetle was the absolutely perfect choice to symbolise all of the forces at work here - protected, armoured and determined with its wings down. When it raises them, it's aggressive, powerful, [i]angry[/i]. \n\nThe damage balance of the game is perfect, allowing you one hit before you're killed - and when you recover health, the wings you lost when you took damage fly back on and click into place with a visual impression like a champion recovering his weapons, or some war-machine reloading a weapon. In short, the game is impeccably designed from an artistic direction. This is the kind of game that is painful to play, because you know the developers may never come across such a stroke of genius again. Well done, Drool, for creating one of the best games I ever played.\n\nThis may all seem like a bit much, considering what I said about playing games based on ambience alone. Trust me, I don't expect this game to have infinite replayability. If I ever go for all S-ranks, I think I'll probably completely cease to enjoy the game and lose entirely the elements that make it great. This isn't a game for achievement hunters. This is a game for your dark fantasies, for your power-visions, a representation of what happens in your head when that pulse-pounding anthem of your passion and your anger starts to play on the radio. It's a game about catharsis, and sadly all forms and sources of catharsis eventually lose their impact. But this dark, bitter, hot half-hour of gameplay has been one of the most satisfying of my life. For the shelf-life of the product and the length of the game itself, I would say a price of \u00a310 is more fair than the asking price of \u00a316, but it's worth it either way.

The heavy music and the abstract, dark art style complement eachother forming not just a very fun game, but a legitimate piece of artwork. The game is divided into 9 levels and each level is split into a couple dozen pieces with a smooth transition between each piece. Every level brings new mechanics that are so good that there is a desire to finish a level just to see the next mechanic. The game is actually easier than it looks, but it is still definitely far from easy. Every obstacle is fine-tuned to match the beat of the song not only by the sound it makes while crossing the obstacle, but also the sound it makes when spawning. In VR, despite the very erratic nature of the game, there is absolutely zero motion sickness, because, technically speaking, the VR camera is stationary and everything moves towards the player. The checkpoints always come on time, none of them feel spaced too far between eachother. But, it is actually easy to miss the checkpoint, which, even though the game still saves, does not get the second health layer back if you encounter an obstacle before.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is highly polished and definitely worth buying even in full price. It is very fast paced and hurts your fingers eventually, but that should definitely not deter you from this amazing experience.

They do not stand out enough against the very basic beat to make it noticeable when you need to do something at many times.\n\nI would be trying to find the rhythm of a particular section and I end up memorizing the pattern by watching it and doing it over and over rather than actually feeling the beat of the music and reacting based on that beat. When the game is based off rhythm, this is not acceptable.\n\nI still do not think this is a bad game per say, but there are just times when the rhythm part of the game isn't standing out enough to actually feel the rhythm and this is most likely due to the fact that there is so little actual rhythm music in the damn game. I went through a level and all there was in that level was a snare on a pattern that did not deviate at any point with the patterns in the level, to make it worse it was a boss fight. I did not enjoy that boss fight for any amount of time.\n\nThe game is good, but the rhythm aspect of the game needs to stand out more and the music needs to support it more otherwise it doesn't feel like a rhythm game, but rather a pattern recognition game.\n\nAlso the effect for taking damage is so distorting that it makes it very difficult to recover if you are in a hard section both with the way it affects the rhythm and the view of what is coming toward you.\n\nThe game is very much made for VR more than anything else. The view of the game is great and cool and all, but the rhythm aspect of the game (which is the entirety of the game's base purpose) isn't standing out enough to make it good in my opinion.\n\nThe instrumentation is the same throughout the entire game. It is always going to be the same metallic drum with an increased increment on the time. (1/4 time 2/4 time etc etc) Due to this the patterns, while increasing in complexity, are beginning to run together and feel the same after 4 levels. \n\nSo after everything is said and done, the rhythm isn't good enough and standing out enough to make it a good rhythm game and the patterns, while they increase in complexity as the game gets higher in level, are very same-y throughout the entire game. The instrumentation is far below average for a rhythm game.\n\nThis is a game best suited for those with VR and no one else. I cannot in good conscience recommend this game for anyone without VR.", "timestamp_created": 1490504980, "timestamp_updated": 1490507513, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1,

Since you first need to get into the rhytms and immense speed in wich the game challenges you it is difficulty to pick the game up just like that.

The DDR craze along side Guitar Hero type games were never  really my thing. The last rythm game I was really impressed with was Pa-Rappa, its quirky characters and super memorable songs hit just the right spot. It's been a long time since that game, and I always wished something would impress me the way that title did for the rythm gene...enter Thumper.\nUnlike Pa-Rappa there is no story, quirky charaters, or zany ass songs...hell its not even like Thumpers soundtrack could be considered a song, more like a drumtrack from hell (but still so good). This is Rythm at its core.\nI'm only on the 3rd level as of now, and I can tell you its a white nuckle affair. Super trippy graphics play perfectly to a soundtrack to get your heart pumping, and controls that are spot on. I have read elsewhere that someone said there was  lag after an update. I had no such problems, everything worked great with my 360 controller.\nPeople looking for more than arcade rythm game might look elsewhere. This is not a story driven game, nor should it be. When a game is this slick, gameplay wins over story. Its all about hitting the jumps, turns, and marked location with the correct presses of the d-pad and the A button at the right times. You don't have real freedom of movement, but soon in you'll realize you wouldn't want it anyways. You'll be too busy just trying to stay alive, and 2 misses and it's game over.

The Pictures and the video looked as if there isn't variety in this game and I wondered if this feels like a Mini-Game you play for a few Minutes like some shallow Smartphone games.\nIt took like 20 Minutes and I was completely sucked in.\nI must admit, I am not a big fan of the soundtrack, not because it is bad, but because its not the kind of music I listen to. BUT it fits incredibly well and it is needed to create the package. And maybe that's exactly the success formula of this game: It is a perfect package.\nThe visuals alone are psychedelic and if you look at them alone without playing or hearing the music, it's nothing special. The gameplay itself is polished, but nothing that hasn't been done before.

It goes beyond the traditional design of using icons to tell you what to press found in games like Parappa the Rappa, Dance Dance Revolution, Guitar Hero, and Beat Mania. Thumper goes beyond it by telling you what to press visually. The ominous repetitive drum rolls give you the tempo needed for you to have sense as to what goes on, and the visual & sound queues come up just a couple seconds before they are needed to activate.\n\nThere is an awesome sense of reward if you land certain queues correctly, which may give you a shield if you don't already have one, to simply a neat effect complementing it with point multipliers. The boss battles could get intense and require several tries to beat them since that is when the queues become even more unpredictable but fair enough to queue you if you react in time.\n\nAt first my impression of the first level was \"Okay, this is kinda cool.\" By the time I was on the third level the game began to get so difficult but was hooked at the sound effects, the combos that the game teaches you, original dark ambient/techno-ish soundtrack which progressively gets more complicated, and deceptively simplistic mechanical control. All these factors make you want to BEAT the level.\n\nThis is an AMAZING and REVOLUTIONARY game, giving you the right amount of difficulty and queue time to get better.

This rhythm game cares less about the music you're trying to match and more about whether you survive its onslaught or not. Each level is an endurance test laced with adrenalin and boss fights with only slight breathers sprinkled in. Between that and it's very surreal visuals, it's a brilliant jump-start to the senses and one hell of a substitute for caffeine. \n\nHaving said all this, wait for a sale. $20 is a bit much for a game that stops varying its obstacles mid-way through and the faster it gets, the harder it becomes to tell what's ahead thanks to the visuals becoming a blurred mess or red and silver. (This is why you don't speed, kids.) Not just that, but there should be a penalty for games that only offer health when you're playing well...meaning that you don't need the health when you're rewarded with it 90% of the time. Just adds salt to the wounds from crashing cus' one level is kicking your ass and you can reeeeeeeally use that health the game spat out last level. That fact is especially true in boss fights. The health refill only appears when you do a section perfectly the first time. The only way that system works is through trail and error and again, by then you generally don't need it when you're given it.\n\nAnother thing is by about world 5, the game gets hard. By world 6, you're expected to master everything, even techniques never taught to you. For example, you can bounce. Game never taught me that, but the game expected me to have perfected this hidden technique. You told me how to slam down on the ground from the air, why not tell me how to stay in the air? That goes double for those arches that appear long past your normal flight strength. I still haven't figured out how to get them cus' the game never told me.\n\nStill, despite the grips, it's a fun curiosity that's worth trying.

I stumbled upon this game when I watched an unrelated Gaming Video with short scenes of this game spliced into it and knew I had to have it just by the looks of it, so I bought it on sale and haven't been disappointed.\nThumper is a rythm game. It's also kind of a horror game with lovecraftian themes. Controls are simple. You have a Stick with four directions and a button, the game throws you the beats and some obstacles and then it goes like this: *THUMP*---*THUMP-THUMP*--*CLING*-*THUMPdangdang*---*THUMPdadingSrrrrrrrrrrrrr*---*WUMP*. Or something like that. The game just feels great. I think what sets it apart from other rythm games is that it's not only important to hit the beat at the right time (the hit window is actually pretty generous) but also that you have to keep the button pressed to not crash into obstacles and release it at the right time to get the next beat. Then add some basic horizontal and vertical movement and you have a simple yet challenging and fun game.\nThe Game is hard but fair (in most cases, some obstacles you can't possibly see coming), you can repeat any checkpoint without punishment, if your reaction time is lacking you can always memorize the patterns. But you will still die a lot, because the game is fast and you only get two chances before you die. But the game also eases you into it, the first 4 levels are basically tutorial, Level 5 is where things get rough and you struggling just to survive. It also is the kind of game where it is really fun to play it again after you have beaten it just to see how much you have grown as a player and how easily you can get an S-Rank on a part you struggled so hard before.\nOverall two thumbs (thumps?) up, highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1487420006, "timestamp_updated": 1487420006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506347", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29996254": {"recommendationid": "29996254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166083982", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514503614}, "language": "english", "review": "Thumper is an absolute marvel that flawlessly accomplishes its purpose as a rhythm game.\n\nThe soundtrack is incredible and diverse, the animations are spectacular, and the difficulty curve is nothing short of perfection.

[/h1]\n\nI've only ever reviewed one other game and that was just to satisfy the steam community badge. Needless to say, this game exceeds my expectations- no this game has become [u]the standard, the pinnacle for VR seated experiences[/u]. I've had my Vive since launch and have played most everything room scale. I didn't think a seated VR game would even come close to the level of immersion experienced via other room scale games but this takes the cake. \n\nGameplay - [b]10/10[/b]\nWhile not entirely rhythm based, Thumper lends itself to a series of visual and audio cues to alert the player. Quick reactions, and keen foresight are needed to obtain the highest score for each level. I find myself replaying levels and checkpoints just to get the coveted S rank. Mistakes are pounded into you in Darks Souls fashion.  \n\nVisuals - [b]10/10[/b]\nAstounding, exemplary, beautiful. I run a GTX 1070 so there's no lacking in graphical throughput. That said, the visuals throughtout are as smooth as a car ride in the countryside. Despite being a roller coaster-esque experience, the visuals don't overshadow the sense of scale, and wonder as you zoom through the obstacles. The geometrical shapes and patterns accompanying the ride flow like a river. There are moments of muted austerity, which is then contrasted by an elongated grandeur. \n\nSound - [b]10/10[/b]\nImagine laying down for an MRI. You're semi-naked in the patient garbs, and you're being slowly thrusted down this tube of magnets and xrays. The incoming radation that will blast through your body is unnerving at first, and you don't realise how it affects you until the doctor shows you your results. This is what the OST to this game does. It accompanies you on a journey and heightens your senses. Like laying there defenseless, you let it overtake you, embrace you at times. Harsh, almost industrial at times, but soft, and orchestral at others. Perfectly balanced for levels, and bosses. \n\n\n[i]Every sound, every light, every movement is orchestrated to provide a thrilling, terrifying, and mesmerising experience.

This is some beautiful next level stuff visually and sometimes the beat hits really hard i find myself grooving to the music in my chair.

Nothing blisses me out more than getting to that place where the music is king and all you're doing is reacting to is. \nThumper is a champion of this, like Rez, the trippy visuals only enhance what is ostensibly a largely audible experience. \nI tried playing this with headphones for a while, but cranked up speakers, ones with really good bass, is where it's at for this. You'll find yourself picking up audio clues all over the place to help you navigate the roller coaster.\nA lot of effort was put into making the experience here viseral, this isn't a simple navigation of multi track mixing like in Aplitude or Frequency. This is a roller coaster ride of audio violence that lets you feel your mistakes. If you fail, you fail hard, with only one shield shell to make protect you. The checkpoint system is incredibly forgiving though, and with levels that go on upwards of 10 minutes or more, they're really nessesary. You can back out, and return to the part of the level you left on at any point. \nRight now, I can't find anything to complain about. Like all rhythm games, sync is important, so if you're playing on an HDTV, you might find a bit of lag between the video and the audio.

Lovecraft's The Music Of Erich Zann. It's also an accurate review of Thumper, especially in VR.\n\n\"I heard a sound myself; though it was not a horrible sound, but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical note, suggesting a player in one of the neighbouring houses, or in some abode beyond the lofty wall over which I had never been able to look. Upon Zann the effect was terrible, for dropping his pencil suddenly he rose, seized his viol, and commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing I had ever heard from his bow save when listening at the barred door.\n\nIt would be useless to describe the playing of Erich Zann on that dreadful night. It was more horrible than anything I had ever overheard, because I could now see the expression of his face, and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear. He was trying to make a noise; to ward something off or drown something out\u2014what, I could not imagine, awesome though I felt it must be. The playing grew fantastic, delirious, and hysterical, yet kept to the last the qualities of supreme genius which I knew this strange old man possessed. I recognised the air\u2014it was a wild Hungarian dance popular in the theatres, and I reflected for a moment that this was the first time I had ever heard Zann play the work of another composer. . . .\n\nThen I remembered my old wish to gaze from this window, the only window in the Rue d\u2019Auseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall, and the city outspread beneath. It was very dark, but the city\u2019s lights always burned, and I expected to see them there amidst the rain and wind. Yet when I looked from that highest of all gable windows, looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the night-wind, I saw no city spread below, and no friendly lights gleaming from remembered streets, but only the blackness of space illimitable; unimagined space alive with motion and music, and having no semblance to anything on earth. And as I stood there looking in terror, the wind blew out both the candles in that ancient peaked garret, leaving me in savage and impenetrable darkness with chaos and pandemonium before me, and the daemon madness of that night-baying viol behind me.\"", "timestamp_created": 1483781626, "timestamp_updated": 1483781626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596457", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29080315": {"recommendationid": "29080315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011551980", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505601601}, "language": "english", "review": "You will enjoy this game.

Musically, the levels are basically indistinguishable, and the only thing that changes as you progress is the complexity/game mechanics of what they require you to do. Normally, that would be fine, and it would essentially play out as an experience of familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics and feedback loop to the point that by the end of it you feel like some musical badass as you're whizing through fantastically complex arrangements using the skills you've developed throughout the previous levels, but that just isn't happening with me. \n\nHalfway through the game, I feel barely more comfortable with the gameplay than when I started. As others have stated, it's a loop of call-and-response where they overlay patterns in the soundtrack that give you a heads up as to what is about to occur on the track. Generally, you can also see what's coming up on the track ahead, too, but sometimes, the track procedes in a way that just doesn't make it visually possible to see what's ahead, and at that point, it just becomes \"well, I hope you heard that barely audible queue sequence well enough to distinguish it from the booming core beat\". And when you crash after you don't hear that and you begin to repeat the section, it just becomes a game of rote memorization to get through the track. This problem doesn't occur in the early tracks, but that's because they're too slow to really be interesting. Then, by the time the action speeds up to the point that it would be interesting, the audio queues get drowned out in the action.\n\nI don't know, in the beginning, it is really cool, and with a good pair of headphones and if you turn out the lights, it honestly is quite intense. Just don't expect much once the initial rush wears off and you settle into the grind.

A few bosses require the pound move to complete, but I could only get the pound move to work around a third of the time. When a boss required several pounds to be performed in a row, I ended up repeating that section several times (for at least 10 minutes) before being able to progress. At that point, the boss became boring. He could not hurt me because his attacks were trivially easy to dodge, and I could not hurt him because I could not pound consistently.\n\nVisually, the game is quite breathtaking, but you can't really stop to enjoy it.

It's generally considered to be of critical importance that the track is readable and consistent.  Thumper says that ideaology is bunk and and puts presentation front and center.  The two major consequences of this are that it 'feels' really good to play when you are in the zone and doing well.  There is a lot of visual reinforcement for nearly every action and it really is a pretty unique experience in the RA genre.  The other consequence of this is that any kind of mistake generates a lot of implicit punishment.  That visual reinforcement becomes visual noise that you have to see through to try and recover.  The audio stutters and breaks when you make a mistake, making it that much more difficult to find your flow again.  Whether or not you doing well, Thumper is a noisy game.\n\nThis kind of presentation extends to effects where you do things right as well -- 'Thumping' on a gem from the air (An action that is not only good, but generates a bonus for the player) causes the track to stutter for an audio effect and generates a big graphic that ripples along the entire track, distorting it all along the way.  Coming from a more traditional Bemani line up of games, these kinds of effects feel extremely disruptive and I honestly shy away from doing them lest I generate more noise in an already noisy environment.\n\nThe contrast of the world doesn't help.  Often times you'll find gems on the track colored bright blue, along with the rails, the background and some of the 'tunnel' objects.  It makes parsing the screen pretty difficult at time.  The contrast of the track 'notes' ranges from acceptable to very questionable throughout the game.\n\nBeyond that, there are a handful of track layouts that are borderline not fair.  You don't get a reasonable amount of time to actually react to some elements, specifically some turns that come out immediately after another turn.  These are pretty rare, but encouraging memorziation as part of learning a track is generally Not Cool\u2122.\n\nI'm ragging a lot on this game and pointing out stuff that irked me some, but I think it's as important to note that I really do enjoy this game and in the whole scope of things, the game is very nicely polished and delivers a truly unique experience that moves the needle in an interesting direction for the RA landscape.  I can't wait to check it out in VR!\n\nIf you are a hardcore RA purist, then be ready to make some track readability concessions in favor of graphical and audio flair, but if you just want a fun, unique Rhythm game with an emphasis on presentation, then you really can't go wrong here.", "timestamp_created": 1483159536, "timestamp_updated": 1483159536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28855447": {"recommendationid": "28855447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982933378", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495676620}, "language": "english", "review": "The Dark Souls of rhythm games.

I've played it exclusively in VR, and it's an amazing experience from that angle. \n\nHowever, where it really suffers is the soundtrack. For a rhythm game, the soundtrack is *essential* and unfortunately, this game's music really disappoints. It is, for the most part, monotonous droning and repetitive, overcompressed cinematic-style drumming, interspersed with synth drumkit samples as in-game sound effects. \"Overcompressed\" is really the important takeaway. There's hardly any dynamic contrast anywhere, and the mixing is middling at best, with hardly any lows and a heavy top end that only distracts from the in-game sound effects. I played the game with my sony MDR-v6's and then listened through the OST again on a pair of DT 770's to see if it improved outside of the game, and it was actually worse, as the best low-end actually came from one of the in-game effects.\nWhile I think the style of the music is promising outside of this context (with a bit of mixing to get the drums more into the foreground), it doesn't fit the fast-paced rhythm game and only serves to detract from the experience.  \n\nSpiel out of the way, this is still an excellent game, especially in VR, as the visuals are absolutely amazing, and the rhythm components are quite well executed despite the mediocre backing music.", "timestamp_created": 1483080572, "timestamp_updated": 1483080572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28813783": {"recommendationid": "28813783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057351773", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488082607}, "language": "english", "review": "Permanently jammed my A button on a brand new gamepad.

There's absolutely no variety to it, it's extremely overpriced, and if you're looking for a rhythm game, you might get sick of Thumper really quickly. Why? Because it's not a rhythm game as far as I'm concerned. There's absolutely no structure to the \"music\" you're playing, so the early levels revolve around you listening to audio queues that come a bar before the note they correspond with. It's a game of call and response, kind of like Simon, but on rails. After a few levels, the audio cues become completely and utterly impossible to decipher. Then Thumper becomes a game purely about memorizing the most boring and repetitive levels I've ever seen in a rhythm game. The boss fights are all identical. The levels are all identical, with identical music. The visuals are impressive until you realize that there's no variety to those either. Every level looks exactly the same. This game looks, feels, and plays like a procedurally-generated game, but then you get to the end and there's no more.\n\nMaybe if the game had gone with a more readable art style (as opposed to the twisty-turny tracks that are constantly preventing you from seeing what's ahead), maybe it wouldn't be so frustrating. When you fail, it's not because you didn't stick to the rhythm or you made a mistake - 90% of the time, it's because the game decided to make you take a sharp right immediately followed by a note you couldn't see and an audio cue that you can't fucking hear. \n\nThe game's not buggy or broken, it's just an interesting experiment that makes too many missteps for me to enjoy it. I'm a lover of rhythm games, I'm a fan of quick-fire high-difficulty challenges, and Thumper seems to provide both at first glimpse, but it soon becomes a struggle against trial-and-error level memorization and a control scheme that works against the game's fast-paced nature. The music is good, but it's not good enough to be reused on every single level with no variation apart from the nonsensical rhythms you're beating your ship against. Wait for a sale if you're still interested, the game's worth money, it's just not worth the asking price and the game has a disappointing amount of variety. No alarms, no surprised.

I'm by no means saying this game is not worth your time, but the price is a bit much for what you get if you do not have a VR headset (which I suppose is the target audience). This game is fun when it works, frustrating when it doesn't. It's hard to explain the difference but I'll try to summarize it because there really isn't much detail to get into.[/strike] I've completely changed my mind, because of the few mechanics added since I last played. I was avoiding adding time due to how Steam refunds work but now there's enough for me to jusitfy the $16 I spent. I would still recommend waiting for a sale however if it's above this price.\n\nSometimes the game gives you great visual/audio cues as to what you need to do, and sometimes it basically just throws additional steps that are not telegraphed at all and you need to rely purely on reflexes. I have no clue if that's me missing a cue, if it's intentional, or something else, but it's frustrating when it does happen because it doesn't feel like I'm the one who messed up, although I very well could have. Tunnels limit how far you can see ahead, and since walls don't have a significant visual cue you'll end up getting hit a lot in a way that feels more cheap than fair. \n\nThe game looks great but you can't enjoy the visuals without messing up, so that's just annoying, and I can't imagine playing this in VR without dying constantly. Some level segments will instantly segway into the next one, meaning you cannot look at your score/rating without immediately missing something. This just seems like an oversight and I question why it's in the game. The 2x score indicator is also distracting but I might just be nitpicking (I think you can disable this by turning the entire HUD off but haven't tried).\n\nMy largest complaint is how hoops work, because they're so frustrating I might end up refunding the game because how agitating they are. They're so bewilderingly fickle I actually think they might be broken. In order to break hoops, you must press A and IMMEDIATELY hold up on the left stick, something that feels like it doesn't work around 20% of the time. There's also a mechanic that enables you to hit buttons by slamming down on the left stick, which ALSO only works around 20% of the time unless it's a scripted part of the track. It's almost like they didn't expect you to do this unless it was clearly indended by the obstacles. It's so much fun and I want to love this game but it ends up being more frustrating than enjoyable for me, maybe I'm just bad but man I cannot play a full level without feeling cheated at least once.\n\n\nIf this was baseline $15 maybe, but $20 is a bit steep for how basic this game is at its core. Far be it from telling people how to price things, I don't think I'll get my money's worth though. This game is far from bad, but I do NOT understand the overwhelming praise it seems to be getting.\n\n\nEDIT: Again everything here is still true, but it's too fun for me to keep this review \"thumbs down\".

I purchased specifically to play in VR as soon as support was added by the developers.  Something is very strange with the stereo rendering in VR.  The near track and bug look 3D, but the track in the distance becomes 2D, and every boss battle looks like you are staring at a 2D cinema screen up close, with the boss showing as a projected movie.  And when your bug explodes, debris close to you again looks 2D.  This sadly detracts from the game in VR, and at one point I was trying to fight a boss with one eye closed to try to fool myself into \"believing\" that everything was actually in 3D.  The game could have been amazing in VR, but this strange 2D-ness totally ruins it.  From the Discussion page, the devs are aware of this, but seem to suggest that there is no possible fix and that it is a failure of VR as a whole that far away objects look flat and only object at a virtual distance of 1 to 3 metres will ever look 3D.  I am really not sure this is the case, given a large number of other games made for VR (as opposed to having VR bolted on a 2D game like this) work fine, and so as it stands I cannot recommend this game for VR.

Thumper looks like an animated version of M.C. Escher's mathmetical collection of paintings that were drowned in a futuristic hellscape. The simplicity of the graphics is frequently overlooked as you're dazzled with a myriad a blazing light shows and particle explosions as you race down the runway with no intention of stopping. I was especially impressed with the unique take on button presses for a music and rhythm game. You'll find yourself holding down a face button while quickly pressing, and sometimes holding, a directional button in rapid succession in response to cues on the runway; The button presses feel visceral as they're translated to the onscreen action. Make no mistake, this game is also relentless with it's difficulty ramp. It starts out fairly simple with timed button presses and a single path along the runway, but it takes a bewildering nosedive the further you progress. And it's awesome. Checkpoints are generous and each level is broken up into two or more dozen sections that climax with a boss encounter. Getting an S rank on every section is a fantastic challenge, and with enough practice you embrace the cacophonous percussion, entering a Zen-like state with perfectly timed button presses. The addition of VR makes the atmosphere and sense of scale appreciably more intense, and it's my preferred way to play this game--but certainly not required--as the game is excellent without VR.

Even in its current form, its worth recommending, but it helps to ignore the hype and keep expectations reasonable. I went in with pretty high expectations from all the hype and was somewhat disappointed, but its still a good and fun game, just not a great game.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, its fairly twitchy and it hits difficulty ramps quickly. 1-13 took me 4 or 5 attempts when 1-1 to 1-12 were very easy for me.  I also had a little trouble understanding what the controls on the screen meant. \"R\" isn't press right, its trigger on the right Vive controller, for example. The game also started behind me when I launched it which took a minute to figure out, so I may have missed some intro elements. Games starting behind you or displaying critical text off screen in VR is inexcuable  this late in the game. Not sure why this is still an issue with some games.  \n\nI am anxious for someone to get this genre right in VR.

Thumper is one of the most intense and beautiful games I've ever played. It's got fantastic art direction; the graphics make it look like you're traveling between universes, and combined with the music it creates an incredibly tense atmosphere as if some kind of eldritch beast might jump out at you at any moment. My personal favorite part are the bosses: their design is often so incredibly weird and unique (ranging from the giant head forecast in the trailers to what appear to be sentient wormholes) that it makes me want to see more. \n\n\nSo what's bad about this game? In short: the gameplay. \n\nI haven't played many other rhythm games, so I can't exactly compare, but I found that this game became damn near impossible around level 4. Specifically, the final boss of said level. In the levels leading up to it, I could [i]eventually[/i] beat them by meticulously memorizing the pattern over the course of fifteen minutes and ignoring most of the obstacles. That isn't an option in the boss levels. Combine that with the nearly split-second timing required to hit some of the panels and the fact that, because of a bafflingly bad gameplay decision by the programmers, you're not allowed to switch rails while holding the space bar, and by the end of level 4 the game has become, as far as I'm concerned, borderline unplayable. If it weren't for the existence of footage of people beating the later levels, I'd accuse this game of being literally unbeatable, especially since it appears to continue scaling in difficulty at the same rate. And that's a shame, because the atmosphere and music are spot on; this is an absolutely fantastic game in every area [i]except[/i] the gameplay. \n\ntl;dr version: If you have the free time, look up a walkthrough of this game.

Could be an isopod with wings, could be a sci-fi bullet, or it could be a scarab, but whatever it happens to be, it loves its hotwheels track, and prefers to stick to it.\n\nControls are hyper simple and the game doesn't lie to you when it claims that the controls are 'a button and a stick. Because of that and as it goes, they can crank up difficulty by having some curves tossed in. Yes these curves and and will kill you, and as such, this forces you pay attention only to the track itself, so that you can not die long enough to die to the boss, which is a crying shame since the world around you is a living thing with pulsating shapes and colors, not dissimilar to your friend on news years eve at 9 PM. \n\nThe bosses, as well as foes in general, are cut and dry basic geometric shapes with what appears to be tenticles to at least some degree, but they merely exist for show. You damage yourself, rest assured. The bosses and other foes puke up the hotwheels track you exist on, and present you times to damage them, but not before throwing in a curve or two, or some toothpicks for you to dodge under. If you fail to press the button at each 'damage time', however, the entire course will reset. Again, keeps it predictible which isn't a bad thing, but after a while it stops being a pleasure and starts being some mumbling about that toothpick that keeps killing you.\n\nAll damage periods, and curves corralate to the beat of the music more or less, and said beat can only be best appricated with a pair of bass boosting headphones, of which I do not own; because the beat has to resonate, and replace your heart beat, so when you force your metal thing to die, you will too, but in real life, and only once.\n\nThe game is unforgiving and yet checkpoints are aptly placed; just enough to force you to try, but not so few that dying is a major set-back. Its quite rewarding to get everything right the first time, and its entertaining to see that triangle writhe in pain as you fling green balls of bile deep into the center of it. \n\nIt just gets irriating fast, I'm afraid. Naturally if you die on a set of track, the track doesn't change, so the game remains predictible in that way, and after hearing the same few sets of the same electronic song, it merely gets old. 5 years a second old. \n\nI'll be continuing this one.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1482108032, "timestamp_updated": 1482108214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28458654": {"recommendationid": "28458654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045652303", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511302245}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought I was Dr.Strange: The Beetle", "timestamp_created": 1482107820, "timestamp_updated": 1482107820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28440101": {"recommendationid": "28440101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136383723", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508774270}, "language": "english", "review": "Now I can see a unicore after playing this game", "timestamp_created": 1482037603, "timestamp_updated": 1482037603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28435756": {"recommendationid": "28435756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005136160", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485048686}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd been a holdout on getting a controller for a long time, but the reviews of this game convinced me to finally stop being such a keyboard/mouse snob.\n\nMy hands are now cramping and my right thumb is going from sore to numb and back again and I am breathing heavily as if I'd just done something atheletic.

It's not a rhythm or music game in that sense, it has a much heavier emphasis on fast reflexes. The player character (the beetle) should usually be thought of as playing an accompanying instrument, not directly matching the background music. [i]This isn't a problem with the game, it's just important to have the right expectations before buying.[/i]\n\nIf you're having a hard time, here are some pointers:\n\n- Don't aim for high scores the first time you play a level, you'll probably just get frustrated. After playing later levels your reflexes and instinct will have become so sharp that you'll be able to come back to earlier levels and ace them without any need for memorization or restarting.\n\n- Turn up your speakers/headphones. This will allow you to better hear the audio cues that come in advance of many obstacles, especially corners.  It also helps makes the game even more enthralling and gets you into its rhythm.\n\n- As far as I've played in the game, there have [b]never[/b] been two turns the same direction in quick succession (within a half second or less). It's always Left-Right or Right-Left, never Left-Left or Right-Right. If you see a turn in one direction, be prepared to turn the opposite direction immediately after. I also haven't seen an obstacle aside from turns that require you to hold A+Left or A+Right, so there's probably no harm in just immediately holding the opposite direction after completing a turn to be sure you aren't surprised.\n\n- Once you get good at jumping/flying and landing, this is often a much faster way of hitting beats that come in quick succession compared to just hitting A as fast as you can. Later in the game (level 5) it's virtually impossible to hit every beat without using this technique.", "timestamp_created": 1481905446, "timestamp_updated": 1482350423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28363230": {"recommendationid": "28363230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045809120", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495178963}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1]\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350[/h1]\n\n\u4e0a\u5468\u6211\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u53614\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u2018\u2019\u8282\u594f\u611f\u5f88\u8ff7\u5f88\u5e26\u52b2XD\u2018\u2019\n\u5173\u53615\uff0c\u2018\u2019\u6cbb\u597d\u4e86\u6211\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u5e72\u773c\u75c7...''\n\u8fd9\u5468\u5173\u53616\u7684\u6700\u7ec8boos: \u2018\u2019\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u5267\u6bd2\u53eb\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8fc7\u5f2f...\u2018\u2019\n\n \u00d7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6548\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u6e38\u620f\u6027\n \u00d7\u591a\u58f0\u9053\u4e0b\u97f3\u91cf\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\n \u00d7\u86c7\u5c3e\u5df4\u592a\u957f\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u8282\u594f\u611f\n \u00d7\u5931\u53bb\u751f\u547d\u540e\u7684\u7ea2\u8272\u70df\u96fe\u6270\u4e71\u8282\u594f\u548c\u89c6\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5269\u4e00\u547d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8282\u62cd\u52a0\u901f\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u4eba\u5173\u53615\u624b\u6b8b\u6253\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u7684C\u8bc4\u5206\u5374\u5168\u7403\u6392\u540d2k\uff0c\u770b\u6765\u6e38\u620f\u5b9e\u5728\u5c0f\u4f17\u4e14\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6709\u5931\u8bef\uff0c\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u662f\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1481736542, "timestamp_updated": 1482646252, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469794", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28319507": {"recommendationid": "28319507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018413676", "num_games_owned": 655, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485530484}, "language": "english", "review": "Thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1481502881, "timestamp_updated": 1481502881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28304551": {"recommendationid": "28304551", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995113990", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482893527}, "language": "english", "review": "The kind of game that makes you sit up in your chair.

I imagine this game will be more favorable to you if you are musician with fairly decent background, as the game moves VERY quickly and if you don't anticipate the rhythms in odd sections (offbeats, leading beats, complex meters) by eventually catching on to the pattern, it will feel somewhat random.\n\nGameplay/challenge: This game will best suit you if you're a fan of hard games as this game is VERY challenging and beyond that has an EXTREMELY high skill cap if you are going for a high score. That said, the game is fairly well designed and will teach you new techniques and patterns in isolation before mixing it in with other stuff. Checkpoints are typically frequent, so you will slowly progress if you keep trying, although you will certainly not hit any great grades if you do this without trying to master each segment.\n\nMusic: But seriously, get this game. The soundtrack is very intense and has a great weight to it. Stylistically, think of it as playing a whole rhythm game where the soundtrack is pulled from Invader Zim industrial background music with a modern twist. The sound effects when you properly hit notes just *feel* powerful, and you'll find yourself pressing the controller and stick much harder than you probably need to on occasion as a result of its weighty feel.\n\nVisuals: This game is BEAUTIFUL and visually is one of the most impressive I've ever seen. Seriously, just look at any of the screenshots. The game looks like that ALL the TIME but with nonstop motion added and constantly shifting colors. It feels like a drug trip without drugs and tends to intersperce calm sections where you just appreciate the scenery with the brutal sequences of rhythm.\n\nTLDR: High challenge/skill cap for perfectionists/twitch games, mind-boggling visuals, gripping gameplay with an equally gripping industrial Zim-esque rhythm soundtrack, bonuses for trained musicians who like mixed meter.

You combine and use a mixed array of combinations to hit notes, slide, jump, etc. Don't underestimate it cause it does get challegning over time, thus despite the intuitive and simple controls, the game does increase in difficulty as you progress.\n\nThe game comprises of 9 levels and has lots of sub levels with a boss in one of the early rounds and another at the end. With achievements to collect and S ranks to achieve, the game has great replay value. The developer recently introduced a new mode to the game, known as \" + Play \" that's a lot faster, unforgiving and frightening with no seconds chances for mistakes made.\n \nThumper has won  8 - 9 awards and still is anticipated to win many more. The VR comptability is on its way and will be freely patched into the game. \n\nWith or without VR, the game is completely worth the price tag for that which it's offered considering the time of release and the adrenaline fuelled joy it packs.\n\n\n[h1] Tips to savour the game to the max [/h1]\n\n~ Make sure to raise up the volume in the settings menu in the game to the max. \n~ Wear headphones / earphones.\n~ Turn off the lights and play in the dark. \n~ Use a controller for optimal experience. [spoiler] Keyboard works just fine too though.[/spoiler]\n~ The game gets really intense after reaching Level 3 , so consider 1 and 2 a warm up.\n\n[h1]Warning: [/h1] \n\nThose with a history of epileptic seizures should stay away from the game and also kids, stay at school, weed kills brain cells and drugs will destroy your lives.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMy

I expected something similar to Audiosurf, but that assumption was blown out of the water when I played the first level. One button and one stick sends your chrome-clad space beetle on its way careering down its metal track into the unknown whilst encountering harsh conditions along the way. You get a sense that you will never know what will appear next in the game due to the different rhythms that will batter you, and it will always keep you on your toes.\n\nIt goes without saying, but with a tagline of \"rhythm-violence\", this game is hard. It's going to force you into a sense of rhythm and will make you good at the game, whether that means dying countless times. At the end of each level you'll have a massive head looming over you, throwing beats your way hoping to kill you in the process unless you smash the four glows without error. Getting them all and delivering a supercharged shockwave towards the demonic head gives you the sense that you perfected the level, just like getting all the notes right on an instrument. But knowing once you get good at Thumper, and that you can perfect that one level you had trouble with ages ago with ease, just like perfecting a piece of music, you feel that nothing the game can throw at you will stand in your way. \n\nVisuaully, it's astounding for such a limited-ish game: my little space bettle shining in its full glory down the track (with no video settings at that) adds to the simplicity of the game comprised of a long metal track, a massive circle unforgiving of your mess-ups and the right-angled turns make for a simplistic but nonetheless aesthetically pleasing visual style.\n\nThe sound design in this game is quite simply untouched. The soundtrack is extremely unique with higher levels composed of their respective time signatures, so level 5 is 5:4 and level 7 is 7:4. It really does spice up the gameplay making you consider the different rhythms that will come later in the game. With a vast array of elements like audio cues, bassy thumps and the squeaky clank on a perfect turn, it makes for a flawless augmentation onto the science fiction-esque OST.\n\nWith the addition of the Play+ mode, it has kept me on edge every single time with the sense of annihalation if you slip up twice. No going back. I managed to complete Level 8+ in one sitting without dying, and it was the most heart pounding moment of this game yet. Knowing that I could die at any given moment after being stripped of my chrome armour, getting especially tense during the appearance of the \"Ring of Death\" hoping to tear you apart on any miss on multiple lanes. Horror games can boast their jump-scares and scary monsters in the dark, but can't compare to Thumper's bleak, glooming atmosphere and the sense of not knowing what's coming next.\n\nThere are only one or two cons I feel I should mention. \n\nSometimes, the beats that the game throws at you can be extremely unexpected and often land on the off-beat of the music, which can make it difficult to get into a real flow of the game. This mostly happens in levels 5, 6, 7 and 9 where the game speeds up and gives you less time to think about the music and make it more about quick reaction. However, these levels have irregular time signatures so that may be a factor. \n\nIt's got a slightly high price (\u00a315.99) , which is pretty uncommon for an indie single-player game. I would have expected a price closer to \u00a311.99 because there are many other games which offer more content at a lower price, but the game is still definitely worth it at \u00a315.99 and has offered me close to and imminently upward of 40 hours with the score-attack replayability of its levels.\n\nStraight recommendation.

Ahead of you are a series of glowing lights on the track, followed by several consecutive curves, more glowing lights, floating rings, translucent tendrils, then more glowing lights. Boom. Boom. Boom. Ching. Ching. Ching. BoomBoom. Schick. BRAAAHHHH. Boom Boom. The beat perfectly complements the hellish music which accompanies you on your seemingly endless journey through the depths of interdimensional cosmic hell.\n \nA smile emerges on your face as you feel a shiver go down your spine. Awestruck and wanting more, your knuckles go white as the next series of glowing lights approach.\n \nThe gist of the game is fairly simple: as you travel down the track, you must hit a button in line with the lights on the ground, and occasionally you lean/move in a given direction when appropriate. The stages start out simply enough in the beginning, with new mechanics like flying, multiple lanes, and oncoming enemies being introduced every so often. The difficulty rises gradually over the course of the first 3 levels, but then takes a sharp spike upwards at around level 4, where the increasing speed and introduction of new mechanics begin to take their toll. It can be frustrating. But each failed attempt brings you closer and closer to finishing a stage, which serves as a teacher that prepares you for the iterative mechanics of each subsequent stage.\n \nAlthough punishing, Thumper becomes increasingly rewarding with each level of mastery you attain. The ranking system is simple enough, with \u201cS\u201d ranks being essentially perfect runs, \u201cA\u201d ranks being great runs, and so on. However, the skill ceiling seems to be so absurdly high that, at a certain point, even an \u201cS\u201d rank doesn\u2019t necessarily feel good enough. There\u2019s always a turn that could\u2019ve been executed better. There\u2019s always a series of beats that could be more rhythmically pleasing. Thumper has a surprisingly effective carrot-on-a-stick that extends the replay value almost indefinitely as you strive to get a \u201cPerfect\u201d on every turn and rack up the multiplier while simultaneously crafting a beat that sends a feeling of frisson down your spine.\n \nPart of what makes Thumper so great is the fact that you aren\u2019t just playing along with the music, in most cases you are actively contributing to it.\n \nAs a fan of the \u201cNoise rock\u201d band Lightning Bolt I may be a little biased, but Thumper\u2019s soundtrack is phenomenal. Created by Lightning Bolt\u2019s Brian Gibson, it is a cacophony of sound that engulfs you in its unsettling embrace of booming drums, shrill screams, and foreboding drawn-out soundscapes. It\u2019s something that works in unison with the gameplay so well that the development process and unification of the gameplay and audio seems deserving of a documentary in and of itself. Text on a page doesn\u2019t do it enough justice.\n \nVisually, Thumper is nothing short of impressive.\n \nThe track you find yourself on loops back and forth, ascending and descending through what can best be described as interdimensional space. Flurries of lights, sparks, and other post-processing effects explode from your cute little beetle as you interact with every beat and curve. If that wasn\u2019t enough, mastering mechanics makes things even more overstimulating. If executed properly, a flight-beat followed by a down-beat combo will shoot a ball of light that travels ahead of you down the track, illuminating other beats, killing tendrils, and creating the illusion that it created the track\u2019s curves up ahead. Chaining these sorts of combos together multiple times is easily the most overstimulating and satisfying experiences you can have in any game. Objectively.\n \nDespite not being a fan of other rhythm games, Thumper has been the single greatest unification of music and gameplay that I have ever experienced. It\u2019s frustrating and difficult, but in a way that drives me toward perfection. It\u2019s overstimulating and chaotic, but in a way that induces a trance-like state. It\u2019s chaotic and violent, but in a way that shoots a cosmic beetle through the mouth of a fiery hell-skull. Thumper is amazing, and it\u2019s something that deserves to be experienced as a whole. In all of its unsettling, heart-pounding glory.\n\n(http://www.shatteredjoystick.com/single-post/2016/10/28/Thumper-PC--Review)", "timestamp_created": 1480541555, "timestamp_updated": 1480541555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28104755": {"recommendationid": "28104755", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993431013", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504495788}, "language": "english", "review": "So, now that I finally S ranked all the levels, I think I'm qualified to leave a review.

I just keep turning it up louder and louder to get enveloped by it. And the soundtrack starts out so simple, but by the end, you are being borderline assaulted by noise, and it's everything I could ever want. But that's just cause I love the tribal feeling. It's very high quality. The composer knows exactly what he's doing.\n\nGameplay:\nOkay, so this is where everyone seems to be torn. The problem is, I wouldn't necessarily call it a rhythm game. More like an [in]finite runner where all the obstacles happen to be on beat. Sure, it is \"call and response\", but towards the end, everything becomes so chaotic, you can't really hear the \"call\" anymore, and you have to rely on sight. Which is also hard, seeing how fast-paced it gets, and how it starts hiding things behind corners.\nAnyway, I would liken the feeling towards being in the rhythm section of a band. You gotta keep the beat and listen for what's coming next, but be ready for anything. You get in the zone, and feel what's coming next.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game, that's hard to pin down. I was a little sad about the length, however with the PLAY+ update, I've got much more reason to keep playing and keep perfecting. I would definitely suggest trying before buying, unless you know you like these kind of mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1480533379, "timestamp_updated": 1480533379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28093852": {"recommendationid": "28093852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337142022", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 19729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1016, "last_played": 1515984208}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beyond fantastic and I definitely recommend it to others especially with how cheap it is for this FUN of a  GAME.

I'm a musician focused on drums, I love drones and dark ambient, I love the demoscene, I loved guitar hero, I love bullet hell shooters and masochistic difficulties, the list of reasons I should love this game just goes on and on. But I really don't.\n\nInstead, Thumper is a slog to play that deals less with rhythmicality than rote memorisation. It goes out of its way to screw with any accumulated sense of rhythm over levels that take far too long to complete to ever want to return to (upwards of 15 minutes each). \n\nA gimmick of the engine is that every successful interaction the player has with the game triggers percussion, which means if your rhythm is off, the triggered sound is off too. The background audio functions as a sort of metronome intended to give you something to correct to, but the audio mix reduces that beat to a noisy growl under the din of your own off-center beats, meaning as levels increase in intensity your own off-ness creeps into your entire performance: Since the beats sound \"right\" to you but are in fact off by some margin, you slowly but surely creep closer to the offset where the game determines you straight up missed it. Among the reliable beats are the turns (which go off when they must as opposed to when you turn), but the levels of syncopation and sections of silence mean they are about as useful as a person next to you randomly bumping into you as you play. It's just maddening.\n\nThumper at its highest intensity (if you're not counting the endless rinse-repeat memorisation of drilling down a checkpoint until you perfect it) boils down to reading audio tells, but again the audio mix fails it. The thing about such a noisy soundscape is you run out of room to communicate with subtlety in the high frequencies. I never got comfortable with the tells for the elevated notches for instance (I was surprised to find out they even have one), and the game frequently sends you through turning and twisting tunnels depriving you of any visual tell to go by. No audio mix options to tweak the game to your own system exacerbate this.\n\nThe biggest failure of the game, IMO, is in its inability to build and sustain a rhythm, opting instead to give you frequent bouts of silence and random bouts of syncopation. It doesn't matter if you've a looping drum roll going in the background if the actual beats you have to hit on top of that are so haphazardly placed you are almost never allowed to \"get into it\". Add to this the game's love of animations and audio cues that don't have bearing on the rhythm whatsoever (the beetle hop when you release the boost is a constant annoyance for me) as well as frequent messing with time (recovering from a collision and other slowmo) all go into removing any pleasure I could get from what could otherwise be a pounding and satisfying drum session. Instead levels on first encounter are 15-20 minute grinds followed by further grinding checkpoint by checkpoint to build \"mastery\" that really just comes down to remembering patterns. It just goes on and on and even at its best I don't think it's rewarding my time. Halfway through *level 5* I was just exhausted. No thanks.\n\nThumper is too long, too repetitive, too random, poorly mixed, with a confounding scoring system.

Bajo esa apariencia inmaculada, donde la suciedad no existe y la m\u00fasica solo insin\u00faa, se nos pide alcanzar un estado de sinestesia, que asimilemos, aunque solo sea un instante, el total de lo que all\u00ed se nos ofrece. La diferencia, la gran diferencia de Thumper con propuestas similares, es que al alcanzar el nirvana a trav\u00e9s del flow que genera cada uno de sus elementos, no encontramos una apacible sensaci\u00f3n de tranquilidad, sino que nos asomamos a un abismo mucho mayor del que insin\u00faa esa pista de la que no podemos escapar.\n\nHe tenido que pasar varias horas con Thumper para entender las razones por la que desde Drool lo anunciaban como un t\u00edtulo de violencia r\u00edtmica. Tras este periodo no creo poder dar una explicaci\u00f3n exacta, pero les puedo asegurar que he pasado, al menos, tanto tiempo pensando en Thumper como jugando con \u00e9l. Buena parte de esto creo que tiene que ver con su envoltorio, no ya est\u00e9tico, sino mec\u00e1nico. Hemos pasado ya por las suficientes pistas infinitas llenas de ritmo como para bajar la guardia ante una propuesta similar. Yo ya he estado ah\u00ed y s\u00e9 lo que esperar. Dame m\u00fasica y elementos que vengan en mi direcci\u00f3n que ya me ocupar\u00e9 yo de mejorar lo suficiente como para que al darle al bot\u00f3n adecuado todo encaje. Thumper es eso, o al menos lo es de una manera que no puedo calificar de otro modo que abyecta. Hay algo inc\u00f3modo en cada pulsaci\u00f3n. Puede que se deba a que no hay un ritmo claro, que vaya desde el juego hacia el jugador, sino que en cierta manera lo va creando el propio jugador por s\u00ed mismo. Este cambio, de experiencia dieg\u00e9tica a extradieg\u00e9tica, mantiene el permio entre los reflejos y la capacidad de predecir el siguiente movimiento, pero a\u00f1ade un elemento de ansiedad de que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de no acertar en el momento correcto con la pulsaci\u00f3n exacta, pues requiere un reaprendizaje constante de las reglas de este extra\u00f1o universo.\n\nLa otra pata sobre la que crece esta violencia r\u00edtmica es la representaci\u00f3n de nuestras acciones dentro del t\u00edtulo, pues realizar correctamente cada una de las combinaciones no obtendremos una respuesta emocional tranquilizadora, sino cargada de intensidad, la cual se siente a veces casi como una agresi\u00f3n a la propia representaci\u00f3n de Thumper. No es por tanto la cl\u00e1sica representaci\u00f3n de una prueba de habilidad que en base a nuestra pericia nos termine otorgando una puntuaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s o menos alta, aunque esto tambi\u00e9n se encuentre aqu\u00ed, sino que el concepto de juego r\u00edtmico deriva en un t\u00edtulo de supervivencia en el que nunca tendremos muy claro si somos nosotros los que estamos sobreviviendo al universo de Thumper o \u00e9l a nosotros.\n\nLa confianza de Drool en su propuesta y sus ganas de realizar un t\u00edtulo que escape a los c\u00e1nones del g\u00e9nero tiene su m\u00e1xima representaci\u00f3n en la selecci\u00f3n musical elegida. Antes de poner mis manos sobre el juego me preguntaba por qu\u00e9 trat\u00e1ndose de un t\u00edtulo r\u00edtmico se estaba hablando tan poco de la m\u00fasica de Thumper. No sab\u00eda si ser\u00eda posible incluir un listado externo o descargar nuevas pistas. En definitiva, buscaba otro Audiosurf con un escarabajo metalizado. La respuesta te la da el propio juego, pues la banda sonora se construye a trav\u00e9s de una partitura que va modific\u00e1ndose, acort\u00e1ndose y alarg\u00e1ndose seg\u00fan avanzamos. Una tormenta industrial que no teme descargar su ira a base de sintetizadores o moverse en una calma tensa que m\u00ed, al menos por momentos, me ha recordado a un Vangelis de bajona.\n\nLo dem\u00e1s es arcade del bueno. Del jodido. Del de \u201cvamos a parar un rato porque quiz\u00e1s acabe reventando el mando contra la pared y esto vale un dinero\u201d. Hay decenas de obst\u00e1culos, cada cual m\u00e1s envenenado que el anterior. Hay enemigos, por supuesto. Enemigos que atacan y a los cuales \u00fanicamente puedes golpear con una bolita que sale despu\u00e9s de haber realizado una serie de combinaciones perfectas que pueden acabar con la paciencia de m\u00e1s de uno. Hay una curva de dificultad perfectamente medida para que creas que siempre te encuentras el borde del desastre, pero sin embargo avanzas un pasito m\u00e1s, y otro. La recompensa es m\u00e1s m\u00fasica, m\u00e1s violencia, m\u00e1s sentirte inc\u00f3modo mientras lo disfrutas a demasiados niveles como para intentar explicarlo.\n\nThumper es sencillamente el mejor juego musical al que he jugado nunca. Lo es porque ha conseguido que dentro del g\u00e9nero no me haya sentido como una cobaya que ten\u00eda que pulsar el bot\u00f3n rojo en el momento que se me indica para ganarme mi recompensa. Soy consciente de que eso es exactamente lo que hace, pero con la diferencia de que en esta ocasi\u00f3n tengo la sensaci\u00f3n de que el ritmo me pertenece, que puedo hacer algo m\u00e1s que salivar cuando el cient\u00edfico de turno toque el silbato, como por ejemplo arrancarle la mano.", "timestamp_created": 1479933861, "timestamp_updated": 1479933861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26855786": {"recommendationid": "26855786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073224624", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1516052171}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1479932442, "timestamp_updated": 1479932442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26831857": {"recommendationid": "26831857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025122856", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515534905}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game that draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

(12 hours for me to complete the game, roughly.) However, the game does offer a more challenging \"+ Playthrough\" if you are content with not beating your high scores.\n\n- Very difficult game. The game trains you well and starts slow but, due to it's fast pace and execution, after a certain point in the game every stage is capable of challenging you. On subsequent playthoughs it won't be as bad because you will develop your muscle memory, but it is especially brutal for a Thumper virgin. Brutal but, very satisfying.\n\n- Beautiful visuals. I decided to play this game after only seeing about 30 seconds worth of footage through a stream. Exquisite colors and effects bombard your eyeballs as you desperately try and keep your beetle alive through his LSD-esque adventure through space.\n\n- Sound Design. Excellent sound. However, you might need a good headset or speaker system to make full effect of this. Thumper is a ryhthym game, and using your eyes is incredibly helpful at certain points in the game. At times you might find yourself blinded by the acid trip, and being able to discern what sounds are what DOES make a difference. \nDON'T RELY ON YOUR EYES TOO MUCH.\n\n- Execution. You don't need to hit every obstacle to earn a good rating but, dropping a combo will hurt you. There are lots of little mechanics that require tight timing, though they aren't necessary for completion. For the most part you have a choice of whether to avoid *some* things, or to put yourself in danger for a big point bonus.\n\n---\n\nCONS: There are not really many actual problems with this game so they can likely all fit in 1 or 2 sentences.\n\n- Sensory Overload. Sometimes you just won't be able to keep up with everything on screen. You need to keep your eyes open, ears primed, and fingers dancing. You may be blinded at one point, or unable to discern one sound from another, Or you can't execute everything, like hitting a hard combo in a fighting game.\n- There is one aspect of the game that I'm still trying to figure out if it has a tell or not. Apart from visually discerning it at 100mph, lane switches are hard to see. That's about it.\n\nI'm having some cognitive dissonance on whether or not to bash the game's difficulty in discerning sound, being a rhythym game. It can definitely be an annoying issue when considering how difficult the game can be. I'm going to leave it at this for now.\n\n____\nNow all we need are custom tracks!", "timestamp_created": 1479224572, "timestamp_updated": 1479224903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26616467": {"recommendationid": "26616467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156034459", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502471484}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38 \u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1479223847, "timestamp_updated": 1479223847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26594527": {"recommendationid": "26594527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052499064", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489057890}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't feel my thumbs\nHelp\n\n\n\nIt was totally worth the money though", "timestamp_created": 1479096754, "timestamp_updated": 1479096754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503889", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26592640": {"recommendationid": "26592640", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962200300", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506228374}, "language": "english", "review": "The core mechanics in this are really solid, and it's a great example of easy to learn and hard to master.

It features beautiful visual and sounds, everything about the game is captivating, the game mechanics work nicely and you really feeling 100% immersed in the game flow.

The game only uses 2 inputs. the left analog stick, and a button (Use a controller, its way better), but the amount of complexity it manages with just those two inputs is staggering. Ill admit it starts off too slow, but after the first \"Level\" it ramps up beautifully. This is not a traditional rhythm game, the best way to describe it is a \"call and response\" system, credit to the other review I stole that off of.

In fact that would be another gripe of mine, after the first couple levels the background music gets less interesting as it relies more heavily on you properly hitting the notes and beats. \nThe game also ramps up difficulty very well, introducing not only new mechanics each levels but also speeding it up and limiting what you can see ahead of you through tunnels and such.

Its musical and Rhythm aspect. Everything else about this game really feels great, but the audio cues being faint and hard to hear makes this game frustrating to play, and any mistake i make, in most cases, feel like its the game not giving me any warning at all to whats coming up, and it feels cheap and unfair. I don't mind difficult, i just want fair difficulty, where it was my mistake that made me lose, not the game just throwing something at me out of nowhere with no warning and no time to react.\nIf you don't mind a more visual focused rhythm game, in which incredibly fast reactions or memorization is the main focus, with a little bit of rhythm mixing in, then definitely go for this game.\nI just expected the game to be more fast paced Rhythm and visuals mixed together, not Visuals with just a bit of Rhythm too it. Read the rest of the review to know why i expected both a Rhythm and a Visual game mixed together, and why the game is clearly marketing itself for being both.\n\nMany rhythm games don't need audio cues since you can easily see whats coming up next, and basing yourself on the rhythm and beat, you can play whats coming up correctly. Examples would be: DDR (you see the arrows and know the rhythm so you know how to play them) Amplitude (You can clearly see all the circles coming up and what rhythm and order you have to play them in), guitar hero/rock band (similar to amplitude, you can see the notes coming up and know the rhythm you need to play them in and what order)\n\nThis games visuals make it very difficult to see whats coming up next, and things just pop up infront of you and give you only about 1-2 seconds to react at best. As such the developpers added \"Audio Cues\" that tell you whats coming up to allow you to listen, hear the rhythm and beat and what you have to do, and then go with it. The problem is that the audio cues are too faint and hard to distinguished and so, many times you get caught because you cant hear/see what you have to do and get killed in a cheap annoying way. This ruins the \"rhythm\" aspect of the game, and instead you have to memorize certain parts of the tracks since its just easier then trying to listen to what you have to do. I have played a lot of rhythm games in the past, and this game is really close to beating all of them. It just needs this one little adjustement and it would be absolutely amazing. instead it just ends up being frustrating and cheap to play.\nIf the audio cues were better, this game would instantly be one of my favorite rhythm games of all time. And right now, it still kinda is a rhythm-music game, it just doesn't do the rhythm-music part right.\n\nI don't want the game to be easier, i don't want the game to change its own style, its a fast paced rhythm violence game. The problem i have is that the audio cues just mix in TOO much with the music in the background. While the visuals outright block whats coming up, most notably, in the tunnel sections, leading to some very cheap and annoying deaths that can only be avoided by memorizing the track. I can hear the audio cues sometimes, i know what they are, but if its going to market itself as, and i quote:\n\"Thumper is rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action, blistering speed, and brutal physicality. \"\n(taken straight from the steam \"About This Game\" section,  \"classic rhythm-action is clearly stated here, and in the description aswell.)\nthen i expect the rhythm part to also be a major part of the game, and for it to be consistently clear and important. Its definintely trying to be, its just not succeeding at it. \n\nThe game also has the Rhythm and Music tags to it, so you can't tell me its not trying to also be a rhythm game. I know its trying to be a mix of rhythm and bullet hell style, where things come at you in large numbers and quickly, giving you little time to react, but rhythm games thrive on having easy visuals, but difficult rhythms that are still clear. bullet hells are good at having really clear visuals that are hard to avoid. This game fails at both.\nBut it comes very close to doing it right, if steam allowed neutral reviews i would give it one, but it doesn't.\nIn the end you CAN go with the rhythm, but only after you've memorized the tracks already. You can't use both your eyes and ears to know whats coming up and then do it perfectly everytime simply because you're that good at music and reacting. In this game, when you get stuck in a tunnel, the audio cues are faint and hard to hear, so you rely on your eyes, only for the game to throw two sudden walls when you couldn't possibly see the second wall until it was already too late. And if the audio cue was just a little bit more obvious then it would be purely up to the player to hear it, realise what he has to do, and then do it in the rhythm of the song.\n\nI cannot hear the audio cues and so i cannot do the right actions to the rhythm of the game because the visuals block most of what you can see at times. And so, its clear the developpers wanted to add something to fix this issue, which is the audio cues ive mentioned many times. But these are too hard to hear, to difficult to distinguish in the song, and so everything falls apart, the visuals end up being distracting more then impressive, the difficulty becomes more cheap then challenging, and the music aspect becomes more reaction based then rhythm based. One small change could make everything i've just mentioned worked. And until that change to the audio cues is done, this review is gonna stay negative.", "timestamp_created": 1477944383, "timestamp_updated": 1478053886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515384", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26335156": {"recommendationid": "26335156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077478547", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1516365711}, "language": "english", "review": "moar this liek gaem!!!", "timestamp_created": 1477917239, "timestamp_updated": 1477917239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.339165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26333267": {"recommendationid": "26333267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038897449", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504644512}, "language": "english", "review": "Frightening, heart-stopping, wicked.

It's so simple and yet so difficult. The difference to Audiosurf lies in the design of and the interplay between music and the levels. Everything is produced with the gameplay experience in mind. Levels build up on each other. Simply the fact that the time signature increases one beat per level shows how the developers intended to get a pacing into the game that could never be there with generative levels.\n\nWhile I do think, Thumper hasn't realized its full potential and some improvements could have been included, I must say that I had tons of fun and even more tons of frustration just barely making it through the 9 levels alive.

If you're here for the high octane, \"game-feel\" defining gameplay,  and don't mind purely reaction-based stuff, this is your game.\n\n\n\n\nI bought this game under the assumption that the focus of this game was rhythm. That's not the case, however. Where the game fails as a rhythm game, it succeeds as a reaction/memorization game. Though this game is SO frustratingly close to being an excellent rhythm game, there are a few details that keep it far from that title.\n\n\nThe visuals, while absolutely stunning, detract from the clarity of the game mechanics. Whenever you go through tunnels, the wall obstacles make the player turn a sharp corner, which prevents you from seeing obstacles that are around it. It also doesn't help when the color of the tunnel interior matches the orange glow of the wall; making it practically invisible. It cheapens the game's difficulty.\n\n\nAbsolutely none of that would be an issue if the audio cues that indicate which obstacles you'll have to avoid next were clear and distinct. They sadly aren't. They are unreasonably quiet, a fact that is painfully clear when the sound of dodging the current obstacle, plus the roaring tribal drums completely eclipse it. The cues also sound too similar to each other. When dozens of sound cues are constantly bombarding your ears, you need to be able to distinguish between them subconsciously. Vary the pitches, make the sounds have fundamentally different textures, anything you can to make them clear as crystal. The current system is simply too muddy to be useful at all.\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, if you like reaction-based \"endless runner\" style games and aren't afraid to do some track memorization for some of the S ranks, you'll really enjoy this game. This honestly may be one of the best \"feeling\" games I've ever played. Every time you clang into a turn or crash through a bar, it leaves a palpable and utterly satisfying impact. \n\n\nIf you came here expecting a new rhythm game to grind at and master, you're gonna be disappointed. I really hope the devs touch up the game and really nail the little things, so you can play the game musically.  I can't help but feel a bit mislead by the \"Rhythm Violence\" tagline, as I don't feel it quite meets the standards of a  rhythm game. For me personally, it's not worth $20 in it's current state, that's the reason I refunded the game. I would be more than happy to re-purchase it when these issues are addressed or when the game goes on sale.\n\n\nThanks for reading.

If anything I think playing it in VR is.. Easyer in a way... But thats not bad! IT IS SOOOOO SURREAL! I've played 3 games in VR, War Thunder, Lucky's Tale and this... This is the best I've played! I love the new camera angle, it's almost like your sitting on the beetle!... RECOMENDATION TO ALL: If you have 300 bucks and a good computer, get a freaking vive or oculus and play this in VR you WILL NO regret it (but your stomach might! ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) anywho Thankyou for makeing this game. It is truly somethin else.\n\n\n\nThis game is just... where do I start. The Graphics are amazing and simple, the color style is brilliant, and the gameplay... ohhh the gameplay. Ive got about 9 hours under my belt at the time of this review with about 8 levels done on Level 5 and at this point I can say is my favorite part of this game is the boss battles not just the final ones but the mini/mid bosses as well especialy with (i think it was level 3 introduces it) the Stomp 'attack' that is just sooo satisfying to do on the final 'cube' to fire a shot at the boss (the last little bit of the trailer shows this attack). I consider this game one with a rhythm that you can feel, one that sends chills up your spine every time you play it. Although one problem that i have.. its probably nitpicking but ill say it anyway, is also what makes this game good.. the speed.. yes this game is supposed to be fast but i sometimes find myself not able to keep up with whats going on.. and this is comeing from someone who loves speed games... but again its probably nitpicking anywho I give this game my final rateing of 10/10 (since my only complant is a nitpick) Buy this game and let your fingers impress you.. thats all i have to say, and if youre recording this for Youtube like I am... I recomend haveing a camera pointed at your hand.. a 'handcam' of sorts.

The visuals are pretty nice, the space theme seems to suit this very well and reminds me of the original TapTap :). Adds lots of new obstacles as the game progresses, kepts it fresh.\n\nNow, unfortunately the cons - the music is a bit too quite compared to the sound effects that you produce, in the first levels it isn't as noticable as in later levels where there are more obstacles. The music seems very very similar through out levels, and what slight variation there is gets masked by th esound effects. A lot of obstacle \"combos\" repeat, like \"long left\", \"long right\", \"long left\", \"long right\", these repeat on a lot of levels and get very predictable. Also the general route seems to be \"left\", \"obstacles\", \"right\", \"obstacles\", you rarely encounter more than 3 turns in the same direction in a row, so it is very predictable. Finally the thing I absolutely hate, why try to make a level harder by simply making it last ages? Also if you do intend in making harder levels longer, make them consisten, that is start with the shortest level and end with the longest (not counting \"bosses\", which are a very nice touch in my opinion). Seriousely, I currently just finished \"world 6\", and the fith last level (if I remember correctly) lasted a good minute, the next level over in 10-15 seconds. \n\nOverall it is a nice challenging game, the challenge curve was a little to small for my taste as I havent died once untill towards world 3 but enjoy the challenge that the game is presenting to me right now. I rate this as \"recommended\" as I enjoy the gameplay, the music is a HUGE let down, considering this is a music game but still.

adrenaline fueled rollercoaster ride to hell.  \n\nNow that I've 100% the game's achievements I feel that I have enough knowledge of the game to review it.  First and foremost, playtime & difficulty.  It took me 9 hours to beat the base game and took 9 more hours to complete all levels with an S rank.  For the majority of players it should take you beyond that much time and may even take some less than that time.  I don't recommend the game for casuals as you'll die in two hits, there are ways that the player may choose to make the game easier but can still be hard to beat.  \n\nNext, the base game.  You'll boot up the game, choose the first level, get a quick tutorial of some of the basic and most important mechanics and will then start to get into some regular levels.  Even though most view a tutorial in games as bad I feel as if it's really important here since without it you may not be able to finish it and will get frustrated.  It's satisfying to hear the loud drum percussion of each wall, red bar, and blue ring and also provides the player a visual heads-up so they can plan their next move (as is with most rhythm games).  Each Level has a boss and an \"Omega\" final boss with sub-levels inbetween.  If you are struggling with a section it's always safe to hold spacebar and preemptively hold the arrow key of the wall that you're approaching, thump pads and red bars, and blue rings that appear on the track are optional and can be avoided in sub-levels.  However, the level boss and final boss have green thump pads which require you to hit each one in order to deal damage to the boss, if one is missed the level will loop until the player has either died or successfully hit every thump.  The final level is not only incredibly challenging and rewarding when you beat each section but also has one of the best endings of any games i've experienced this year, well worth the trip there.\n\nSecondly, S Ranks, and advanced moves.  S Ranks on sub-levels, boss, and final boss levels are reached by getting a large score percentage in each level, it's possible to miss some thump pads and get damaged on some walls and still beat a section with an S rank.  S Ranks are not easy, you'll have to replay a sub-level multiple times in order to achieve it but is an excellent challenge for those willing to attempt it.  Advanced  moves range from perfect turns, stomping, and kills.  Perfect turns are preformed by pressing the arrow key at the last possible moment before reaching the wall and is rewarded by a higher score and a satisfying sound effect.  As you start to feel the rhythm of the levels these will start to become easier to perform.  Stomping is achieved by pressing up and holding spacebar when reaching a thump pad and pressing down instead of spacebar when reaching another thump pad.  If your score multiplier is 2x or 3x (shown in the top right and plays a sound when reached)  The player will spawn a glowing thump pad which can restore your shield if you lost it and has a marginal difference in score gain then regular thump pads.  If you thump on a glowing thump pad in a sub-level the game will temporarily pause and spawn another thump pad, giving you a small amount of extra time to view the track so you can act accordingly to the enviornment. Tentacles growing on the track can actually be destroyed!  By stomping on any thump pad tentacles that are in front of you will be killed which both clears the screen giving you more vision of the track and adds to your score at the end (displayed by Kills x #).  \n\nLastly, issues and closing thoughts.  Two of my major gripes with the game is the lack of an option to display your score on the hud, and that [b][strike]you need to restart the level from the beginning if you get an A or worse while attempting the (All S Rank) challenge.  The game provides you with a quick restart button \"R\" which allows you to restart a sub-level but should provide the player with a way to re-do \"failed\" levels to not deliberately waste yout time and erase your progress.  This happened to me several times and would've completed every level with an S rank more quickly if the option to re-do levels was implemented.[/strike][/b] (SEE EDIT)  Overall I enjoyed beginning to end in the game, the game seems fairly linear and limited at first but will introduce new concepts and unique boss types/changing final boss that both challenge and interest the player.  I recommend the game particularly for those who are accustomed to and seek challenge and for those who would like to try a difficult game out.  Below is the S Rank for Level 9 for those interested (Spoiler warning)!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=784915834\n\nEDIT 11/4/2016: You can now restart from the previous sub-level if you get a score that's less than an S so I only have one gripe with the game now, it's a shame this change couldn't have come on launch day but it's a much appreciated and welcome change.

Would recommend to anyone who's into rhythm games.   \nHaving said that, there's some minor problems that you should keep in mind before buying.  \n\n- Thumper is designed around chasing highscores.   \nThe first reason is the way of \"clearing\" levels. You clear a level by reaching the next checkpoint, but this can be simply done by ignoring most of the objects and only avoiding real obstacles. All you need to do to progress, is to survive. This also applies to levels you'll face later on. Now of course this takes away the fun from a rhythm game and you wouldn't intentionally abuse this, but it will happen. \nThe second reason is the amount of playtime needed to finish the game. After 6 hours I completed the game and all that is left, is to chase highscores on each level.   \n   \n- Some levels don't scale logically.  \nThe beginning is easy, the end is hard. But inbetween you might struggle on one final boss and clear the next with ease. The same applies to consecutive parts of a level. I couldn't help but feel like some parts were just added as fillers or simply placed in the wrong level.  \n\nConsidering that some aspects of Thumper could use some more fine-tuning, I would still recommend the game as a whole.

Hac\u00eda ya un tiempo que no jugaba a algo que solo utilizara un bot\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n; todas las acciones r\u00edtmicas se llevan a cabo con las direcciones y un bot\u00f3n. Es tan simplista en mec\u00e1nicas que ni te lo tienen que explicar, enseguida entiendes el prop\u00f3sito.\n\nComo juego musical r\u00e1pidamente se conjuga con la acci\u00f3n: hay jefes, e incuso puedes matar fractales, tent\u00e1culos y trozos de escenario haciendo combos. No sabes en ning\u00fan momento si te est\u00e1s guiando por el sonido, por la vista, o por la memoria (o todo a la vez), pues el ensayo y el error es necesario, sobre todo, si queremos la S, puntuaci\u00f3n perfecta. Para este prop\u00f3sito existen checkpoints al final de cada peque\u00f1a fase o tramo. Hay 9 mundos subdivididos en fases, si mueres, reapareces al principio de esa fase. El objetivo es cruzar los aros intentando tomar bien las curvas, saltando los obst\u00e1culos, rompiendo aquellos que se puedan, pulsando tambi\u00e9n las luces del suelo, que son las que permiten que saltemos o matar a los jefes.\n\nEl juego adquiere un frenetismo y una exigencia muy alta ya a partir del mundo 6, a\u00f1adiendo hasta aqu\u00e9l reglas nuevas: cada mundo es como el anterior pero aprendiendo una nueva mec\u00e1nica, que se conjugar\u00e1n de foma endiablada ya por el final. Ojal\u00e1 bastase s\u00f3lo el o\u00eddo, esa es la mala noticia: Thumper no es un juego r\u00edtmico sin m\u00e1s. Es una aventura, una carrera donde la vista y los reflejos de tus pulgares es casi m\u00e1s importante que lo que se oye. \n\nLos jefes son una aut\u00e9ntica pasada: han creado un g\u00e9nero nuevo con esto. Para poder matarlos hay que hacer las secuencias correctamente hasta que aparezca el disparador. A los 4 golpes, el jefe muere. Tu escarabajo cibern\u00e9tico puede morir de dos simples golpes, pero podemos recuperarnos en ciertos puntos. M\u00e1s adelante luchar\u00e1s m\u00e1s por memorizar d\u00f3nde recuperarte que en hacer los tramos a la perfecci\u00f3n. En ese \u00e1mbito el juego suma m\u00e1s del triple y cu\u00e1druple de horas, a m\u00e1s exigente quieras ser, a m\u00e1s elegante quieras realizar tu partida, m\u00e1s horas te demandar\u00e1 Thumper.\n\nUna banda sonora contundente y que va dando pistas de los elementos que van a aparecer, ya que se basa en la m\u00fasica. Pero que no os enga\u00f1en; hay que tener mucho m\u00e1s \u00e9nfasis en lo que se ve que en lo que se oye. Con todo ello, un trabajo supremo.\n\nThumper es el juego de acci\u00f3n perfecto camuflado tras una propuesta mel\u00f3dica. Es un viaje psicod\u00e9lico y adrenal\u00ednico por el surrealismo, mundos fractales, geom\u00e9tricos y pesadillescos. No tengo muy claro si este juego surgi\u00f3 de un mal sue\u00f1o, pero parece tejido con elementos que dan bastante mal rollo.\n\nNo siempre se necesita algo cinematogr\u00e1fico para sorprender.

The weird part. The really, really crazy part.\n\nAnd it's beautiful.\n\n\nThe game can get tough, but it never seemed unfair, to me. I really enjoyed the challenge and now I'm planning to go through it all over again several time to master it... why? Because the flow of the game is amazing. It's a rollercoaster, in many ways... But it's hard to judge it when you have to restart some levels repeatedly. I'm curious about how it would feel to go through it in one single run. ... It might take a while, though.\n\n\nThe music is very interesting, and probably not something for your mp3. Brian Gibson has a \"noise rock\" band, which is... noisy? The game itself is what I would call \"noise classical\", perhaps? Know the discordant violins in horror movies? That's a big of part of this.\nThe other part is the industrial/metallic tribal percussion.\nIt's strange, but it's perfect for the game.\n\nThe visuals are also very abstract and metallic, but very beautiful, in parts. Something harmonious, sometimes discordant as well. And always very alien.\n\nThe \"feel\" of the game is some of the best I've seen in any game... ever?\nIt's that good. If you string combos together, your hits become very powerful, complementing the strange rhythm of the music with the rhythm of the level, which are not always \"cooperative\".\n\n\nI can't say much more about it, for now. But it's amazing!\nIf you're looking for a rhythm game in the vein of Guitar Hero or Stepmania, this is not at all for you. It's not about playing your own music... This game is its own beast. If you're not into its aesthetic (which I can imagine many people are not?), you will probably not enjoy the game very much... some people consider it all to blend together. I disagree, but I can see that happening, depending on what you're expecting. \n\nSo yeah. If the videos seem cool, definitely get it. There's a lot more to the game than shown in the videos due to the visceral feeling and impact of the game.\n\nSo good!\n\n\n\nP.S.: I've now beaten the game twice, to see how much it would change. On general terms, there's definitely replayability without wanting to climb the leaderboards. This is because you can still play the previous levels in a very different way by using the new mechanics that you didn't know when you first did the levels.\nThis can make some levels far, far, harder. But also much more satisfying! It's really cool to see how levels were designed in different ways depending on how much of the game you've played before.\n\nThe scoring system is also more complex than it first seemed.\n\nThere's a basic C-B-A-S \"rank\" for each sub-level, and then calculated for the full level. These mostly depend on your misses. S being for missing no \"Thump\".\nYou can't replay specific levels, at the moment, but you can restart the sub-level that you're playing. This means that you have to play the whole level from start to finish to get these rankings, but you can restart each one as much as you'd like before moving on.\n\nThe scoring, which will get you on the leaderboards, is where the real game is.\nFor these, restarting carries a penalty. So, to reach the top, you need to play every sub-level in a row, as well as you can, without restarting to get the optimal score for each one. It's a marathon, more so than a sprint.\n\nI can see this being a somewhat controversial system, but I like it. It's the hardcore way to play the game, and I'm glad that there is one, rather than seeing how restarts the most.\n\nFor the score, you have to study the levels, somewhat, because of the \"stomp\" mechanic. On 2 consecutives Thumps, you can use the first to fly, and stomp the second for extra points. This is even more important in boss fights, where you're awarded multipliers for stomping the final thump (sorry for this vocabulary haha).\n\nAside from that, there are the riskier plays of trying to make a perfect curve, etc. (to get a perfect, you have a much narrower window to turn -- otherwise, you're dead).\n\nIt makes it much more interesting, choosing when to play aggressively or not, trying to get a good score. \n\n\nThere's quite a bit of depth for those looking to climb leaderboards, so that's definitely another plus!\n\n\nP.S.2: Consistency is way more important than I realized before. Each consecutive level you beat without a Miss gives up a 1+ multiplier. The same for No Damage levels. So your score really gets out of control if you can avoid missing/damage for many consecutive levels. It's good to keep the competition high!\n\nOne kinda big problem I have, though, has to do with the \"game feel\". I really like the whole impact the game conveys, but I think it takes a step too far by slowing down the game too much for give a very high impact in a long combo. This slow down actually throws me off completely, sometimes, because the rhythm breaks in these situations. So... you're expecting a certain obstacle at a certain time, but the tempo slows down a lot and then speeds up again. \nIt leads to a rather inconsistent rhythm when you're actually doing great!\nWhich is a negative. Sure, it makes it harder to do perfect runs, but it essentially punishes good play? I would much rather have a lower impact in these long combos, but be able to keep the \"flow\", so to speak.", "timestamp_created": 1476627119, "timestamp_updated": 1477582235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577419", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26069802": {"recommendationid": "26069802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123273463", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503274124}, "language": "english", "review": "have u ever tried to take some xtc before going on a rollercoaster?", "timestamp_created": 1476625410, "timestamp_updated": 1476625410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26068293": {"recommendationid": "26068293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000215647", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482869785}, "language": "french", "review": "\"Tak taktak tak tak\"\nConcentre toi.\n\"Tak taktak tak tak\"\nImpr\u00e8gne-toi de la musique.\n\"Tak taktak tak tak\"\nTu as les mains tremp\u00e9s de sueur, enchainant les manoeuvres pour progresser.\n\"Tak taktak tak tak\"\nChaque touche appuy\u00e9e est une percussion en plus. \n\"Tak... tak... tak tak tak... tak...\"\nTout d\u00e9file \u00e0 toute vitesse, tellement vite que tu es surpris d'arriver \u00e0 suivre le rythme.

Thge gameplay itself is good, really good. The problem lays in the structure surrounding the good gameplay, the way they handled the gamedesign here.\nAlso i dont get why people call it rythm based, because i cant see that.\nIt is \"rythmic\", as in when you press the buttons at the right time it give sounds that make the game music sound rythmic, but its not really rythm based in a way that a track is played and you press the buttons in a way to reflect the music. \nMeans, i couldnt find a good connection between the games music and the gameplay. Its not that there are beats or so when you have to press a button, its also not that you can try to listen to the music/sound and then find the best pace or pressing. So you have to rely alot on visual feedback, more so than on rythmic feedback. But because the game often is not only overloaded visually but also doesnt even show you what will come for the next 2 seconds and you have to do a hectic button press and hope for the best, this can cause problems.\nIn the end its not rythm based, but rather rythmic.\nThe visual overload can cause other problems aswell.\nFor example it suffers from a known problem of when you mess up one time you can throw the run often into the bin. You have two lifes in this game, so you can mess up once and also get the chance of regaining (health). But messing up once often just causes that you lose entirely.\n\nThis is supported by a large degree of graphical effects thrown at the player, together with narrowed viewpoints and two weird black fields that limit the screen on the bottom (i have no idea why they are there) and you can forget your second life instantly when you messed up once.\n\nPositive:\n- Fresh idea\n- nice gameplay overall\n- deep enough, although sometimes a bit too overloaded with stuff\n- nice visuals, although at points too many effects and a weird narrow view that i dont really like and seems to not serve any purpose\n- nice music \n\nNegative, i explained some bad points already, but this might be interesting aswell:\n- not content rich, i miss different modes, especially an endless mode or a mode where you do all the levels mixed together in a different order, or a boss run.\n- sometimes too effect heavy\n- a bit bad camera view, especially narrowed by some black fields that have no point and can be very annoying\n- its not rythm based, only a bit rythmic. You will mostly only realize that with stepping a bit behind the system.\n- sometimes levels become frustrating, when obstacles are only spammed at you it gets a bit tedious and annoying instead of \"hard\".\n- music becomes a bit onesided after a while. \nI fear it suffers a bit from not having a \"play your own track\" mode with trackgeneration.\n\nBut now the worst point, which pressed me to give it a negative rating although i had it on positive before and explains a bit the surrounding structure that covers the good gameplay in a horrible mess of design of progression and options:\nYou cant do a highscore run and get an S rating on every section without playing the level completely as a whole from the start. You just cant select a single section and play that (although they are there and also visible, you cant select them though). \nThats extremely bad design and a bad decision. And the worst, you cant even set back to a previous section WHILE doing the level. \nMeans, you do a section, lets say the second last section of the first level, you felt you did good and it was enough points-wise? \nYou reach the goal of that section (a gate on the track) and hit the A button to gather the last point and lock the section behind you, then the points summarize and you see you got an A or even just a B for example. \nWell, yeah then your whole run was worthless, even though you had an S rating on the 20 sections before the last one. \nOh you think you can press the start button and press \"load from last checkpoint\" so you get back to the start of the section and try it again? No, screw you player, you cant. \nWhen you gathered the last point and the summarize appears showing you your rating, the game treats it as finished and the \"restart from last checkpoint\" will only set you to the start of the next section (the last one in our example). Doesnt make much sense. Its not really a point of being easy if you could select a single section anyway.\n\nThe developers decided it was a good idea to not show you your rating until you cant turn back and restart it. And the real thing is, level 1 for example is basically easy, but even with practice you will screw up there sometimes. And the first level only has about 15 sections. \nLater levels will be 5 times as hard and have 25 or so sections. \nAgain, you screw up once, you have to do it again. \nWe talk about possibly an hour of investment here sometimes. So you can be perfect in the first 24 sections, when you screw up only one button press in the last one and you didnt realize your points werent enough to get you an S ranking, you can do it all over again. \nThats tedious bullshit. \nWhy not let me do single sections or a part of a level?\n\nThis ties in with another problem the game has. It might give you many different gameplay elements, but only in pieces. Means you start the game with the first level, teaching you how to press A and do turns in curves. \nThen level 2 teaches you a new element like flying, the next level teaches you the element of lanes and laneswapping. \nAnd so on. \nWhen you reached level 5 you have quite an arsenal of different things you can do on a track. Problem is, all the levels/section up to that point are not designed for the gameplay elements that come after them.\nMeans, Level 1 doesnt have any lane sections, doesnt have flying or whatever else. So it is limited to only doing the first basic things.\n\nWhen you reach a point in the game where it becomes interesting, its already 50% beaten. \nAnd the real problem i have with that, that there are modes missing that have all the elements in them. \nWhen i want the full experience of the game, its worthless to play the first 4 tutorial levels, as they dont have all the elements combined in them. \nThats limiting. \nAnd there are quite some nice sections in the levels. \nBut they are so short or basically so easy, that it becomes boring fast.\nI will finish the 8 levels in the game (yeah, 50% of those are basically tutorials focussing on one element) and then wait until they get new modes into it. \nI thought i could also complete the achievements and reach an S ranking for each level, but seriously, i value my time more and instead play something else, as not being able to select single sections becomes already tedious for the first 2 (the easiest) levels. \nAnd the fact that screwing up only once meaning all my time investment was worth nothing, gives me the impression that the game doesnt value my time.\n\nResum\u00e9e: Sadly a good game not valueing my time enough with throwing BS design decisions at me and even taking on the challenge doesnt feel satisfying but rather annoying or frustrating. Theres nothing to unlock, i fear, content is baren and not really there now. \nIt lacks modes and levels, especially some infinite or customized content. \nAnd at the time as the gameplay becomes interesting, its already over for 50% as the earlier levels arent designed for later gameplay elements (which makes no sense for me, they still could have included later elements there for players that want to use them for some score ranking).\n\nWould have been better to have one tutorial level introducing all the gameplayelements and then have the rest contain all of it, instead of delivering it piece by piece.\nSome sections are really nice to play and fun and cool to look at. But i dont want to spend 20 minutes to reach that point because they happen to be in the last third of a level.", "timestamp_created": 1476461078, "timestamp_updated": 1476468253, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411123", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26028437": {"recommendationid": "26028437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013283113", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1515718747}, "language": "english", "review": "Most intense and unrelenting gaming experience you can have TODAY.", "timestamp_created": 1476449744, "timestamp_updated": 1476449744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26027188": {"recommendationid": "26027188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095329373", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506820960}, "language": "french", "review": "Ma meilleure exp\u00e9rience de l'ann\u00e9e 2016 tout jeu confondu.

The track you follow is the music sheet, and the player character is the visual marker signifying when notes should be played. Controls are very simple; a directional input and one button. You have 4 actions at your disposal, meaning there are 4 types of \"note\" to play in time with the music, these actions are: \n\nThump - press the [Action] button when a glowing marker aligns with your character.\n\nSmash - hold the [Action] button when faced with a set of barriers on the track.\n\nTurn - press the [Action] button + a directional input at the moment your character encounters a turn.\n\nFly - pressing an upward directional input + the [Action] button on any note marker will launch your character into the air, where it can fly for a brief period. If you press a downward directional input while flying, you will activate an Aerial Stomp.\n\nBasic scoring is determined by how accurately you enter the appropriate input when you meet a \"note\" on the song sheet, with a multiplier accumulating for long periods of perfect inputs and no mistakes. The beauty of this game lies in the arrangement of the \"notes\" and the behaviours they encourage from the player; you only have a small number of actions at your disposal but you must make expert use of combinations of these actions in order to survive the courses.\n\nWhere things get really clever is when you incorporate the Aerial Stomp into your game. Any \"note\" marker can be used to trigger flight, once in the air you can then Stomp downwards onto the next \"note\" of the course, the resulting shockwave is capable of breaking barriers, awarding health pick-ups and awards more points than a ground Thump alone. Once you get the hang of this mechanic, you start to think about and tackle the game's courses in a completely different way, constantly working out how best to maximise points.\n\nWith online leaderboards and an absolutely gorgeous audio visual aesthetic, this is a game I can see myself playing for a great deal of time to come.", "timestamp_created": 1476374696, "timestamp_updated": 1476375109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537856", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26013830": {"recommendationid": "26013830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096949689", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485333337}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u597d\u7279\u4e48\u7d27\u5f20\uff0c\u6bd4\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u4e0b\u7247\u8fd8\u7d27\u5f20\u3002\n\n\u624b\u75bc\uff0c\u55ef\uff0c\u6309\u7a7a\u683c\u952e\u6309\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1476371968, "timestamp_updated": 1476371968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600517", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26012024": {"recommendationid": "26012024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066954820", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506563802}, "language": "english", "review": "Thumper is a very demanding game. It's a test of timing and patience. Despite the steep difficulty curve in the latter half of the game, nothing about the challenges was truly \"unfair,\" not even the laser rings which penalize (and damage) you for missing beats. Suddenly requiring perfection during a sequence may seem a bit extreme at first, but if anything, it's encouraging you to do your best. During tough sequences and boss fights, I saw and knew what it was that I had to do--I simply had to do it right, even if it meant dying multiple times. Trial-and-error became commonplace for me after a while, but it was never as though the game was throwing something impossible at me. Taking damage and dying can ruin the flow of the game, but again, that's just another reason to try harder.\n\nOne criticism--the closest thing to a negative--would be that, even though the game's visuals are slick, stylish, and great to look at, sometimes there CAN be too many visual effects happening on-screen to be able to focus on what's coming ahead. One or two bosses are practically exploding with color and bloom lighting, sometimes obscuring a fair amount of the oncoming track. It's tough to anticipate the red bars indicating turns when the boss is flashing red, as well.\n\nThe layout of obstacles in these levels will always be the same (meaning replay value will REALLY vary from person to person), so you won't see any sudden variation when revisiting them, but at least you'll have some familiarity when coming back to them to go for higher ranks and scores.\n\nMost importantly, quality headphones or a home theater system are a must, not just for the sake of enjoying the music, but also for being able to clearly hear the backing instrumentation and sound cues indicating upcoming obstacles, so you'll be ready to take them on.", "timestamp_created": 1476363636, "timestamp_updated": 1476363636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593599", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26011753": {"recommendationid": "26011753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080468617", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514407386}, "language": "english", "review": "You should just play it already.

Some people have complained that this is not a true rhythm game since it will sometimes throw unconventional patterns at you that seemingly don't conform to any meaningful musical beats, but for me, that is just a way of keeping players on their toes rather than simply memorizing everything. My only real gripe is that the visual and sonic chaos will sometimes drown everything else out, making it super hard to decode what's actually happening, but even so, my overall opinion stands.

However, with that mentality, there are two major flaws that get in the way of going for those achievements.\n\nFirstly, a checkpoint pad counts as a hit, and if you miss it, you get an A rank for that segment and cannot go back unless you restart the whole level.\n\nSecondly, why oh why is the restart checkpoint option in the menu so many button presses to reach? Devs, players ARE going to play the game just trying to S rank using resets, so just make it easier for us please?\n\nClearly the game is meant to be digested in one continuous run focused more on overall score, so I'm going to do that moving forwards and come back for S ranks, as resetting a dozen times for one segment certainly becomes a bit mind-numbing.\n\nI can't even imagine how much more difficult things will get after Level 3...", "timestamp_created": 1476344834, "timestamp_updated": 1476344834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26009005": {"recommendationid": "26009005", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983402898", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510306957}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say?

That\u2019s all you really need to know, but it\u2019s not all I\u2019m going to tell you. The game would never allow me to get away with such a modest descriptor. It\u2019s more appropriate to speak in intangibles. Thumper is anxiety. It is restlessness, wretchedness, abjection, pain, failure\u2014and ultimately, hope and triumph. It\u2019s a reflection of everything about yourself that you hope to never face, laid bare in the dark light of Hell. It\u2019s what Franz Kafka might dream up if he met Trent Reznor and they invented their own programming language.  \n\nIt\u2019s a damn fine video game, and I urge you to use this critique as a jumping-off point to do your own investigation (i.e. buy the hell out of it).\n\nThumper represents the next logical evolution in what rhythm games can (and should) be.

Don't buy the soundtrack. It's quite simply not worth it unless you're into \"ambient landscape\" where the whole appeal of the music relies on the samples(and even for ambient landscape it's not that good). Other than \"Beetle\", the last and only good track on the album alongside \"Triangle\", nothing has any redeeming musical quality besides really crisp sounds - which for me personally isn't quite enough to listen to it.\n\nNow about the game:\n\nThe game is very \"raw\". Everything has a very \"raw\" metallic feeling to it. It's not at all \"floaty\" relative to the ever changing background; instead it actually feels quite fast and threatening in it's own unusual way. The game is very short. I've just completed level 2, and there're like 11 or so? I'd say around 6/7 hours gameplay given the last few stages aren't frustratingly difficult. Is the game \"hard\"? Yes and no. It's really managable to get past everything, but quite a challenge to do so whilst maintaining proper \"grades\"(each level consists of several checkpoints, inbetween each you get a \"grade\").\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple, you use a combination of the keys and spacebar. No pointers there, it's kindof what I expected.\n\nOverall the game is quite unique, it has a very strange atmosphere to it. It's smooth as silk, the soundtrack is good(ingame is a whole different thing than buying the actual tracks outside of it; where all of it seems just...pretty bland), the game looks \"okay\" if you're into it's style. It's pretty fun to play. Biggest downside is is that the price is somewhat steep for what it actually offers.", "timestamp_created": 1476206848, "timestamp_updated": 1476208864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464355", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25984970": {"recommendationid": "25984970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038711801", "num_games_owned": 715, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476153043}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun rhythm game... but It's not my kind of rhythm game. I don't normally write reviews, but I think I have to since I was looking forward to this game for a while. First, you have to understand that when they say it's a rhyhtm game it really is just that. I played for 45 minutes and only heard rhyhtms and no actual music *FROM WHAT I'VE PLAYED*. Maybe it gets actual music later, but the lack of an actual melody or anything of the sort just turned me off. Second, It feels very repetative. It's fun and difficult but it feels like you're doing the samething over and over with more or less the same background. Yes the background does change, but not all that much. I think the concept of this game was good and will probably appeal to a lot of people, but I just couldn't get into it at all which is sad since I'm a big fan of rhythm games.

Man sieht \u00c4hnlichkeiten, ja, aber bei Thumper spielt man nicht seine eigene Musik, sondern die schon vorgegebene. Das ist schon einmal der st\u00e4rkste Unterschied. Noch dazu sind Fehler fatal. Pro Stage kannst du dir max. 2 Fehler erlauben, au\u00dfer du schaffst es, ein besonderes Gameplay-Element zu benutzen, um deine \"R\u00fcstung\" wiederzubekommen. Noch dazu f\u00fchlt es sich nicht wie ein Spiel an, indem man wie bei Audiosurf einfach eine Strecke generiert zur ausgew\u00e4hlten Musik abf\u00e4hrt. In Thumper macht die Strecke teilweise auch die Musik. Taucht eine Kurve auf, h\u00f6rt man das, taucht ein Ring auf, h\u00f6rt man das und das mit allen anderen Objekten auch. Das zusammen mit der stimmigen Grundmelodie ergibt den finalen Soundtrack. F\u00fcr mich ist Thumper eher ein Abenteuer als eine einfache Fahrt auf dem Soundtrack.\n\n\n+(23.11.2016) Da ein neuer Spielmodus hinzugef\u00fcgt wurde, f\u00fcge ich meine Meinung dazu noch hier rein. Der neue Modus ist f\u00fcr die, die sich selbst noch einmal testen wollen.

Each beat leaves you wondering if you're being punched in the gut or dealing said blow. The soundtrack instills a sense of imminent doom, as if you're fleeing from a serial killer... until you realize [i] you're [/i] the theat. \n\nGameplay operates much in the same manner as Rhythm Heaven, with each note type having a cue that precedes your input by a measure. The result is that by a few levels in, you're forced to be looking at and listening for the note's you'll be playing moments in the future as you input the controls for those you observed moments ago.

If you like either, or if you're curious, dig in. Gameplay, environment, and cue are intense and relentless, but they also make it feel satisfying. Don't play if you have motion sickness or get frustrated.[/i]\n\nBought it full price tonight (an hour after it was released), played for five hours straight and got through four and a half \"levels.\" Thoughts so far. \n\nThis is a rhythm game for people who hate the cheery cliches of rhythm games, and an action game for rhythm game players who hate the clutter of action games. If you don't like rhythm games nor action games, pass on this one, because you'll just have a bad time. And if you don't like AudioSurf, maybe you should pass, but it's not just \"copying AudioSurf.\" It's an action game that looks like AudioSurf from the surface. It's more oppressive, more hectic, and overall more satisfying. \n\nIf you're willing to make the dive, consider Thumper less of an \"innovation\" on the [i]rhythm and music[/i] genre as much as it is on the [i]action[/i] genre. Yet, that makes it even more interesting. Like, imagine the most intense boss battle music you can think of. Now, imagine [i]becoming that music.[/i] In other words, it's less that you're [i]playing[/i] the song and more that you're [i]acting as[/i] the song, or maybe the song's acting as [i]you?[/i] That's what Thumper is. Because Thumper on its own could be another action game, but they incorporated rhythm game features, and in doing it so well, that mentality becomes most of the experience of this game. I might expand more on my own in a more extensive talk/review about what this means and why I love it, and I'll update here if I do, but that's the gist of it.\n\nFrom here, I'll just do a bare-bones review of the game's major mechanics/gameplay points. \n\n[b]PROS:[/b] \n\n[list]\n[*] Easy to learn. Not disgustingly hard to master. Extremely intuitive once you get the hang of it. But I'm only in level five and I've given up for the night so we'll see how that holds out.  \n\n[*] The soundtrack is intense. Like I said, it feels like a giant boss battle, except you [i]are[/i] the music. \n\n[*] Extremely responsive environment and interface. The game has excellent non-verbal audio-visual cues that make every hit feel so satisfying while making you regret just \"scraping by.\" With every hit, you add to what you hear, and that's an extremely fulfilling part of this game, as much as completing stages and levels and beating your own scores. \n\n[*] Rewards rhythm game mechanics and instincts, without forcing you to feel like it's a rhythm game. If you're a rhythm game player, you'll get what I mean when you get into it. If not, you'll hear what I mean as you tap your keyboard/controller.  \n\n[*] Extremely addicting. Once you start, you just keep going. \n[/list] \n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n(I know there are as many \"cons\" as \"pros\" but they're extremely minor -- consider it constructive criticism rather than \"reasons why this game isn't worth your time.\") \n\n[list]\n[*] [b]If you have motion sickness issues or can't handle \"psychedelic\" aesthetic, take a pass. Warning you now.[/b] \n\n[*] The music and rhythmic style gets over its own head sometimes, which is sorta expected from such a heavy industrial percussion-ambiance style of music. Some stages are extremely difficult to follow rhythmically, which is an issue, given it's a rhythm game, coming from a rhythm game nerd. You can survive just on visual cues alone, but as a rhythm game, this becomes a frustration. \n\n[*] The game's tighter \"tunnel\" points are unnecessarily and annoyingly difficult -- that is, it's difficult to see the next part coming often, especially when the environment causes parts to blend in. You will NOT finish the game without dying at least a few times. \n\n[*] They really don't instruct you on things. Again. Do not expect to go through this game without dying a few times. There will be [i]a lot[/i] of trial-and-error. \n\n[*] Needs an audio-visual calibration system. Badly. \n[/list] \n\nOne note that's extremely neutral is that the game doesn't punish you until about halfway through for \"just getting by.\" That is, it doesn't detract if you aren't doing perfect combos of the square taps, except in boss battles. I'm split between whether this is a good or bad thing for the game, but as a player, you can absolutely tell the game gets irritated for being lazy. \n\nAlso, it feels intense as hell. If that's not your thing, skip it; if so, go wild. \n\nBasically, the gameplay is perfect, the execution isn't, you know? Like, they have a system perfected, but it gets a little bit over itself sometimes.

Holding or releasing the button alters your trajectory in each of these planes, effecting creating eight \"lanes\" for you to navigate at a given time.  Obstacles spring up to the beat and require you to be in a certain lane to avoid them, forcing you to navigate a treacherous, high-speed path through a psychedelic wonderland.

This means I've gone through everything that this game has with an S rank.\n>I still also maintain the opinion that this game is not musical enough, and that you can not predict the thumps by sound alone. The BPMs are too low for any consistent rhythm for the most part. You react a lot more to what you see than what you hear. And for the sake of it I played the game on mute for a while and not much was lost in terms of performance.\n>I double down on the visual aspects getting in the way of the gameplay argument. The midboss in stage 7 is definetly the hardest part in the game to get an S rank at solely because the visual clutter and the spins are just too much for you to make out what you're supposed to do. To pass it with an S rank I just memorized the pattern and did it by memory. That's not a rhythm game.\n>I still also think the walls are a bad mechanic. At some point I just learned that the best strat is to buffer all the turns unless the ones in which perfect turns are absolutetly necessary.\n>Yes. I am aware that walls do have a callsign, but the fact that I wasn't able to notice it at first shows how much this callsign blend in when compared to others.\n>The restart button was added a while back. I'm aware.\n>The new mode seems tacked-on and pointless to me. It does not add the replayability a rhythm game needs.\n\n\nThe visuals are amazing, but this game lacks the tightness of an actual rhythm game.\n\n-The charts are weird:\nThe notes are constantly spread too far apart. It almost feels disconected from the song at some points.\nIt also makes inconsistent decisions in terms of being in syncopation or not.\nAnd because of that you start to rely in visual reaction for timings instead of using the beat of the song.\n\n-The visuals get in the way of the game:\nIn some levels, you go through tunnels that hides the obstacles ahead, which just doesn't feel like a fair challenge. Specially for S curves in succession.\n\n-Walls make you play off-beat:\nThe walls are probably my biggest gripe with this game at the moment.\nUnlike the other obstacles, walls have no audio cue to them when they spawn. I don't see why, it's inconsistent.\nTurning at the perfect beat rewards you with a perfect turn, which is what you want, but the game is too harsh on lateness for these, while presenting no punishment other than no bonus score for being early.\nThis makes going for perfect turns too risky, so you go early. But at this point your not on beat, and isn't this a rhythm game?\n\n-No quick restart button:\nThis is a minor point, but as a rhythm game player, I want o S everything. So restarting is something that I want to be doing a lot. I don't see why this game doesn't have this feature.\n\nThis game had a cool idea, but the 4 button game underneath it doesn't feel very good to play.", "timestamp_created": 1476158066, "timestamp_updated": 1478966539, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682114", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25976905": {"recommendationid": "25976905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028425712", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476588023}, "language": "english", "review": "Thumper is loud, intense, stressful, uncomfortable, and above all, fun.\n\nThe music and visuals tell you something is wrong, there are writhing mechanical tenticals, dark industrial music, and a huge fucking head that grows bigger spikes every time you kill it. And you see all this out of the corner of your eye as you fly down the beetle superhighway. However, sometimes there's a break, where nothing happens to you for about 30 seconds, and you get to sit back and just take it all in. \n\nAnd then the music starts again.\n\nThe gameplay is chaotic and complex. For using only one button and the joystick, there are a suprising amount of mechanics that you have to worry about. It's very intense and almost stressful, and more than once I found myself hunched over my controller gritting my teeth in concentration. Take the time for a deep breath every now and then.\n\nThe difficulty is very interesting. The game doesn't have a difficulty setting, like easy, medium, or hard. Instead, the game is only as hard as how good you want to be at the game. There is a score system involving hitting consecutive beats and performing combos that is very hard to pull off perfectly. However, if you just want to survive, you don't have to hit a single beat all the way to the boss. Although, just because you can skip the beats doesn't mean it will be a walk in the park.\n\nWhen I quit the game for the first time, still on the main menu, there was only one thing going through my mind. \"I can't wait to play this game again.\"\n\nThis game's value goes much further than the $20 price tag.

Sharp, colorful, and absolutely stunning to look at in motion. Screenshots don't do this game justice.\n\n-Soundtrack, Grab some headphones, crank up the bass, put that volume up to 100%, and feel the POWER.\n\n-Gameplay, Simple controls, simple mechanics taught at the beginning of each level, but don't confuse simple with easy in practice. Once the game ramps up and the music gets more intense, you'll be forgetting your lefts from your rights and smashing into everything in no time. Very difficult, but so damn rewarding when you hit max rank on each level.\n\n-VR Support, While i haven't tried it(Don't own a Rift or a Vive) just the thought of playing this in VR makes me as giddy as a schoolgirl.\n\nThe MEH:\n\n-Price. Now after playing it, i'm absolutely happy with my purchase and will probably buy the soundtrack, BUT 20 bucks is a bit to ask of some people when comparing it to other games that are a bit more deep than this at a similar price. Its a minor gripe but i believe this wont have any problems selling a ton of copies.\n\nOverall, I expected this to be different, a little indie game that looked neat but would be dusted away in the mess of games released every day. But woah...im so glad i pulled the trigger and got it.

I do enjoy the game, but here are a few things to keep in mind before you buy it:\n\n- The game is very visually noisy. I found my attention directed more to the screen than to the beat of the music. Hard for me to call it a Rhythm game based off this.\n\n- When you take damage, and you will take damage, the game freaks out, throwing colors and effects at you and making it very difficult to see where you are or what you are doing at the moment. You gain a little bit of invulnerability when you take a hit, but when you are trying to hit something and you suddenly can no longer see it at all, the game takes a much more un-fun turn.\n\n- The beats are there, but sometimes with so much noise happenign around you it is hard to keep track of it. I find myself constantly losing the beat of the music, and unable to hear the music very well due to concentration on what is in front of me, and the growing sound effects from everything.\n\n- I've never once felt like anything I do, any light I hit or move I do was in sync with the music. There are times I notice that I do something and it coincides with a beat, but most of the time I'm ignoring the beat because it serves little purpose when things I can't see until they pop in are coming at me  from around a corner.\n\n- It's nearly impossible to look ahead because most of the time you cant see anything until it is about half a second in front of you. This makes it very difficult to predict what is next, so some parts of levels you have to beat purely by dying over and over until you have muscle memory.\n\n- The music is very abstract, and the tunes are often hard for me to follow, and I almost always very quickly give up on keeping the beat. \n\nDespite these gripes of mine, I enjoy the game a lot. It's difficult, and i wish the music had more of a presence and afferct on the actual gameplay. But it's a good game. If you're looking for a twitch reflex action game, I'd recommend it. If you are looking for a purely rhythmic game, this might not be the right one for you. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1476152173, "timestamp_updated": 1476152173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631918", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25976015": {"recommendationid": "25976015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042539144", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498943358}, "language": "english", "review": "A very different and unnerving take on rythm gams - wildly gripping", "timestamp_created": 1476151568, "timestamp_updated": 1476151568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25975944": {"recommendationid": "25975944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047400875", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476762182}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game I have always wanted and no other game has done it correctly.

It's not overly difficult, the soundtrack doesn't have much variety, the control scheme is basic - however the game pushes the genre in other ways. The soundtrack, visuals and actual gameplay all feel unique and interesting, a game that fleshes out the genre in a welcome way.\n\nInstead of hitting the right keys on expected notes and beats, like Guitar Hero style games, or learning patterns and practising specific songs for hours, like Osu or Beatmania style games, this game has a consistent soundtrack with specific audio cues notifying you when a certain type of obstacle is going to come up. If you hear a clap, you turn. If you hear hefty bass, you're jumping. These audio cues are outside of the soundtrack, however, and it feels ever-so-slightly jarring and takes you out of the game a little. Think of it like a one-man audience alongside the soundtrack and that's the person you've got to listen to.\n\nThis might seem simplistic at the face of it, but when you're hitting those maneuvers your character is also making sound and, in some cases, it's specifically planned out so that the sound of your character masks the sound of what's coming. You learn to use both your eyes and ears independantly to figure out what's waiting for you, and the game punishes you for failure. 2 tries and you're out.\n\nGiven all of the priase, and also the thumb up, you might think that I'm telling you that you should buy it. However, at \u00a316 this game feels lackluster. It's a unique take on the genre, changing pretty much everything you expect, but realistically it doesn't push much further. I don't believe that there's a challenge mode, there's no variety game-modes, it's just the levels you get given and there aren't many at that.\n\nLike I said at the start, if you're into the genre and want to see a different view of it, I do think this is the game for you but at this pricetag it's hard to recommend outside of that. If it interests you I'd recommend picking it up and playing through the first few levels - if it isn't for you, you can simply refund it. I've rated it up because I believe that it's a good game, price tag excluded.\n\nNote: The reviews in the video on the Steam page hype it up to be more than it is. There's nothing \"existentially dreadful\" about the game, nothing \"terrifying\". It's good, but come on.\n\nAlso note: I've not completed the game, yet.

It lacks sub-frame input detection and it's missing any kind of delay calibration, features which come standard in most rhythm games (even free ones). Then again, Thumper isn't really a rhythm game, at least not in the traditional sense. Most of the challenge comes from having to react extremely quickly as similar-looking obstacles come barreling towards you. Occasionaly I was killed without really knowing why, only to later discover that a projectile I was supposed to be avoiding happened to be the exact same color as the track.\n\nThe mechanics create a constant feeling of uncertainty, because the main button must be held down to perform many of the game's actions, yet at the same time you are frequently required to tap the button to hit the bars that come down the track. This means you're constantly second-guessing yourself about if you should be keeping it held down or not. Some people might find this to be valuble gameplay, but to me it broke the flow of the game and made it more stressful than fun.\n\nThe atmosphere created by the game is dark and forboding, which is an appreciated change of pace from the neon colored-rave that many rhythm games (there's that term again) seem stuck in. Unfortunately, it's largely this one note the whole way though (at least as far as I got), and the various stages seem almost indistinguishable from each other. Sometimes there are long, unskippable stretches where literally nothing happens, as if you're supposed to be so enraptured by whatever weird tentacle tunnel thing is ahead of you that you'll forget that there's nothing to do.\n\nI wouldn't say Thumper is a bad game. I wouldn't even say it's a badly made game. I would, and will, however, say that it isn't nearly good enough to justify the current $20 price tag, given its simplistic gameplay, embarassingly baren settings menu, and lack of variety.\n\nBy the way, if you play on KB+M, I highly reccomend that you try mapping one of the mouse buttons to the main action instead of the spacebar. Unfortunately, you'll need to use third party software to do this, because the game doesn't allow mapping to mouse clicks.

It's a weird mix between Guitar Hero/Rockband, your typical mobile running game, and some kind of Lovecraftian horror mixed in there.\n\nYou play as a little beetle, and your goal is to reach the end of the track. There are obstacles you must overcome, such as little barriers and sudden turns and even boss fights. It builds this odd dread without even really doing much. The closer to the end you get, the more it starts to feel like you shouldn't be there and that something is watching.\n\nIt doesn't hold your hand. It forces you to have to keep up. If you get lost, well, the music doesn't carry you too far outside of simple percussion. That's right, you're the one responsible for the melody. Everything you do, every turn, Thump and barrier broken makes a sound that adds to the symphony of organized chaos.\n\nYou do battle a recurring boss that evolves after each defeat, and my god does it evolve. \n\nAll in all, I gotta say, this game is something else.

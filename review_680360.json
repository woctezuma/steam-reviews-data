I am not a fan of dwarves (sorry, I am an elf at heart) and I adore pixel art games thanks to growing up with games such as Monkey Island. Despite my bias on dwarves I found this game to be (in it's current Early Access state) quite enjoyable in it's raw function and form. That is to say the premise of the game has promise.\n\nThe controls are a little akward in their default stage, but can be altered to fit your personal comfort. The User Interface is refined in some areas and lacking in others. (White on light colors can be hard to read.) The game play itself is fairly simple and strait forward. Even so it leaves room for a sense of self in terms of what you build/upgrade and when. There is no linear path (that I could tell) that you are forced to travel and you are free to explore at your own pace.\n\nIt turned out to be a fairly relaxing game.

The enemy have a tendency to zerg you and if you kite then you kill 90%. \n- Some decisions, let me explain: There's a tavern, you can play a \"game in this place... it's a completely time waster mouse clicking game, why is it a con? because you actually upgadre important stuff in your camp if you play it so get ready to spend a lot of time clicking (or download a fast clicker)\n- tutorial and some keybinds. This one is minor, the game is not that complicated and you can rebind your controls.\n\nPro\n- Great idea, there is exploration and sense of discovery\n\n- Upgrading your character and camp feels very satisfying\n\n- Combat (i know, pro and con at the same time), reflect a fireball was just epic! the stealth mechanic is not half bad.\n\n- Not only a great concept the execution is going very well.

New content usually arrives at a weekly pace, including new locations to explore, additional enemies to slay and interesting items to slay with / help with the slaying.

Combat requires a little bit of strategy, which is great, and the game is extremely difficult early on but it pays off. I enjoyed the town building and resource gathering elements, however it becomes clear pretty quickly which resources you end up using the most and some times those can be hard to get a hold of, especially in the case of the food resource which is scarce and gets used up quickly trying to uncover parts of the map. it is a little frustrating to use the food resource to uncover new levels only to find the levels hadn't been added into the game yet, although since it's under development I'm mostly grumpy about having to wait. Overall I'd say the game is a lot of fun and easy to get sucked into, but resource management needs a bit of work and difficulty levels fluctuate very heavily between levels, some are much too easy and some take multiple retries.

The further the town the more it costs (kind of obvious). Once you unlock that part of the map it is free to travel to the nodes at any time.

So far i've only played a melee character where i am using a shield and a melee weapon. Cutting down enemies left and center. Though the games difficulty increases dramatically as the more damage you take the less you can sustain. If you take no major injury (text on screen) it means you can regenerate your health to perfect health.\nMeaning Magic attacks even though brutal damage it doesn't cause permanent damage.\n\nBosses are just named enemies with a higher health pool, hits harder and has a few unique tactics.\n\nAs for building up your town. After you explore for abit you'll see dwarves trapped in cages (Only release them after you've dispatched all the enemies) these can be used to automatically gather resources from completed zones. Each dwarf is 1 resource per 5 seconds. Until that resource pool has been used up. \n\nNot going to say more about the game as I'd like you to experience the game yourself.

The game is a well balanced mix of exploration, rpg, strategy, citybuilding and crafting. This game however doesn't fall into the trap of oversimplifying combat - which while seeming deceptively simple actually has a fair amount strategy and complexities below the simplistic surface and  well demand more of you than you would imagine from a game of this type - but don't be fooled on higher difficulties it has enough challenge to make you rage. It is a ton of fun to build/improve your colony through adventures, rescues and crafting and while many of the features are still being implemented/completed  its easy to see where the game is going and I suspect i'll end up doing  a lot of complete playthroughs - this is the kind of game you can enjoy over and over.

The game is not finished.  There are many places you cannot go and get a message that the area isn't in yet.  Items and abilities have numbers attached to them, but none of those numbers have actually been balanced yet.\n\nThat being said, core mechanics are in place and feel well thought out.  Given only the broad outlines of a goal to gather dwarves together to stand against the goblin king, it feels fun to explore locations to see what I'll find.  As you explore locations, you rescue dwarves that will help you gather resources to grow your town.  The little mini quests in areas I explore are varied enough that exploration is its own reward; I don't feel like I'm just clearing identical areas in some sort of resource grind.\n\nWhat makes the casual exploration gameplay really work is the art syle.  How you feel about this game is going to depend largely on how you feel about pixel art.  Personally, I am amazed how expressive the low pixel count characters are.  It takes a particular talent to create features by altering the color of individual pixels.

development\n\nI know I'm being rough on the game but my opinion still stands. The dev(s) are doing great work on progressing the game with the help of an active community and have progreesed the game by a fair margin since last time I've played yet its still quite tedious to play. Pleese keep in mind that I've only played as a dedicated swift melee build.\n\nThe combat has been made more diverse yet its still the same projectile spam its previusly been which just makes it annoying rather than difficult. Oh and the melee figheters love to just line up and let you kill them orderly and systematically.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6th Oct 2017 Reveiw\n\nThe combat is more bothersome than entertaining with next to no variation, at first youll have difficulities killing even the basic grunts, and basically have to really on trowing axes and kiteing. Then once youve visited one of the story areas (just gather apples and you can go there instantly, though I wont spesify where) you'll be a one-hit wonder, and nothing stands a chance. \n\nThe exploration is also annoying, you have to gather obscene abount of food just to progress the game and mercy be upon you if accidentaly unlock and area youve already discoverd...\n\nFor combat all you need is sheildbreak and you're unnstopable, just spend all your skills in the first tree and you're done.", "timestamp_created": 1507318938, "timestamp_updated": 1510768937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35525158": {"recommendationid": "35525158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986270756", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513389922}, "language": "english", "review": "Dwarfs, Goblins, Axes..AWESOME SOUNDTRACK..\nI build a Tavern and killed some Gobs near my Town..just Dwarf Life.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1507315552, "timestamp_updated": 1507315552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35516237": {"recommendationid": "35516237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124759191", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508406442}, "language": "english", "review": "\nMy opinions are based on the current state of this game. \npros:\n-I really like the scope of the game so far. It contains rpg, base building, and fighting elements. I hope all of these will be fine tuned and expanded upon in the future.\n-The creators clearly care about the lore of the land, even if it is your run of the mill fantasy so far. I like the dwarf theme.\n-The art stile is solid, and the animations are smooth. \n-I haven't met with any big, game breaking bugs so far\n-I think it already has ton of content that makes it whort buying even at this state\ncons:\n-It is early acces, so a lot of things are missing. For me the music quickly became repetitive.\n-Goblins find it hard to climb laders unfortunatelly. \n-The beggining is hard and somewhat slow ,until you can impove your stats somewhat, and you can become quickly overpowered.

In the future I will probably change my review.\nI have extremely high hopes for this game! It's fun and quick, but not without fault. I'll split this into positives and negatives.\n\nPros:\n+ Extremely easy to pick up\n+ Pretty neat aesthetic\n+ Most if not all of the promised features in the game already work (I feel like this is important to note with Early Access titles in 2017)\n+ Devs are definitely devoted\n+ Love the health system. There's something great there! It's not a simple health bar, but instead an immersive and in-depth overview of how screwed you are. Not enough RPGs take that into consideration!\n+ Every dwarf has personality!\n\nCons:\n- Changing controls doesn't seem to work. I've tried three times to change my controls and have been unable to.\n- The attacking/counterattacking system doesn't feel very satisfying, as combat usually is 1v3-1v6, not allowing for any sort of attack other than spam left clicks and kite. Throwing is extremely useful in this regard, though.\n- The sound is all over the place from quiet to explosively loud\n- Compared to Kingdom too much, the game is way different than Kingdom. I totally see where the comparison is from the aesthetic, but gameplay-wise it's very unique.\n- Pacing is very poor as of right now, you can play 30 minutes and already have a great deal of buildings built. As a result, it doesn't feel very rewarding to build the next one.\n- The resolution of the game itself feels too low, and could be a little zoomed out.\n- Any problem your character has from battle is instantly cured by a little apothecary dwarf for a few coins. It kinda removes the intensity of the health system they have in place\n\nThe cons will probably will be worked out with a little polish. I don't often say that, but I get a good vibe from these guys. All in all, this game is shaping up quickly.

Enough available content alrady in the Early Access version, lots of unique areas to visit, enemies to fight, quests to do, loot and resources to collect in order to gear up fight bosses, level up and unlock more skills to complete quests and build your dwarven kingdom.\n\nIf Kingdom and Elder Scrolls had a baby, that would be called Regions of Ruin. RoR is hevily inspired by Kingdom but it's a completely different game at the same time, it's a side-scrolling RPG where you explore, fight, level up, and build your town. The world has a ton of unique areas, quests, loot and resources waiting for you. You will die a lot or you can change the difficulty if you are not into fighting signigicantly better than you enemies, you can visit and complete each area in the order you chose and you can recruit mercenaries to assist you in combat and workers to farm resources for you.\n\nThe combat is trickier the higher the difficulty you chose, you can dash to avoid enemies, or sneak to sneak attack them, you have a power hit and the ability to throw axes in your enemies face. When you level up, you unlock abilities that will make your job easier. The skill tree has 4 categories: melee attacks, ranged attacks, shield and power hits and you can chose the path that fits to your playstyle. There is a good variety in the enemies already in the Early Access version and bosses that you can find the more you explore the map in the further away areas.\n\nYou \"build\" your town by spending resources for buildings that automaticaly get build there for you. Some of them offer you different things for example a tavern to hire recruits to assist you in combat, or a forge to make your own equipment and an apothecary to make bandages. There are 8 buildings currently available that can also be upgrated to provide more perks.\n\nThere is an open world, you visit new in the order you want and all of them are handcrafted not procedurally generated. That means that everything is placed there for a reason. There isn't an infinite world but it has almost 60 areas already in the Early Access version for you to explore. The areas can be forests, deserts, caves, farms, ruins, strongholds but each one of them is different from the previous ones. You always have new stuff to do and find.\n \nThere is a good variety of npcs (50+?), most of them with unique dialoque. Some of them offer you quests to help them in one way or an other, some of them come and stay in your settlement to be used (medic, blacksmith, vendors etc) and some others you can used as workers to farm resources for you.\n\nThe lore is a mystery you have to figure out by talking to people and collecting some book pages. Currently not finished in the EA version but there are some good amount of text already written. You can also notice a subtle sense of humor in some area's signs or in the gameplay itself, for example your injuries names or that you can apply your skill points by pressing P (peeing) in the campfire etc.\n\nThe art style you either love or hate, it's a decent pixelart with some nice scenery and lots and lots of different hand drawn areas, buildings, enemies, npcs, items and biomes.\n\nThe music is fantastic, gotta love it when a game has a good soundtrack that fits the games universe and hypes you. \n\nControls offer you a variety of options, i use keyboard but as far as i know the controllers will be fully supported too. I tested it in windows but also as far as i know the game runs smoothly on Linux and Mac too. Performace is great in my 5+ year old laptop with an i5@1.80ghz and a gtx970m, it will probably run smoothly in any pc.\n\nThe game still needs a lot of work to extend the content, new areas to visit, new quests and maybe more weapons, armor types and buildings for your settlement and of course the lore, the ending and everything story-related but i'm sure everything will be there in the full version.\n\nThe developer is a solo-dev, very passionate about this game since the day i met him he is fixing bugs left and right and adds new content in regular basis. The current version of the game offers you at least 12-15 hours of play time that can be easily reach the 20 depending on your playstyle and difficulty (edit: apparently some people after the EA launch are finishing it in 5-10 hours so it's totaly up to you how much it will take to you for now). They plan to make the content triple during the early access, the map is huge and only 1/3-1/4 of it is available currently so i expect it will need 40-60 hours to complete it after EA. The game is fun, unique and if it seems interesting/promising for you i would highly recommend it to you to check it out and give it a chanse.\n\nI hope this review was useful to you as i tried to cover as many things as possible. I was one of the testers of the game and had a blast testing it so far.

Discovering the secrets of your ancestor\u2019s ruined homes is especially delightful. They really nailed the wonder of discovery and exploration. The story is felt and experienced, not forced.\n- Seeing your town come to life as you make progress is extremely satisfying\n- The pixel art is beautiful. From the adorable kobold dwellings, to the malevolent, grimacing lightning wizards, this game oozes charm.\n- Companions can be quite helpful when you don\u2019t need to be sneaky. It can be really fun to bring two or three companions and face a whole fort full of goblins or orcs head on.\n- The skill trees are pretty well done as far as I can tell. If you choose wisely you really feel the increase in power as you improve certain skills.\n- When stealth is not employed, battles become appropriately chaotic. I could see some people getting frustrated with being overwhelmed by enemies, but that\u2019s often a sign that you need to take a different approach, i.e. sneak, hire companions, return when you\u2019re stronger etc.\n\n[b][u]What would be nice to see:[/u][/b]\n- Flesh the world out even more. The devs are clearly working hard on this, but the more full and alive the world feels the better. More rumors. More stories. More secrets.\n- Perhaps add more flavor to the companions. Maybe some unique ones could be found/rescued. Also, if companions become more permanent, perhaps you could opt to leave them at your base if you want to go it alone for a bit.\n- It might be fun if some areas were larger. Sneaking about in a huge orc fortress would be pretty epic.\n- Magic, possibly. If it doesn\u2019t thematically fit for the player to get to use magic then that\u2019s okay. Some of the enemies have really cool magic abilities though. It would be fun to get use them (If it wouldn\u2019t completely unbalance the game. Balance is more important)\n- Town events could be cool. Maybe dwarves could come to town from a region you liberated to ask you to go back there and deal with a problem. Maybe your town could be attacked. On that note, maybe you could build town defenses to deter raids. Maybe you could hire/train/equip militia to defend your town. Maybe if you cause trouble for powerful enemies before your defenses are strong, you get sacked hard.\n\n[b][u]What needs to be fixed:[/u][/b]\n- Sometimes the quest-giver dudes get killed in battle, and the quest remains with no way to finish it. I\u2019d say either make the quest-giver invulnerable, like the caravan guy, or make the quest disappear if they die.\n- Oftentimes I\u2019ll complete the objective of a quest, but have no idea where I have to go to finish it. The journal entry only includes the quest objective, not the quest origin.\n- No clue what to do with the runeforge. I\u2019ve dissolved a bunch of stuff, but I don\u2019t see an \u201cimbue\u201d option for any of my items.\n- There seems to be a bit of imbalance in resources. In my current game, I\u2019ve been through dozens of areas since I found one where I can harvest hides. Nearly every forest seems to yield only lumber.\n\nKeep up the good work devs!", "timestamp_created": 1515625248, "timestamp_updated": 1515793266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39163404": {"recommendationid": "39163404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121752988", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514430737}, "language": "english", "review": "This a lot of fun and I've really gotten into building up my little town.

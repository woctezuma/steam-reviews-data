Taking place in the 1960's, the United States is at the height of the Cold War with Russia, and the looming threat of nuclear war pervades the atmosphere. Miller has stolen top secret chemical weapons research files from the CIA, and it's up to you to recover the documents before they land in the wrong hands. However, there's more to this story than meets the eye.\n\nTo say that this title is unlike any other experience in VR right now is a total understatement. There are truly not enough positive things that could be said about the game, from its government brainwashing beginning where you swallow pills to choose which language that the audio plays out in, to the very climactic ending that'll leave you desparately wanting more. Much of the gameplay goes slightly in depth on conspiracy theories and known United States government testing, such as the infamous MK Ultra experiments. There are quite a few documents that can be picked up and read, and though the puzzles that lay in wait are simple, they're still compelling in their own way. Even the ending will have you running through the game once more to see if there's an alternate path that can be made.\n\nThe graphics and controls are top notch, everything looks crisp and has a tight handle. I was able to get through the whole game without any issue in my 2mx2m room-scale set up, so not a lot of space is necessary to give The Price of Freedom a whirl. It's definitely one of the greatest and most unique free games on the market right now, and I would gladly pay for a full, polished product of this nature. Detailed spy games are in short supply, and the half hour spent with The Price of Freedom is simply not enough.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]5.0/5.0[/b] - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.[/h1]\nThe Virtual Reality Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31311814/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thevirtualrealitynetwork]Group[/url] Click for More", "timestamp_created": 1512491478, "timestamp_updated": 1513695731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37977799": {"recommendationid": "37977799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024287556", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512138764}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but highly recommend, Wonderful piece of work.", "timestamp_created": 1512139050, "timestamp_updated": 1512139050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37808822": {"recommendationid": "37808822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141489246", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512955621}, "language": "english", "review": "Shockingly fun and interesting for a free game.

As it is at the moment of testing I am leaving a [Negative] as a constructive feedback and will adjust the review if most of the issues mentioned below are addressed in the future.\n\nThis might have to do with the fact that it was designed for the HTC Vive but the first thing I noticed was the initial orientation of the room which wasn\u2019t facing the camera and rather taking place in a 90 degree orientation.\nThis wouldn't have been much of a problem if things didn\u2019t get worse once in the room with the flashlight where the action was taking place behind the user so the sensors were blocked and couldn\u2019t track properly \u2013 there should be a way to reorient the camera with the game (it changes multiple times across the experience). As a side note a third sensor might have helped but that is beside the point I am making here with the orientation of the camera and the impeded movements. Being that the majority of relevant interaction is done in that room, most of the experience was impacted.\n\nNext, the idea of the UV lamp worked wonders however here came the second issue I experienced: I dropped the flashlight a few times on the table to accomplish other manipulations and a few times it dropped on the floor \u2013 well after the third time or so the flashlight seems to have vanished and I had to restart the whole thing. I did not try to break the game on my second and final attempt so I don\u2019t know if this behavior can occur repeatedly or not. \n\nBut the major issue encountered was actually the presence of visual glitches where the whole screen would turn gray (this is known to happen in Google Earth in particular) depending on what you are looking at. This behavior constantly happened when in the room with the flashlight near the red candles where you happen to read stuff in particular and also happened at the credits around the last highlighted footprint.\n\nWhile this experience was free and the rest of the experience was satisfying including the story elements considering the length of the experience, each of these issues broke the immersion and wouldn\u2019t be acceptable in a retail product.\n\nI hope we will see more of these as the premise was interesting and could lead to a lot of places!\n\nEdit: Typo and formulation.", "timestamp_created": 1507069059, "timestamp_updated": 1507069230, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35182482": {"recommendationid": "35182482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008067028", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506251187}, "language": "german", "review": "H\u00fcbsche VR Demo.

I would advise the developers to put a little bit more time into placing their triggers in such a way that the user can grab something quickly and easily, rather than having to grope around until the tactile response indicates that they've put their hands in the right spot. On first playthrough, I would guess the triggers need to extend further towards/past the fingertips. The orientation of the hands isn't quite right either, and holding something such that you can read it is more than a little awkward. I also would advise making it a little more obvious that the first door is locked. In future episodes, I would also like to see a more polished locomotion system. The blackouts between locations are immersion breaking.\n\nEssentially, it's clear the effort here was put towards the story. Game mechanics feel like an afterthought, a boring distraction cobbled together quickly in order to move on to more interesting things, and the result is a game that feels like a very pretty prototype. The narrative is excellent, but the mechanics get in the way. I would love to see that addressed in future updates/episodes.\n\nOtherwise, this is an excellent experience, and I would strongly recommend it as a quick introduction to what VR can do in the storytelling arena.

I liked it a lot and can only recommend to test it for yourself as it is also free.\n\nIt shows perfectly fine what VR is capable when it comes to story telling. You feel immediately immersed in the environments. Reading through files in VR is so much better than just reading them on a normal screen. Even little puzzle that would normally bore you make fun in VR with motion controllers.\n\nOne minor critic is the way how the hands are situated compared to the controller. This does not feel naturally and even hurts a bit if you try to hold a file straight in order to read it. This could be fixed actually. Also the gun has the same problem that it does not feel like you are holding it naturally.\n\nRecommended. Good work.

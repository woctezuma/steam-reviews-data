It's apparently based on the webcomic Homestuck, which I have never read, but I found this to be no hinderance to my enjoyment of the game so if you've never read it either, don't let that stop you from trying this game out if you are a fan of adventure games.\n\nThe game takes place in the 90's and starts with the main character Joey and her brother Jude playing in the front yard.  Things quickly go south when a bunch of monsters crash their afternoon and Joey ends up trapped in the house and Jude in his treehouse fort.  You will mostly play as Joey and will spend the first half of the game trying to reach the safety of the attic with a couple of brief forays as Jude in the treehouse providing backup to Joey.   I don't want to say too much more due to spoilers but as you can see if you have looked at any of the screenshots, about two thirds of the way through the game Joey is going to be blasted to an alien world and things will get weird.\n\nGameplay is traditional point and click fare with Joey collecting items and then using them on each other or on the environment in order to solve puzzles.  Early on you also gain the ability to tap dance and ballet dance (Joey is an aspiring dancer/veterinarian.....don't ask) and you can use these abilities also to solve problems.  Its fairly standard stuff and if you've ever played an adventure game before, you will be right at home.\n\nThe art style is a simple comic book style for the main characters but everything is well animated and that really helps brings things to life.  The background art is bright and colourful and everything is packed with detail.  All in all its a very nice looking game and I had a lot of fun exploring it.\n\nSound and music is a mixed bag.  I liked the music a lot but the sound effects were sparse and often mixed quite low compared to the rest of the sound.  It's by no means a deal breaker but it just makes some of the moments feel a bit odd as they can feel bizarrely quiet.  There is no speech, but that's fine.  Id rather no speech than bad voice acting and it lets my imagination make up character appropriate voices.  So yeah, sound is a weird one but its a minor gripe more than anything.\n\nAs far as the story goes, this is the first episode so a lot of it is build up.  You can see the game putting the pieces in place  and doing a lot of character and world building that feel like they won't pay off fully until later.  That said I enjoyed my playtrhough and am really looking forward to what comes next, which is about the best you can expect from the first part of an episodic series.  It should leave you wanting episode two and it does just that.\n\nThe biggest plus to this game for me was that using every item, either on another item or something in the environment, has its own specific text.  This is not a game where you are going to see a generic \"That does not work\" style message.  Literally every single item in the game has its own text depending on what you use it on.   Try and put the pigeon in the microwave and the game will let you know that it recognises what you just tried to do and it thinks you are a monster for example.  None of this stuff is essential but it is often hilarious and its the kind of detail that I adore in a well written adventure as it makes even the most crazy of actions rewarding, just to see what the game has to say about what you just did.  Trying everything on everything so I could read the humorous responses added about two hours to my playtime as I just messed about with everything.  It also helped give insight into the characters thought processes as their different world views are reflected in the way they game describes their responses to the actions you take.  Its good stuff and I had a lot of fun mucking about.  \n\nAll up this was a great opening and I can't wait for the rest of the series.  Here's hoping Act 2 is not quite as long a wait as Act 1 was.\n\nIf you are a fan of humorous adventures, pick it up.  It's very much the love letter to 90's adventures it bills itself as and the more people that get it, the more chance we have that this series will actually reach its long awated completion.", "timestamp_created": 1516279968, "timestamp_updated": 1516280123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39425898": {"recommendationid": "39425898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116841521", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "last_played": 1516236837}, "language": "english", "review": "This is honestly the best thing in existence I just wonder when will act II be released?", "timestamp_created": 1516236693, "timestamp_updated": 1516236693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39425740": {"recommendationid": "39425740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132020453", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 349, "last_played": 1516235957}, "language": "english", "review": "I've  accidentlally left this game running for hours, but from what ive actually played, its really cute", "timestamp_created": 1516235890, "timestamp_updated": 1516235890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39424250": {"recommendationid": "39424250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046371503", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 445, "last_played": 1516227703}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Trata de dos hermanos Joey y Jude que son sorprendidos por un ataque de monstruos mientras estaban en el patio de su casa.\nJude se queda en la casa del \u00e1rbol y Joey entra en casa,  tiene que esconderse de las criaturas,y asi va transcurriendo la historia.\nSe puede interactuar de distintas formas con diferentes y sorprendentes resultados.\nEs una historia de puzles simples y es divertido.", "timestamp_created": 1516229562, "timestamp_updated": 1516229562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39423056": {"recommendationid": "39423056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034698785", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512258540}, "language": "english", "review": "love it", "timestamp_created": 1516225169, "timestamp_updated": 1516225169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39422213": {"recommendationid": "39422213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054184677", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 199, "last_played": 1516221919}, "language": "english", "review": "eeeeeeeehhhhhhhhh", "timestamp_created": 1516222383, "timestamp_updated": 1516222383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39420626": {"recommendationid": "39420626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083793600", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1516161128}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is SJW drivel.

The game's characters are well written, the story, while linear was interesting enough for me to keep playing. It was also really short which is unfortunate.

Have you read it or maybe played it when it was still \u201cinteractive\u201d? Either way it's still there on mspaintadventures.com. You can go and read it. It's quite something. HIVESWAP are set in the same universe with Homestuck, but earlier on the timeline, so you don't really need to know whatever happens in the Homestuck to play this. But you may want to, you know? It's good.\n\nAnyway, we have a classic point & click game here. It's quite short since it's only a first act (and I READLLY HOPE isn't the last one), but attention to the details is quite shocking and unlike old p&c games you won't need to hunt down that damn little pixel on the screen to interact with or fathom insanity by combining everything with anything in order to progress the story or just freaking stuck since you happen to forget something IMPORTANT f-k if you know where and there is no way back. Have you heard about the infamous Rubber Duck Puzzle in The Longest Journey? And that's only the entrance to the rabbit hole. This may shed some light on the subject cracked.com/article_19974_the-6-most-absurdly-difficult-video-game-puzzles.html ... or won't, since even though there are puzzles in HIVESWAP this clustertruck won't happen here. At least not in the first act and I hope it won't happen in the following acts either.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean you won't be able doing crazy stuff. In fact game will actually reward you for doing crazy stuff with secret achievements or hilarious comments. So, if you an achievement hunter then you might want to use a walkthrough since you'll most likely miss half of them if you go on your own. Unless, you really want to go on a quest of combining everything with anything.\n\nAnd here we are, I wrote three paragraphs of text already and this is the fourth one and I still haven't told much about the game. Except for being small since it's only a first act, and haven't given you a comprehensible list of pros and cons either. Know what? I haven't found any cons so far and without cons there is no reason to make a list of pros since there is nothing to balance out. Except, maybe, this whole \u201cchapters\u201d concept, which is quite understandable, but frustrating anyway. I don't like to wait for the next act to be released. I want the WHOLE GAME and I want it RIGHT NOW, but I do understand that without being divided into small portions that \u201cwhole game\u201d thingamajig may never actually happen. So, I'll wait for the next chapter and play it ASAP. You may want to wait for the whole game, though. Ah, right, it also lacks voice acting, but I can't really pin this to the cons list.\n\nSo, this is amazing first chapter of potentially amazing point & click adventure which is going to happen. Yes, I do believe in these guys enough to think it will happen unless the World just suddenly End. We just have to live long enough to let it happen to us.\n\nAnd if you read this when all chapters already released you are one LUCKY BAS/TARD! It might be good to be you.

I like to end things positively so I'll start this with the negatives...\n\nCons:\n-Typos... a lot actually for a published game. Main game play is free as far as I can tell, but the otherwise nice flavor text you get by having objects interact with each other is full with them.\n-Music... I didn't find the background music as bad as some, but coming to this game from Homestuck leaves much to be desired. The music that plays while you're playing and the music that plays during important scenes have almost no distinction making their emotional impact practically non-existent. I feel that if you replaced the soundtrack with generic free internet music there wouldn't have been a big difference.\n-References... there's not enough to completely alienate someone who's never read Homestuck, but there are some that could confuse the player. They're worded in a way that sounds like a funny inside joke... but they don't know the joke. It's not a deal breaker but it is something to keep in mind.\n-Point and click mechanics... they aren't bad but not really polished. The click box is just not where it should be sometimes. You have to do a little search to get what you're looking for.\n\nPros:\n+Trolls!... this is purely a Homestuck thing, but it's pretty exciting to see new grey aliens to love!\n+Solid characters!... this comes as no surprise considering Andrew Hussie had his hands on this, but it's still refreshing to have characters that you can instantly tell the difference between both physically AND mentally! There's only three real characters that you interact with in Act 1, but they all have unique interests and hobbies like actual people. They even act like the teenagers (and possibly young almost-adult(?)) that they are.\n+Plot!... admittedly not too much was revealed as this seemed to be largely a story set up and character introduction act but what was revealed in interesting and has me hooked in order to find out the answers.\n+Flavor text!... I know I said that the flavor text has a lot of typos but it's still fun to read and reveals plenty of tasty tidbits about the characters. For anyone who obsessively combed though Homestuck for clues, this will be a field day for you! For those who didn't, well it's still nice to uncover more about the world and experience delightfully sassy narration to your dumb item combinations.\n+Accessibility... while there references to Homestuck, I imagine this would still be a good game to the uninitiated. It has some good world building that I can appreciate and has a much more acceptable... \"vocabulary\" than the webcomic it's based off of which would make it better for a wider audience (Homestuck has some colorful words that are NOT child friendly).\n\nOverall, there are technical issues with this game, but they're largely minor and most casual players wouldn't notice.

I was a major Homestuck fan in my youth, and still enjoy the actual material quite a bit. However, I haven't been attached to the fandom for quite a while now. This won't really impact my review, but considering i'm reviewing a Homestuck game... yeah. It's necessary.\n\nIt's a game that feels like the Homestuck webseries. That is essentially the best way to explain this game to someone. If they ask, \"What's Homestuck?\", then they're not in the right demographic for this game. It's not that someone who hasn't been exposed to the comic can't enjoy the game. It's more that they won't be receiving a complete experience, and with an asking price of eight dollars for a game that took me sub two hours to complete, I can't imagine it being worth the price of admission.\n\nAs for the actual game, it's a fairly typical point-and-click adventure game with some added bling. Quite a few interactions happen via a communication device to talk with other characters that you can play as. There is a solid main character, but these other sequences with supporting characters do well in breaking things up. The other notable feature is the STRIFE! battles. Now, these aren't true battles. They're more like flashy puzzles. But they're distinct enough from the actual puzzles that I feel like mentioning them. They're fun little diversions with some witty dialogue, but nothing really that special. \n\nStory wise, it's hard to judge considering this is the first chapter of the story. All I can really say is that it's a good setup that manages to leave some good questions to be answered later down the line and establishes the universe to the extent that it's needed for the plot. I like all the characters that have been introduced. They each feel suitably unique, and the dialogue is all excellently written, which is something of a must for a game that's mostly dialogue. \n\nOverall, it's not a revolutionary game. But it doesn't really need to be one. It sets out to make a nice homestuck adventure game, and does that very well. Wether it squanders the potential it has is yet to be seen, but i'm personally looking forward to the next act.", "timestamp_created": 1514888358, "timestamp_updated": 1514888358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38967874": {"recommendationid": "38967874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198453009652", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514884615}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, and stays true to the general ideas left in the comic it references, Homestuck!

Sadly I did read all the 8000 pages thinking it would help me but it didn't, and I hate myself.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n[spoiler]The Bazinga guy and a bi girl are playing in their backyard, when suddenly a monster appears. Joey, the bi girl, goes in the attic to get some weapons, there she finds a mysterious big object covered in the most clicheic way ever. Beaside Bulgaria's warnings, she uncovers a portal to a new world. She is transferred to a planet from where the Trolls originate (those aliens with horns you see at cons), somehow at the same time a troll from that planet also touched that portal, and now they changed places. The girl who questions her sexuality is now on Alternia and questions everything. She makes friend with the cutest gay boy alien to ever ever exist and after SOME time they meet and try to escape the resistance.

Best example I can give is when trying to click on the cleaning set near the door where Xefros's pet should sleep (in theory), the clickable zone of the cleaning set is overlaped by the door clickable zone, and you get the door's description instead.\n[*] Game is short, and most major plot elements  are spoiled in the trailers.

Instead, you should be treating Hiveswap as its' own property, and stop constantly comparing it to Homestuck just because it's made by the guy who made Homestuck. It's not going to be based in Homestuck, will not be focused on Homestuck, and Homestuck characters will likely remain Homestuck - specific characters, as far as we've seen now. So if you're here for something that's like Homestuck or is the \"spiritual succesor\" of sorts to it, leave. Because you're going to continue to be disappointed.\n\nWell anyway, other than that, I think the game's fun. As a lot of people said, it is kind of frustrating during the first play when you get stuck in certain places (I was using a guide for most of the Alternia gameplay) and if you don't have the patience to click on everything like me, then it's really annoying.\n\nThere are a lot of achievements that I believe pretty much capture that \"Hussie\" comedy, contrary to most who think it's just a forced attempt at humor. I mean, I think a lot of people forget, this is the man who found enjoyment merely in drawing weird human-animal abominations with giant bulging muscles and shit. Got all on my second playthrough except for the seemingly elusive \"Ourous\" achievement, which only that one guy who probably used the Steam Achievement program got.\n\nIt's a very short ride. For my first playthrough, 2 hours (even constantly checking a guide and suffering through an 'unable to interact with anything' bug) and my second, 1 hour, seeing as I'd basically memorized all the choices and skipped through a huge chunk of dialogue.\n\nAll in all, I do think that for what it is, the pricing's pretty accurate. I've seen visual novels with no animation like Hiveswap that go for 20 bucks just because \"good art\", but we've gotten good art, nice animation, and nice music all for 8 bucks. Pretty good deal, if you ask me.\n\n From my (probably slightly biased) opinion, I can recommend Hiveswap, but I can't confidently say that you will 100% enjoy it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514471335, "timestamp_updated": 1514471335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38768856": {"recommendationid": "38768856", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969245563", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514441642}, "language": "english", "review": "I was worried this would be impenetrable, as a person who never got into Homestuck.

As a huge fan of homestuck, I was quite excited for this, but unfortunately I have some gripes with the execution. The game provides very little help when you get stuck, so when a character arbitrarily asks you to fetch her own key before allowing you to proceed and gives absolutely no indication of where she put it no matter how many times you press the literally useless hint button, you can understand if I get a bit annoyed. Most of the homestuck running gags are gone, so no acrobatic pirouettes off the handle will be performed any time soon, which is fine, but they don't seem to want to replace them with anything. The characters are pretty dull, one-note entities with too few chances to meaningfully interact with each other like they would in a webcomic, so despite what some individual scenes or some homestuck style \"You are now X\" introductions would have you believe, I could sum up all the part 1 characters in about 5 words each. The most interesting characters seem to be the guardians who get zero screen time. I really want to meet this mysterious babysitter, she seems pretty fun, but who knows when/if that will ever happen.\n\nThere's also the slight issue that this is incredibly short. I am aware of the drama happening behind the curtains of this particular project, but I'm the kind of guy who enjoys following the main story and only examines random objects in a pretty cursory fashion, so about 2 hours have passed and I've finished the entire thing. I then looked at the achievement list to discover that I missed about everything on it because I didn't decide to feed a stuffed animal with a cracker, but instead spent my time trying to tap dance on a pile of guns and putting a pigeon in a microwave (I'm not weird, shut up). Basically, the achievements just point you to the random comments that the developer thought were the funniest, which would be fine if they weren't all hidden by Steam anyway and required you to rub everything in your inventory against everything in the game world until the friction spontaneously produces Steam achievements (or look up a guide). There was probably a soul-crushing level of effort writing all those possible interactions, but I just didn't want to go look for them. I didn't feel the need to pick every conversation choice in Openbound and I'm not going to waste my time putting batteries in my shoes just in case my character goes on a quick rant about how light-up sneakers are stupid or something.\n\nUltimately, the game's not horrible, but I feel slightly less impressed with this game's first act than I was at the end of the first act of Homestuck. Yeah, I'm sure the story will pick up from here, and I wouldn't mind spending some time with the sequels when they come out, but as it stands, I can't really recommend this to anyone without it being on a huge sale.

This game was rushed out so that the Homestuck fanboy/girls could fanboy/girl over it despite its flaws. It's not worth playing because of these problems.

I also appreciate the fact that troll typing quirks were HEAVILY downplayed, making them easier to read for anyone not familiar with Homestuck.\nAnother neat thing about this game is the sheer amount of flavor text. Just about any combination of items and/or background objects can give you a different response. Heck, at one point near the beginning, two pieces of flavor text actually reference each other, and I actually laughed out loud when I saw it. Then again, I laughed out loud quite a lot throughout this game.\nThat's actually pretty much how I'd describe this game: a laugh-out-loud experience. It's bursting at the seams with humor and charm, and I loved it from start to finish.

Never change.\n\nHIVESWAP: Act 1 is good.  It's a well-designed adventure game (a big hurdle to clear, in my book), but it comes across as more of a visual novel than an adventure game because it doesn't present any kind of challenge -- that's not its purpose.  Its purpose is to tell a Homestuck-parallel story in a Homestuck-like way, and it does that very well.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Homestuck, you ought to go read that first before investing here... this game's sense of humor won't make any sense to someone who hasn't internalized the jargon and in-jokes.  That might seem like a failing, but there shouldn't be any mystery regarding exactly for whom this game was designed.  It's a Homestuck game for Homestucks.  Are you a Homestuck?  No?\n\nRead the comic.  Be the Homestuck.\n\nOkay, let's mill some build grist.\n\nI finished Act 1 in two and a half hours with about half the achievements.  I consider that a good investment of US$8.00.\n\nThe art and animation in this game is great.  It is inspired by Homestuck, but far more consistent and clean.  On occasion I found myself wishing for a momentary dip into hideous crayon blarg just for old times' sake, but it doesn't happen and I think that's probably a good thing.\n\nThe writing is solid, although it lacks any of the occasionally mindblowing japery of Homestuck.  There is a lot of text-bubble reading, which is not a surprise and not necessarily a bad thing.  The puns are... well, they needed a lot of puns.  Some of them work, but brace yourself for the ones that don't.\n\nI am suitably intrigued by the characters, the standalone story, and the subtle and not-so-subtle tie-ins to Homestuck that I will be returning for Act 2, but by relying on what has come before the game has robbed itself of an opportunity to create new inexcusable folly.  Again, though, I don't think that was its purpose.\n\nAs a final point, I was surprised by how /much/ this game has to do with Homestuck -- I was expecting a parallel but separate story, but it looks from Act 1 like Hiveswap (or perhaps Hauntswitch) will be tied into the characters and events of the original.  This was not unwelcome, and more importantly I trust the author to be able to do this well.\n\nIf I have any complaint about the game, it's that it's not Homestuck enough in its mechanical execution -- I was looking forward to wrestling with a Fetch Modus for my Sylladex and interacting with complex systems like the Cruxtruder-Punch Designix-Totem Lathe-Alchemiter sequence of devices from the early days of Homestuck.  Of course, trying to actually code such a thing would have been an unmitigated disaster, so perhaps it is for the best. \n\nIn short: this is a great start of a game for fans of Homestuck, and if you're not a fan, you should consider becoming one.  It is time well spent.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514046021, "timestamp_updated": 1514046021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818530", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38558078": {"recommendationid": "38558078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406635994", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514068364}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super fun.

As pictured above the first half has an engaging and unobtrusive dynamic dialog system. The second half however shifts to a full screen static dialog system, essentially devolving the game interface to walls of text broken up by short point and click interludes.\n\nI still recomend this game at this time as I have enjoyed it and the second half I mention is more like the last third as far as play time goes.

For example, an early quest has you searching for properly sized batteries.  You check objects for batteries by clicking them and selecting \"scrounge.\"  In one area, there's a radio, where clicking the radio gives you the option to turn it off.  If you expect the rules of the game to be consistent then, you can easily miss that you need to specifically click on the battery compartment and open it in order to get the scavenge option.  Do that, and you'll wander around, unable to progress the game and not knowing why.

But the background aren't of lesser quality, it's really a joy to wander in those places and see every little details that are at every turn. \n- The characters are very easy to relate with and you want to be with them on their strange and intense journey. \n- The pacing of the adventure is good, not especially hard, even if sometimes you'll just have a moment to search where you saw said information or object to get past something, so it's not too easy, but not hard enough to make you quit. It's a good balance.\n- The story is starting putting itself in place naturally and i can only hope that the next Act to come will be as satisfying.\nBonus point : If you were an 90s kid, you're in for a nostalgia trip~\nAnd to finish, the price is very correct for the lenght and quality of the game, so it's a complete recommendation for me !!!", "timestamp_created": 1513520396, "timestamp_updated": 1513520396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38367429": {"recommendationid": "38367429", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979580303", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514590165}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is SO GOOD.

The major problem with this: It's SHORT. Like, REALLY short. But being episodic and relatively cheap, it's a complaint equal to the amount of love you have for Homestuck in general.\n\nThe main character, Joey, is okay. Unlike most of the other characters in Hussie's franchise, she is actually really written into a relatively blank slate archetype, at least as she is expressed through dialogue. The world around her is riddled with flavor text that delivers plenty of background that does give her depth, but through dialogue she just comes off as somewhat flat. Not a huge complaint, especially given the other characters around her, all interesting in their own ways.\n\nThe dialogue itself is way more tame, especially in terms of profanity, than Homestuck was. But seeing as this is an adventure game and not a novel of a webcomic, it works out. I found more than enough moments of intrigue, and it was charming and cute the whole way through.\n\nThe puzzles were all pretty easy, especially toward the beginning. So it doesn't seem to have a leg up on most adventure games I've played as a kid. No walkthroughs required, and there's only one ending. Take that as you will. Older adventure game fans might find this a fault, Homestuck fans probably will not.\n\nThe soundtrack\n\nIs\n\nAMAZING.\n\nI would definitely have to say, even if you're not familiar with Homestuck and are interested in a character and story driven adventure game, go for it! Either way, I loved this and I can't wait for the second episode, hopefully a bit longer, and I'm super proud of Andrew Hussie for managing to crank this out through all of the turmoil!", "timestamp_created": 1512841176, "timestamp_updated": 1512841176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38177903": {"recommendationid": "38177903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198444379462", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512820293}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784\uc774 \ub118\uc9e7\uc544\uc11c \uc544\uc27d\ub124\uc694 \uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub124\uc694 !\n", "timestamp_created": 1512820509, "timestamp_updated": 1512820509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38176705": {"recommendationid": "38176705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147662322", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512799194}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game, even if you have no clue what Homestuck is.

To the point where I'm very glad that they went to a hand-drawn style over CGI. It definitely helped to give the characters more life and expressiveness. It was one of few games that I actually wanted to sit through and play whenever I have spare time (and I have a very hectic schedule, so..make of that what you will). Not to mention the writing for nearly every bit of dialogue for this game is absolutely top-notch. I almost never found repeats in combinations, and it led to some of the stupidest, yet funniest, scenes in the entire game.\n\nSo, all that said?

The environments are well rendered and interesting, the characters are generally likable. And the story, overall, has promise, though it's hard to tell from just the first episode.\n\nBut for something that comes out of a love of classic adventure gaming, it seems like their familiarity with conventions stops somewhere in the late 80's. A lot of the quality of life improvements that became standard in most games in the genre are absent in this game. The issue with having cluttered and busy art in a game is that you have the give the player some means of parsing useful objects from decoration. Some do this with a hot key, some do this by coloring useful objects differently, and some choose simply to keep their environments more spartan. Hiveswap does none of these things, and forces the player into the old school habit of hovering the cursor over every inch of the screen to find what's useful. This isn't helped by the fact that sometimes really dull items that look like background are often critical to solving puzzles.\n\nThere's also, at times, an exhausting amount of writing in this game. The creators are clearly in love with their own words, which is a pretty common problem in indie and narrative games at this point. Video game creators have now reached the point where they should heed the old Strunk and White advice and use fewer words. If there's a way to have the player engage with the content rather than reading, go with engagement.\n\nHaving said all that, I'll still probably check out episode 2, but there's a lot here that made things needlessly frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1511474149, "timestamp_updated": 1511474149, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37212096": {"recommendationid": "37212096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136836516", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511135975}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ufff Juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1511473381, "timestamp_updated": 1511473381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37206810": {"recommendationid": "37206810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268703667", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505705447}, "language": "english", "review": "Much better than I had ever expected it to be!

This is my first review so go easy on me. As a fan Hiveswap exceeded all my expectations, but for the sake of the review i'm putting all my Homestuck love aside. \n\nThe story: On its own the story is funny and interesting, it gives you a sense of wonder in all its jokes and dialogue. The first half of the game is very captivating in the interactions with the environment ranging from Bubsy posters to monsters chasing you around the house. It really makes you feel like there's more to this world that we think. The second half the protagonist is swapped to another planet where you get to take control of (spoilers) Xefros the troll. During this time you really get to know and understand the \"universe\" Andrew Hussie has in store for us, you get to see its problems and its MiRaClEs. It shows us just how different but not different the \"trolls\" really are. Too bad it just builds us up to the real story that'll come out in the next acts. \n\nThe characters: The game starts us off with the siblings Joey Claire and Jude Harley taking control of Joey most of the time. In the first area of the game you get to learn about Joey and her point of view of environment. Each dialogue inteaction is from Joey's mind on the subject like how she wants to be a veterinarian to oppose her negective father. Have you ever done something as a counter to someone close. Jude likes to make conspiracy theories, do you like finding out answers to something or predicting the answer. Xefros is a chill dude who likes sports and music but is constanty terrorized by his red blood color which basicly makes you low class. Do you like sports but are discouraged by something you can't contol, these characters are relatable in a way good way. It immerses deeper into why we love video games and entertainment in general to begin with. It lets us feel like we can do things that are impossible.\n\nThe gameplay: I personally don't like to read books but hiveswap does in a way that makes me clicking for more. There are SO SO many hilarious jokes that it doesn't feel that taxing to be reading multiple lines. Combined with the great characters the jokes add to the level of interest within the dialogue. All of the places you explore are well drawn and cartoony and it feels like Homestuck at its core, but still different enough for somebody who's never seen Homestuck to enjoy it just as much as the next guy. On the puzzle side it's a little meak but fun nonetheless, it's definitely not as hard as other point and click adventure games. It is a little heavy on the reading side, for example there's a part where you read dialogue from a pad, it becomes slow at times thinking I just want to skip this to get to the rest of the game. The Characters and jokes really save it when it comes to this, anyone who fully reads all the dialogue will enjoy the game more, making you want to find more. That is for me at least.\n\nMiRaClEs: This is what made Homestuck so popular in the first place. Relatable characters, funny dialogue, and exciting lore. Have you ever wished you could play sburb, or fight monsters, or save a princess. Thats what it means to really play Hive swap, it has a nice balance of relatability and fantasy. So if you like games but LOVE Homestuck I absolutely recommend this game.\n\n- Anyway sorry if there's some grammer mistakes or I mispell something, it's my first time trying this but if you read this far THANK YOU go read Homestuck and buy Hiveswap (HeHe). <3", "timestamp_created": 1511412940, "timestamp_updated": 1511412940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36911877": {"recommendationid": "36911877", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991542822", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505877518}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck homestuck", "timestamp_created": 1511406694, "timestamp_updated": 1511406694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36911594": {"recommendationid": "36911594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081044706", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511406281}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game that is a nice follow up to the Homestuck web comic.

And by Jegus, after five long years of waiting and wondering, What Pumpkin finally delivered. With time constraints no longer being an issue due to not having to rush production or risk keeping eager readers waiting, almost every aspect of Hiveswap: Act 1 has been lovingly polished to a fine point, and it shows. The writing is hilarious and filled with references for fans of Homestuck to ravish in, the art manages to establish a beautiful, hand-drawn style that builds upon the classic look of MSPA perfectly, the soundtrack is composed by the two incredible musicians James Roach and Toby Fox -- the latter of whom is responsible for the infamously popular game Undertale and its own soundtrack, as well as being a highly respected member of the Homestuck music team for much of the comic's run, and while the gameplay isn't much to write home about, it does go above and beyond what is usually expected of a point-and-click adventure game by having almost (we'll get to that) every item available in the game usable on any object encountered by the player and not containing any of those overly-obtuse bullshit puzzles that point-and-click games seem to love so much. I managed to stump myself on what to do next at a few moments in the game, but that was mainly due to the fact that I either wasn't paying enough attention, I was overlooking something obvious, or am just incredibly shitty at solving puzzles. If you manage to get similarly stumped, fear not, because there is an incredibly helpful spoiler-free guide available among the community guides at the moment that should be able to help you with whatever problems you may run into, but I'd recommend that you only do this if absolutely necessary. My only remote gripe about the game is that late into it, a lot of the items seem to not render any output when used with most things, which was very disappointing to me as someone who spent at least an hour or two in Joey's bedroom alone. This issue could have been addressed since I last played it, but I highly doubt it, and it's really more of a nitpick than anything else. Outside of that, the game is absolutely and undilutedly brilliant and I'd highly recommend it to any fan of adventure games and/or Homestuck.", "timestamp_created": 1510748585, "timestamp_updated": 1511438401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36523764": {"recommendationid": "36523764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199220210", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514922792}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good!

The only criticism/ concern I would have is it's length.  It's not a long game at all:  a couple of hours if you know what you're doing and hurry through, a bit longer if you explore and look around a lot.  I do hope the other acts and the connected game, Hauntswitch, are longer.  Simply because if each comes in around 2 hours, then you have 2 games of 4 acts each = 16 hours.  $8 x 8 = $64.  So you're coming in at AAA game pricing for a pretty short, indie game.  I'd be alright with it if they drop the price on each or make them all longer though.\n\nThat said, I loved the game.  The graphics are beautifully done, all hand drawn, I believe.  The music is very good as well.  The story is engaging and the characters are interesting.

But you don't need to know what it is to enjoy this game as it is only loosely connected and has no impact on the plot. But I enjoyed this game so much that I went out of my way to read it (It's apparently a webcomic) and I love it. Now that that's out of the way, we can start this review. (Well, I start this review)\n\n                                                                                 [h1]Gameplay [/h1]\nThere isn't much gameplay here because it is a point and click adventure game. But, I have to say, it does have more than I expected. When you use an item from your inventory on a interactable it gives you a unique and sometimes humorous text. It makes a second playthrough worth it and it's way better (and less annoying) than the typical \"I can't do that!\" text that we all know and hate. \nHiveswap also has something called \"strifes\". Strifes are a form of combat. But they are really puzzles referencing/parodying Turn-Based combat. You can't fail during these \"strifes\" but, if you have read any other review, you have probably heard that you can't die either in this game. Which is false because you can die, but it's more of an easter egg.\n\n                                                                                 [h1]The Writing [/h1]\nThe writing is amazing! I instantly fell in love with the characters and the story. The jokes are well placed and humorous and I found myself laughing a couple of times. You get to know the characters through their thoughts and dialogue. \nThe story is great and I found myself deeply invested in it and the characters. I truly cannot wait to see what happens next in ACT 2.\n\n                                                                                 [h1] The Music [/h1]\nIf you have read any other review then you most likely already know how good the music is. I definitely punished myself for not buying the Soundtrack Edition. The music doesn't distract you from the game but it isn't a boring repetitive tune either. It's just simply amazing.\n\n                                                                                 [h1]The Visuals [/h1]\nThe visuals in this game are beautiful. There is definitely some background material in this game.\nI also really liked the character designs. I haven't seen a single character yet that looks boring or unimaginative.\nI really liked the monster designs aswell. They definitely look interesting and monstrous. Maybe I just a have a soft spot for eyeless reptilian monsters.\n\n                                                                                 [h1]Length [/h1]\nNow, you have probably heard that this game is short. Which is sort of true. It really depends on how you play the game. If you decide to play this game by just solving the puzzles and reading the dialogue then completing the game will take you around 2 to 3 hours. If you decide to also click on every interactable to see the thoughts of the character on it, then it will take you around 7 to 8 hours to complete the game. If you decide to also use every item in your inventory on every interactable then completing the game will take you around a week. I played the game by solving the puzzles, reading the dialogue and clicking on every interactable. It took me almost 8 hours to complete the game this way and I am happy that I played it like this. I got to know allot more details about story and even more about the characters. It made me like them even more. I find playing the game like this personally the best way to play it. It will give you more insight on the story and characters but you also won't be spending hours in one room wiping your inventory on everything, thus distracting you from the story. In my second playthrough I did use my inventory on everything (R.I.P Byers) and even though I got to see more jokes and story details, it was also distracting me from the story. \n\n                                                                                 [h1]Final Verdict [/h1]\nAll in all, this game is amazing and I highly recommend it, even to people that aren't all that interested in point and click games (like myself). I love the characters, the story, the visuals, the music, I love all of it. I give this game a: [b]8/10.\n[/b]\nNow don't put the game on a incredibly high pedestal.

Keep noted that it's development took a hella of a long time due to an ENTIRE redo of the project (more details somewhere online, no doubt). What you're looking at the store page of is the Hiveswap that was worked on after it got smoothed out. I'm making sure this is clarified, because I'm quite sure there are some here under the mistake that this is a long awaited big content title. But with that nonsense out the way, let me tell you about Hiveswap!\n\nRead Homestuck?:  While many will say otherwise, I say ReAd Homestuck before playing Hiveswap (or watch the awesome dubs). Yes, it's not mandatory, but trust me. You will most certainly miss the importance of countless direct plot points such as [spoiler]scratch's appearance, mention of the condesce, comical reference to the Signless's death, possible involvement of the midnight crew, the fact that Joey's mom has a frickin juju, knowing why the household is full of blue ladies and odd animals, what a lusus is (they don't fully explain it), the untold fact about what grubs are,[/spoiler] and many many other points only a Homestuck reader will understand. Just do yourself a favor and try reading the story this is adding onto, and if you do play Hiveswap blind, PLEASE keep your theories silent until you read Homestuck. It's improtant to the game's lore in so many ways already. So overall, playable and understandable enough for any, but intended for those that read. Also we know Hussie is a troll, and will use that specific wording \"Homestuck hasn't even been made yet!\" for a plot twist twistier than the windy thing.\n\nStory: Hiveswap starts out perfectly. We are beautifully gifted with a  taste of the art from the main menu and introduction. You probably already know this part, but Jude n' Joey get attacked by monsters, and flee to their little hideaways to get a grip on the situation. It's a fast introduction that raises enough questions to get the train rolling! Our two main character siblings Joey and Jude make no hesitation to engage in conversation and show off the qualities of their character and writing the moment we are interested to learn. I'll let you learn more about them when you play, but have my word they put no shame on the Homestuck name. Oh, and given the E rating, you will here a lot less cursing in this story, but the humor is dark enough to feel at home. I don't have any harsh feelings towards this development, as it goes with the aesthetic theme pretty well. Oh yeah, and obviously our lovely narration text is detailed and filling our eyes with pixel letters as ever. Every object and interaction have endless possible text to read. What's better is it's mostly all optional to try, letting the player choose just how much detail they get to read. I'll lastly say in regards to the story that is pretty short, even for an Act. But seeing as they also plan the Hauntswitch series, I think there will still be lots to see in the future.\n\nArt: Beautiful! ..But not perfect. Every single background is hand drawn fantasicly, and the classy approach definetly shows. Homestuck's original style feels well left behind aside from the obviously inspired character designs, but the new background approach is very welcomed. My only complaints being that the combat animations don't feel all that inspiring, but being as this is a point and click adventure game, that shouldn't matter (but there is a reason why it's not usually attempted in the genre). The bigger problem being that some room areas feel a little too cramped, and you can't always tell what you're looking at (Might just be me with the weak eyes here, but I don't know). This is difficult when the game doesn't have a scan feature, but I can't say it messed up my game progession. Also a quick seizure warning as there are flashy light moments.\n\nMusic: It's Toby Fox hun', what more to say?  Though I don't feel as in love as I did with Undertale's, it's still great and atmospheric. The battle themes have to be where the talent mostly shines, to no surprise. Honestly... I wish I had more to say here. Just try to avoid getting stuck anywhere, as some themes can last a while through the story and get drilled into your head until you progress.\n\nGameplay Technicalities: It's what you expect of a point and click boy! While I have heard of issues with framrate, none of that really interupted my experience... Honestly it's a very nit picky complaint to make on a game that doesn't require intense movement. And all the glitches I experienced on launch day have since been fixed, you may still find some, as well as some crazy exploits if you search. It also managed to play on my steam link pretty well, which is rare as hell.\n\nGameplay Features: You have an inventory, stuff goes in, there's endless possible texts. Okay, so what isn't dead obvious or not talked about yet? I guess the progession rate. Hiveswap is one of those games where talking means you did something right. Though the ammount of talking can be quite intense for even the smallest of progress, this is something all us readers are already used to, actually it's far more mild here than in Homestuck standards. It is best to get lost a few times just to explore and see everything, and with everything you are tasked to do between the dialogues, I'd say it all fits well enough. Plenty of easter eggs and optional interactions too, as an essential to any good point and click. The only two lacking points I can think of are the difficulty and the \"battles\". Hiveswap's description may say it goes for logical and non-dreamy solutions, but it gets a bit too logical... In the sense that any sense of logic can follow the directions it hints at. But I'm not saying it's all the time, as I had a decent ammount of head scratching moments. It just didn't feel as satisfying to solve a majority of the puzzles when the answers were so obvious. So about them battles? Well, while I do appreciate that the battles change the pace of scenes and throw in new ways of thinking for the player to react to, they don't translate to the genre well. Enemies don't really act monstourous, and kinda just stand around until you throw the right random item at them. The game over screen is considered a secret, if that says anything. \n\nPrice and recommendation:  A Daedalic title is 30$ off of a sale, and Hiveswap will be 32$ if it continues the 8$ tag ::::) I feel that Hiveswap would be either long as or longer than a Daedalic by then, so can't say the price ain't proper. But I do hope upon finishing it they do a discounted complete bundle by maybe 10% or so if you buy it whole. So is Act 1 worth it now? Yes if you're a big Homestuck fan. If you're a fan but are unsure, I won't argue waiting for more acts to be released. If you aren't a Homestuck fan, wait for a sale because it may be a dissapointing buy, especially if future acts raise the knowledge requirement.

To Homestuck fans it's a must have, but if you're new to the fandom this is the best place to start your journey!", "timestamp_created": 1507775809, "timestamp_updated": 1507775809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35647864": {"recommendationid": "35647864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047912725", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513513690}, "language": "english", "review": "List of things i know about Homestuck;\n\n1. It's a really long webcomic\n2. The Main character doesn't have arms (clarification needed)\n3. Toby Fox (Who made the game of the year 2015: Undertale) did some music for it i think maybe?\n4. Trolls????\n\nSo, yeah, I haven't read the Homestuck comic in any way, shape, or form. I don't even have a very vague idea about what it's about. What I do know, however, is that a short while ago, I saw a friend of mine on steam who rarely ever actually plays video games, playing a game. That game? Hiveswap Act 1.\n\nI took a peak, and watched the trailer. Straight away I was absolutely stunned by how breathtakingly beautiful the animation was. I have great fondness of cartoons and animation so i was pretty intrigued. I asked my friend if I needed to have read the Homestuck comic to enjoy this and he told me that I didn't have to. It was cheap, i was interested, so i chucked it on my wishlist and a few days later another friend of mine gifted me the game.\n\nI sat down to play the game, and by the time i closed it again i had already finished the whole act. Was it good though? Heckin yeah it was. It's funny, it's well written, the characters are interesting, the music is great, the animation is GREAT, and the story, oof, that has got a lot going for it. I can't wait for the rest of the acts.\n\nI'm a big fan of short and sweet games, so I wholeheartedly recommend you grab at least the first act of Hiveswap. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507760288, "timestamp_updated": 1507760288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500165", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35642229": {"recommendationid": "35642229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142272049", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514076319}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Este foi o melhor point-click que eu ja joguei na vvida, recomendo demais :3", "timestamp_created": 1507740274, "timestamp_updated": 1507740274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35640350": {"recommendationid": "35640350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227546192", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508961409}, "language": "english", "review": "hiveswap is an amazing game where people of all ages would love", "timestamp_created": 1507734478, "timestamp_updated": 1507734478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35634141": {"recommendationid": "35634141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071925929", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507709961}, "language": "english", "review": "excelent game, nice amout of homestuck lore and references sprinkled through but still understandable for players that have not read or finished homestuck. it has fantastic music and art.", "timestamp_created": 1507710562, "timestamp_updated": 1507710562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35633368": {"recommendationid": "35633368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119896247", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509588913}, "language": "english", "review": " its fun, it gets edgy sorta with the trolls but i think thats the point? its something. music is fantastic, art is fantastic, totally outstanding. with all due respect, id be really surprised if continues though. not because its bad, but because idk how big itll be, and how capable the studio will be to continue. we'll see! i got my fingers crossed.", "timestamp_created": 1507706525, "timestamp_updated": 1507706525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35628698": {"recommendationid": "35628698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124971376", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507455004}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been waiting for this ever since the Kickstarter was announced, an I'm glad the first act has finally been released.

Not worth $8 dollars in its current state.\n\nI absolutely, positively cannot recommend this game to anyone. For the time it took from the ending of the kickstarter and the poorly aged jokes that Hussie made about how much money he earned in total(while absolutely ruining the chance to get any of the stolen money back), Hiveswap is already looking like a worse version of Broken Age, with the beginning starting out decent, then having to buy each \"chapter\"(aka an actual part of the game that should already exist) with nearly immediate diminished returns. Two things that I can talk positively about the game is that it... looks pretty, and appropriately sets the scenes according to the time period(WOW, REMEMBER POGS AND LITEBRITES? WE'RE SO QUIRKY).\nThat's it. \nHiveswap is still showing Hussie's absolute mastery of color coordination(which I always deeply appreciated from his Problem Sleuth days), so while what I said was sincere, nearly every single other aspect of the game is severely lacking. Puzzles, if they can even be called that, depend on you having two eyes and a mouse. There is literally nothing challenging in the game itself, even for a point and click: how do you get a key? Don't worry, every single step is described in excrusciating detail, or you have to click on a teddy bear on a whim. \n\nFor combat, I'm not even sure how to critique it: The girl won't use guns because it would make combat last one t-sorry, because she doesn't like guns. You can tapdance, you can pirouette, you can flash a light, but it takes you out of having any sort of fun with it when 'options' turn into 'one solution you have infinite time/turns to choose accordingly'.\n\nCharacters are absurdly flat, with gems such as \"I hate my dad but I'm the main character so I'm also nice\" and \"I BUILT MY TINFOIL HAT OUT OF CHILDHOOD DREAMS AND FOX NETWORK SATELLITE DISHES\", as well as \"Tavros, but worse\". As having read all of Homestuck, I could not in my wildest dreams expect anything better than what we have now for the characters, but I'd be willing to change my opinion on this as the different chapters come out; looking in from a lets play, as it stands right now.\n\n$8 after two million and waiting months for chapters after years from the kickstarter campaign disguists me, but I'm only holding so much vitriol for this and writing a review longer than I ever would want to read because I KNOW Hussie and the What Pumpkin staff at large can do so much better.", "timestamp_created": 1507288714, "timestamp_updated": 1507293345, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35509877": {"recommendationid": "35509877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240589556", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512198455}, "language": "spanish", "review": "FUE GENIAAAAL.

A tribute to 90's era point-and-click games. What it has an abundance of is fantastic music, made by Toby Fox (The creator of Undertale), a great story (One that you don't need to watch HomeStuck to gain interest in). As a standalone story, it shines through with moments of hilarity, and unlike what it says in the description, som frustration. May not come in the form of pixel hunting, but make sure you try everything. EVERYTHING. Not kidding either, it'll save you some time, instead of spending an hour pixel hunting only to realize it was something so obvious. Banging your head into a wall for ten minutes is a quick way to a migraine, one I wouldn't recommend. Anyways, back to the review. If you have some experience in HomeStuck, then you will have some nice little eggs left from Easter to enjoy. My Ratings:\n\nMusic: 9/10. There are a few tracks i'm not a huge fan of, but I love most of the music in this game.\nStory: 9/10. I will not spoil anything about the story. But, I can say wholeheatedly that prior experience with HomeStuck is not required to play this game. Two seperate, although connected, stories.\nReplayability: 6/10. I haven't replayed it, but on my one playthrough, I only got half of the achievements that are present. Will be fun for Achievement Hunters to go through. \n\n\nI simply hope that Act 2 will be out within a year, but that is a pipe dream. I'm not a very patient person, but when the product is of a quality like this, I will wait. Not forever, but I will. Unlike most of the people who have boughten this game, I hadn't followed it religiously, and I didn't even know it had come out. I stumbled across it by accident, and I haven't been disappointed yet.  I haven't even finished HomeStuck yet, hell, I'm not even a third of the way through it.

But unlike homestuck, this takes place outside the SBURB game in the main homestuck lore, but also takes place in the same universe in the beta timeline but about 20-25 years into the past, the 90's.\n\nNow let's talk about the game's illustration and mechanics.\nThe artstyle is really charming and refreshing, incredible detail in the background illustration left and right, top to bottom. The music fits the mood perfectly, hell one part reminded me of the typical 90's rugrats music if you remember what WOOONK WOOONK instrument I'm talking about. The game's movement, interaction and flow is basicly....DURRrrr, point and click, with options that pop up on objects or items of interest. So far it needs to be polished for the system itself feels a bit clunky at times, buggy i might say. You progress by using items you find along your journey, sometimes even combining said items to make a puzzle or door work. Requires the minimal use of a braaaaaain.\n\nStory-wise I'm really digging the direction this game is headed. There is an obsessive amount of dialog if you use the pigeon on pretty much everything that is clickable in the background illustration, and incredible amount of story dialog as you progress the game. You can skip dialog, but some dialog is mandatory to progress and unskippable. The game is really short but will feel complete once the other acts are done.\n\nWould i recommend this game?\nYes, but Only if you're into point and click adventures. Like, seriously. You could be a huge homestuck fan, but if you dislike Point and click games you wouldn't like this game.\n\nYes if you don't mind a short game. Act 1 is about an hour the first playthrough and will leave you wanting for more.\n\nYes if your computer isn't a toaster. I had a fair-share of discovered bugs in-game, but others with inferior computers downright have games that crash upon startup or have broken cut-scenes. Please purchase this game if you are absolutely sure you can run it.\n\nWould i recommend this game to people who just want to explore without someone telling you what to do?\nMaybe. Personally i found Joey's brother Jude a chatterbox, and i mean, a big chatterbox, half the times i didn't even read what he had to say since he kept draggin on and on. Thankfully however the reason i say MAYBE is because there IS an option to just fast forward the dialog or completely ignore his walkie talkie calls. Some calls are mandatory, but you can fast foward through them.\n\nIs this game easy?\nIt requires thinking and problem solving. But you can beat the entire game without reading any other characters dialog, The narrator or self dialog tells you what you think or think you shouldn't do as you interact with random objects in the world, which is a direct hint. This game does require minimal use of a brain, please check the status of your brain or borrow or steal a new one if needed and preserve the tissue in formalin in a container before use.\n\nOverall i do recommend this game even if you never read homestuck, you don't need to read homestuck at all to dive into hiveswap. You might spend about an hour or two trying to beat the game the first time, especially if you read every single dialog. Second playthrough once you know exactly what to do, you can beat the game in about 10 minutes or less.\n\nWhat can be done to improve the game if you're WhatPumpkin dev and you're reading this?\nWell iron out those bugs and for the sake of the people who can't run this game, try to make this game more compatible. Advertise the game once all the Act's are out, some people who are homestuck fans are unaware this game is even out to this day. I'm sorry but this game was poorly advertised, everything including the greenlight was pretty much community spread word2word.\n\nWhat can i suggest for you, the person who's reading this that might purchase the game, to do to have an ultimate experience with this game?\nIf you have the patience made out of iron. I would recommend you just wait until all the ACT's are released, that way you can experience a clean flow of uninterupted content, and possible performance bugs fixed. Having a cliff hanger and waiting for months for a new act is a real drag unless you're chill and ok with it. But if you're new to Homestuck in general or a veteran with patience, wait until all the acts are released.

(Also what have you been doing with your life they're point and click adventure games????) The universe of homestuck is explained through bits and pieces that don't bore fans but also slowly introduce newcomers into the world.

It has fun (but new) characters.\n\n\n[b]Graphically great[/b] \n\nthe abstract simplicity of the characters/enemies and so on really stands out with the high detailed but bright backgrounds. Everything pops out at you and in terms of game play you don't feel like the world is meshed like you can get in other point and clicks. It's real eye candy. Almost every room is jamed with stuff, but clearly defined.\n\n[b]Animation [/b] \n\nFollowing from the art, the animation is generally smooth and nice. The cute scenes don't feel like interruptions into the game and they don't come in for minor crap alot.\n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nMusic is good. Which is great, because you're going to be listening to it for an hour when you trying to find an item you need.\n\n[b] Writing [/b]\n\nThe writing is good. The characters have instnatly distince personalities as soon as they speak and almost every item you can interact with have some sort of personal, and new, dialogue. Wich is a relief as many games resort to bland, recycled commentary.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe cons:\n\n[b]Against Homestuck[/b]  If you weren't really a fan of homestuck to begin with, I doubt this will really flip your opinion. It's not exactly made to break away from it. It brings to the table what the audience ordered and you probably don't like the audience.\n\n[b] Gameplay[/b]\n\nHonestly, there are not a lot of puzzles in this. While you do have to overcome obstacles, chances are that most of them you already know the answer and will simply need to find the right item. However, in its defence. It dosen't have stupid, obscure, convulted solutions to a really obvious problem. Except for maybe one case which you will figure out in 5 seconds because it still makes sense.\n\nStrifing is also a bit weird, it presents itself like a turn based battle-which is keeping with the theme of homestuck- but it's actually just a differently framed Puzzle. \n\n[b] Length [/b]\n\nIt's pretty short, honestly. Is it worth 6 bucks, I don't know. I would of liked a bit more to it for the costs. What in it is fun though and it got a few hours at least.\n\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\n\nRating: Theme Park Tour.\n\nYou basically are on a ride in this game most of the time. Your input is still needed and it simulates a sense of urgency fairly well, there is never a case where SOMETHING isn't happening SOMEWHERE and it requires your controlled character to do something, with implied stakes being life or death. So, feel at ease that the game at least put weight on your actions even if you are bound by story to simply see the actions through.\n\nThe writing is nice, the animation is nice, the world is nice, the art is nice. It's a very casual, very fun roller coaster of a game, which, it being a point a click act 1, you probably expect.  \n\nIs this ride worth the price of admission...well...if you want to kill some time with a story. Yes. \n\nif you're a homestuck fan: yes.\n\nIf your a massive fan of point and clicks: yes\n\nor you're a very casual type of gamer who likes to explore but it keep it laid back: yeah.\n\nIf you're searching for intense puzzles, open ended choices an freedom, then no.

Not so strong on the whole gameplay aspect, but it makes up for it in story. It's designed to be understandable by non-Homestuck fans too, and even they will most likely enjoy it.\n\nThe good:\n- Art and music is fantastic\n- Compelling dialogue/story\n- Clever and humorous interactions\n- Unique object interactions- every object has a unique interaction with every other object and everything in the background. That's a ridiculous amount of interactions.\n\n\nThe bad:\n- Uninspiring puzzle design (they're not really puzzles, more like tasks. You find which object interacts with which thing to progress.

I stopped following it around the time of the final update (which sucked tbh) but if im being truthfull I stopped being majorly into the fandom around 2014. The fandom started to shrink from people leaving and whoever was left were rude, childish and kind of violent? Nevertheless I still lowkey love homestuck and when this game finally aired I suddenly remembered being so excited when the game was announced to be made years back and I promised myself then that I'd buy it. So I did. And man this made me so nostalgic of when I first started reading the comic and played the first mini game! It makes you think of how this fits into the first acts of the comic and gives you a glimpse of how awful Grampa Harley really was (i mean he gave jade a gun when she was like a toddler? please.) and it takes you back to a simpler time of the basic homestuck formula -> Kids V.S House.

As for the mini games with the troll tablet, if you click you'll get past the art screen otherwise you'll end up sitting there waiting like a loser. The mouse has quite a bit of lag, more than I would like considering there isnt much wiggle room for clicking things but its doable.

Except not.\nI'll be the 100th person to admit that the more recent announcements for the game were not what I expected. I didn't even expect it to be for the PC, let alone have nothing to do with Sburb. But that didn't stop me from buying it the day it came out.\nInitially, I was pretty skeptical. In the first 10 minutes of playing, I'd already spotted to in-game glitches and I wasn't impressed. My cynical mind could only think, \"How many years had this been in the making? How much money did this earn again?\" But it was whatever. I was here to support one of my favorite webcomics turned game with three of my favorite creators boasting a hand in it's production, and get in on those sweet, sweet references. Quality was the least of my concerns (but still a concern none the less). But after the latest update, most of those quality concerns were swept away and I enjoyed the story in it's entirety and let me tell you. I finished it today and it was more than I would have ever hoped. I'm in love all over again. The characters are so well made and while I don't love all of them, I do admit that it's not because they're poorly written. In fact, their flaws make them enheritly better fleshed out. The game is FUN, though more story-based, with little player interaction other than telling the character where to go and some amount of puzzle solving skills. As the description says, you don't NEED to have read Homestuck in order to get into the game. In fact, the actual Homestuck references that would go over an unknowing player's head are rather few and far between, but just enough to make a old or new fan go, \"O SHOOT SON.\" \nMy only REAL complaint is the length. I thought $7.99 was a steal for a brand new game, but after beating the entirety of it in two not overly lengthy sittings, I can honestly say it was about 8 bucks of content. Which is to say it was about the length of one graphic novel, which is accurate pricing. For a more frugal and savvy fan, they may consider waiting until all the Acts come out and buy them in bulk. But you won't find me putting myself through that; You can bet I'll be buying Act 2 on it's release date as well, and I feel like that says something on my opinion of this game as a whole. \n\nTl;Dr: If you're thinking of checking it out, just do it bro.

For the former: yes, this is the Homestuck you know... in video game form!\n\nIf you're the latter: I can't think of any better way to dive into this franchise. The art is beautiful, the music is amazing, the characters have more depth than a tunnel, and overall the whole package is just so full of heart. At its core, the plot is straightforward: teenage girl Joey Claire finds herself stuck on an alien world with no way home and must find a way to survive. You know, the usual faire.\n\nAs you play your way through the admittedly simple puzzles though, you'll find something else: like its parent Homestuck, Hiveswap is about relationships. As you search Joey's home to find flashlight batteries, you'll quickly find signs pointing towards the distressed relationship she shares with her absent, adventure-loving father. You'll learn about Jude, her paranoid dweeb of a brother whom she still loves. You'll learn about her mother, her dearly departed role model.\n\nAnd that's just while you're still on Earth.\n\nWhile Hiveswap is far, far more accessible than Homestuck, there are still a few artifacts of the franchise that will disorient newcomers a little bit. Battle sequences mimic a traditional combat system, rather than being one in of themselves. The game also jumps to different points of view every now and then. They don't last too long, but they can be disorienting. The hint function is completely useless as of this review.\n\nThese flaws aside, I still wholeheartedly recommend this game.

To me, I wish there were more obscure jokes that would be special to the long time fans, but to be honest, I'm glad they didn't put any of that. I'm glad that they decide to pull back all the old Homestucks and put some new quirks.

This game is rather short as a warning, but it's packed full of details where you can interact with the environment and get different reactions for doing so. Think of older games like Discworld where you can retrieve items to advance with puzzles and can use these items where they don't belong to get some rather funny responses.\n\n  The music is great, the amount of detail and humor is great, it still sticks to the same algorithm as the comic for the most part while fitting into a side scrolling world. There's been a lot of hardships for this and it's finally here - I'd say this is exactly what we were wanting too. I'd reccommend this for everybody since the characters have wonderful personalities that you can grow attached too, like they should be.\n\nMy only complaint is there are some game breaking bugs that are pretty severe in some cases or just silly and not harmful in others.

L'une des raisons pourquoi ce jeu a explos\u00e9, c'est parce qu'on peut retrouver de grands noms dans les personnes qui ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 ce jeu, avec notamment Toby Fox, le cr\u00e9ateur du fameux Undertale et de sa soundtrack incroyable, et Andrew Hussie, le cr\u00e9ateur de MSPaintAdventures et, bien s\u00fbr, de Homestuck.\n\nPour ceux qui ne le connaissent pas, Homestuck est un webcomic totalisant plus de 8 000 pages (et ce sur plus de 8 ans) ayant amass\u00e9 un fandom massif mais \u00e0 tr\u00e8s mauvaise r\u00e9putation. Et c'est dans l'univers de Homestuck que le jeu se passe, ce qui l\u00e0 encore a beaucoup contribu\u00e9 au succ\u00e8s de ce jeu: apr\u00e8s l'annonce du d\u00e9veloppement d'un jeu vid\u00e9o bas\u00e9 sur Homestuck sur Kickstarter en 2012, il n'aura fallu que 32 heures pour qu'Andrew atteigne son but de 700 000 dollars, et au bout d'un mois sa campagne aura amass\u00e9 quasiment 2 500 000 dollars, soit trois fois plus que son but original, preuve du d\u00e9vouement des fans du webcomic.\n\nMalgr\u00e9 tout, il aura fallu un peu plus de cinq ans pour voir le premier acte de ce jeu sortir; en effet, \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re des jeux de Telltale Games, l'histoire de ce jeu sera divis\u00e9e en quatre actes, puis un autre jeu, nomm\u00e9 Hauntswitch, sortira et prendra le relais (d'apr\u00e8s ce que j'ai compris). Le prix d'un acte \u00e9tant actuellement de huit euros, on peut supposer que le jeu complet rassemblant les quatre actes sera au prix de 32 euros. Mais alors, est-ce que tout cela vaut vraiment le coup ?\n\nEh bien, tout d'abord, penchons-nous sur ce que le jeu a \u00e0 nous offrir. Dans Hiveswap, ou du moins son premier acte, on incarne successivement Joey Claire, Jude Harley et Xefros Tritoh, le dernier \u00e9tant un troll (oui, les fameux trolls de Homestuck) \u00e0 l'instar des deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents personnages qui sont humains. Chaque personnage a une personnalit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise (peut-\u00eatre un peu moins Jude \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'on ne le joue que tr\u00e8s peu compar\u00e9 \u00e0 ses deux cong\u00e9n\u00e8res), nous rapprochant beaucoup d'eux.\n\nL'histoire se passe au beau milieu des ann\u00e9es 90, ce qui donnera lieu \u00e0 de nombreuses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 son sujet, ainsi qu'au sujet de Homestuck: beaucoup d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments para\u00eeteront assez flous aux yeux de ceux qui n'ont pas lu le webcomic (on peut citer le concept des lusus et des moirails, par exemple) tandis que les habitu\u00e9s de Homestuck sauront reconna\u00eetre des choses que les autres seraient incapables de distinguer (notamment les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences aux cherubs ou le fait que la babysitter de Joey et de Jude est (sans doute) Roxy Lalonde de Homestuck). C'est sans doute l'une des choses qui peuvent repousser les nouveaux arrivants, mais rassurez-vous: m\u00eame sans avoir lu le webcomic \u00e0 la base de Hiveswap, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de l'avoir fait pour passer un bon moment.\n\nLe jeu est un point and click: bien que cela puisse sembler assez ennuyant au premier abord, ce qui d\u00e9marque Hiveswap c'est le fait qu'on peut utiliser (presque) n'importe quel objet de votre inventaire sur (presque) n'importe quoi, donnant lieu \u00e0 des textes de narration plus intelligents et marrants les uns que les autres. Parce que oui, Andrew Hussie lui-m\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de l'\u00e9criture des textes, donc si vous esp\u00e9riez trouver quelque chose tr\u00e8s similaire \u00e0 Homestuck, vous ne pouviez pas tomber mieux. Il y a quelques sc\u00e8nes de combat dans Hiveswap, mais elles ne consistent que \u00e0 trouver quelle combinaison d'objets utiliser sur quel monstre; cela est malgr\u00e9 tout compens\u00e9 par les textes cocasses s'affichant lors des tours, rendant une exp\u00e9rience ennuyante \u00e0 la base tr\u00e8s sympathique au final.\n\nLa difficult\u00e9 n'est franchement pas un probl\u00e8me dans Hiveswap: le jeu vous aide lors des \u00e9nigmes et s'assure que vous ne restiez pas bloqu\u00e9s car vous avez loup\u00e9 un objet irr\u00e9cup\u00e9rable. Lors des combats, il est impossible de perdre: le game over est impossible dans cette partie (mais tout de m\u00eame possible, m\u00eame si tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 faire !), vous laissant le temps de tenter chaque item et chaque combinaison en paix.\n\nMa partie favorite est sans aucun doute la bande son. On nous a promis du Toby Fox, et on ne nous a pas d\u00e9\u00e7u du tout, au point o\u00f9 je me suis senti oblig\u00e9 d'acheter la soundtrack \u00e0 8 euros pour soutenir le travail des compositeurs (oui, Toby Fox n'est pas le seul compositeur dans Hiveswap). Je n'ai pas grand chose \u00e0 vous dire dessus, si ce n'est de bien profiter des musiques de Hiveswap ou, si vous ne comptez pas l'acheter, [strike]le cracker[/strike] \u00e9couter ses musiques sur YouTube. Les animations aussi sont tr\u00e8s raffin\u00e9es, mais l\u00e0 encore je ne peux pas vraiment tout vous d\u00e9crire de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise: allez donc regarder les bandes annonces de Hiveswap o\u00f9 vous pourrez vous faire une meilleure id\u00e9e de la qualit\u00e9 globale des animations et du dessin.\n\nIl y a malheureusement un point qui est assez n\u00e9gatif: la dur\u00e9e de vie. En effet, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'il m'aura fallu quelques cinq heures pour terminer le premier acte, le terminer en deux, voire une heure est possible. La rejouabilit\u00e9 ne compte que sur la multitude de combinaisons d'objets possibles dans et en dehors des batailles, et m\u00eame avec \u00e7a, il sera difficile de continuer \u00e0 \u00e9prouver beaucoup de plaisir \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 Hiveswap apr\u00e8s une dizaine d'heures de jeu. Les mauvaises langues pourront dire que c'est tr\u00e8s faible en citant le fait qu'il aura fallu attendre cinq ans pour la sortie du jeu, mais pour huit euros, je ne dirais pas que tout est g\u00e2ch\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de \u00e7a. Il y avait aussi quelques bugs \u00e0 la sortie du jeu, notamment avec la r\u00e9solution, mais apr\u00e8s avoir jou\u00e9 \u00e0 la nouvelle version, je pense que tous les bugs majeurs sont partis.\n\nEn conclusion, au m\u00eame titre qu'Undertale, Hiveswap est un tr\u00e8s bonne exp\u00e9rience si vous \u00eates \u00e0 l'aise en anglais et si vous aimez la lecture. Il ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que le second acte sort avant 2022 !

now, after 5 years of waiting, it's finally here, so let's check some mandatory Pros and Cons of this game:\n Pros\n1.- The Dialogue: Hilariously Genius, the dialogue is almost perfect, made with a lot of Popular Culture, some jokes and stupid (and oddly funny) puns.\n2.- Narration: Is just cool, feels kinda like a comic........*cough* homestuck *cough*.\n3.- Classic Point & click: Do I really have to explain this one?\n4.- Yes you have to: Well then, Hiveswap is made like a Classical Point & Click with the main difference being that there is a different dialogue for almost everything you can click and combine, so that's always cool.\n5.- Devs actually listen: When the game was first released, there was a bug with the resolution f***ing up and you had to change it and restart, now it's been a week since the game was released and this bug (along other minor problems) has been already fixed, would you look at that?\n\nCons\n1.- Kinda short if you ask me :/\n\nThat's pretty much I can

Edutainment games were the only kind our parents let us play as kids, and well, a lot of those tend to be p&c adventure games. So it stands to reason that Hiveswap was a major throwback for me, from the familiar routine of clicking everything in the environment and using everything on everything in frustration (except that the interaction text went a long way in attenuating that frustration), to the manual saving (and forgetting to do it), to the awkward BGM-filled pauses as you pondered the solutions to the puzzles, etc etc.\n\nBasically, Hiveswap recreates the feel of 90s/early 00s p&c adventure games incredibly well, and to its own benefit, because that drew me right into the world. The game is beautiful; the art is atmospheric and lush and just a treat to look at. The spaces truly feel lived-in and the attention to detail is magnificent. The music complements it perfectly, too\u2013none too dramatic, and atmospheric without overtly dictating how you\u2019re supposed to feel.\n\nAlso outstanding was the way that the story of Joey and Jude\u2019s family was told just through interaction text. They managed to pull off a backstory for Grandpa Harley that not only flows seamlessly with the HS canon and does not feel like a forced afterthought, but is also affecting and kind of heartbreaking. It's a deftly-handled exploration at the lives of the children of an absentee parent. It\u2019s all just superb storytelling (and rather reminiscent of HS).\n\nBasically, Hiveswap absolutely does stand on its own merits; knowing Homestuck offers depth and insight into certain characters, but is ultimately not compulsory.\n\nMy main complaint is that the cutscenes initially didn\u2019t work on my fairly low-end laptop, but that\u2019s mostly a problem on my end. The interface got in the way at times, and I felt a little jilted by the Strife scenes which turned out to not be real combat\u2013but I\u2019m less bothered by it in hindsight.\n\nI have yet to find every secret of the game--there's just so much to be discovered--so I'm definitely going to give this a second playthrough.

Was quite sad when it ended, it was definitely something I'll never forget experiencing. Of course, I had heard of Hiveswap, but I sorta just forgot about it after all the delays (yes, I understand that it wasn't Hussie's fault).\n\nCome the day before the release of Act 1. My friend comes up to me at lunch time during school and says \"Guess what comes out tomorrow?\" I had actually forgotten, so he had to tell me it was Hiveswap. Since I wasn't able to purchase the game myself, he gifted it to me. \n\nI start up the game, and take in the title screen. Oh boy, the music is great already.\n\nEven though this Act is short, it really shows a lot of personality in the characters and builds a memorable cast easily. The humor in the game is very similar to the comic's humor, which I absolutely adored. The soundtrack is great (Rustblood in particular I remember well because the gOD DAMN SLOTH TREATS) and I've listened to it many times over without it getting old to me. The effort put into Hiveswap shows in the animation, environments, and pretty much the entire game. There's plenty of hidden achievements for achievement hunters out there. \n\nIn it's entirety, this game is amazing, and in my opinion it was definitely worth the wait.

The animation is well drawn and detailed with quality sound. I like how unique the text is for nearly every possible use of an item against another object. The shift in perspective of characters in the story kept it interesting too. I didn't have any technical issues (Win10/Intel/Nvidia) along the way unlike other reviews that I've seen. It takes about 2-3 hours to finish this act which isn't bad for $8 assuming full price. I'll likely be playing the future acts if/when they release.\n\nAs for the negatives:\n- This is only Act I. Honestly I'm a bit tired of games releasing in episodes/acts/etc since who knows if the rest will ever come out and how consistent the quality will remain. Plus sometimes they've nickel and dimed you by the final release.\n- Animation is a bit clunky... the walking pace at times is a bit jittery with the character animations.\n- Can't re-examine items in inventory... this is a strange absence for a point & click since you can only identify your items by memory/icon alone without trying to use it\n- Inventory dropdown would persistently open at times even though I previously closed it \n- The forced perspective of character in the room seemed a bit off, and sometimes it was confusing figuring out which way to move to walk around a room that's open to exploring.", "timestamp_created": 1505964003, "timestamp_updated": 1505964213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500720", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35096426": {"recommendationid": "35096426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103197326", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505549172}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, I'm impressed! It's only Act 1, but the little bits of story and character development we've gotten so far have sucked me in. I want to learn about and do more with the four main characters!

There are so many references to the 90's and to Homestuck that a bunch of people are bound to love!\n\nI personally didn't mind exploring and reading it all, though some people might find it tedious (anybody familiar with Homestuck already knows what to expect). Some people might also find the puzzles and battles too easy. I didn't mind too much, plus it's only the first Act, so who knows what else we'll be put up against. I also didn't have any of the issues I've been hearing about with the cutscenes or black boxes, so I can't really comment on those. Some people are satisfied with the length of the first Act, some are disappointed, it really depends on the person and how much time you spend exploring.\n\nThe quirky charm and humor that I was hoping for was also there in the way the characters interacted with each other and the world around them. (A particular scene with Jude is my favorite so far in this game).\n\nOverall, thrilled it's finally out, felt like it was an awesome intro to a 4-part game (and then we get Hauntswitch after that!), and can't wait for the next Act.

After years of production drama hearsay and lost faith, I've been nervously anticipating this game and trying to keep an open mind.  Overall, I'm relieved with the results.  And full disclosure, this review is voiced from the perspective of someone comparing it to the webcomic, which may or may not be fair, but is the only way I can personally judge it.\n\nThe positives:\n-Beautiful, atmospheric background art and cutscene animation.  The illustrated backgrounds strike a sharp contrast with the aliased photo-manipulation art of the original comic, but the art team did a great job creating scenes that fit in well with the vividly colored worlds of Homestuck.\n-Fantastic soundtrack.  James Roach struck me as an unusual choice for music lead back when it was announced, given the vast arsenal of music team members from the original comic, but it's clear now that it was the right one.  The music is quirky and fun, and it never gets tiring (except for maybe one song, you know they one).  I really appreciate the FFVII homage pieces.  And, of course, Toby Fox's song-writing cannot be beat.\n-I love the characters.  Joey is such a likable protagonist.  She strikes me as the sort of character Jade was always supposed to be.  Both her and Xefros have some very nuanced personality traits and flaws, and learning more about their lives and their thoughts from exploring the environment was my favorite part of the game.  And the end of the act threw an emotional punch that I was not expecting, but was happy to see (especially after some character arcs were rather clumsily handled in the conclusion of the webcomic).\n-The flavor text.  There is SO much optional flavor text.  I've been trying every combination of item/action on object I can manage in the game, and nearly everything gets its own unique flavor text.  Even though the playtime of this act is short, if you're dedicated to exploring the environments and interested in milking out every tidbit of lore you can spend hours with it.\n-The setting.  Specifically, the background of 1994 (It's difficult for me to judge the depiction of Alternia just in this game, given how I'm already familiar with it, but additional tidbits of world-building were lovely).  I love the way this game acknowledges nostalgia without shoving it down our throats.  The fact that that the game is happening in the early-mid Nineties is completely incidental to the plot, and if you were too young to get the references then there's not much lost, since the text is more interested in pointing out the absurdity and humor of ancient trends then reveling in their greatness.  The setting mainly serves the purpose of being a cute, refreshing backdrop and sometimes the butt of a joke.  I think a certain popular novel-soon-to-be-movie can take a lesson here on the proper way to use nostalgia in your science fiction.\n\nThe cons:\n-The most obvious thing here are the glitches and they typos.  I was lucky enough to not be hit by any of the bugs that effect the cutscenes and the music, but I did play through the entire game with the resolution/letterboxing glitch.  These along with the VAST amount of typos and grammatical errors give the impression that the game wasn't playtested enough (or really at all).  Hopefully a patch will be released to fix these.\n-The UI could have been better.  Nothing game-breaking, but the overlay is large and gets in the way of some clickable objects.  Additionally, there are some instances when you have to click the edge of the screen multiple times to, say, descend some stairs because the screen doesn\u2019t move enough.\n-The combat.  The puzzles in this game were fairly simple.  The game basically tells you what to do most of the time, and I don't think that's a bad thing, especially considering that most people playing this probably won't have much experience with point-and-clicks.  But the strife sequences are confusing and unintuitive, especially with the flashing text that disappears before your eyes have a chance to figure out what they are looking at.  Luckily there is no way to fail, since you don't have any HP.\n-The humor.  And this might not be fair, since the humor wasn\u2019t really bad, but I had some expectations going into the game.  This is a warning for the Homestuck fans who are curious about how the writing compares to the comic: the humor is very tame, and it's plainly not written by Hussie (you don\u2019t need the credits to see that).  If you asked me what my favorite part about Homestuck was, I'd probably tell you it was the characters.  But if you asked me why I loved the characters, it would have to be because of the brilliant comedic voice given to them by the author.  Karkat's disgustingly colorful and creative strings of profanity read like poetry.  Dave's long and uncomfortable metaphors filled to bursting with human sexual innuendo still make me double over in laughter all these years later.  Fists full of penis, heads full of empty, babies dual-wielding flintlock pistols: nothing in this game can really compare to the wordsmithing hilarity that was found in the comic.  Humor is subjective, and there were plenty of moments in this game that got a smirk out of me, but if you are looking for more of the magic that was Homestuck's comedic gold you will not find it here.\n\nOverall, I rate this game as not a disappointment.  Most of my complaints a fairly minor and they didn\u2019t ruin the experience of the game.  I honestly think that fans of the franchise will look more harshly at it than newcomers due to that high expectation left by Homestuck and the frustration with production setbacks.  However, there is plenty to enjoy for both camps, and Hiveswap deserves to be taken as its own body.  I\u2019m eager to see it get more exposure and pushed into the mainstream.  Since this is only the first part of 4 I can't say much about the plot yet, but I'm excited to see where it goes.

Everyone who doesn't fit that exact bill I would warn away for a few reasons:\n\nThere isn't much content. It was only three hours for me and I am very very bad at puzzle games. It could be about 1 1/2 or less for someone good at games and focusing on it. The background art is pretty but the actual sprites are choppily animated and when it goes into detail shots it looks like they haven\u2019t finished painting it. I can clearly see brush strokes in ways that do not look artistic. It looks lazy. Some of the animations look like they've been slid to the side rather then properly done too. The screen postion glitches like crazy and if you are not in the exactly correct angle you cannot click things you can clearly see. There isn't any explanation for anything, not even basic game mechanics, and it starts out slow and rather boring. It gets progressively better but honestly doesn't even remotely live up to the hype. The best part of the entire game were the chatlogs and you barely do any game-like things with those. If I had brought this while still excited about it I would have been severely disappointed. \n\nIf you look at it from an indie perspective it\u2019s a cute game that could be worth your money if you like puzzle games, but from a professional perspective it\u2019s under finished and lazy.

Hearing about this game immediately got me super-pumped, and while it did take 5 years, I was happy to wait for this game. I wasn't able to back it, but I was as eager as everyone else to see this game release, and finally it was!\n\nNow, upon first purchasing the game, I experienced some bugs. Cutscene skipping, specifically, which is a common bug with the game. It's NOT your computer, guys! \n++A fair reminder, What Pumpkin is a new developer studio, and even huge AAA-Title games, devs and studios have huge, HUGE game-breaking bugs in their games at launch. (Mass Effect, anyone?)\n\nThat being said, I was able to test the new build and the game worked FANTASTICALLY! I was able to watch the cutscenes, and there was minimal lagging- due to my computer's low processing. But still, the game was playable, I had no hitches that hindered gameplay.\n\nNow, the actual game...is wonderful. Homestuck fan or not, casual or serious, no experience with the fandom whatsoever- this game exists peacefully in all realms. The references were there, but made to cater to all audiences, not alienate. (Which is something I HATE in other games, making obscure references that only hardcore fans would know)\nThe animation is lovely. The music is ASTOUNDING. The UI is intuitive, simple, attractive and thematic. The dialogue written between characters is natural and nothing is forced to resemble Homestuck in any way. While the first Act is only a few hours long, for a person like me who has problems focusing, it was the perfect length, especially for an episodic that is $8 a pop. PLUS, I got the Soundtrack Bundle, and the OST is fantastic. \n\nNot to mention, ALL OF THE 90S REFERENCES. The moment Pogs were mentioned, I was thrown back into my youth where pogs were everywhere and Clarissa, indeed, Explained It All.\n\nOverall- this game is WONDERFUL. I'm looking forward to the next Acts and Hauntswitch as well.

While the game had a few bugs when I played (specifically two, in my opinion, minor ones with screen transitions not being smooth and one incident of an slightly off-center screen for a bit of dialogue) it didn't overwhelm the story or experience and were easy to play past. The characters are great, and I love how their personalities are constantly expressed whenever you explore the world (Earth or Alternia) from their perspective. And they have WONDERFUL personalities at that! I love practically all of the characters in the game, the ones from Homestuck and the new ones who are introduced!\nWhile the combat/strife is somewhat pointless the puns and entertainment from them are still a great experience and fit with the whole \"puzzle and solution\" focus of point-and-click adventures to an extent. The artwork is spectacular and the design of the environments have lots of detail and help immerse the player into the game even more.\nA GREAT game for Homestuck fans and people looking to try out the point-and-click genre (though if your looking for complex puzzles to really challenge yourself this isn't really the game to do it) and a fun way to spend a few hours and have a couple (or a lot) of laughs. Some people are complaining that ACT 1 is too short, but there's so much too look at and have fun with that the game takes up a couple of hours (mostly if you're intent on exploring EVERYTHING, which I recommend you should) and the quality overall is outstanding, even if the quantity isn't as much as one would expect because of the time in production. But then again, this is only the first ACT and the real meat of the game will most definitely be in the ones to follow as was the case with Homestuck itself.\nSorry for the essay, this is just an AWESOME game that I would recommend to anyone who has a ten dollar bill and I'm hyped for what ACT 2 will bring to the table because if it's anything like ACT 1 it's going to be AMAZING!!!", "timestamp_created": 1505882643, "timestamp_updated": 1505882643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35076874": {"recommendationid": "35076874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280475214", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505940472}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely terrific first act!

I\u2019ve played a few point and click adventures in my time, but none that feel as full and vibrant as Hiveswap, with its beautifully rendered environments and wonderfully fitting soundtrack. The areas you explore feel alive, like actual lived-in spaces chock full of personality in their own right. This, along with the clever and humorous tone of the writing, means the way you learn about the characters from examining objects and areas in their homes feels natural in a way that games seldom land. Speaking of the characters, they\u2019re all wonderful. One of Homestuck\u2019s strong suits has always been its character writing, and it really shows in the main cast of the game. They\u2019re just a bunch of kids, each with their own hobbies and interests, but also their own aspirations, worries, and problems that they have to reckon with. I won't go too deep into specifics, because you really ought to meet these kids for yourself. They all feel unique and human (or er, not, as the case may be) and interactions between characters were frequently my favourite parts of the game.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about getting Hiveswap because of the convoluted behemoth that is the source material, you shouldn\u2019t be. Even though they take place in the same universe, the events of Homestuck proper haven\u2019t even technically taken place yet, and familiarity with that story is not required. Everything that is relevant to the game is explained, and the stuff that isn\u2019t is just sort of hinted at in the background. The kind of stuff that might make fans of the comic go \u201chuh!\u201d but isn\u2019t critical in order for new players to understand and enjoy the game. Hiveswap completely stands on its own as an adventure game, and a darn good one at that! The solutions to the puzzles always make sense, even if they\u2019re not always immediately obvious. No combining a magnet and some human hair to make a fishing line or some such nonsense; the most convoluted these solutions ever get is putting some liquid in a bowl, or choosing the right moment for a refreshing energy drink. Even if you do get stuck it\u2019s not so bad, as mashing items together to try and find a solution is fun in its own right. The game always rewards you for trying to interact with it, even if you\u2019re not exactly accomplishing anything by doing so. There\u2019s unique text for seemingly EVERY combination of items on each other, and for using them on almost EVERY object in the environment. Seriously, it\u2019s mindboggling just how much optional text there is in this game. I\u2019m very tempted to go back and replay it just so I can try clicking everything on everything else, just to see what happens.\n\nAll that\u2019s not to say that Hiveswap doesn\u2019t have its own problems. Anyone who\u2019s followed the project from the beginning knows this game has had a troubled development, and at times I feel like it shows. There\u2019s definitely some bugs that need fixing, like the game loading in the wrong resolution the first time you play it, requiring you to manually change the settings and then restart it to apply them. On another occasion, I solved the puzzle in the trophy room only for the game to keep acting as though I hadn\u2019t, rendering the item you get for completing it unpickupable until I loaded my save and tried again. Only a minor time loss for me, but definitely the sort of thing I hope they patch out before it messes anyone else up. I have some other nit-picks too, like, why does the screenshot button advance the text? For that matter, why does any button other than the spacebar and mouse advance the text? It\u2019s annoying. And while we\u2019re at it, why doesn\u2019t my boy Xefros have an idle animation like the other kids?! He deserves one, dangit! In practice though, these are all things that I can (mostly) overlook because the majority of the game is just so good.\n\nAct 1 of Hiveswap is not a long game. I finished it in a little less than four hours, and that was including time spent exploring and finding most of the flavour text around the environments, though I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t see everything. It definitely comes down to how you feel about quality over quantity, and I at the very least feel like the quality is absolutely worth the price. This game is witty, funny, and at times just a little bit moving. As the credits rolled, I felt the way you might feel at the end of a really good book, only to realise as you turn the last page that you already want to read it all over again from the beginning. It\u2019s a really good video game, one that\u2019s rekindled my love of a series I thought I\u2019d given up on years ago. Hiveswap has wormed its way into my heart, and it is my one true, sincere hope that Act 2 doesn\u2019t take another five years to come out.\n\nPlease.

I was really excited to play it, but once I opened it up many of my worst fears came true and most of my hopes were crushed. I like the plot and the storyline and all that jazz, I'll give you that, but the gameplay. The gameplay is sort of decent at best. Now, I'm not sure if this is because my computer is just a tad bit out of date, but a lot of the cutscenes are very laggy and some of the frames blur together into a glitchy amalgamation. Half of the time when I'm in a battle, attempting to do something will make the game freeze, and the only way to keep playing is to force quit it and load it up again. About 20 minutes of my gameplay is me crashing it by making a wrong choice in battle, and going back to try and correct my mistakes. It's the game we've all been waiting for, but in my opinion, there are too many bugs and glitches for the game to be ready for the market.

But I do wish there were more animations for interactions and for when your character is chatting with another on the last part of the game. I tihnk there could be some good comedy.\n I wish there could have been more puzzle solving in this First ACT.

I regret not purchasing this with the soundtrack included as the soundtrack is my favourite part of this game.\n- Jam-packed with pop culture references and callbacks to the original webcomic.\n- Many great nostalgic 90's references.\n- Very witty writing.\n- Gorgeous environmental art.\n\nNegatives\n- The art and animation is inconsistent, there is a dip in quality as the game reaches it's conclusion.\n- For the $10AUD I paid for this, I really did expect there to be more content. I was able to finish this game at my own pace, whilst interacting with everything I could find in the world, in just under 2.5 hours. The pricetag is fairly hefty for what little playtime you're getting. Whilst I understand that this is only the first act in presumably many to come, value for money needs to be taken into consideration here.\n- For a point and click game, it's incredibly vague. I had to consult a walkthrough several times just because the game often doesn't make it clear enough what steps you need to take.\n- The battle system is quite confusing, and is in desperate need of a tutorial. Whilst it's not set up for you to fail (at this point) it can be quite frustrating.\n- The GUI doesn't make it clear enough as to what items you're utilising.\n\nSome improvements that could be made.\n-Cutscenes need to be better optimised.\n-GUI and strife/captchalogue system could use some tweaks to help make it clearer what you're actually doing with it. Visual feedback is important and unfortunately somewhat lacking in this game.\n-Some form of tutorial.\n-General polishing of the story and reasoning behind the items you're required to pick up.\n-Some new sound effects - that one constant bleep sound began to do my head in very quickly.\n-More content for what you're paying for - just because it's only one act doesn't mean it can't be more indepth.\n\nDo I believe this was worth the several year wait since the Kickstarter project? No, I would have expected several more acts to be released in this time frame with a much higher level of polish. This game pays homage to years of dedicated Homestuck fans, with clever callbacks and references, however it's just not [b]enough[/b]  for what you're paying for.\nI was so excited and enthralled as soon as the game started, but my enthusiasm very quickly dulled as I found myself getting confused and frustrated quickly, and before I knew it the game was over. \n\nHere's to hoping Act 2 is an improvement of Act 1.\n \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505823024, "timestamp_updated": 1505823024, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35062663": {"recommendationid": "35062663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019653000", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505820760}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f, \u0441 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445, \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0443\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0430. \u0411\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u043a\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1505821174, "timestamp_updated": 1505821174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35062499": {"recommendationid": "35062499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148283961", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510777531}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish it was longer.", "timestamp_created": 1505820467, "timestamp_updated": 1505820512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35061839": {"recommendationid": "35061839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006537321", "num_games_owned": 626, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511466937}, "language": "english", "review": "Played through the full Act in two and a half hours, with only one puzzle that truly stumped me (and then was actually easy for me to solve) - absolutely worth the $8 for the game if you want the first chapter of a fascinating story with gorgeous art, engaging characters and a true sense of humor.

It would take seven years to complete, but it was largely created by a single man, and it was massively long. It's impressive it did not take even longer.\n\nAndrew Hussie is a gifted writer. His comic is inventive, funny, and he did a remarkably good job of writing the complicated story as he went without tripping over himself. The characters were multi-faceted and interesting, the world was well developed, and the exposition was never dull to read. His artwork was also excellent - low detailed and made for speed, but expressive and visually appealing, and although he was a crude, novice animator, he had a real talent for making engaging flash videos. He was especially good at timing the action to a piece of music, which was even more impressive given that the songs were composed first, before the videos were even conceived. There was a constant sense of learning and escalation in the delivery - it began with simple GIFs and short flash projects and expanded to include inventive 10-minute short films. That progression made a nice motif for a story with themes of adventure, discovery, and coming-of-age.\n\nThe music was always done by volunteers. Homestuck's website carries two contributor pages - one for music and one for art. Beginning from a little over a year into Homestuck's run, Hussie would take some art submissions for use in his comic. At first this was only for the larger animation projects. But it grew increasingly more frequent, and when the comic ended, one could be forgiven for thinking that Hussie was no longer contributing to Homestuck at all: the final panels and the last animation were done entirely by others.\n\nThis of course brings us to Hiveswap, a kind of side-story video game set in Homestuck's multiverse, the creation of which, unbeknownst to the people who backed it on Kickstarter over five years ago, hardly appears to have involved Andrew Hussie at all. He is credited by the game as a writer and producer, and information from Hiveswap's dedicated tumblr indicates that he acted as a kind of creative consultant to the real brains behind the project: Cohen Edenfield.\n\nWho is Cohen Edenfield? According to an autobiographical update on the Hiveswap tumblr he is an English Lit graduate who shared an internet forum with Hussie over a decade ago. The body of his previous work consists of a twitter feed and Hiveswap's promotional material. Before release this did not encourage positive speculation: his former work is written in an insufferable self-aggrandizing voice that tries too hard to be funny.\n\nBut to his credit, his scripting for Hiveswap is not that bad. It's hard to say how much Hussie's advice helped, because What Pumpkin have been tight-lipped about the process of their development. About the only thing we do know is that they repeatedly failed to deliver on the release dates they promised, and that the project changed hands at least twice. But for the most part the dialog in Hiveswap is tolerable, and occasionally even funny. Edenfield does sometimes lay it on thick though. In Homestuck, the main character had a book titled \"Colonel Sassacre's Daunting Text of Magical Frivolity and Practical Japery.\" It's a minor joke how overly long and whimsical that title is, and it works for Homestuck's outwardly quirky tone. In Hiveswap, a book is similarly titled \"Pistols to Pelts: How to Turn Sweet, Intelligent Animals Into Weird Rugs and Stuff.\" The first example works because it's actually a plausible title, but the second really overdoes the joke and bungles it.\n\nIn Homestuck, the child characters have complicated, ever-changing views of their parents and their relationships. They were confused about who they wanted to be and what their roles in life were. All of this is to say that it did a good job portraying adolescence. Hiveswap doesn't really have that. Joey is fully decided on how she feels about her parents. She shows next to no self-doubt, and her dad is cartoonishly negligent to make that work. It's the same with the story's themes of revolution: the alien regime is entirely, ridiculously wrong and the characters are plainly meant to rebel against it. What exactly is that meant to portray? That monarchy and genocide are wrong? In conversation, the characters spout their life-stories unprovoked, especially Joey in the final scene of the game.\n\nTo be fair, this is only the first episode of many, and the later acts might resolve some of these story issues. I wouldn't be too surprised if it at least turned out to be a nice, classically structured adventure story with some decent character arcs. That much potential is there. The backgrounds are nice to look at and the animation is generally good, although there is a problem of the game being so visually cluttered that it sometimes hides the things you need to interact with, and there seems to be no way to tell what's a usable item and what's just background besides mousing over it all. The music is fine and works for the atmosphere but it's not memorable, so that I wouldn't recommend buying the soundtrack. Toby Fox has done much better musical work than this.\n\nAnd I understand that it isn't fair to compare such a short game to something like Homestuck. That's the point though. Adjust your expectations accordingly: Edenfield is no substitute for Andrew Hussie, and Hiveswap is not and will probably never be Homestuck. In one news update on the Homestuck website, Hussie promised that this game will play with the medium as much as Homestuck itself did. Nothing like that has been displayed so far. This is a decent, standard-fare modern adventure game, completely toothless in terms of both puzzles and story. I'm willing to give it a thumbs-up in Steam's system, and I would score it about a six and a half out of ten. But the recommendation is conditional: if you don't like adventure games this won't change your mind.

End of the day though, if they hadn't been over zealous about release dates, i don't think this would be a problem, the game came out in reasonable amount of time (a little over 4.5 years from the blank slate to the finish) which isn't unusual for games, especially one with so many complications, and this being a first time company.\n\nWith 10 hours and 100% completion of act 1 on record, i think its time to put in my review. First off, the art goes without saying in that is extremely attractive and well done. Although the characters themselves and much of the art did mimic the simplicity of the Homestuck style, the backgrounds were rich in detail and the animations smooth in movement, excluding from the nasty loading screens however, which hopefully will be fixed in a patch. Despite the clutter of some of the characters homes; such was well placed and built on each's personality very carefully, as well as many enjoyable references to the time period this game was set in. The plot was quite enjoyable for just being the beginning to the story, as the main character Joey interacts well with both other characters, and background characters, even ones we had presently been aware of were we fans of Homestuck itself, were handled well in explanation. It's especially important to notice that this game has very little relation to Homestuck at all, except for the apparent fact it is the same universe. A few people have been overlooking plot points as \"probably references to Homestuck\" but in fact I personally found very little references to the webcomic myself, and the ones that did exist explained themselves rather thoroughly, In fact, putting Homestuck aside entirely, people can still easily understand and enjoy this game.\n\n\nThere are of course, a few things on the downside to it. Theres a bird that dies, rather sad, some slightly strange interactions, and bugs in loading between cutscenes, as well as there being a deal of typos (specifically a name recall fail with several of your item uses) when interacting with your Deercat in the final cutscene. I was also a bit puzzled by the fact that e consistently mention the troll main character bleeding under the rocks (presumably to death?) up until the point where we move him out, and he is inexplicably scarcely injured. they did draw the Deercat bleeding, although i have some suspect drawing the troll not bleeding was to keep a rating, since his blood is red? \n\n\nThe game was a little short, I completed my first run in about 4-5 hours, including the annoying cutscene lag, but completed a speed run in under an hour, with similar lag issues. I hope that the second act will be greatly longer, with that release being without the cutscene lag, but regardless, I'll probably end up playing and enjoying it as well.

I've played point-and-click games Venus, where I get disappointed when I'm constantly barraged by the same soundclip of the protagonist saying \"I can't do that\". When I began playing Hiveswap, I was astounded. I got stuck in Joey's room for a full hour. And not because of a puzzle, but from my own volition. I tried every single item and hotspot combination. And I was fascinated by what I read. I became satisfied when I began getting achievements for trying seemingly innocuous combinations, which was super satisfying. After 8 hours, across a couple of days, I managed to finish Act 1. I was extremely satisfied. I even tried my hand at playing the game all over again, this time skipping all the flavor text. It took me around 15 minutes. That's when I realized my first playthrough was exactly how this game is squeezed out of its content.\nI for one found myself relieved with the change of graphics from 3D to 2D. It feels so much more like Homestuck in that way.\nThe music is just absolutely marvelous. I found myself tapping my foot, my knees, humming along with the music in each room. Even the characters, I gotta say, are a big step up from the source material. Through the constant use of the items and skills in the characters' sylladexes and strife specibi, I got to understand their motivations.

Wouldn't mind half so much if the navigation weren't a little janky, which brings up my only non-bug problem with the game.

I tried to get through the comic and I started speed skimming and was just really underwhelmed and bored with the comic. Even my friends who are fans of it tell me it's a bit difficult to read. I do enjoy and appreciate aspects of the Homestuck world tho, and actually have a friend who is a co-creator of the comic Vast Error, a Homestuck fan comic. She got me interested in the art style and animation, and that's what brought me to the game. Thankfully I knew enough about trolls to not be confused about the world xD\n\n*coughs* Onto the review. The game's cutscenes are super glitchy. I've heard they're creating a patch to make things run smoother, but every time it went to a cutscene, my screen would freeze and the sound would cut out, and I'd be in the next scene ;n;\" I had to open up youtube and watch the cutscenes there as I went, and continued to play the game. That was the biggest struggle for me and sucked some of the enjoyment of the game away from me. If you feel okay playing the game like that, go for it! Otherwise, wait for the patch.\n\nThe game is a point and click clue/puzzle game. Not really one of my favorites, but I was in it for the story. It was actually quite frustrating for me to spend a long time searching for things and mousing over everything to find the items to progress the story. I had to use a walkthrough a few times cause a few parts are really confusing.\n\nThe art is super adorable and gorgeous! I love watching the animations and the story made me excited for more, and that is what made the game for me despite still needing some work!\n\nWould honestly recommend the game despite it's bugs and the fact you can get through it in about 2-3 hours.

This was a beautiful game, with great characters, thrilling plot and I honestly can't wait for more. There was a lot of excitement to be dealt with since the beggining.. The writing was funny, relateable, and kept me wanting to know more of how everything was going to play out. \n\nNow I saw one revew saying there wasnt much character backgrounds or deveopment, and mabye that might have been because it was only the first freaking act (so we cant say for sure there wont be more character deveopment) but I beg to differ. You dont necessarily need to click every gosh darn thing in the game, but doing so gives you a lot of insight how each character thinks and their backgrounds and past. Which is exactly how the webcomic was, so I really like that it gave us the freedom to do that on our own whether we wanted to know more or not.\n\nIf I had to critize this game, it would be the battle scenes. Honestly it took me a while to figure out what to do before actually solving the puzzle. I guess they wanted to keep the homestuck feel to it, which it clearly did with the looped annimations and funny comments with each of your actions but it could've helped to explain how to properly initialize each action. \n\nAnyway, this is only act one and I already love the first characters introduced to the story and I sure as hell enjoyed the funny chatroom conversations.

The writing is hilarious - full of clever wordplay and pigeon antics and witty dialogue, but it also delves into some affecting subject matter (absent parents, classism, toxic friendships) with sincerity and sensitivity. The characters are really lovable, especially the main playable character Joey and a certain sport-loving butler boy. The soundtrack is terrific, with loads of catchy beats and haunting melodies - if you loved Undertale's music you'll be well at home here since Toby Fox co-composed! The backgrounds are absolutely gorgeously drawn, and they complement the writing by giving you a strong sense of the characters\u2019 lives and interests. The character designs and animations are just as wonderful \u2013 Joey\u2019s nervous fidgeting, peppy tapdancing, and acrobatic pirouetting are endlessly cute \u2018n charming. The animations have a snappy, bold, keyframe-heavy style \u2013 maybe some extra in-between drawings could have been added here and there, but given how enormously time-consuming hand-drawn animation is I understand why they used their frames economically. It already looks gorgeous and communicates the characters\u2019 personalities perfectly anyway!\n\nDon\u2019t feel discouraged if you\u2019ve never read Homestuck - you don\u2019t need any knowledge of the comic to enjoy Hiveswap since the story is so far self-contained and set years before Homestuck\u2019s events. Long-time fans will find tons of subtle Homestuck references hidden throughout the game, some just for fun, others filling in characters\u2019 pasts and adding an extra layer of intrigue.\n\nMy only complaint is that there\u2019re a few minor bugs and typos at the time of writing, but these will all likely be patched by WhatPumpkin soon. The most bothersome one is a resolution/camera-panning hiccup that can appear the first time you launch the game, but it\u2019s easy to fix since the bug seems to disappear for good if you relaunch the game after changing your resolution settings.\n\nOverall I give Hiveswap five out of five transuniversal tapdance teens\u2026 I can\u2019t wait for Act 2!", "timestamp_created": 1505689485, "timestamp_updated": 1505689485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35034913": {"recommendationid": "35034913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140504352", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505970817}, "language": "english", "review": "This game manages to be simultaneously fantastically nostalgic for anyone who's read Homestuck, and completely approachable and fun for anyone who hasn't. 100% worth giving $50 of my 8th grade Christmas money to kickstart this back in 2012.", "timestamp_created": 1505689271, "timestamp_updated": 1505689271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35034841": {"recommendationid": "35034841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300851039", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506188508}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved the humor and music in this game!!

For instance: the game's got a ton of dialog, and it goes on longer than I'd like, but I enjoy slowly getting to know the characters' via their banter and the jokes sometimes make me cackle with glee. However, I almost didn't realize that because it's exactly the same way I felt about Homestuck five years ago, and I took it for granted here. So yeah, take my praise with a grain of salt.\n\nThis game is a bunch of fun. The strife puzzle-solving sections are especially good, because they're inventive combat that leverages the game's true strength: Having jokes written for pretty much every bullshit combination of inventory item and puzzle object in the game. The puzzles aren't insane - you're not going to be spending an hour wandering around before you think to use \"Fork\" on \"Pile of Spaghetti\" to turn it into a fake hairdo - but they're odd enough that you'll try a couple wrong options, and there will always be something written for it. Hell, one time when I was stuck I tried to use a pile of pogs on a staircase crammed with guns and there was a response for *that*. I got into a fight I didn't know how to win and resorted to throwing everything in my inventory at the monster, and the monster replied with a pun for every single one. I might replay this game and just spend all my time mashing my inventory on the environment.\n\nSpeaking of replaying, the game's pretty short! About three hours, I think. I super wanted more - but I know there were some (for high values of \"some\") production problems, and I'm really glad they spent the money and time they had left on making a short game that's crammed with jokes and crazy visuals rather than a longer, blander game.\n\nSpeaking of crazy visuals, holy shit this game looks crazy good! Every scene is crammed with excellent bullshit going on, weird things scampering outside the windows, every shelf jammed with trash literature and nonsensical occult bric-a-brac and leg lamps and conspiracy theory diagrams. It's awesome.\n\nSo yeah!

I have to warn anyone who wants to buy this game: do not buy this for the puzzles. The puzzles and combat (which itself is still a puzzle, really) are fairly easy. Hiveswap is enjoyable mostly for its story and flavor text when trying to solve puzzles. If you're still here knowing that the puzzles aren't too amazing, then go for it. At eight dollars, this game is certainly worth it. There are many complaints about how short it is, and it is short, but it's not like it feels incomplete considering the price on it. It left off at a good point, and while I'm going to hate to wait for act 2, the game gives you enough content. If we had to wait another 5 years, then yeah this would be ridiculous, but What Pumpkin said that it shouldn't take nearly as long for act 2 to be released.\n\nThe game breaks down into about three different categories. I'll briefly talk about each one.\n\nExploration/puzzle solving: Like I said previously, the puzzles aren't anything special at all, but they're still fun for the most part, and the exploration to figure out the puzzles is entertaining due to the flavor text. However, I wouldn't buy Hiveswap if you're in it for the puzzles.\n\nCombat: The combats are actually small puzzles. You have to use the resources you have along with the terrain around you to defeat enemies. There were a few times that I got frustrated with the combat because the game didn't do a good job of visually displaying the problem with why <insert some item/ability> didn't work how it should've, but it was only like two times, and it did make sense afterward. Might've just been me brainfarting, but I do think there could've been better telegraphing for some of the combats. I really enjoyed this kind of combat/puzzle, however. It felt pretty rewarding to escape or defeat whatever it is you're facing, and the little quips used when you attempt to do something were a nice touch. Overall a small part of the game, but pretty enjoyable when it was there.\n\nStory: I think the best parts of the story are the interactions between characters. The interactions feel natural and stay interesting throughout the entire game. This was definitely my favorite aspect of the game, especially after interacting with the thing in the attic (no spoilers). The interactions were completely solid. As for the other aspects of the story, such as reading your diary or looking at pictures of family on the wall, etc., I enjoyed the sort of \"already know but thinking about\" perspective. It feels natural and gives you an idea about how the characters feel about each little story blob. \n\nYes, there are references to Homestuck in it. While they were very enjoyable, they're a small part of the game that aren't required to pick up on at all for a full enjoyment of the game itself. This game makes you care about the characters within itself, not characters from another story. \n\nI would certainly recommend this game! There are people who definitely wouldn't care for Hiveswap, don't get me wrong, but I think Hiveswap has a lot to offer to people who like more story-based games.

To be upfront on my mindset going in: I'm a fairly longtime homestuck fan, and have enjoyed a lot of the franchise for several years now. To say that I was looking forward to this game was an understatement, as I'm sure can be said about a lot of other people! However, as much as I was looking forward to this game and making sure to go into playing it with a fair mindset, there are a lot of things that need fixing for an episodic game that we've waited 5 YEARS for with each part to the game being 8 USD a pop.\n\n[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]\n\nThe visuals are absolutely beautiful! I love how unique they look, yet so close to the original comic we all know and love. I like the detail put into all of the backgrounds, animations and thensome, there was obviously love put into them.\n\nThe music is equally beautiful and served quite a bit to keep the flow of the story 'feeling' the way it should. The music was tense when needed, happy when it needed, uplifting when needed. I never found myself feeling odd or off with the choice of tune while I was pulling my hair out for the various little riddles or battling a local beast.\n\nThe characters are nice! I like the fact that the cast is entirely new, with the occasional throwback or reference to the older characters we know and love. The two human and troll characters, despite being introduced within a 2-hour game, have some sense of uniqueness to their design, and the good writing that accompanies them helps to flesh them out into quirky, lovable characters. I'm interested in seeing their progression through the story\n\n[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]\n\nThe depth of the game itself isn't good. Many times while playing did I find myself outright bored with what was going on--I felt like it would have been far more entertaining to just WATCH all the characters interact rather than trying to pick apart a riddle that, really, shouldn't have taken more than a few seconds to figure out. Instead of enjoying the silliness of the character's adventures through this game like I had with the characters of Homestuck, I found myself begrudgingly wasting fifteen minutes of my life for something that was so out-of-the-way that I don't understand how there weren't more hints to help me figure it out.\n\nImagine being on a road, and it's going in a very specific direction. Sure, there are cool stuff you'd love to do and investigate, but they're all off the road and you are absolutely not allowed to do that. You can appreciate from a distance all of those cool things, but you have a specific path you have to follow, which quickly depreciates a lot of possible fun when you realize that road is this game. You have little to no options other than the ones you are given--where I was imagining the battle system to be something like Pokemon (turn-based with a fair bit of choice) you get absolutely none of that, and yet it's still tagged as an RPG? No. This is a very linear game that gives you little-to-no options outside of the designated path programmed in it. Linear games can be great, don't get me wrong! Just don't lie and make it look like you are giving the player options and variety when you really are not. This game has the same branching story options as the Homestuck webcomic did: none.\n\nThere was no sense of appreciation or pride whenever I got through a challenging bit--more akin to a feeling of relief after you've finally finished all of your homework and want nothing more than to rip it to shreds so you don't have to keep looking at it and the countless minutes you've wasted on something that was stupidly difficult for no reason whatsoever than to make you take more time figuring it out.\n\nBugs. So many. Bugs. Whether it was the buttons not working or the screen of the game going askew and bugging out, there was no shortage of bugs. I shall remind you that this game took FIVE YEARS of development, and the first visual bug is on the OPENING SCREEN. For a game that has taken this long, cost 8 US dollars for only a less-than-2-hour experience (it personally took me about 1 hour and 45 minutes), this is absolutely unacceptable, especially for such a high-profile game from a very successful webcomic. Images below (if they work) are just a few examples of the visual bugs I'm talking about.\n\n[url=https://i.gyazo.com/a4d545b789eb68bae5f86c6fd0c92168.jpg]Image 1[/url]\n[url=https://i.gyazo.com/dba49cc1d14ac56d121c37a6ca57310e.jpg]Image 2[/url]\n\n\n[h1]FINAL OPINION:[/h1]\n\n[b]I wouldn't buy the game in its current state.[/b] Don't get me wrong, it looks and sounds beautiful, but that doesn't alone make a good game. Homestuck was perfect for the webcomic format, and I feel like Hiveswap could have also been a great webcomic, but it was ramshakled and forced into the videogame medium.

Most of the reviews you'll read on here are going to be people who either just found this game and are wondering what all the fuss is about, or people who've been waiting for this game to come out ever since the Kickstarter launched in 2012, and are just overjoyed to finally play it. I will admit, I belong to the latter group.\n\nBut if you want an honest review of this game, it's fantastic. The music is beautiful, the animation and artwork is fantastic, and it captures the comedy and storytelling style of Homestuck perfectly, without being completely impenetrable or falling into the bullshit the original story did. Is it more enjoyable if you've read that monstrosity of a webcomic? Yes. Is it still a really good game? Also yes. Hiveswap doesn't limit itself to Homestuck references, but branches into every aspect of the 90s, right down to poorly-disguised cameo posters for Metroid or The Neverending Story.\n\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I've seen is that there isn't enough play time to warrant its 8-dollar asking price. And it is certainly true that you *can*beat the game in two-ish hours. You can also spend twice that time and not even clear the house you start out in. It all depends on whether you feel like discovering every hidden dialog line and reaction. When they say you can combine everything with everything, they mean it. Every item can be used on every piece of background and every other item. Pog jokes abound, and there's a shocking amount of story you can discover just by poking around and trying things. \n\n\ntl;dr:\nIf you just want puzzles and nothing else, Hiveswap is not for you.

Todo lo dem\u00e1s es perfectamente autocontenido.\n\nEl juego es un point-and-click al uso. Toca cosas para investigar m\u00e1s sobre ellas, usa o combina tus objetos para salir adelante y habla con varios personajes para estar m\u00e1s al tanto de tu situaci\u00f3n. Dos cosas caracterizaban a los point-and-click de anta\u00f1o: su sentido del humor y que los puzles en s\u00ed eran rebuscad\u00edsimos. Afortunadamente, el humor de este juego, sin ser del mismo palo que de Homestuck, no deja de ser variado y ocurrente. Del mismo modo, los puzles son bastante evidentes y es bastante dif\u00edcil quedarse atascado. Puede que demasiado f\u00e1ciles, algo que me gustar\u00eda ver enmendado en futuros actos.\n\nHay di\u00e1logo y texto narrativo para rato (unas 150.000 palabras) y hay respuesta para todo tipo de situaciones, algunas de ellas con logro incluido, por lo que se fomenta mucho la rejugabilidad para volver a ver escenas antiguas con otro giro de tuerca.\n\nUn punto negativo es que el juego no est\u00e1 traducido al espa\u00f1ol a\u00fan, y el nivel de ingl\u00e9s que se requiere para entrar en materia es, como muy poco, intermedio. Dicho esto, los fans de Homestuck de habla hispana no son pocos, y es posible que en un futuro se habilite una versi\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol para mayor disfrute de estos. No tiene nada que ver que sea el propio traductor quien lo diga, EJEM.\n\nEn cualquier caso, juego recomendad\u00edsimo, ya sea para entrar en el mundo o para conocer la historia de Joey Claire... una gran mujer. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1505673509, "timestamp_updated": 1505673509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598086", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35030245": {"recommendationid": "35030245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073771162", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505671167}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is incredible, though a bit short.\n\nThis game is also incredibly beautiful. The drawings of characters , backgrounds, monsters and the super fluid, beautiful animation - just about everything looks fantastic. And the art style it all combines into ends up being one of my favorite in a video game - ever. \n\nThen there's the music which is also incredible and fantastic. Composed by Toby Fox and James Roach from the homestuck team (one of which also made the game and music of Undertale, which has one of my favorite video game soundtracks) the music fits every scene perfectly and has a very unique aesthetic. From big haunting melodies to quirky little songs based on short samples it all just fits and just pleases my ears to an orgasmic level.\n\nThe gameplay of this game definitely isn't for everybody. It's mostly just point and click (except for the snake puzzles) and is based on solving puzzles. The puzzles are kind of inconsistent. While some feel very well thought out and fun to solve, some of them feel very off and in some cases plain unnessecary. \nFor the gameplay you walk around areas clicking on everything to get information and dialouge (more on that in a second) and find items that you will have to use and combine in different situations and with different objects to progress. There's also a couple of battle sequences against monsters. The battle sequences will initially just look like it's a turn based battle, but the battles are also just puzzles (but with some rad exciting music and cool looking monsters). You can't just beat the monsters to a pulp (cause you're just a kid) so you have to use imaggination and find another way.\nPersonally I love the gameplay to bits but as I said, it definitely isn't for everyone. There's a LOT of reading, which is what brings life and character to the game, but if you have a short attention span or just hate reading this probably isn't for you.\n\nSpeaking about reading, what you'll be reading are mostly descriptions, Joey Claire's (main character) thoughts, dialouge and chatlogs. All of which have freaking fantastic writing. I cannot stress enough how important the writing in character/story based games is. The writing is usually one of the defining factors for me in how immersed I am. And this game just nails the kind of geek dialouge and writing that actually exist. Sometimes games will come off as if it was a 50 year old bussiness man in a suit writing what he thinks kids say and how they talk without any help from anyone else and the whole thing just ends up feeling completely disconnected from the world. But this game just nails the great nerd speak, webhumor, references to both homestuck and other work, and you know, everything that you've come to expect from the writer of homestuck. Amazing writing, major props to Andrew Hussie for pulling this off so excellently.\n\nThe detail in the game is also extremely high and something I kept noticing. They have written extreme amounts of text responding to almost everything you do. You'l have about ten items in your inventory that you can click and use on pretty much anything in the game. Depending on what item you use and what you use it on you will pretty much always get unique dialouge written just for that action and I can't imagine how much time they must've spent on writing that. Sometimes they even make it so if you do the same obscure action that has no impact on the story or progression over and over again the dialouge/text will continue to change and sometimes mock the player.\nI just really love this stuff okay?\n\nI haven't talked much about the story since you get a brief description of it on the steam page and I feel that it is meaningless to talk much about in a review except for saying that it's good or it's bad. This story is good. A lot of plotholes as of now (there's more to come obviously, the story isn't finished yet) but it is very good and interesting.\n\nOne thing I have to point out is kind of weird and cluncky is the map layout. The perspective often changes violently when you walk into a new room and you're sometimes left wondering where you came from.\n\nThat's  a summary of my most important thoughts that bumbled around my head while watching the credits. If you enjoy good writing, music and art style, get this game, or you'll be missing out.

And HIVESWAP certainly delivered. There's clearly more coming, since we were left with that huge cliffhanger. And being a fan of Homestuck, with its contrived plot twists and wild and wacky storytelling, I was certainly impressed by the amount of character developement and craft that WhatPumpkin packed into the game!\n\n[h1] GRAPHICS: 9/10 [/h1]\nThe game looks gorgeous, straight out of a storybook. First we were promised a 3D adventure game, but we came out with a 2D point and click genre game, and I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by the smooth cutscenes, animations, and detailed backgrounds. It's like if you took a Humongous Entertainment game and gave it a huge texture revamp. I love it.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY: 8/10 [/h1]\nI hope you're not expecting too much out of gameplay. It's solid point and click. [spoiler] There is a part of the game once you get to Xefros' hive that you play a short minigame that you use the arrow keys for. It's Snake. But besides that? All point and click. [/spoiler] That doesn't mean the gameplay is boring. Just basic.\n\n[h1] (RE)PLAYABILITY: 7/10 [/h1]\nIf you're a puzzle expert or are using a tutorial, odds are you'll finish the game with the basic story-driven achievements in under 2 hours. If you want all the achivements, including the hidden ones, well, probably another 2 hours. There isn't much to replay the game for. Unless you want to use the spice on every object and record what it does. In which case... probably more.\n\n[h1] OVERALL: 8.5/10 [/h1]\nI have to say, yet again, I'm impressed. After The Odd Gentlemen took all the Kickstarter money and made their own game, I thought HIVESWAP was a goner. Then, WhatPumpkin turned into a game making studio, and saved the day! Through blood, sweat, tears, and weird alien liquids, this game finally came out. Any fan following this game early on might be disappointed -- not me. I wished for a bit more playing time, maybe a bit more on the mysterious Tetrarch Dammek, or some on Jude.

For newcomers this is a great stand alone treat that, while some refrences and jokes may fly over your head, it is deffinetly not required to know anything about the series, in fact, this could be a more pallatable way to dip your toes into HS without fearing for drowning in the chaos.\n\nGameplay wise it's a basic point and click adventure and it's engaging and fun enough, if you enjoy such games. There is combat, though, not traditional combat, but more puzzle solving combat but it's not a big focus of the game but it's very welcome. The puzzles aren't all to difficult and only really got stuck once but they're fun and not too easy enough that it's engaging. I would also be remise if I didn't mention the music which is such an integral part of Homestuck that I'd have been so destraught if Toby Fox hadn't graced us with his talents again also a composer who's name, I'm sorry, I unfortunatly can't recall. I had only a few bugs mostly with framerate but wasn't really breaking. Only one during the first strife that made it so I had to restart it.\n\nAll in all a nice romp in a familiar but new setting and people with a story that grabbed me and by the end made me beg for more.

This game has been through STUFF, alright. Alleged theft of kickstarter money. Overestimated budgets. Development of this game was restarted twice. It took, what, four years or something for this thing to release? Point is: I've been wanting to play this game for a long time. One question remains, though: Does it hold up to half an eternity of being hyped up as \"The Homestuck Game\"?\n\nLet's look at the facts. Or the opinions, I guess.\n\nPRESENTATION: 4.5/5\n\nThe game is beautiful, both visually and acoustically. Though much of the soundtrack isn't usually the kind of music I personally enjoy, the game was definitely pleasing to look at and listen to throughout. Not much else to say on the matter. I'm not really a stickler when it comes to presentation, but I can see that HIveswap's Music and Art team did their best, which is definitely enough in my book.\n\nSTORY, WRITING, CHARACTERS: 5/5\n\nIf there's one thing people should read Homestuck for, it's probably the music I mean come on the music's great go listen to it right now. But if there's TWO things, the second one is definitely the characters. Hiveswap, in my opinion, lives up to its legacy here. Which is fascinating, because there's really only a handful of characters in Act 1!\n\nAs for the writing, there are lots of great jokes in Hiveswap. If you're going to play it for that, though, remember to combine all of the things, as this is where most of the humor is stashed away.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 1/5\n\nLook, I'll be honest: Hiveswap is easily one of the worst Point and Clicks I've ever played, gameplay-wise. This is mainly due to one thing: Lack of Difficulty.\n\nThe game is super easy. Some What Pumpkin employees must've thought they were making a modern FPS, because this game has so much handholding it's not even funny. Here's a little taste of what awaits you in Act 1: Throughout the entire game, you are required to combine items in your inventory ONCE. There's dozens of situations where just LOOKING at a problem tells you how to solve it.\n\nIf a What Pumpkin employee reads this (which is highly unlikely, but still), PLEASE, for the love of gog, MAKE ACT 2 MORE DIFFICULT. This is embarassing.\n\nAlso, make it longer. You can beat the game within two hours, even if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThese issues go hand-in-hand, and they both seriously need fixing.\n\nOVERALL: 3.5/5 Hats, to keep it real\n\nDespite all my nagging about the lack of difficulty, I still thoroughly enjoyed Act 1 of Hiveswap. In spite of all its gameplay-focused shortcomings, I don't think gameplay is what most people want from this game. But as for me, I just... I really, REALLY want Act 2 to be enjoyable by a wider audience.\n\nIf you're a fan of Homestuck, it's a must-have. If you want an extremely short and easy, but cleverly written game, the game is also recommendable.\n\nBut if you're looking for a Point and Click Adventure where this cleverness extends to the gameplay as well? Hiveswap Act 1 is just not for you.

However, upon my completion of the game I believe that newcomers who know little to nothing about Homestuck or Hiveswap can enjoy this game.

But is it any good?\n\nYes!\n\nBut was it really worth the wait? Umm...\n\nOk so let's make this review proper! Good stuff first.\n\n\nArtwork, animated cutscenes and style are great. \n\nCharacters seem intresting so far.\n\nThere is about 1500 diffrent text responses you can get by interacting with masses of items giving you more insight on characters thought or their lives.\n\nAMAZING soundtrack. Really soundtrack is good. Filthy Nuclear Bunker is probably my favorite.\n\nLot of refrences and ;) to webcomic fans.\n\nLot of 90's refrences. Only 90 kids will remember this, yeah screw this meme.\n\n\nNow the bad stuff. :/\n\n\nIt's relatively short comparing the price to amount of time you need to finish the game. If you rush it you could finish it in hour. It took me with a bit of exploring, interacting, easter egg hunting and getting stuck at least once about 2,5-3hours to finish it.\n\nLot of people are reporting problems with cutscenes atm, where they will freeze and then jump instantly to scene after cutscene.\n\nThe idle and character animation isn't really that much smooth, altough this could fall under style choice. It still kinda hurt my eyes as I could count the amount of frames it consisted of with my eyes,\n\nYou will not understand lot of references unless you read comic.\n\nSometimes you might get stuck with a puzzle, and tips won't really help you figure out how to get unstuck. about 50% of times when I got stuck the solution turned out to be inspecting everything in sight. There is also thing with flashlight batteries, where just stupid amount of people get stuck on obvious puzzle, just becouse the place on a certain thing didn't look like something you can interact with. [spoiler]The goddemn radio battery socket.[/spoiler]\n\nI really, really disliked the snake puzzle. I just felt bit slaped on the face when i saw that after having a budget of 2,5 milions to create this game they decided to put in for some reason just snake minigame instead of actual puzzle. Shame. But then again it's probably just me complaining. But it really did feel like the weakest and most unnecessary puzzle in game.\n\n\nTo finish this up my honest thought and opinion. Game took way tolong to make and feels like it should be at least half longer considering time and budget. It felt like it ended where it should really start but that's ok since next acts are on the way and at least it didn't end with a clifhanger. Which really brings me a relieve since we have no idea when 2nd act is coming out. Overall game felt more like a demo of a game than actual act.1. Although to be fair it felt like really well made, advanced and prepared demo. Game does certainly have potential as a series, and biggest problem I had with the game was the fact that it ended a little bit too quickly. First achivment you get in game pretty much foreshadows that.\n\nOverall good game, but next acts need to be kinda longer to justify the price/wait. If you like adventure/puzzle games you will probably have a lot of fun ignoring the length. If you are Homestuck you probably already bought it.\n\nI give Hiveswap with a honesty a 413/720 which is around 7/10. It's well made, but ends way too soon. I look forward to next acts, and I hope some things will be improved.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505655030, "timestamp_updated": 1505655030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35023214": {"recommendationid": "35023214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372178564", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505484009}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is one huge high quality shitpost", "timestamp_created": 1505653964, "timestamp_updated": 1505653964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35023133": {"recommendationid": "35023133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031103494", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505565214}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game,  if a bit cluttered at times.

So am I. But I actually know what I'm talking about and enjoyed both Homestuck and Hiveswap: Act 1.\n\nAfter developement hell, this game finally gets released. My review will be more based on the game itself and less about what people hoped it would be.\n\nHiveswap: Act 1 is the first of 4 episodic Point and Click adventures and is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the series. Besides a few visual glitches and some spelling errors, it's done it's job at introducing characters and setting up the story for the other 3 acts. Visually, the backgrounds look amazing, the animation flips from fluid to choppy, and mechanically, there isn't a puzzle too hard to figure out with all of the visual cues you're given. A new feature packed along with the game is the dialog response for each combonation of \"inventory item X item/environment\". No longer will you get the same old \"You can't do that.\" over and over. Each interaction has something different to say, and can encourage the player to try to combine everything out of curiosity. The soundtrack is composed from James Roach and Toby Fox, both of which are very talented musicians. If you get the chance, you should buy the sound tracks for each act. You're bound to fall in love with at least one song. (Also, I don't believe \"The Grubbles\" have had a chance to play yet, and the two songs released are pretty damn good as well. So hang on to your underwear when they finally make their debut.)\n\nNow onto the Homestuck Perspective Review.\n\nLOTS of references to Homestuck. Being based in the same universe, it's really unavoidable. For anybody who's kept up with the story, you're going to be combing through this game with a super secret cypher thats not easily obtainable. Plenty of stuff will already be common sense to big fans of the series, while everyone else will be just as clueless as Joey Claire. And for those that are wondering what is up with the combat system, it's modeled after some of the early Homestuck flash fights. If it doesn't make sense, it's not supposed to. It's purely cosmetic.\n\nWith the tone set, Act 2 is going to deliver just as well, if not better.

It's not that I don't think I can, and it's not because I don't think other games deserve them. There are a lot of games that deserves much praise and admiration. However, when this game strikes a special cord for me.\n\n[b]The bad:[/b]\n\nIt's a relatively short game. Don't go into this expecting ten hours of entertainment. This is just one part of a larger whole.\n\nIt's on tracks, this is not a choose your own adventure game. It's a story-telling narrative.\n\nAs stated before, this is just part one. Part one took a very long time to come out. I can't say when the next part will be out, and you might want to save playing this until all the pieces are released.\n\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\nIt does it's job fantastically. It tells a story, gets you interested in the quirks of the characters. It flows smoothly from one point to the next in that style Hussie became famous for.\n\nThough the game itself is linear, the things you can discover are so vast that in this short game you can and will spend more time reading about wall posters than advancing the plot.\n\nAlmost true to the description, there are very few generic 'combinations' in the game. Almost everything you can use on something else gets its own unique flavor, even if it doesn't work or do anything special. The few times that something lacks interaction or has a generic default are far between, and hardly immersion breaking. I was never quite left with the feeling of \"I have an axe, but I need a hammer to get past this wood because it has nails.\" that you might get in older point and clicks.\n\nLast but certainly not least it's beautiful. The work put into the assets and the way everything is composed is both beautiful and true to the original Homestuck style.\n\n\n[b]In summary:[/b]\n\nI'm happy with the end result, even if it took a very long time to get here.

I am here sitting at 2.7 hours of gameplay time on september 17th 2017, a few days after this games release, that is the amount of time it took for me to beat this game with getting stuck on maybe two (in my opinion) poorly telegraphed puzzles. Hint: You have to pull the deers horn. There is a red panel beside the bedroom door you came from. And frankly I don't think the game should have released in this state.\n\nThough let's get something straight, it breaks my heart to do this, look at my icon, it's a goddamn fantroll so you know I want to reccommend this but I simply will not reccommend this until it's cleaned up. Even sadder is my expectations weren't even that high for this, I wasn't expecting much more than a simple, fun adventure game that probably had great music and what I got was a simple adventure game with a bunch of excess mechanics shoe-horned into the first chapter where they're not usable and a bunch of puzzle pieces that I am not allowed to fit together yet...with great music ... sure can't wait to wait another 10 months to see what happens with Jude and Dammek though.\n\nFOR A NOT HOMESTUCK:\nPros:\n+Incredibly adorable, if you're one of those people who can live off a game by how cute the characters are, then you can go ahead and stop reading here.\n+Art is perty\n+Humor is fairly on point, it won't really miss any beats\n+Music is lovely\n+If you're worried about having to have read homestuck to understand this game, don't worry it does an okay(?) job of keying you into the lingo slowly\n+ I N T R I G U I N G L E V E L O F M Y S T E R Y\n\nCons:\n+Some poorly telegraphed puzzles\n+They don't even really try to give you an illusion of choice, mistakes you make are forgiven instantly to make room for a sloppy combat system and a linear narrative that they give you dialogue options for - for what I can only see as no reason- nothing you say or do can change anything and yet they still give you choices to do things for cheap 'interaction'\n+AN ENTIRE SERIES OF PUZZLE PIECES THAT YOU GO THE WHOLE GAME WITHOUT USING. People are going to say \"oh but this is chapter one, they'll probably use them later.\"- and I retort with, I don't care. If they are going to release this product as is then I am going to judge it as is.\n+A completely pointless combat system that is basically a glorified puzzle (Though it wastes more time than any of the puzzles would)\n+The game leans almost a bit too much on the text logs, and more to the point this entire first act is basically doing the housework to move you up to speed with the lingo, but since it has to do that your overall experience will suffer for it unless you're super into these characters\n+You might find 1/3 of the characters annoying. Oh wait there's only 3 characters.\n+Short play time. 3 hours. Act one. At the time of writing there is absolutely no scheduled release date for act two on a game five years in development and 3 years past initial scheduled release with vague development timelines leading up to this.\n+A character switching mechanic that never gets used\n+Spelling errors\n\nFOR HOMESTUCKS:\nPros:\n+All Pros mentioned above\n+Joey is Cute\n+Jude is Cute\n+Xanax or whatever his name was is adorable\n+References I guess...\n\nCons:\n+All Cons stated above\n+No Trickster Mode??\n+Regurgitation of the same troll-lore exposition that you already know backwards and forwards\n+Jake is an asshole (Honestly this isn't a real con I just thought I'd toss this in, in case you liked Jake English and weren't prepared to have him be a willfully estranged father to two angel children.)\n+Literally nothing new to anything you already knew besides 3 new characters\n+I cannot overstate how dissapointing the combat system is\n\nAll I can really hope is that the next three sections they take the few criticisms they get to heart (because love is blind, and so is fandom) and make chapter two at least worthwhile for the 2 and a half hours it'll take to beat that.

I am a long time fan of Homestuck and I have waited for many years just for this game to come out! I feel however, as some things can be improved, such as improving the amount of RAM the game takes up, and me, with my crappy 2GB of RAM can definitely testify: DO NOT TAKE THE RECCOMENDED AMOUNT OF RAM LIGHTLY! It really ruins my gameplay when I have to save every 5 minutes or so in order to avoid losing progress because of my computer restarting due to the small amount of RAM. If you have 2GB of RAM like me and want to play, do not dismay! You can buy more RAM for your computer and it is relatively inexpensive. I don't really find it to be a problem because the pros outnumber the cons but I can definitely see why some people may be hesitant.\n\nI paid for the Soundtrack Edition, and I definitely reccomend you to buy Soundtrack Edition if you can spend 5 more dollars! The soundtrack is amazing and it is a bargain that you can get the game and the soundtrack for only $11.99. \n\nI love the game and wish it was longer.

Also because my game started and restarted numerous times, but lets ignore that last part :P.\n\nI feel like strife was semi-pointless, but it added to the story and kept a theme of Homestuck.\n\nEven if you aren't a fan of Homestuck you can still enjoy the game!

It only took me about 2.5 hours to complete, and I'd say I did a fair bit of exploring and combining. \n\nLastly, the music was absolutely fantastic and I am very glad I chose the bundle with the soundtrack way back when I backed this game on Kickstarter. \n\nSo, uhm, yeah. Overall this game is great aside from being brief, though I am sure the time will stack up as more acts are released. Gorgeous art, gorgeous music, chuckleworthy dialouge that has come to be expected of Homestuck, and an interesting plot that begs to continue! 10/10 do love, thank you our lord Hussie", "timestamp_created": 1505623887, "timestamp_updated": 1505623887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35014273": {"recommendationid": "35014273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048579796", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505706179}, "language": "english", "review": "Had so many EMOTIONS the whole way through; laughed a lot, clutched my heart, finished the game and want to go back and play it all again.

True to any adventure game, the first act is mostly setup, worldbuilding, and enticing the audience for more. It was pretty and sounded nice, although the puzzles were WAY too simple. I knew it'd be short, but for the time everyone waited on Hiveswap I didn't anticipate it being THAT short.\nI like what you guys are offering, just try to keep the momentum going come Act 2.

I doubt it.\n\nIt lacks the substance, lacks the proper character development and generally lacks the charm that homestuck had.\nI'm not saying it is bad, it is just not what I expected. Worst, it reminds me of exactly the same problems that Armikrog had.\n\nPROS:\n\nYes, it is really, really well drawn.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. First of all, it feels dated and unfinished. The game was in production for 5 years and you can feel it. Manual save system for 2h game looks archaic. Menu elements looks half-assed. The game is buggy. It's rough around the edges. Art quality is inconsistent.\n\nMap layout is bizzare. A lot of game elements can be accessed from a very specific angle even if they visible on other screens. For example, in the 2nd act security terminal is visible but you can't access it *UNLESS* you realize that you have to change the view.\n\nThere is an option to swap characters, but there is no gameplay mechanic to utilize it. Why is it there? \nCombat/ability system looks unfinished. Once again, it feels like a forced addition that can be entirely cut from the game or be replaced by the scripted scene. I can't exactly say what feels wrong about it, but it feels wrong. Also, those abilities can be probably used, like, two times in the entire game? Why coudn't they just add another option to the popup menu and call it a day?\n\nThose are minor complaints, but they are important, because they form the overall game impression, and generally break immersion for me.\n\n2. It has a soul but it has *WRONG* soul.\n\nThe broad appeal and the art direction they took is understandable, but in my opinion it is detrimental to the game.\nIn Homestuck art always feels second to the content, and the whole aim of the narrative was to create this bizzare \"meta\" atmosphere.\n\nI don't see it in the game. They tried to make classic golden age adventure with a team and creative lead who does not have experience in this field. As a result we have a game that has all of the weaknesses of the genre and none of the strengths of the Hussie. It is an attempt to play on the foreign field and I don't see the reason behind it.\n\nWhy creating another beautiful but mediocre adventure game? There are plenty of them, and it is very difficult to compete with them having such a small team. The game does not try bring anything new or try to achive anything notable rather than being very ambitious but very minor omage to the niche webcomic.", "timestamp_created": 1505622311, "timestamp_updated": 1505797606, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558373", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35013847": {"recommendationid": "35013847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180881762", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505669571}, "language": "english", "review": "I.

and \"no\" for recommending a game on here. Because my response varies based on what you're wanting this game for.\n\nDo you like Homestuck and want to get a little more into what kind of place Alternia was, and have a good chuckle every now and again? Then yes, I recommend it.\n\nBut as a point and click game, regardless of what franchise it's tied to, I can't in good conscience recommend it as-is.\n\nMy favorite part of P&C games is the puzzles. Even when I don't get them myself, I like seeing how clever they are in the end. But a lot of the puzzles in Hiveswap that stumped me wound up having really bizarre and illogical solutions. A lot of parts felt really over-written, and that in the process of trying to cram as many jokes in as they could, they also put in far too many red herrings that then became more frustrating than funny. On the flip side, some of the puzzles seemed like they could have had a little more player involvement, but were largely just handed to you.\n\n There's also a particular minigame that I wasn't a fan of that was required for you to proceed, that required you to look in multiple places on the screen at once. It wasn't that difficult conceptually, but the execution wasn't great.\n\nThe UI could have used a little work, it wasn't entirely intuitive and there was no real guide to how to use some of the buttons. There are also a lot of typos in the dialog, as well as a lot of very blatant bugs. More than once, a button would come up, giving me a dialog option, but it would be completely cut off.\n\nThese issues would be a lot more forgiveable if this was an early access game, and if it hadn't taken as many years as it did to be released. I understand that there is some unofficial banter about monetary issues, but given that I've heard competing rumors, I can't really take that into account. Still, money issues aside, I don't think it would have been particularly hard to at least run a spell check on your dialog.\n\nThat said, the characters are cute, and while the story is a little slow to get going, once it does it's pretty fun. I imagine it will feel a little more fleshed out when there's more actual game to play. The art is, of course, lovely and the colors are vibrant, while the world is well-populated and lived in.\n\nSo if you want to learn more about trolls, this is the game for you. But if you only want to play a good point and click game, I'd wait until they release a patch or two.", "timestamp_created": 1505614182, "timestamp_updated": 1505614269, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35011741": {"recommendationid": "35011741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318794742", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508642723}, "language": "english", "review": "god, where do i begin. although quite short, this game was everything i had hoped for and more. its hilarious and everything is fittingly homestuck. seriously, you can get an achievement for trying to use a pigeon on 30 items!!\n\nthe art is amazing, the music is AMAZING, the gameplay is amazing, and overall, everything is amazing. i still cant believe hiveswap coming out was a thing that ACTUALLY happened in REAL LIFE. for me, it was totally worth the wait.\n\nthe characters are FULL of personality and life (and i cant wait to learn more about them). i played the whole game with the dopiest smile on my face (though maybe thats just because im extremely fond of homestuck, haha).\n\ni can tell the team worked very hard, it really shows!! everything is just...perfect, really. its hard to use anything else to describe it other than that.\n\njust. go play it. please.", "timestamp_created": 1505613486, "timestamp_updated": 1505613486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35011697": {"recommendationid": "35011697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101087559", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506885573}, "language": "english", "review": "[strike]I gave it 5 out of 5 hats to keep it real[/strike]\n\n[strike]half life 3 came out before this.[/strike]\n\n[strike]more real than kraft mayo[/strike]\n\nWho needs a joke review?

It actually, in part, makes it feel more like Homestuck some how.\nThe artwork is all beautiful, the cutscenes are awesome, the music is perfect, and the story is interesting so far!

Some of the puzzles in the latter end can be difficult to figure out, especially as there's not really an in-game hint system and some of the puzzles rely on finding the just right part of the screen to click on, but that's par for the course for graphic adventure games. Besides, at least the parts of the screen you have to click on make sense.

Bringie the Knight of Void is here to help you decide whenever or not to give this game a chance.\n\nFirst important thing: quite obviously, this is a Homestuck inspired game, so there are many great references for Homestuck fans (would feel unfair if there werent since we waited so goddamn long for it.) BUT if you\u00b4re not a Homestuck fan, its okay! the game itself does a great job of being indipendent, so there is no required Homestuck knowledge to enjoy it. But if you enjoy the game experience, the mechanics and the storytelling, i\u00b4d wholly recommend Homestuck for you: Act 1 is a bit slow, but once you get past it, you\u00b4ll discover a rich world full of complex characters and excellent story and humour.  \n\nNow, without futher ado, lets review the heck out of this game.\n\nLets start with the esthetics and animation. The colors are beautiful, the visuals vibrant, and, should i say, alive. Each character has a set of tiny animation while standing, walking etc. There are animated leaves, moving chains, closing doors, each detail carefully taken into consideration. Fighting sequences are fluid and fun. \n\nMusic created by crazily talented duo of James Roach and Toby Fox (the latter being composer for quite a few Homestuck songs before moving to create his own game, Undertale. Undertale itself is also an excelent game worth checking out once you\u00b4re done with Hiveswap). The tracks are lovely and i myself am a happy owner of Hiveswap OST, definitely worth investing in if you\u00b4re electric/chiptune/orchesta enthusiastic.\n\nThe characters are unique, with their own quirks and interests. You mainly get to play with two out of four characters in this act, so i believe others get their turn in Hauntswitch (Act 2). But even with two characters, you get plenty of fun and experience a lot through them.\n \nGame mechanics are simple and easy to use. The essencial of Hiveswap is to click everything, combine everything, and use objects on everything. if not for plot advancement then definitely for hillarious text that always pops up.\n\nProbably the strongest aspect of the game, as mentioned above, is writing. Andrew Hussie has plenty of experience, and knows how to make funny, sad or silly commentary whenever needed. The storytelling is masterful, and i must admit i was close to tears about twice. \n\nAs for negatives (every game has its bugs afterall), my personal problem was with short animated sequences, because they were choppy. But seeing as i have outdated computer with not very strong graphic card or CPU, i say its due to technology i am using, rather than the game itself. \nAnother problem with the game is that at perhaps three points, i didnt know what to do. Again, understandable, since this is point-and-click game. You just gotta use your brain (or mouse and desperately click on everything again, like i did :D )\nLastly, the game isnt very long. it took me 5 hours to finish it and get most of achievments (still planning to play it second time to get remaining 5), but you need to remember there is a whole lot more coming. The story had only just begun.\n\nIn conlusion, Hiveswap is a tribute to Homestuck fans who will happily get nostalgic over their fandom years, as well as a well-made visual adventure novel for people that want to get into world of mysteries.

I loved it. Here's a spoiler free review:\n\npros:\n* The music is amazing, as excpected from the people at the music team.\n* The artstyle is real easy to look at and appreciate.\n* The story so far is interesting, taking place somewhere before the begining of the events in Homestuck (haha who am i kidding, pinpointing a beginning on the homestuck timeline is like trying to find the mean between zero and infinity), and the humor is cyoot.\n* The gameplay is standard point and click fun, EVERYTHING is interactable with EVERYTHING, so if you're the type of peep who likes his games slow and rich, this can work very well for you. Puzzles are interesting but nothing you cant solve, so it's not gonna be one of those games you need to open the wiki for to search how to progress.\n* This game doesn't require any fancy computer parts to run, and it ran smoothly on my potato i3 intel hd graphics 4600 on the highest definition, so if you are low end, you can purchase without fear.\n\nwith all that, here are some noticable cons:\n* The most noticeble one: it's SHORT. Like, I'm a nerd who likes to use all the interactability and slow down to read in some parts, so I got 6 hours out of this game. But a man who likes his game fast and to the point, and people who just want to get on with the story, will finish it in 3. But you know a game is good when the most noticeable bad thing with it is it being too short. Hopefully the 2nd act comes withing less than a year, but you know how it is with homestuck titles. One can only hope.\n* With the intentions of this game to be a complete standalone title and people not needing to read homestuck to enjoy it, you will miss a LOT if you didn't read it. I'm not saying you CAN'T enjoy it without Homestuck; but the first act fails to explain itself many times, if you're new you would miss half the jist. Maybe it's a way for the game to stay mysterious for the second act, but I know it's going to annoy some people.\n* The game is simplistic, and can be predictable at some points. If you are searching for hardcore puzzles and mindblowingly complex gameplay, im afraid you wont find it here. The point of the game is to enjoy the feel, story and characters (which are all adorable btw), not to win.\n* It had some visual glitches at some points, but that was because I was messing with the screen resolution while tabbing out. Also it had some lag loading certain clips, but nothing to worry about.\n* Not even a con, just my petty nitpick: it has nothing to do with Sburb, at least not now. I know it's supposed to be focused on the troll-human relations, switching planets yadda-yadda... But what I personally liked best about Homestuck was Sburb, the concept of a game being connected personaly to you, with kids learning and becoming gods and most importantly: adults. Again, this is just a nitpick and I know it wasn't planned to be connected to Sburb in the first place but... A man can dream right?\n\nI give a score of 7/10, great for me, maybe not much for other people. It's only 8 bucks anyway, you're not risking much by buying it, and I can say with confidence that 3 hours of this 8 buck game is more fun and rich than 1.5 hours for 15+ bucks going to a movie.\n\nIn short, I think heavy sums it up accurately:\nhttps://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/e/e3/Heavy_goodjob01.wav?t=20110320053516", "timestamp_created": 1505588400, "timestamp_updated": 1511549082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35004580": {"recommendationid": "35004580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421262373", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505588132}, "language": "english", "review": "Man that was a RIDE!

It's a Point & Click adventure that's beautifully done and well written. Is you don't know the webcomic that won't be an issue as the game generally explains everything with the in-player interactions.\n\nPros:\n\n-Text for almost every interaction with the scenery and invertory items\n   You can honestly use like every item on one object in the background and get interesting text and jokes/puns with very few exceptions. Heck you can even use items on each other which yield some funny results.\n\n-Well written\n   From the characters to the descriptions everything feels just well done and authentic. Though it is written in a 2nd-person style which might seem weird at first, you'll get used to it and this style works for the benifit of the game as you get the character's thoughts on whatever you've clicked on.\n\n-This ain't a fairytale\n   The trailers and images make it seem like a fun little adventure and it is, but there's themes in this game that are not all sugar and spice. It never gets bloody and nothing really dark happens but these themes add to the characters and makes them and the situations they're in seem real. It also makes you sympathize with them too (if you're worried about the potential themes because of triggers I'll leave a list of them at the end of my review).\n\n-Puzzles\n   The puzzles are mostly simple until you get to the battles. Battles in this game aren't really battles but act more like puzzles themselve in order to win which is pretty cool. \n\n-Music\n   This music is very, very good and fits with whatever is going on scene. I'm not really surprized by this because the webcomic always had good music and it's obvious they brought people who contribute to it here on the game like Toby Fox (the man who created Undertale which makes me wonder when this game is going to get it's own version of Megalovania because I want it)\n\n-Cheap\n   Honestly I was surprized this game was so cheap but it makes sense since it's a short game, speaking of that...\n\nCons:\n\n-Short, like, VERY short if speed running\n   The game is very short if you just do the puzzles, you could probably beat it in 30 minutes top but that's not what these game are for. You're ment to explore and interact with stuff and that easily adds a few hours onto it. Another issue with the game being so short is that there's only so much plot and in hind sight there's really not a lot as it leaves you wanting more. It honesly only feels like the introduction to the game and then some.\n\n-Character animation (more of a pet peeve)\n   This may just be me but when I saw the introduction cutscene and then the animation of the character in the acutally gameplay section I was put off because it wasn't as smooth as I was expecting it to be. It took a minute to get used to but after that it didn't bother me in the slightest, it was just a bit jarring at bit.\n\nThe Conclusion:\n\n   Overall, it's a very fun click & point game that is short but is also cheap. If you got the money to spare and you like these type of games even a little bit I'd say get it. There's more to come in the future and if it's anything like the webcomic we'll get up to 6 Acts where Act 6 feels like 5 acts on it's own merit to the point we got acts in Act 6 itself (e.g. Act 6 Act 4, it was very silly with how long Act 6 was getting). Oh and let's not forget the intermissions, there were several of them in the webcomic that would later tie into the main story... \n\nHomestuck is very confusing and LONG is what I'm getting at....\n\n\nThe End \n(the only thing below this is the list of dark-ish themes of the game which are kind of minor spoilers)\n\n\n\n\nThemes (minor spoilers):\n-a father that's never at home to take care of the kids because ADVENTURE\n-a long since deceased mother\n-an achoholic babysister (who isn't mean or cruel, just irresponsible)\n-a dictator\n-a revolution against said dictator and government\n-a not-so-balance friendship between two characters (one is kind of mean to the other to the point one of them has pretty bad selfconfidence issues but we don't see their interactions in game)", "timestamp_created": 1505582619, "timestamp_updated": 1505582619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35002577": {"recommendationid": "35002577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093058438", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505430002}, "language": "english", "review": "hiveswa,p mp i waited a lot of time for and it wasgood\n\ngood game and i like the bbubsy refrance\n\ngoodbye", "timestamp_created": 1505582530, "timestamp_updated": 1505582530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495544", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35002539": {"recommendationid": "35002539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082469384", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505443186}, "language": "english", "review": "literally my only problem with this game is that it's not long enough", "timestamp_created": 1505582424, "timestamp_updated": 1505582424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35002494": {"recommendationid": "35002494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043333533", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505582186}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful soundtrack, The characters have depth, lots to click on and lots to read.", "timestamp_created": 1505582300, "timestamp_updated": 1505582300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35002328": {"recommendationid": "35002328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147885410", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505578120}, "language": "english", "review": "what the fuck is a \"homestuck\"?", "timestamp_created": 1505581891, "timestamp_updated": 1505581891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35002275": {"recommendationid": "35002275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990480290", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505576758}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who has a moderate experience of Hussie's work, \"Homestuck\", that this game is a derivation of, this is definitely up my alley.

It's just the first act right now so obviously I can't rate the full game experience, but here's what I can say.\n\nI'm giving Hiveswap a thumbs-up because I enjoyed it, and because I think it (for the most part) succeeds at being what most people expected it to be, but I only \"recommend\" the game under very specific conditions.  I meet these conditions, but I don't think most people do.\n\nThis is a good expansion to the Homestuck universe, sure.  So if you already know you love Homestuck, you probably want to get it.  But, if you already know you love Homestuck, then you already bought this game before reading this review.\n\nThe thing is, that's ALL it is.  It's an extension to Homestuck.  If you ignore that part and review it as just a game, it's a pretty bog-standard adventure game in the style of \"rub all inventory items on the scenery until something happens\".  That part, alone, is not worth the asking price in my opinion.  What IS worth the asking price is if you wanted to see more of the chaotically dense worldbuilding and goofy IM conversations that Homestuck had.\n\nIt's not BETTER than Homestuck, though, and while Homestuck is humongous and free, Hiveswap is tiny and costs some amount of money.  Well, Hiveswap is comparatively tiny, anyway--it's a short playthrough from beginning to end of act 1 (2-3 hours), but it's also dense with descriptions of all the stuff in the world you can click on, not to mention unique reactions for attempting to use different items on those same things.  But Homestuck is still massive in comparison to all that.\n\nI'll say that Hiveswap is better than Homestuck in two major ways: The art is way better, and it gets to the meat of the universe-spanning stuff way faster than Homestuck does.  So although Hiveswap is shorter than Homestuck, that also means that it isn't the same slow burn that Homestuck is, and I'm sure that would make it a better experience for some people.  (It also means a whole bunch of stuff is dumped on you at once with very little introduction, but then again, being confused and overwhelmed by the complexity of the story is part of the Homestuck experience.)\n\nBut would I recommend the game to anyone who hadn't already tried Homestuck to see if they like it or not?  I don't think I would.  I'd be more likely to gift this game to someone in an attempt to get them interested in the idea of reading Homestuck.  Except I wouldn't do that either, since I'm not THAT big a fan of Homestuck.\n\nI dunno.  Hiveswap is okay, but the only consumer advice I feel comfortable giving is \"read Homestuck first to decide whether you would enjoy this or not\".  You should probably give it a pass, otherwise.

Nonostante ci\u00f2, il gioco sembra essere stato pensato per essere apprezzato facilmente anche da chi non ha precedentemente avuto a che fare con l'opera da cui origina (bench\u00e9 molti dettagli e indizi di trama risultino incomprensibili a questi giocatori).\n\nEDIT [16/09/17 ore 16:44] Si precisa che, durante l'intero arco del gioco, non si sono presentati problemi nella sua esecuzione.

I was one of the Kickstarter backers who put money towards this five years ago.  After five years, I expected more.  I really did.\n\nI could go on for hours, almost as long as I've played the game itself, on all the things I hate about it.  It's really pretty, I'll give you that.  All the art, the references, the artifacts laying about, and the attention to detail in a purely visual sense is very strong.  It's meticulously crafted for the time period.  But in a point-and-click adventure game, it's kind of hard to know what's interactable and what's not when the background is so busy.  And in a 2D format, everything is warped to try and appear 3D, so your depth perception is thrown off.  Is that a hallway, an alcove, or a shelf?  Can I click on it?  WHY NOT??  I got lost in the fucking ATTIC.\n\nPlus there's the clunky menu that (spoilers) ironically often gets in the way of the puzzle's solution.  You gotta close it to see everything in the whole screen.  ***And there's no WASD controls.***  You have to not only click on everything to use or interact with it, in an already disorienting setup, you also have to click on arbitrary points of what might be floor somewhere at some unknown distance.  If you click on something that is not floor, it will give the same message as when you inspected it the first ten times, all of which will be preachy and smarmy.  This will happen over and over, by accident.  \n\nIn a game that is 90% walking and using items from your menu on things in the environment, it sure makes it hard to do those things well or differentiate from them.  That is the first big gripe, one that will break the game singlehandedly in most people's eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, the same looping midi track is playing over and over in the background.  You'd think composers with such experience in the indie game scene (the legendary Toby Fucking Fox being one of them) would have thought of making the soundtrack a little more tranquil, or just less in-your-face all the time, especially in the troll segements.  Nothing makes an obtuse, buggy, utterly garbage puzzle more infuriating than also having obnoxious band music playing on loop.  Here's a hint: loud, obnoxious music only appeals to us if it's FUNNY.  That's why Horsecatska was so popular, Mr. Roach.\n\nAnd speaking of hints, hoo BOY HOWDY do we have a segue there.  The hint button is the most infuriating piece of shit you'll ever find in a game.  Navi from Zelda has nothing on the hint button.  At least Navi would tell you something useful some of the time, and her only flaw is that she would tell you too much too often.  But the HINT BUTTON.  It is not a hint button.  It is the greatest crime ever conceived by a developer: a feature which has no use.\n\nThe hint button does nothing.  Ever.  It's not a glitch, it's not a bug.  It just makes fun of you for clicking on the hint button.  You expected help?  In a game where nothing makes sense and the controls are garbage?  It's not like this is Zork here, we aren't typing commands into a prompt.  But apparently when you're stuck and can't find any sort of solution (and here's the kicker: (spoilers again) you are ALWAYS trapped in a room.  It is almost comical how stupid the hindrances become to your progress through this quadriplegic art mural.), it decides to say nothing of your situation and MOCK YOU FOR IT.  It's a \"make fun of me\" button.  For how sensitive and bleeding-heart the writers were about big game animals and fucking security cameras, they sure love to trigger people.  \n\nAfter a certain point, the hint button just stops saying anything.  It would make sense if it started taking things seriously as the game progresses, and only make fun of you in the opening area when things are easy and (supposedly) self-explanatory.  But nope.  Its only purpose is to antagonize you, and then cease being funny.  It's the lack the lack of being funny that gets me.  It's like every piece of progress punishes you for you for daring to proceed, in the only way possible, by design.\n\nYou noticed the redundant words up there just now?  Get used to it.  There are grammatical errors and copy flubs throughout.  In a text-heavy game, just within the first few sessions of me playing, I've found six textual and punctual errors in the narrative prompt itself.  Missing periods, repeating repeating text, and just and just failed grammar in general\n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with the characters' spoken words or typing quirks either, both of which are essential spice to the dialogue both here and in this game's source material.  This is just the writers being careless and not as diligent as I, which is a shame since they are supposedly older, more professional, and should just fucking know better.  This game was written in 2012 goddammit.  You should have found these by now in your last half a fucking year of bug testing.  I certainly noticed and I've only had the game for two days.\n\nThe very last question of this game, since it was set in the Homestuck universe(s), is \"Is it funny?\"  Well, it wasn't written with the sharp, cynical, nihilistic wit of Hussie, so no.  It was written by some vegetarian Tumblrite or something when Hussie couldn't give enough of a shit about his own game to bother after the first developer he chose to make this game embezzled him and then his father died.  I guess your ghost writer being a total pansy is the lesser of two evils.  They still burned through the better part of two million dollars pushing this platinum turd out on their own.\n\nOh, and did we mention that after the five years of development hell, the game was delayed another eight months for bug testing?  AND IT'S STILL BUGGY.  Eight months is enough to create a whole damn game, and they couldn't even get the screen to center properly in that time.  I CAN SEE ANOTHER PANEL FROM DAMMEK'S LIVING ROOM IF I WALK AROUND TOO MUCH.  \n\nYou wanna see what kind of game the Homestuck fandom makes?  This is it.  All doodle, no substance, and definitely zero fun.  Just like the SJWs who were fallen back upon to create it.\n\nI mean, in conclusion, I should have expected as much.  This game was in development hell for several years, been through three developing houses essentially, and the only thing that's stayed true since the start was the gorgeous concept art which is the strongest point of the whole game.

I read it and then saw a trailer for it a few months later. That said I was very excited but also knew how the game was probably going to be utter garbage. It only makes sense. So I'm really happy that this game actually really nails what made me fall in love with Homestuck while not leaning so heavily on it to collapse.\n\nJoey Claire is a fantastic main character, isntatlly likable as she looks through her room, remembering good times and bad as she looks through her house. Her relation with her brother is sometimes contentious, but ultimately loving. Seeing her naviagate her feelings for her father, her mother and the relationships she might have in the future was honestly one of the most interesting parts of the game. I put so many items together to see if it revealed another tidbit.\n\nThat's not to say their isn't a great sci-fi plot going on. If you can swallow that their are suddenly monsters out of nowhere you'll have a lot of fun. Newcomers will love learning their first tidbits of the world while longtime fans will enjoy all the little nods to things from the comic. I don't want to spoil much but there's a lot of exciting stuff going on.\n\nThe puzzles are good, never feeling like the worst of adventure games, solutions always makes sense. Having combat be it's own puzzle is great and removing the risk of dying there is a smart decision allowing you to play around to find a solution or just to find the perfect bad pun attack name. The second half gets a bit more obtuse but not to a point of being that difficult.\n\nThe art is incredible. Beautiful 2D animation and backgrounds make the homes of the characters feel lived in and very unique. You'll want to look at everything and you basically can. Little touches such as the way the kids draw or the toys they leave behind make their world feel so much more real and really bring this to the next level.\n\nBasically this is a great game that worls great for old and new fans.\n\n[Note: I recived this game as a gift from a friend.]", "timestamp_created": 1505553566, "timestamp_updated": 1505553566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34991487": {"recommendationid": "34991487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238077240", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505590907}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is absolutely stunning with interesting music and achievements.

I could be wrong though, and I'm sure future acts will add a little more world-building too. \n\nThe only other complaints I can really give are obviously the length (plus the cost to length ratio for the rest of the acts together if they're of a similar length), and one bug I found where the cutscene after unlocking the attic wouldn't start and I had to restart the game.

They don't give you too much detail but just enough that left me like \"Yeah... I need to get Act 2 and figure out just what's going on\"\n\nCons:\n\n-Short? Beat this Act in 3 hours but that's mainly cause I clicked EVERYTHING and got lost on one puzzle. It's probably cloer to 1.5 Hours. I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking the price isn't worth it for how short it is.\n\n-Choppy Animations.

But as much as I tried to like this, I really just can't.\n\nPros:\n+The humor can be pretty funny from time to time\n+A nice amount of interactive stuff throughout, usually giving a joke for your troubles\n+Strife scenes are neat\n+Soundtrack can get downright ambient\n+Some of the artwork can be pretty beautiful\n+That Sloth lusus is goddamn adorable\n+Plenty of Homestuck references (I mean, of course there is) so fans will likely enjoy themselves\n+Runs quite well\n\nNeutral:\n+/-The humor can get a little too reliant on references in places, the first half of this act being especially guilty of this\n\nCons:\n-Animation is choppy as fuck, no matter your framerate, its just extremely choppy\n-Hope you're a Homestuck fan. Cause if not, you'll likely end up really lost in a few places and probably won't get nearly as much from this as you would if you were a fan of the series\n-Characters can be hit or miss. You'll either love em or hate em and the game doesn't last long enough to have any of them evolve in any way\n-The overall setting of the game is really hard to get invested in when you're given two different settings to explore in such a small timespan, each with their own seemingly unrelated problems\n-When the humor falls flat, IT REALLY FALLS FLAT, some straight up inducing a cringe from me\n-Puzzles don't really go beyond \"put key in door\" or \"mix item with other item\" levels of problem solving, with maybe one or two points where that isn't the case\n-The troll half REALLY drags the game down with boring puzzles and not exactly interesting enviornments if you're at all versed with Homestuck\n-The troll half is also honestly really ham fisted with messages that might not gel well with some fans of the series\n-The soundtrack can get a bit grating with the non-ambient tracks\n-The game is maybe 2 hours long if you know what you're doing, more if you don't, like me; but maybe only an hour more\n\n4/10.\nI really wanted to like this game. I really did. However for every good aspect the game seems to have, there's seems to be a problem to match it. And with how short the whole experience is, you won't really have much time to get invested in the setting, characters, or the plot with how barebones it really is. It almost feels more like a proof of concept than a fully fleshed out game. Might be better to just wait for the whole thing to come out before buying unless you're a diehard fan that wishes to show their support along the way.

In these areas the game doesn't make it clear enough what it wants you as a player to do, and even when you do figure these \"puzzles\" out it isn't satisfying, it's just frustrating. I understand they were going for classic 90s computer games but they could have updated the responses a bit more to feel good to play.\n\n- On the other end, some puzzles are TOO straight forward, and feel like they're spoon feeding the player the answer. I find this more frustrating than the combat/hacking puzzles, because it just feels like there was no reason or thought for those obstacles when it was so obvious how to get around them. How many point-and-click adventure games have done the \"find a key\" puzzle by now? Once could pass for nostalgia, but in the first act, let alone the first scene they do the \"find a key\" bit upwards of 3 times. I wish a bit more of the attention given to the writing side of the game was given to the....game side of the game as well.\n\nDespite all this, I still recommend HIVESWAP for people who love point-and-click adventure, regardless of whether you were a fan of Homestuck or not. The story is accessible for new audiences as well as paying a lot of subtle fanservice to people who read the comic, and doesn't have to carry a lot of the exposition baggage Homestuck is so famous for. Most of it's pitfalls are in the mechanics, but as it is it doesn't really need to be super engaging on that front, just a little more polish would make the experience more enjoyable. I was totally absorbed by the story and characters from start to finish and am very excited for act 2's release, which will hopefully be soon.

For some, that will be fantastic.  Others may find it alien and peculiar.  There's one significant deviation from that formula though, in that the game features two minigames that are basically short sessions of Centipede.  The first is easy enough to be inoffensive to everyone, but the second is actually hard enough to be a genuine annoyance to P&C purists.  \n\nAssuming you actually LIKE P&C games, and are fond of all the reading and clicking things on other things just to see what the game will respond, there's a ton of material here. It took me 6 hours, and that's with only minimal \"I know this won't accomplish anything, but I'm going to try using the X on the Y just for the lulz\" shenanigans.\n\nBut if you DON'T enjoy reading all the text, the game is actually pretty short.  This first installment BARELY feels like it even manages to get the main story off the ground, which is a bit odd, because I don't think there are actually all that many more Acts planned.  Without knowing what the rest of the story will be, it's hard to say much of anything more about that.\n\nAll in all, a good time.  A bit slower-paced than just reading Homestuck was, even in the dialogue-heavy parts, but still a good time.  Recommend to anyone who likes both P&C games and Homestuck.

It's really, really fun. And totally, unquestionably Homestuck. Let me elaborate:\n[list]\n[*]The writing is so far beyond great as to defy adjectives (didn't I just say that?).\n[*]The utterly over-the-top (at least superficial) interactability of every item and ability you pick up with every object in the environment is the means by which you access the lion's share of text in the game, and one of the greatest sources of fun throughout is wondering what connection the characters/the narrator will make between the two wholly unrelated objects you just pushed together, and how the narrator will next insult you or voice their exasperation with your obsessive need to poke things with other things. When some of the especially ridiculous combinations lead to actual Steam achievements, the feeling is tremendously satisfying.\n[*]Given that it is ACTUALLY a point-and-click adventure game, much of the humor has a more game-medium-oriented, \"mechanical\", Problem Sleuth/Homestuck Acts 1-3 vibe than the crazy [spoiler]\"callback-within-a-callback-within-a-callback-too-many-dead-Nepetas-holy-crap-is-that-Shrek-HUSSIE-NO\"[/spoiler] humor of the latter 2/3 of Homestuck. Which will be perhaps a disappointment for a good number of fans, but a HUGE plus for many including myself.\n[*]The music is. just. SO GOOD. James Roach and Toby Fox composed the lion's share, and it's UHMAZING. It brings back the beloved earlier-Homestuck feature of \"character music\"--pieces or motifs that are specific to and meant to evoke the perspective of particular characters, and it does it damn well.\n[*]The action sequences are not the game's strong suit, in my opinion, and the STRIFE system, while very visually evocative of its source material within Homestuck, is kind of a frustrating and mechanically insubstantial affair. What makes up for it is the puns that appear as \"move descriptions\" or \"combat flavor text\" when you try out various things in combat--they need to be seen to be believed.\n[*]The art is real pretty. Just super, super pretty.\n[*]The relationships between the characters are magnificent and mundane and dysfunctional and wonderful (again, it's Homestuck).\n[/list]\n\nSuperlative praise so far. Now for the cons:\n[list]\n[*]There are a lot of typos. I mean a LOT of typos. 1 in 4 chunks of game text, as of launch night, contains one or more duplicate words, misspellings, or other typographical errors. This is the highest typo density I've ever seen in a game, outside the very worst/cheapest dating-sim visual novels and text-heavy flash games. Given how great the text (as intended) is, and what a huge part of the game it comprises, this is really disappointing to me--but thankfully for later players, it is much easier for the devs to fix than almost any other bug/mistake in the game, and I'm sure the bug reports are already flooding in.\n[*]Clicking on objects in the environment is visually buggy. Some things that are not mutually interactable (i.e. poking thing B with thing A does nothing) nonetheless display the cursor change intended to represent interactability, only to switch back to the regular cursor and do nothing else when actually clicked to interact.\n[*]There are more than a couple situational text mistakes, including one really profoundly disappointing \"narrative sequence break\" in which interacting with an important object provided text that was clearly only meant to be displayed when I came back to that area much later and had completed several intermediary objectives, and actually spoilered the immediately-following [i]hour[/i] of gameplay (by describing those as-yet-unintroduced intermediate objectives as if I had already performed them). Another such problem which prevents an obstacle to progression (to which I have yet to identify a workaround, though I know one either exists or else the objective in question is a non-required subthread of gameplay, because people have completed the game) involves an item nowhere in sight being described as right in front of you (and all the objects supposedly around it referring, upon interaction, to this more important object theoretically nestled amongst them). Another involves a character attempting to perform a complex operation, which they initially fail, followed by game text reminding them they left themselves instructions in another room. I looked high and low for said instructions, found no sign of them, and eventually went back to the original room and clicked to attempt the operation again on the off-chance some different text would display giving me a further hint to the instructions' location. Despite my having found/done nothing in the interim, this second attempt actually successfully completed the puzzling operation, and progressed the story beyond the need to find the elusive (and ostensibly necessary) instructions.\n[*]Clicking the open spaces of an environment to walk around within it is quite clunky, and I experienced a fair amount of frustration trying to find the right spots to click to make characters walk across certain rooms so I could see what was off-camera.\n[*]unfortunately, given the previously mentioned \"real-pretty\"-ness of the art, the animation during cutscenes is far from fluid--very few frames of animation per second. This is not a huge frustration, and it by no means ruins the action being presented, but it's noticeable.\n[*]See near the bottom of the first bulleted list for my comments on the STRIFE (combat) system.\n[/list]\n\nAt this point, I would say--if you are not one of the untold myriad including myself who are driven by a blood-compulsion to play and complete and devour and pick clean the nostalgia-spiced carcass of this game RIGHT NOW--wait a while for the less systemic issues to be ironed out before purchasing. After a bit of cleanup by the devs, you are sure to have the truly captivating, feels-inducing, laughter-provoking, magnificently bizarre experience you deserve, and which the wonderful people behind this game so earnestly wish to provide you. :)", "timestamp_created": 1505533544, "timestamp_updated": 1505611172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500720", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34986875": {"recommendationid": "34986875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059802287", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505672410}, "language": "english", "review": "thoroughly enjoyed the game\nthe songs are really catchy you find yourself just humming along to each one\nanimation was p great also\nloved the art\nxefros is adorable i want to see him hug something\nwill be getting act 2 when it comes out!", "timestamp_created": 1505533394, "timestamp_updated": 1505615841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34986869": {"recommendationid": "34986869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329476984", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505952758}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game!

I don't usually enjoy this genre, but they weren't kidding when they said it had all the charm, but none of the frustration of most point-and-clicks. \n\nStory: 5/5 \n   The perfect length for an episodic game, in my opinion. Enough callbacks and reference to the original comic to satisfy long-time fans, but you have no need to know the lore beforehand to complete the game. This game does tie some unanswered questions in the comic together and reveal things most people wouldn't even have speculated, but again, understanding them isn't needed to enjoy the game.\n\nGameplay and Combat: 4/5\n   Favourite thing about the gameplay is how efficient it is. The walking pace changed depending on the situation to ease frustration. For example, if you were to click something at the far end of a room, Joey would speedwalk there to inspect it instead of her usual pace she takes when walking regularly. It's minor, but really pleasant.\n   Combat is very user-friendly, but feels scripted (I'm guessing that was intended). The only challenge I felt was figuring out which option to use to win, I didn't ever come to a situation where I felt like I was gonna lose. Keeping in mind I have not yet tried to lose a strife.  \n\nGraphics: 4.5/5\n   Absolutely adorable! Keeps in line with Homestuck's style (notable addition: arms), and the animation is consistent. Really pleasing to look at. The contrast between living/moving objects and the scenes was good, they stuck out adequately yet were as elegant as the background itself. \n  The backgrounds were beautiful, but it was a little difficult at times to make out which objects I could inspect/interact with. Sometimes they were in a cluttered corner, or even a couple of items cluttered together, and a few just blended in to the scenery. However, this didn't take away from my enjoyment , and the middle ground between \"completely hidden in the background\" and \"so obvious its basically telling you\" is hard to reach. \n\nMusic: 4.5/5\n   Fitting and familiar. I shouldn't be surprised at how many songs there were, given the source material and development team. Transitions between songs when entering different areas was smooth and pleasant, felt mostly natural. I have nothing bad to say about the music, only that it didn't grab me the same way the Homestuck soundtrack did. \n   The price increase from the game alone to with the soundtrack was very fair. Would reccomend getting it with.\n\nCharacters: 6/5\n   Oh my gosh, the characters. I don't know how to talk about characters without spoiling much, but this episode established more depth than I thought it would. Adorable characters, not without flaws, still adorable. I wish I could back this up more with words, but writing a review this late at night doesn't help me.\n\nOverall: 4.5 stars\n   Super nice and satisfying to play! Short but not too short, and full of story. Can't wait until the next installment!\n\n(I didn'd read any reviews before writing this.

I liked the simple character designs against a more complex background, and all of the backgrounds were detailed and nice looking\n+I really liked the dialogue and the text that popped up when you clicked on stuff. Almost everything you combined or made interact with other things had different text, which was really cool to me.\n+I liked the characters and was interested to see what would happen next, which is pretty good because a lot of the times I don't care.\n+A lot of people complained about the mini games, but I really liked them. \n+The puzzles at the beginning were fun and nice to complete\n\nCONS:\n-The puzzles near the end were just clicking on random things and praying. The description said no dream logic but that was exactly what happened\n-Very glitchy. This is probably the most major problem. If just this one problem were fixed, everything would be great. When I first played it, things weren't cropped right, and everything was just off centered. Sometimes I could see parts of other rooms I didn't even know about yet. [spoiler] In Jude's treehouse I could see the desk drawer off to the side of the screen and actually complete the puzzle without ever clicking the desk [/spoiler] I actually got rid of steam and reinstalled it in order for it to be functional, Now it works great, but my computer is suffering. Why should a few videos and dialogue cause so much suffering?\n-The strife scenes were very... strange? I feel like they would be better if there was some sort of health bar so you could feel that you were progressing in some way, and have you use some kind of fighting ability instead of relying on the random stuff you just pick up.\n-There were a lot of homestuck references. While this is a homestuck game, so it makes sense that there'd be references, but there were some characters that were mentioned whose implications only someone who knew the character would understand. The storyline still makes sense, and its not completely void of entertainment if you haven't read it.\n-The character animations were kind of off. They were kind of jittery sometimes, and other times they didn't quite match the action. [spoiler] Joey throws spice at something and her \"picking something up off the ground\" animation plays. Why? is she picking up minuscule particles of spice off of the ground? maybe it's not a glitch, she's just talented. Who am I to judge? [/spoiler] Also, some times the door opening animation doesn't quite match up with the door but at this point I'm just nitpicking.\n-The game is pretty short. I personally was fine with it, I wish it was longer but it's like how I wish a book I was reading was longer. I don't feel cheated, I just feel excited for the next one. However some other people feel cheated and I can understand that.\n-Really long production time. Why did it take so long, I finished in about 3 hours.\n-\"Everything has unique text when interacted with another thing\" is a lie. Some things would say stuff, so saying that goes against the description.\n-This is more of a misconception than anything else, but I thought there would be multiple endings and they did not exist. This makes the 3 hours worth that much less.\n\nOVERALL:\nWait until the glitches are resolved and only then should you think about buying it. You do not want to go though the pain I went through. After the glitches are fixed, then continue to proceed cautiously. I love homestuck and I love a lot of the things in this game, but watch a playthrough if you just want to see the pretty pictures.", "timestamp_created": 1505527766, "timestamp_updated": 1505527766, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34985574": {"recommendationid": "34985574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174625850", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505532534}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect game love the art, tons of references to Roxy, she's great, also Homestuck in general.

Everything is here except this time around there's a lot less plot to deal with and only vague references and mentions. It helps to know the mechanics in Homestuck, but none of it is required. Now let me follow up and say that if you don't enjoy reading loads of text, using things with other things, you probably won't get a lot out of Hiveswap. There's cute characters, funny moments, and all sorts of little things going on if you just play the game through with the basic plot. If you start using everything with everything else you start understanding the characters as a whole. And that's Hiveswap's strength, getting you invested in the main characters through stupid completely optional interactions. And even if you don't do these interactions, the vast colorful cluttered environments come a close second, showing a ton of character in their own way.\n\nBut ultimately, Hiveswap is just a slightly more interactive version of Homestuck. Since accessibility to the craziness of the media is the concept, puzzles are very simple and interacting with objects will give you big hints that will tell you exactly what to do. It's a good thing that Hiveswap advertises this because adventure game veterans are going to feel a little underwhelmed. Again, however, this is a game where the completely optional acts of using things with things will fill in all those little spaces where the game may feel less than stellar. And nearly every thing you use other things with have unique dialogue! Hooray! \n\nBig tip: if you intend to play the game this way, DIGEST IT. There is so much text, so much text, Homestuck is near legendary for its ability to completely smother pages with texts, Hiveswap is no different. If you really want to use everything with everything, then my friend, you have a 6 hour game ahead of you. So yes, take your time to enjoy it because you will get tired out if you don't. If you decide to just run through Hiveswap, it's considerably less time at about 2 to 3 hours, probably less if you know what you're doing or don't bother checking anything. But again, a lot of the fun is just those optional dialogues.\n\nIf you're interested in Homestuck but haven't read it or read very far into it, Hiveswap is... somewhat of a good jump in point. There's almost no spoilers to the main series, or at least any obvious ones. And from what I've seen, Act 1 doesn't reference the webcomic's plot at all. If you're a big Homestuck fan, then you're going to like Act 1 and it'll be over too soon. Just think of it as an update followed by a megapause. It's like Homestuck never ended. And if I'm going to be frank, given how much dialogue and text there is in Act 1, I'm pretty relieved that there'll be time to talk and speculate about every little thing.

You will really appreciate all the little details you can find poking around even within the first few areas alone), humor, beautiful artwork, and an equally-great soundtrack.

The text was creative and witty, something that encourages players to try out different combinations just to take in a sentence or two more.\n\nThe story itself is entirely independent of Homestuck, while keeping an amazing level of quality, which makes it entirely suitable for people who've never even heard of the webcomic before.

The art is very stylistic, similar to Homestuck's, but with MUCH more detail put into both art and animation. Speaking of Homestuck, you don't need to have read Homestuck to understand the plot, as it will introduce the concepts Homestuck readers already know about through the course of the game.\n\nAt least in my experience, however, there were some resolution issues (The game would only run in widescreen format leaving black bars at the top and bottom, regardless of windowed/fullscreen or what resolution I played in.) and the UI could sometimes get in the way and stick around in situations were it should disappear, but these were just minor grievances and are not nearly as big of problems as they would be in a more fast-paced game.\n\nAs a lore-loving completionist type who read every text prompt using every inventory item on every background object, 9/10. It may be an 8 or 7/10 for a more fast-paced player. But, my heart will say 10/10.\n \nBecause Homestuck.", "timestamp_created": 1505513371, "timestamp_updated": 1505513396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34982321": {"recommendationid": "34982321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042406998", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506190629}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice point and click that harkens back to games before my time.

Joey is a totally fun and lovely hero, and I'm really looking forward seeing how she will evolve in this universe.

The default movements of characters while not walking are a bit choppy, but I guess that could be the style of the game. \nAnd that's it, I didn't notice any other bugs, probably because I was too busy admiring the artwork.\n\n[i] And now, a novel-lenght appreciation part of the game [/i]\nFirst of all, ARTWORK. Man, the backgrounds, the animations, y e s. I would spend like 10 minutes just staring at the backgrounds, admiring the beautiful art. And then clicking furiously on everything with everything to get every single text box I can get. The humour of the game is also yes, very much like Homestuck, forced me to take out my translator app sometimes because it uses SO MUCH fancy words. Especially Jude. Jude's talking through walkie talkie kinda annoyed me. \nMusic. Oh god, the music. Every single piece I heard in this game is beautiful. Toby Fox and James Roach did an amazing job. My favourite was Xefros' theme Rustblood, a.k.a. WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE TREATS. Can't wait to arrange the song to piano. \nMoving on. Strife scenes. They are a bit tricky, but I really enjoyed the generic Homestuck Strife texts after every attack. I loved that you needed to use stuff in your sylladex to win the fights. Rip bat monster, you will not be missed as you ate poor Frohiko. \nThe animations are really fluid and beautifully drawn. The \"The Door is Open\" animation is amazing. The facial expressions of the characters are very funny and perfectly drawn as well. Man, this game's visual are great and I will proceed to talk about it for the rest of my life.\nMoving to Alternia, I was happy to find out some more stuff about this world that Hussie has crafted for us over the years. The violent nature of trolls never fails to amuse me. As Xefros kept talking about his moirail Dammek, who was probably sucked in to the cherub portal at the same time as Jude, I started to grow fond of this little sweet cinnamon roll Xefros and kinda feel bad for the boy, because his moirail was clearly using him? Let Jude kick Dammek's ass later for that please. \nWhere was I?\nDiscovered Alternian sports - Pusher ? I think? Later he referred to this sports as Arena Stickball so I dunno. Once again, morbid game: you win - cool, you lose - death. Like everything is in Alternia.\nAlso they have public transport which is great. \nMy favourite part about the Alternia part of gameplay was the ability to name Lususes. Lusi? I don't even know. I don't know why, but I got really excited when I got to pick a name for sloth Lusus. \nInteractive walkie-talkie on Earth and trollian on Alternia was cool too. I wonder how will the real life dialogues go in the next Acts.\nThe personalities of the characters were also good. I feel like I know the characters as good as people I see everyday. Is that a good thing? Probably. Easier to write good fanfics :D\nMan, I could go on and on about every single object in the game, but I'll spare you guys this time.\n\nTL;DR: As it was just released it has some bugs but aside from those, the game is amazing and you all should check it out!", "timestamp_created": 1505499793, "timestamp_updated": 1505499793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34978267": {"recommendationid": "34978267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269412730", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "last_played": 1515167761}, "language": "english", "review": "Really beautiful game and enjoyable for both homestucks and non-homestucks alike! \nAlso, I may only have known the children for a little while, but if anything happened to them I would first kill everyone in the room and then myself.", "timestamp_created": 1505499634, "timestamp_updated": 1505499634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34978218": {"recommendationid": "34978218", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960302266", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511653273}, "language": "english", "review": "HIVESWAP is a well made point and click adventure game based on the Homestuck web comic.

Which, leaving in account that this is an indie pc game is very normal. However, some stuff is really annoying, like cutscenes being skipped, and a resolution changing bug.\nMost of the mid game cutscenes are just still images that change after one or two seconds. would not be too bad, bus most of the time there isn't a transitioning animation for the character before and after the cutscene, and some of the regular animations don't really interact withe the enviroment (I.E.: opening a door)\nJoey opening doors animations annoys me. She should've interact with the door's handle. small nitpick but still\nThe puzzles are not challenging\nIt is Short. It can be divided in only two segments, and if you go running you can finish it in like an hour. Of course, that's normal for a point-and-click adventure game, since you usually have to interact with everything to extent it's time. but still, the game should have more playtime, speacially with the amount received with kickstarter money.\n\nThe good stuff:\nThe story. Nothing mind super blowing like the mid homestuck, but Honestly, it is probably because I know most of troll culture and have watched the trailers over and over again. It gives to me the same feeling I have with the initial acts of homestuck. If this indicates anything, Act 2 of hiveswap will be very good, like letters acts of the original work. It's a good introduction to both hiveswap and hauntswitch. It shows the protagonists of the games, the initial threats that they are fighting, the world(and house) they live in, and hints of other characters that will help or antagonize them. It has good potential, and I don't really like to criticize a story for it's beginning, the mid stuff is what matters. And a satisfying ending I guess.\nJokes: They are funny, and that's all I have to say on the matter\nMusic: I don't regret buying the album without knowing if the songs are good or bad.\nStrife battles: They are all pretty nice, although there is a short amount of them\nCharacters: They are all lovely, and have all potential to grow, although if they do not in the following acts... they might look one-dimensional.\nYou can interact with everything with almost everything\nYou don't need to read homestuck to know what's happening. Everything  a new player won't know and need to know at the moment, the game will explain.\n\nNeutral:\nAnimation: \nThey are good, however I wish there were more of them, especially in the middle of the game, the lack of transitioning between a character in the screen and a still image cutscene get's a bit annoying. \nDialogues: They are condesced in information and are funny sometimes. Although they can be a bit long.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a good introduction, and if the following episodes expand on characters, lore and playtime it can be very good as a whole. \n\nThe price is a bit expensive for the size of the game, but might be worth it if the following acts are cheaper. like 4+ dollars cheaper\n\nNow if you are a new player... even though I recommend this game you have to know that the game is around 3 hours, the following acts could get good or not. And you still will have to pay for them, are they going to be cheaper? What Pumpkin haven't given information on this yet.

Though I'm going to note that I'm not used to this style of game at all. \n\nI thought that for the time we waited for this game to come out, the animations were a bit rough (though the art otherwise was very nicely done). The music did get repetitive and could've used a few more tracks to break up the monotony. It bugged me that characters in a stressful situation were animated with smiles on their faces, I think a more neutral expression would appropriate at the very least. \n\nI thought the play time was okay for episode 1.

I do not know why this happened, but it played the third time I tried it.

Sometimes the click areas felt needlessly tedious and off, especially descending the stairs in the Harley house. This game wouldn't run with my GTX 430 installed, I had to plug in my r9 290. Technically the lower card could've handled it, but it just wouldn't open.

Homesick fans are used to much of the charm of the series being the writing beneath the panel; similarly, the charm in this game is in the tidbits of writing you get trying every object in your inventory with every object you can interact with. There were very few objects that did not react in a unique way to every single item, and you get character background, 90s nostalgia (perhaps the term is more \"90s mockery'), references galore, and plenty of humor for your time.\n\nThe dialoguelogs of the comic are implemented very well in game by form of walkie-talkie and tablet conversations. These come almost a little too frequently, though they're always enjoyable.\n\nIf I had one issue with the game, it's that the minigames that for the game are too short and easy. The point and click puzzles are almost non-existent, which is okay because they're not really supposed to be the focus of the game (with the exception of one important puzzle which is solved by another character, which would be a major flaw except that it allows us to explore another room and help out as said character). But the minigames could be much more. Let the Simon Says game go on for double the iterations.

But this game here deserves this and much more.\n\nI have to say that, being a Homestuck fan, I was really hyped waiting for it, but nevertheless, I will make this review as objective as possible.\n\nIt's an awesome first act for a point and click game. If you are a Homestuck fan like me, you're going to really enjoy playing this, looking into every detail and gasping at every reference or in-depth look at thing related to the webcomic.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that this game can't be enjoyed by people who doesn't know Homestuck, quite the opposite, indeed, the story is tailored in a way that no knowledge of the webcomic is needed to enjoy it. Sure, you'll miss part of the appeal of the game, but you won't have any \"What? Am I supposed to know something?\" moment while playing Hiveswap: Act 1.\n\nPros:\n\n- A really nice and unique art style, with very fluid animations.\n- A great soundtrack to enjoy every stage of the game.\n- It's easy enough to assure you won't get frustrated by not knowing what to do to continue the story.\n- The narration is very enjoyable, with humour everywhere, surely to make you feel like you are playing the likes of Monkey Island or Hollywood Monsters.\n\nCons:\n\n- Maybe a little bit too easy, indeed. If you only enjoy point and clicks adventures that make you squeeze you brain out in order to solve an almost unsolvable puzzle, you're not going to enjoy this game, but hey! they point it out themselves, so...\n\n- It is only the first act of a 4 acts series, so... Yeah, it really leaves you wanting more once you finish it, I'm not gonna lie. But well... It's only 8$, so it's a fair quantity of content for that price.\n\nWith all said, while I REALLY recommend this game to everyone who loves good humour and a great story, I must also say that, if you can, wait untill more acts are out, or have enough distractions at hand for when you finnish this one and find yourself craving for more Hiveswap.", "timestamp_created": 1505495024, "timestamp_updated": 1505495024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34976747": {"recommendationid": "34976747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084743763", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505664690}, "language": "french", "review": "just awsome", "timestamp_created": 1505495003, "timestamp_updated": 1505495003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34976600": {"recommendationid": "34976600", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990265172", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505462945}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love P&C games with good art and a ton of dialogue, then Hiveswap is for you.\n\nThe generous pricing model, to me, recouped the game's negatives which were: Sometimes frusterating navigation, a couple visual bugs, and even a single game-breaking bug.\n\nWish it didn't have those, but I was too busy having legitimate laughs to get hung up on it.\n\nSoundtrack is on point as well.\n\nOverall, I don't know how to recommend this to non-Homestuck fans.

All in all, I recommend this to all those who read the comic, those who haven't but are willing to try it out, and those that just like point and click adventures.  \n\nOne thing I will say though is that the first act is rather short if you just go ahead and try to progress, but seeing as how almost every combination of item has its own unique response, you can enjoy yourself experimenting to see what does what.", "timestamp_created": 1505493806, "timestamp_updated": 1505493806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34976298": {"recommendationid": "34976298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072645582", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505666237}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This game is good![/h1]\n\nSo yeah, I caved and bought [b]HIVESWAP. IT IS NOT HOMESTUCK THE GAME IT IS HIVESWAP. THE ONLY SIMILAR THING IS THE UNIVERSE IT TAKES PLACE IN, YOU COWARDS.[b]\n\nAnyways, I bought HIVESWAP expecting an advnture game, and I got...well, I got an adventure game! A fairly short one, according to all of the reviews. But honestly, what were you expecting from a game that's supposed to be episode one in a four part series? \n\nFirst thing I noticed is a pretty glaring flaw, and that is [i]the cutscenes don't work on my computer[/i]. Now, I'm not gonna blame the game for this, seeing as I'm playing it on an older laptop, and I bet if I were playing it on a newer machine, this problem wouldn't be occuring. But I'm not a huge fan of the fact that none of the cutscenes for the entire story are gonna load for me. If anyone knows how to correct this problem (orwheretowatchthecutscenesinorder) that would be awesome. \n\nOther than that, the game is pretty great! I'm a HUGE fan of the art style here, I really think it does a great job of encapsulating the space. [u]The puzzles are hard, but not impossible.[/u] We're not knee-deep in moon logic here, but you gotta be ready to use your thinking cap on this one. It's no goat puzzle, essentially. \n\n[u]The soundtrack is solid, using both classic homestuck soundfonts and some stuff from Undertale.[/u] I would say Toby Fox did the music, but if you're a fan of his work (which you are if you're into homestuck, let's be real here) you could've told on your own. I guess this is payment for Andrew letting him make most of Undertale in his basement. \n\n[u]I'd reccomend this game to anyone, homestuck fan or not.[/u] If you're not into homestuck, you'll miss out on some minor references, but there's not really anything about homestuck you NEED to know to get this game. No major puzzles are based around your knowledge of homestuck lore. If you ARE into homestuck, you'll get some of the references and jokes they make [spoiler] (the my pet monster in the hallway for example) [/spoiler]  but you have no real upperhand. \n\n[b][u]However, this is definitely a pure adventure game and should not be partaken in if you dislike that style.[/b][/u] This is not my FIRST experience with the genre, but I know that it really takes some brains to get some of this stuff done, and it might not be appealing to you to walk around a dusty mansion looking for d-batteries [spoiler] (THEY WERE IN THE  RADIO I SEARCHED THE WHOLE FREAKING HOUSE JESUS FUCKING CHRIST ON A CRACKER) [/spoiler] but you certainly need to work for reward here. So if you're looking into a first look into the adventure game genre, I would definitely suggest either this game if you want to REALLY challange yourself, or maybe try out one of the humongous entertainment games, which I believe are available on steam. \n\nFinal score: numbers are irrelevant to human emotion and numbers other than 10/10 or 0/10 are useless.

The only other problem I had was that even though I clicked on a lot of stuff (not every single item interaction, but quite a few of them), and got stuck a few times (nothing major, just me never being super good at puzzles, even though the puzles aren't really that hard, I just needed to think some more) and took a while to think of a name for Xefros' and Dammek's lusii, the game only took me about 4 hours, which isn't terrible, but it did seem a little short.

There's lots of interactions you can have with items, and the art in this game is lovely, atmospheric and the animation is extremely fluid. If I had to nitpick, I would have liked to see more of the interactable setpieces move, a la old point and clicks, but as they are, they're fine.

Yeah, it's only 8 bucks, and I did have some fun with it, and I was grinning for most of the experience, but I don't know about it. I did like a lot of the writing, and the jokes had me chuckling. However, there were a few animations that weren't the greatest, the resolution for the game was all out of whack which caused things from a previous screen to load in, and those kind of threw me out of the game. Sometimes the screen would even jitter about, and moving for a few of the scrolling screens was hell because you could only click so far from your body when you're at the edge of the screen. Mixing for the music was off as well, sometimes tracks would just abruptly end and then start back up after the next one would end. It also just felt too short. I know it's going to be an episodic thing, but if all of these episodes are going to be 8 bucks, I'm not sure I want to buy every part if they're going to be that small.  Overall, I'd suggest you play it if you're a homestuck fan or looking to get into it.

There's a tiny bit of changes from the original Homestuck, but still gives me the feeling that I'm looking at the same universe. (or maybe it's a different universe really :0)\n- Well what can you say? I love the script! Jude's script being quite fun to read and all and Xefros being the bab he is. Of course, Joey is included. She's,,, amazing\n- Cutscenes. They're well animated (even though a bit laggy for my laptop,,) and... smooth, just generally smooth. Both literally and... well yeah. That. Detailed stuff. \n- ERIDAN??? (Yeah)\n- (does me cringing the whole time count as a pro)\n\nCons:\n- Let's just say... it's a bit shorter than I expected, but I acknowledge that it took a lot of time and effort.

Be warned, however, that a bug that I (and many others apparently) faced caused this beauty to be tarnished slightly. When opening the game, the aspect ratio is messed up. You can choose a new display ratio, and it *looks* like it might've fixed itself - but it hasn't. If you experience this issue, relaunch the game, or else the backgrounds are going to appear incorrectly at times.\n\nBack to the review. Hiveswap is a short adventure game with minimal difficulty and no \"dead ends\" from what I could see. The battle system is a neat spin on the way STRIFE works in Homestuck, and from what I could see it has no failure state. Think of battles in this as a series of puzzles that you have time to fail and get right. The puzzles don't involve any real violence, the main charatcer speaks for herself on this: \"I don't use guns.\"\n\nWhat you get instead of anything above \"I whack the critter\" is a very funny and entertaining battle system, with the iconic bizarre one-liners of STRIFE combat acting as gags or hints. The puzzles in combat do suffer, however, from a lack of clarity. There are times in combat where you'd think an option would work... and it doesn't. However this is an issue that all adventure games suffer, the dreaded \"macgyver\" solutions. But to say that Hiveswap goes to extremes in the way traditional adventure games do would be a stretch - rather, you can have multiple items that seemingly serve the same purpose, but only one works.\n\nThe environment is littered with interactable objects, and as any astute player would be wont to do, you'll spend most of your time clicking through the background looking for items. If you're the kind of person who couldn't care less about the story, and just look for items to solve puzzles, you'll probably only spend 20-40 minutes on this game. I'm a big fan of Homestuck, and spent a lot of time reading item descriptions and looking around this new part of its universe eagerly. \n\nBut that brings us to another point of contention for potential newcomers: the writing. I find the goofy and oftentimes slightly crude writing of Andrew Hussie to be amusing; it fits the theme of \"a bunch of kids doing stuff\" well, and can be very funny when it wants to be. However if you're the kind of person who's coming here looking for a tightly written and executed exploration of characters, then perhaps come into this game with an open mind. None of this is to say that Andrew's writing is bad, or lacklustre, or anything of the sort - heck, most adventure games also have corny writing. Rather I'd like to warn potential buyers that you're not walking into an oscar worthy piece of literary masterclass; rather, an emotional, epic, drama-abound script about kids being kids. It's great, but it's not for everyone.\n\nSpeaking of tone and atmosphere the music does the game much justice. I've seen comments about the music transitions being jarring but personally I never had issues with it. I did however spend a lot of time happily exploring with unobtrusive but pleasant melodies filling my ears. Homestuck has never been short of good music and Hiveswap is no exception. Don't let my description fool you however, when the game needs to get into full gear the soundtrack is happy to oblidge. \n\nThe story of Hiveswap so far has been very engaging. As an avid fan of Homestuck I found myself drawn, yet again, to the exploration of themes such as society and class, as well as the intriguing inclusion of green and red spirals... As someone who has no experience with the Homestuck universe, however, the game still has much to offer. It isn't quick to throw you into themes unbeknownst to anybody but the \"niche audience.\" The game offers a steady introduction to the themes of the universe, with only a few things sticking out to me as lacking explanation; namely the STRIFE system itself.\n\nThe only remaining topic worth touching on is the animation. The idle animations for characters are very expressive and speak to their personalities; but they feel lacking. Rather than being fluid and pleasing to look at, they are stilted, as if they were merely a few frames thrown together. This becomes less apparent over time but it was still distracting at first. The game features many cutscenes, some of which are mostly fully animated and beautiful (the opening and ending cutscenes come to mind, the latter being wonderfully animated) - while the rest are stills being played with sound effects and music. I wish we had seen more of the former, but I understand the team were on a budget, and respect that they used their money wisely.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to anybody with \u00a35 to spare, an open mind looking for a goofy, funny, and rather dramatic story, and a love of puzzles. If you are none of these then it might still be worth a try, but the refund option may turn out to be your best friend. If I had to rate Hiveswap as how I enjoyed it as a fan: 10/10. If I had to rate it as a consumer: 7/10. Hiveswap is let down by its length and minor technical issues. Even while taking my time and reading everything I could, I finished the game in about two hours and forty minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed that entire time, with no dips in my enjoyment whatsoever - but it was still a rather short time.\n\nI will be back when Act 2 releases to continue the story, and hopefully, continue to enjoy myself immensely.", "timestamp_created": 1505481667, "timestamp_updated": 1505481771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34971648": {"recommendationid": "34971648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065894459", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505482496}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you Hussie for my life", "timestamp_created": 1505481640, "timestamp_updated": 1505482105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34971548": {"recommendationid": "34971548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159292124", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505485334}, "language": "english", "review": "HELP I can't do the snake game, it doesn't respond when I click on the keyboard.

Because of all those reasons, I can look past the minor bugs, the horrendously limited video settings, or even the fact that it's supposedly only 3 hours long. But one fatal flaw that I cannot forgive is that it's the most poorly optimized game I've ever played, no joke. \nSeriously, as good as the visuals are, a game of this magnitude could have been pulled off in the early to mid 2000's and run butter smooth on low end machines of that era no problem. Instead, the game overheats my admittedly dated laptop in a matter of minutes, and chugs during cutscenes. By comparison, I can play both seasons of TellTale's The Walking dead for hours and only occasionally have to close it to let my laptop cool down. There's no excuse as to why I can run those games, but not this. \nI'm not forgetting that this is a freaking 2D point and click adventure. HD or not, what could possibly be eating up so many resources? The most taxing thing it would need to do is render a few layers of animated bitmaps. The other things like music, cutscenes, and UI are all things that have been around and haven't been innovated on since 2000.

You do not need to be a Homestuck fan to enjoy this game.[/i]\n\nIt has been many years since I backed this game's kickstarter and almost a year since Homestuck itself has ended, it has been a long winding road. I cannot separate this review from the Homestuck fan that still resides inside of me, so this review is MOSTLY for other Homestuck fans, but also contains general critique.\n\nHIVESWAP: Act 1 is the first part of the HIVESWAP series of point and click adventure games that follow a handful of rambunctious teens in an interplanetary adventure. The game is based on Homestuck the scarily popular and confusing (In a good way) webcomic which itself is styled on a partially text adventure partially point and click game that evolves into a lot more.\n\n[h1]What it gets right:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]HIVESWAP is no graphical masterpiece but its style is very charming and occasionally beautiful, the animations especially are a lot of fun, it's a joy whenever they are on screen.\n[*]The writing for Act 1 is good, it clearly sets the humorous tone immediately and slowly eases you into the dialogues which Homestuck is known for. By the end of Act 1 you are having full blown conversations, much like in Homestuck, but in a much more digestible format as message by message is easier than a wall of text. It also starts simple on the typing quirks, which was the right choice. There are dialogue options and it adds a nice layer of interactivity throughout the conversations though they ultimately seem to have no real consequence in the story.\n[*]The music is fantastic, it is hard to live up to the lightning in a bottle that is Homestuck's soundtrack, with a lot of fantastic early work by Tobyfox (Now of Undertale fame) and a plethora of other community artists, but Hiveswap does a damn good job of trying. James Roach and Toby Fox have made a refreshing and catchy soundtrack with just enough musical nods to leave any Homestuck fan happy.\n[*]References are light and unobtrusive, this can be a real problem when popular things get spin-offs but I feel Hiveswap handles things correctly in this regard, it doesn't feel like I needed to read Homestuck to play this game and enjoy its style and humour.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]What it needs to improve:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]As a basic point and click HIVESWAP: Act 1 comes across as a little flaccid. It isn't put across as a MYST style puzzle game so there isn't any expectations for hard puzzles to be crossed and it works hard to guide the player which overall makes you feel a little babied by the end of this first act. None of the solutions give you that feeling of overcoming something, I would hope that in later acts things get a little more challenging.\n[*]There are a handful of jarring frame by frame scenes that would have done a lot better to be animated, the most glaring example being after doing some [spoiler]tap dancing in the basement.[/spoiler] I feel these scenes contrast harshly when the great animated scenes are still fresh in your mind, I hope the frame by frame is used sparingly in later Acts.\n[*]The length of this game leaves a lot to be desired, I think price-wise even a penny higher would have been a risk. I think myself and a lot of other Homestuck fans will be looking for a lot more to chew on and the general public wont get as much mileage out of this like a Homestuck fan would. My first play through took 3 hours, I didn't rush, I looked at pretty much everything I could, I DIDN'T however use every item I have on everything I could look at, and the game does genuinely have a lot of unique text for this, which is great, I'll probably come back to this game and do that, but can I say everyone who will buy this game will do that? Probably not. \nI REALLY HOPE that this series is going to follow a Homestuck like formula in which the first act is the shortest and the later acts are longer in length. They have stated this series will be in 4 acts which would end up at 9 hours altogether if the first act is anything to go off of, which is nothing to sneeze at but I think closer to 12 - 14 would really benefit Hiveswap as a whole, especially if it decides to get anywhere near as complex as homestuck does.\n[/list]\n\nOverall I would say this game has a winning formula, its problem that it feels a little under-cooked in areas and that the portion size might not fill everyone's belly, as a starter it still leaves you wanting more, I'm excited for the next 3 courses and I wouldn't doubt that other Homestuck fans are too.", "timestamp_created": 1505473080, "timestamp_updated": 1505473080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34969010": {"recommendationid": "34969010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980828201", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505471617}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a 3 hour game. While based on Homestuck it doesn't require Homestuck. Atleast in Act 1 it's just nods to the origins. \n\nIt is also clearly set in the 1990s. It's not so much in your face about it, but 90s kids will just see little things here and there that are clearly 90s things.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who can handle episodic games, able to pick up the next chapter no problem. I can recommend this to get right now.\n\nif you aren't, maybe wait till HIVESWAP has completed.\n\nHomestuck isn't required reading for this game, which is good. Though if you've played this, and enjoyed it, I would recommend giving Homestuck a read. For three reasons.\n1. To pass the time. Homestuck is so long, it may take you months, maybe even a year or so to read through it depending on your pace. \n2. To get background and little nods within the game. Some of the stuff mentioned in Act I will likely get explained, like Moirails.\n3. Learning of the phenomenon that resulted in Newgrounds crashing. Cause yes, Homestuck caused that. Ironicly, it fit with the name and setting with the page/flash animation that caused it.. Cascade.\n\nSo yeah, that's basically what I have to say for it.

Sure, it's short. But, well, if you take some time to mess around with items and explore, you get some interesting developpement considering its only the first act ; some people announced only 2 hours of gameplay, I'm at 5 and i plan to replay again sometimes soon to explore some more, so it depends how invested you are I guess.\n\nBut when you rule this out, the game is really good imo. The characters are very likable and dynamic - even the ones who're not introduced properly yet, the artstyle of the game is really pleasant and reminds me of the comic without being too sketchy, the musics... are good, since james roach and toby fox did the job, and the writting is honestly well done even though Hussie wasn't the one in charge. \n\nIf you're searching for a game including reflexion and deep puzzles, or action and reflexes, I can't recommand Hiveswap to you. Hiveswap is a game about exploring, going with the flow, experimenting with various items or simply following a story without worrying about how good you're doing. If you're the kind of person who'd attempt to spray spices on a pigeon, feed a poster or that kind of dumb shit, then yes, consider Hiveswap because the game expects you to test it. \nAlso, I saw some non-homestuck persons wondering if the game was accessible for them : yes, it is! It happens 15 years before HS begins, so most of the characters weren't even born, and overall the game explains pretty much everything important.

Yeah, it's not the longest game ever, and there are a few finnicky niggles here and there (The resolution starts out at the minimum, and you need to restart the game for the resolution change to take effect, the cutscenes are a little glitchy), but its certainly worth all of five quid for 3 hours first playthrough and double that to mess around and hunt for things, when its just _that funny and engaging_. Maybe someone new to HS would be a little confused with the trolls but overall, I think they pulled off accessability well.\n\nIf you start playing expecting the whole story you'll be disappointed. This is Act 1 of 4 (supposedly), and there's talk of a counterpart game series telling the other side of the swap later called Hauntswitch.

I got into it maybe two or three years before the comic ended and I followed it pretty religiously to the end.

While reading the comic will make you catch certain references and draw conclusions, Hussie is 100% correct when he says there is NO requirement to read the comic to understand this game. So if you've never read Homestuck or are thinking about reading it, this game is still really good.\n\nThe achievements are ridiculous and that is part of the charm. The writing is over the top and that's sort of Hussie's brand of humor. If you like quirky writing Hiveswap is the game for you, even if you're not a fan of Homestuck. That being said though if you're not a fan of quirky writing, you probably won't enjoy this game.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, there is nothing more to say about that. Get the soundtrack edition, you won't regret it.\n\nThe game also is very easy to pick up and play even if you've never played point-and-click adventure games before. It avoids the pitfalls of the genre such as accidentally putting the game in an unwinnable state (there's always a way to progress in Hiveswap).\n\nI would highly recommend it and for $8 it'll be a great way to spend 2-4 hours.

If it only took them 5 years to make one Act, we are going to have a problem.\n\nPros:\n- Wonderful story, and fond throwback to the original Homestuck.\n- Act 1 recaps the world of Homestuck for those who need a refresher, or are new to Homestuck and it does this quite nicely .\n- The art style is wonderful, and it is nice to see a much beloved comic in this art style.\n- The puzzels are wonderful, and help convey the story nicely.\n\nCons:\n- I waited 5 years for a few hours of gameplay. There needs to be more to this, and if they cannot deliver fast enough, they will have some sad and angry people on their hands.\n- Not all that bad, but the combats aren't really combats. I'll give the benefit of the doubt since it is a story game.\n\nOverall, this game was wonderful to play and delved me deeper into the Homestuck world. The characters have a nice introduction and everything, and things are really just set up well for the first and upcoming acts. There just needs to be more meat to this all. . .

This is fairly likely, and I think this would cause a lot of non-die-hard fans to lose interest in continuing this series.\n\nMiddleground: It's a lesser-priced DLC, perhaps closer to $5.

As for the rest of the characters, I do hope to see more development on Jude, but hopefully in Hauntswitch, and Xefros was fun to read though he does need more development so we can really see the type of character he is.\n\nI love the way you can tell how the characters lived and what they liked just by looking at your surroundings of where they lived, Joey's room and the kitchen expecially. The visuals were just outstanding, the backgrounds, even if initially concept art, and just so damn appealing to look and and they tell the viewer so much and I love that they get that point around and don't even need words for it but they go the extra mile by adding a shit ton of funny dialouge to each and every little thing in room. Cutscenes were smooth and crisp, I loved to watch them when my computer would actually properly load them, heh. \n\nNow the soundtrack....oh my god the soundtrack. IT'S JUST AMAZING. I love how the music in the game always is able to convey the atmosphere and feeling of the scene, whether it's goofy and laid back or to make you ready for action. It always gets it's point around and that's great for music. The motifs are lovely and I even bought the soundtrack included version of the game. Toby Fox's composition was incredible, but I think what made it really shine was James Roach's great instrument choices. (I personally really like SERPENT GENESIS)\n\nAs for controls, they were honestly a bit wonky, but not unbearably bad. Places in the manor were tedious to get around because of how inconviently the other room enterences were and how you would often accidentally click of them. But system wise it was fun and I love the charming puzzles, though a couple of them were really farfetched and I had to look up how to do them! \n\nI have to say, there's a lot of cons to this game, but most of them are so small that someone just enjoying it for the narrative wouldn't notice. I'd have to say the biggest things that bothered me in my first playthrough of this was the ocassional skip of dialouge (since any key goes to the next text bubble) and how, even on one of the lowest resolutions, the cutscenes were extremely slow and sometimes would make my game freeze. There were also times where I felt like the game wasn't complete just because of the sprite animations only having four to eight frames per second, which is honesly kind of sad to look at. There are also times where some of the dialouge, specifically between Joey and Xefros, where text feels unnessary or drawn out as if it's a filler episode in a comedy show. A very small conplaint is how there were just these moments of almost silence where I think they could have tried to work more on sound design of the monsters to help get the atmosphere of the scene across. \n\nA complaint that doesn't apply to most of the first buyers (like myself) but will probably impact a lot of people later on if this game gets really popular is that if felt like there was an extreme inbalance of the \"Homestuck feel\" that it was promising. At the start of the game Homestuck readers are refreshed with even just the text font but throughout the Half-Harley manor you see refrences scattered in almost every corner and I loved that...but when we got to Alternia it just felt well...devoid of anything Homestuck. Sure they have Alternia as a planet and the species and all that but the refernces were clearly toned down A LOT. I wasn't too personally effected by this but it just felt really off to me during my first play through. At the same time though, I feel like for someone who hasn't read Homestuck all these references are shoved down their throat and they're finally relieved of that once they get to the Alternian scenes. \n\nAnother small gripe, though many people have talked about it, is the awkward switching between characters and how once you just get invested in Joey, she gets taken away from you and the bizzare Jude Harley is who you're playing as. It's just ackward and feels forced on you, and it was really sudden, I think it would have just been better to make the scenes with Jude in them cutscenes and keep the playable characters limited to Joey and Xefros. That is until Hauntswitch when Jude gets his own game, then it makes a lot more sense. \n\nThose were just my main gripes though, and the pros about this game definately overweigh the cons; plus, some of those cons won't even been noticed by people. I smiled a lot through playing Hiveswap and I think the dialouge and main visuals can make up for most of it's cons. It's just simply a fun game, though I think that after people experiance all of the combinations and get each achievement, it whill have a clear lack of replay value, that is until the next game comes out and we see what will become of Hiveswap.", "timestamp_created": 1505466559, "timestamp_updated": 1505466559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34967320": {"recommendationid": "34967320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036655415", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508126157}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, but a lot of the cutscenes are broken and it doesn't support my native resolution.

The art in this game for example is so full of character you can't help but recognize the effort gone into it by the WP team. The same could be said for the character actions- it's very reminicent of its predesessor. The effort gone into the sylladex and the various combinations was enjoyable as were the little puzzles strewn about the game which were not too bad in terms of dicciculty.\n As for the downside to this game, the only real issue I had was with the cutscenes which were pretty common. The issue however did go away after so tinkering with the video settings, and even though thats not an ideal situation its understandable- having played it within hours of the release ... there's bound to be bugs somewhere. \nOverall I look forward to the next few acts in the making and of course Hauntswitch.

Pretty much all of the non-pop culture references will go right over your head, and there will be plenty of things you just straight up will not understand, such as what the hell Strife or a Sylladex is and why do these kids have such goofy or dangerous weapons, why do some of the characters talk in such a nonsensical way, who is their babysitter or father and why are they important. Many of these things are barely touched upon, if at all and will leave you with questions that won't get answered at least in this Act, but have already been long ago answered in the comic.\n\nAt the same time though, I have no way of experiencing this game with zero knowledge of Homestuck, so maybe not knowing these things is a lot better for you. And if you did get this game knowing nothing about Homestuck I HIGHLY recommend reading the comic assuming you enjoyed the game, because it's literally this game but focusing on different kids doing different things, is way longer, and you don't have direct control over where the character goes.

And it's...  Good?   Yep!  Hiveswap is pretty much a love-letter to 90s, adventure games, and homestuck.  What's homestuck?  That's not important!  While Hiveswap is based off of homestuck, I was actually surprised to see that they kept their word about homestuck knowledge being unecessary.  There's a ton of references thrown in, but they shouldn't look too out of place if you haven't read any.\n\nBut what about the gameplay?  The puzzles are decently challenging, but usually after finding the solution I think \"oh, that actually makes sense.\"  It's not the type of game where you'll have to try everything with everything to figure out some insane logic puzzle that makes no sense, and in fact the game usually hints pretty hard at what you need to do for most of the puzzles.   Speaking of trying everything with everything, you don't HAVE to, but you'll probably WANT to, since there's a unique line of dialogue for almost every single combination of items.  That being said, there are a few interactions that don't have any lines.  It didn't happen very often, but it would have been nice if there was a generic \"that's not how that's used\" just to fill in these gaps.\n\n(edit: there's apparently been an update that's supposed to fix some interactions not having lines, so that's pretty cool.  Also I forgot to mention, there's a hint button in the game, but it was completely unhelpful.  Maybe future acts will feature harder puzzles that require hints, but for now you should be able to deduce most problems by just reading the hints the text provides.)\n\nThe soundtrack is... weird.  It wasn't bad, but the whole thing has a fairly unique sound to it that's kind of hard to describe.  It's not the type of soundtrack I would purchase, but there were definitely some songs I did enjoy.  Also, the battle music kind of cut in really suddenly and poorly.  The transition was pretty bad.  Other than that though I didn't notice any issues with transitions between songs. \n\n(Edit:  I've relistened to a few of the songs and they definitely grow on you.  I still don't think the album is really worth purchasing at full price, but you may consider getting the game + soundtrack bundle.)\n\nI absolutely loved the art style.  It completely captured the feeling of homestuck and the 90s.  The houses are filled with all sorts of random trash and posters, and the majority of it is interactable.  The animation is also really good.  It's not super fluid at times, but even the lower quality cutscenes look very nice.\n\nThe writing is also surprisingly good.  They do a good job of introducing the alien concepts without just having a massive info dump, and the jokes were pretty on point as well.  There were a few grammar and spelling mistakes, but nothing too major.  I will say though the main character, Joey Claire, is a bit boring.  She does have a variety of interests, but other than that she acts pretty typically for a main character.  Luckily, the other characters have been a lot more interesting.  \n\nThe game, however, is pretty short.  It took me about 4 hours to get through it in one sitting.  How much time it takes the average person will probably vary a lot though, since you can waste a lot of time just interacting with random things.  Normally I would say hold off on purchasing a game this short, but for  8 dollars it really isn't too much of an investment.\n\nOveral, I really enjoyed my time playing hiveswap.

Its here. After 5 years of hype, HIVESWAP: Act 1 has finally been released. \n\nThe gameplay resembles a classic point and click adventure style of game, with beautifully drawn backgrounds, HEAPS of dialogue and world building, and wonderful music. In addition, there is SO much lore for those who have read homestuck. I would say the game fills in many aspects of daily troll culture and life that we knew little to nothing about before the game. \n\nIts cute, funny, enjoyable, and I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzle/point and click, even if they have not read through homestuck.\n\nHowever. Was it worth the 5 years of hype, a long and drawn out release, and 8$ for one of four acts? No.\n\nThe movement is point and click, and while usually not too intrusive, can be extremely annoying for just getting your character out of the way of what you need to click on. Should have been a WASD movement system. Its a core mechanic that feels very unpolished relative to the rest of the game. In addition, upon startup there are a few EXTREMELY glaring bugs, the foremost of which is if you change your resolution and dont restart the game, it WILL make the UI look super weird and terrible. Which is how I played the entirety of the game. \n\nWhich is not hard to do, as the game is not long. For something that had 5 years to be developed and raised over 2.1 MILLION dollars on kickstarter it is entirely underwhelming, especially with the 8 dollar price tag. Even though I took my time in exploring every interaction, I finished the game in exactly 2 hours. Not only that, but the game ends just when the story picks up, RIGHT as things get serious. Blueballs for sure. I mean, they didnt HAVE to leave it on a cliffhanger, and considering that this is act 1 of 4, seems like they could have condensed 2 acts into this one game and chosen a more resolved point in time. And what seems more ridiculous is that even though they left it on a cliffhanger, they couldnt bother to give us a date for the next installment. \n\nTo conclude, I loved it, 5 hats out of 5, 8 out of 8, 10 decapitated Dirks out of 10.\n\nPs.

This game is very fun and very detailed, if you loved reading homestuck then you'll love reading all of the quirky text in Hiveswap and there is A LOT of text to be found. every item in your sylladex (inventory) can interact with almost anything you see on screen and I enjoyed pretty much all of the dialouge. The characters are very loveable and fun, the art is fantastic, and the music, as expected, is beautiful. If you have an extra couple bucks I think you should get the soundtrack because the music is great. I can't stress how similar Hiveswap is to Homestuck, it is great for all Homestuck fans who are sad that Homestuck is over, because frankly, thanks to Hiveswap, it is not.

It takes maybe three hours to beat if you just sit down and get to it. But honestly, for the amount of enjoyment and the number of genuine laughs and moments of hype i got out of this game? Eight bucks it totally reasonable for three hours of playtime.\n\nPROS\n- Music is absolutely stunning. Toby Fox hit the nail on the goddamn head, but when hasn't he?\n- Absolute truck loads of references, if you look for them and have the knowledge to recognize them. And if you don't have any prior Homestuck experience, the references aren't going to feel forced or in-your-face!\n- No pixel hunting!!!! At all!!! Ever!!!!! Almost unheard of for a point-and-click adventure game!!\n- The artwork is beautiful, lending to very immersive backgrounds that pull you in and make you want to click on just? everything?\n- The cutscenes (what I could see of them, more below) were wonderfully rendered, and the animation in general is all around very very smooth and fluid. It's really gorgeous to watch in action, especially Joey's Tap-Dance Strife Specibus prototype.\n- Did I mention no pixel hunting? Because that was a really big one for me.\n- Movement speed in a point-and-click that's actually reasonable! No snail's pace from one end of the screen to the other! These are some kids who know how to make like a tree and abscond in a hurry.\n- World-building is on point, and almost subtle in some places. It's got a fantastic build up, giving you new information just as you've finished processing the old. It does leave you guessing/wondering here and there, but in a very intentional \"this will be built upon\" way, not \"we forgot to expand on this and hope you don't notice.\"\n- The characters are fucking AMAZING. Joey and Xefros have some really fantastic interactions, especially with the cultural differences back-and-forths. And the radio talk between Joey and Jude is some of my favorite writing to come out of a point-and-click game-- as an older sister with a younger brother, it was dialogue that felt very, very familiar. Jude and Dammek get left in the dust a bit, but will presumably be explored in HAUNTSWITCH. That said, even Jude had a couple of shining moments whenever he popped up.\n\nCONS\n- It wasn't always very clear what actions would progress the story and which ones wouldn't. Not necessarily a fault of the game, I suppose, but it's always disheartening when you're trying to clear out a room and suddenly get transported away, or put in a scenario that railroads you somewhere else.\n- Strifes were sometimes confusing? Strifing in general was VERY unclear in the first combat and just sort of tossed you into the deep end, and on one or two of the Strifes I had trouble figuring out what order the game wanted me to use abilities in. That very well might be user error however, so ymmv.\n- The musical transitions are a bit glitchy, especially if you stay in one room for a prolonged period of time. Usually they fixed themselves if you changed rooms, but not always.\n- Changing the screen resolution without restarting can Heck Things Up and icons will begin a gradual journey across the screen.\n- This might be unique to my poor, overtaxed laptop-- but I couldn't see a single cutscene through to the end. After about 2-3 seconds, it would freeze and then skip to the next game play bit. I tried changing screen resolution, windowed vs. not, closing background programs, and restarting my computer, all to no avail. If your personal gaming box of choice is relatively current, you're probably fine. But if it's on the older side and lower end of the game specs like mine-- be warned. You're probably gonna miss a substantial amount of plot.\n- It's so. SO. short. If you want a quick little world to sink your teeth into a blow a couple hours on, this might not be a bad thing. It sure wasn't for me! BUT. If you aren't necessarily a fan of the genre, want something a little more out of the game, or don't have a deep, multi-year emotionally investment in it, it's going to feel a little disappointing. Particularly since the end appears very abruptly.\n\nMy guys, I hecking love it. This game isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, and after years of waiting and all the Drama TM surrounding its Kickstarter, it might feel like a let down. But if you just let the game Exist and go for the ride, it's a fucking good ride. The developers called it a love letter to 90's adventure games, and playing it feels like drinking a steaming hot cup of Nostalgia delicately cloaked in gross monsters, conspiracy theories, absentee fathers, and weird bug aliens.

It's all very well made and always fun to listen too.\n\nFinally, the characters are believable. This is a common theme in this and Homestuck, but the writers do such an amazing job at creating realistic, believable, fun characters that you just want to hug.\n\nCons:\nThe length. I understand this is a part 1, but the amount of time this game has been in development compared to what was recieved doesn't seem right.\n\nThe bugs. There was a few bugs I personally ecountered that stopped me from progressing for a while; An example was I had to open a larhe cabinent and grab the item inside, only to see that once it was open the game REFUSED to let me pick the item up, leaving me stranded until I saved and reset. Nothing big, but it was troublesome.\n\nAs a minor nitpick, I had a bit of trouble at times navigating, but it was only a minor annoyance. \n\nOverall:\nIt's funny, it's great, you'll love it, even if you haven't read Homestuck.

He is best known for his role on the sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, for which he received an Emmy Award, and as the voice of Manny in the Ice Age film series. He created and starred in the TNT comedy-drama Men of a Certain Age (2009\u201311). From 2012 to 2015, Romano had a recurring role as Hank Rizzoli, a love interest of Sarah Braverman in Parenthood.\n\nPersonal life and family\nRomano was born in Queens, New York, the son of Lucie (Fortini), a piano teacher, and Albert Romano (November 7, 1925 \u2013 March 11, 2010), a real estate agent and engineer.[2][3] He is of seven-eighths Italian, and one-eighth French descent, and grew up in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens.[4] He has an older brother, Richard (born in 1956), a sergeant with the NYPD, and a younger brother, Robert, a second grade teacher in New York City.[5] Romano married his wife, Anna Scarpulla, in 1987. They met while working at a bank together.[6] They have four children.\n\nRomano's character's daughter on Everybody Loves Raymond was named after his real-life daughter. Also, in the series pilot, Ray and Debra's twin boys were named Gregory and Matthew, after Romano's real-life twin sons, but Romano felt it was inconvenient to have all his TV children have the same names as his real children, and changed the twins' names to Geoffrey and Michael on screen. He also said his brother was not pleased with Ray Barone's TV brother.[7]\n\nRomano's family has made various appearances in the show. Romano's real-life daughter Alexandra \"Ally\" Romano made several appearances on Everybody Loves Raymond as Molly, the best friend of his on-screen daughter, Ally, and the daughter of Ray Barone's nemesis, Peggy the Cookie Lady. Romano's father, Albert Romano, has made various appearances as Albert, one of Frank Barone's lodge buddies in various episodes such as \"Debra at the Lodge\", and \"Boys' Therapy\". Romano's brother, Richard Romano, appeared in the episodes \"Golf For It\", \"Just a Formality\" and \"The Toaster\". Romano's wife Anna appeared as one of the moms in the background at Geoffrey and Michael's school in season 6's episode titled \"The Angry Family.\"\n\nIn February 2012, Romano revealed that his wife Anna had successfully battled stage one breast cancer in 2010. Romano told People magazine that \"the reason we're going public is to share our experience, yeah, but to have an effect. Our goal is to help people.\"[8]\n\nCareer\nRomano attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring from Archbishop Molloy High School, Romano graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1975.[9] He was in the same high school class as Fran Drescher. Before getting into show business, Romano briefly attended Queens College, in Flushing, New York, where he studied accounting.[6]\n\nHis early comedy career started when he competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989 directed by Saturday Night Live short film producer Neal Marshad and appeared on The Comedy Channel. His career included many outlets, such as Comedy Central, where he had been a recurring guest voice on the show Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist. He also was a contestant on Star Search in the stand-up comedy category. He originally was cast to play Joe (originally named Rick) on the American television sitcom NewsRadio, but was fired and replaced by Joe Rogan. He then appeared on Late Show with David Letterman doing his stand up routine which formed his ties with CBS. Shortly thereafter, he became the star of his own show, Everybody Loves Raymond on CBS, that featured a cast and format more suitable to Romano's brand of humor. His work on the series earned him six Emmy nominations, winning in 2002, as well as five Screen Actors Guild Award nominations and two Golden Globe Award nominations.\n\nRomano and his comedian best friend Kevin James starred in the salesman comedy Grilled as two Average Joes of the same profession who are both desperate to land a big sale.\n\nRomano was featured on a 2000 episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, on which he won US$125,000 for the NYPD's D.A.R.E. Unit.\n\nIn 2001, Romano was named one of E!'s top twenty entertainers of the year. That same year he was featured with his brother (a teacher at a school in Long Island) on a New York Police Department recruiting poster.\n\nIn 2004, he became the highest-paid television actor in history for his role of Raymond on CBS's Everybody Loves Raymond. It was later revealed on E! that he had broken another record by his show having the highest revenue at US$3.9 billion.\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Romano was featured as a special guest star, sending a birthday card to Bob Barker in his eightieth-birthday bash on the twenty-seventh \"Million Dollar Spectacular\" special of the long-running daytime CBS series The Price Is Right.\n\nRomano was the subject of the documentary film 95 Miles to Go. The film documents Romano's road-trip for a series of rides across the south of the United States. The film was released in theaters on April 7, 2010, by ThinkFilm.[10] In August 2006 Romano was interviewed in front of a live audience at UCLA by fellow stand-up veteran David Steinberg, for an episode of Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg. The program first aired on the TV Land network in March 2007.\n\nRomano returned to television with a new dramedy for TNT in 2008, Men of a Certain Age, which he co-created with former Everybody Loves Raymond writer, Mike Royce. It co-starred Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.\n\nRomano made an appearance in the seventh season of NBC show The Office as Merv Bronte, a nervous job applicant interviewing for the job left vacant by Michael Scott.\n\nRomano made an appearance in the third-season premiere of ABC sitcom The Middle as Nicky, a friend of Mike, who ruined his and Frankie's honeymoon. Romano was the second actor from Everybody Loves Raymond to be reunited with Patricia Heaton on The Middle. Doris Roberts guest-starred in three episodes.\n\nHe joined the cast of Parenthood beginning September 11, 2012.[11][12] He became a semi-regular, playing photographer Hank Rizzoli, who hired and later had a romantic relationship with Sarah Braverman and developed a friendship with her nephew who has Asperger syndrome. The role was specifically created for him after he expressed his love for the show and met with creator Jason Katims on the set of Friday Night Lights.[13]\n\nIn 2002, Romano voiced the wooly mammoth Manfred (Manny) in the film Ice Age, followed by Ice Age: The Meltdown in 2006, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in 2009, Ice Age: Continental Drift in 2012, and Ice Age: Collision Course in 2016.\n\nCompetitions\n\nRomano at the 2010 World Series of Poker main event\nRomano competed in the World Series of Poker in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015.\n\nIn early 2010, Romano starred in the second season of The Golf Channel's original series The Haney Project in which Tiger Woods' former coach Hank Haney attempts to improve the golf games of different celebrities and athletes. Romano's goal was to finish the show being able to break 80.[14] Romano took time off from the show to be with his father, Albert Romano, who died in March 2010. Romano is also a regular competitor in the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where he finished fifth in 2012 with his partner, Australian professional Steven Bowditch.

If you entertain even a vague notion of this game functioning at all, you must start the game, then go into the settings and fix the resolution, and then *quit out of it entirely and restart it*. Otherwise you risk getting a white screen at the first Strife and having to restart the game from the very beginning.\n\nI'm seeing other reviews suggesting the difficulty should be harder. Look, I *loved* Loom, but we really should never, *ever* go back to the LucasArts adventure game days. The world has changed, and while the art in Loom was *Art*, the gameplay was crazy-making, and we've come to expect a higher standard of gameplay now. Besides, if you were to only read the game's description, you'd see that the game is \"adventure-lite\" in the same way that \"rogue-lite\" is less punishing than your typical roguelike. So please, go into this knowing that it's casual gaming, and that's a Good Thing.\n\nSo, with that out of the way...\n\nPros:\n[list]\n  [*] Feels like one big interactive page ripped from SBURB. Were you, like me, hoping for that? Well that's exactly what this is. Spend some time to appreciate the posters, the pogo ball, the absurd fetishism of Betty Crocker. It's all here.\n  [*] Lite difficulty makes this kind of like an adventure-game-themed kinetic novel\n  [*] On-point humor befitting the SBURB lineage.\n  [*] Every thing can be tried on every other thing. Every error message is unique.\n  [*] Many of the chat interactions have scroll bars so you can actually go back and read something you've missed by mashing continue too many times.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n  [*] The aforementioned resolution problem. Game stability generally feels bad because of it.\n  [*] In spite of claiming no alien-logic puzzles, some of the solutions are rather strange, such as having to use an item on a door when the result doesn't ever involve either of these things touching.\n  [*] The amount of content is very, extremely, surprisingly small. My playthrough was casual, and involved a total restart from the beginning because of the resolution bug, and yet my playtime is 2.5 hours. There are no choices I could go back and play through differently. I'm never opening this game again. That's all the entertainment it holds for me.\n[/list]\n\nThis game puts me in a tough spot. I don't want to return it. I experienced - and enjoyed - as much as this game has to offer. But overall, if I were to compare this to another good \"experience\" game like The Stanley Parable or The Turing Test, the value proposition for this is much lower. If you see all four chapters of this come out in a bundle for $15, buy it. Each one individually for $8?

But even if you're not a fan, it's still a pretty good adventure game. The only major thing hampering it, at least on release, is the amount of bugs. Most of them are visual bugs with the environments and UI. It can break the immersion just a bit. They will most likely get fixed. It happens, usually, when you first switch to fullscreen and to a higher resolution. It goes away upon restarting the game.\n\nNothing else seems to be wrong, technically speaking. Vertical Sync is available with good Resolution Options, Volume Levels, and Windowed Mode. When loading, the game suffers some framerate issues, but that literally means nothing since there isn't a thing on screen during this process. Moving around does feel clunky, especially on stairs in cramped spaces.\n\nOther than that, there's very little wrong with this game. It's almost \"perfect\", despite it having this sort of \"cheap\" feel to it... but it's so minor, that it barely affects the game at all.\n\nThis game is a crap load of fun, with plenty of laughs to be had. The 90s pop culture references are off the charts, and the nostalgic feel is wonderful to the point of being palpable. Sadly, this wonder only lasts about 5 hours. It ends too quickly. The price justifies the length at least. There's some replayability, especially since you're practically encouraged to try every item and weapon with everything. I actually didn't think of trying every item with everything. I was just using the weapons with everything, and even then I eventually stopped doing that. So there's probablly quite a few things I'm missing, which is evident by me having 57% of the achievements after beating the game.\n\nWhat makes this game so great is the text, which is amazingly written and hilarious, and the sheer amount of things in each environment that make them feel \"real\". Trying out stuff on everything will give you this text, making each action you do rewarding just for the downright fun writing to read. Don't even get me started on the story, it's very good and keeps you playing all throughout. Andrew Hussie has crafted yet another fantastic story of youth and the celebration of the people, hobbies, dreams, or things we care about.

I found myself getting bored of clicking on literally everything, but I imagine that's just my impatience with the format.\nThere were a few typos that seemed to have made it into the final dialogue, only one managed to confuse me a little bit because I guess an entire word got cut and it was kind of key in that context. Otherwise just a couple letters off, but I got the point.\nI only got stuck at one point, and that's probably just because I assumed a couple objects were connected but they had different dialogues associated with them. From my perspective, it was overall an enjoyable experience. It does look like this is going to be episodic, like a Telltale game. I finished Act 1 and I assume I have to wait for Act 2 to come out.\nFollowed homestuck for its last few years, so that's nothing new.\nI can't say for sure how this would appeal to newcomers who never checked out any MSPA comics.

Obviously I would rather have one full game released instead of installments- but I've already waited five years for this piece of shit so I'll take what I can get. Not much in way of gameplay, it's pretty much a linear narrative- I'm okay with that though, it's just like more comic. The score fuckin knocked it out of the park though, I expected no less of toby and james.

Finished my first playthough in thee and a half hours, but I was kinda rushing through it in one sitting to avoid spaoilers. \n\nThe animation is great, but it does take a couple of seconds to load between scene switches and also when going into strifes. Speaking of the combat, I enjoyed the puzzle based fighting system, but it did feel like they dumped all the combat into one small section of the game. I kept expecting more in the second half, only to be dissapointed. But I guess this is first and formost a point and click game, not an Undertale style action adventure, so combat is not the games main focus.\n\nThe writing is good and the dialog is funny. They managed to give the kids their own personalities, rarther than being Jade and John 2.0. There were enough Homestuck refrences to keep fans happy but they shouldn't distract too much for people who haven't read the comic.\n\nSo yeah, a nice 3-4 hour campaign with probably another 2-3 hours of exploring of you want to unlock all the things. All of them. Some people might say that's not worth the asking price, but if you also pick up the soundtrack (which you should, it's amazing) I think it's a fairly good bargin.

Maybe when the story comes to completion?\n\nSo anyways, I've been waiting for this for around a year myself and I can say that its definitely worth my personal wait. For those of you who have been hyping over this as Homestuck fans, its finally here! The story just rings with Hussie's writing, comedy, and none of his seriousness that turns out to be actual sincerity. I laughed, I teared up a bit over the poor troll boy's life, and I got interested and involved to the point for where I'm itching for Act 2. \n\nIf you're one of the many who have been waiting for this game for a long while:\nEach action and inspection you make adds just a bit more story and personality to the characters and their lives. The game has beautiful art and music, just as I would expect from some of the names I saw in the credits. If you've read Homestuck, you'd be familiar with quite a few of the callbacks and references involved in the game. Although I'm a little disappointed in the fact that what we've been waiting for doesn't involve our kids from Homestuck, the kids here in Hiveswap have their own story and voice to be told and heard, and I've already fallen in love with what we're seeing.\n\nIf you're just now hearing about all this Hiveswap and Homestuck stuff:\nWelcome to the product of 5 years of hype and strife!\n\nHiveswap: Act 1 has given a very strong foundation with its small amount of content (took me nearly 3 hours to complete, and I went about checking everything I could) for the rest of the franchise soon to come, and I'm hopeful for its future. \n+ The Artstyle fits perfectly with what we know in the traditional Homestuck world\n+ The Music fits scenes very well, giving character's their own themes.\n+ The Story was easy to get into, and enjoyable the entire while. I never felt like I was reading on some unimportant piece of lore.\n\n- There were quite a few grammar mistakes in the dialogues. I don't mean like sentence structure, I mean there were parts where instead of \"it's\" it said \" 's.\" Not too much of a problem, but should be noted.\n- If you're one of the ones who have been waiting for as many years as most of us have, 3 hours doesn't exactly fulfill much on that.

Also I don't know the other musician well enough to compare it to their other stuff, but it was all extremely good.

I've read all of Homestuck, but it seems to me that this can be played without Homestuck knowledge; the only Homestuck characters appear in portraits on a wall.   The art is often breathtaking, the music is pleasant and cheerful, and the animation is delightful.   The principal character, Joey, is funny and angry and has a great interior voice; I rushed through the last part of the game because I wanted to get her to safety.\n\nEvery single object in the game has a pre-written relationship with every other; if you use any A on any B you will always get a response, most of which are funny.  You'll never get \"I see no [item] here\" or \"You cannot use [item] on [item].\"\n\nA lot of people are having problems with glitchy cutscenes.  I'm on a Mac running OS Sierra and haven't had any problems.  If you are on a different platform, you may want to save frequently in case of a crash.

Fun to play, fun characters, just a few problems that kept me from loving it. A constant glaring problem being that there were constant spelling errors throughout the game.

Also during that scene there was black space on the right side of my screen, empty space but the curtains were still visible. Not really too big of a problem but after all this time, the game was surprisingly super short.

The only times I was confused were because the cursor could use a directional indicator to be clear on where the player is clicking to move in the environment.\n\nThe only complaints I have are the length, because it was easily finished in 3 hours and could possibly have a long wait for the next acts (which is just speculation on my part for now). It\u2019s also worth noting that the devs, at this time, are patching a few graphical glitches, however I encountered very few problems with this and it was solved by playing in windowed mode. \n\nHowever long that wait for the next part is, I think this game is well worth your time and money. It\u2019s a delight, and if you have any interest in the quirky humor of the MSPAdevntures, you\u2019ll love this one. \n", "timestamp_created": 1505436437, "timestamp_updated": 1505436437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34960902": {"recommendationid": "34960902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299883508", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505434002}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is ****ing amazing, love it completely, though I had to reset when I forgot to save and went into the first strife, I kinda messed something up.

The art and soundtrack are fantastic, and I found the scattered bits of lore interesting and worthwhile. The writing and dialogue were inoffensive and generally pleasant. There were, however, several issues I took with the game and think are important for the potential consumer to be aware of:\n\n1) Volume inconsistency\u2014the second track on the soundtrack is nearly twice as loud as the first, and this isn't an isolated example. Some sound effects were terribly quiet, while others made me temporarily mute my computer volume.\n2) Length\u2014the game is wayyyyy too short; while I understand that this is only the first episode, it felt more like a demo than an actual game. It took me about as much time to play through as it took me to play the Undertale demo when it came out, and here I was trying nearly every combination of items and interactables I thought to try.\n3) Combat\u2014the strife system was poorly paced and made no sense. I found myself really struggling to understand what I was supposed to do half the time. I think the game would have been better had the strife not been included at all.\n4) Puzzles\u2014The puzzles had quite a bit of handholding, and the next objective was often spelled out very explicitly. Where this wasn't the case, there wasn't any satisfaction in figuring out what to do next because the solution was a little bit contrived, and not in a clever way.

Since the opening and closing cutscenes are actually fully animated.\nTwo puzzles are just snake, which was weird.\nSHORT.

It feels like it lacks some polish, but it worked and I didn't run into any issues which is more than you can say for many games these days. The resolution felt a bit weird. I'm not sure why they made the screen so wide or fixed the aspect ratio but whatever, that's nitpicking.\n\nThe way the game starts throws you directly into the action, which is nice, but the way they presented it is a bit jarring. Apart from that, it's nice. The puzzles are neat, although I wish they'd made some things a bit more obvious, like explaining properly what your weapons do when you get them. I had to figure it out for myself and it was a bit frustrating. When I got the hang of the system, though, it was pretty cool.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the battles. They're not much more than puzzles, and the way you go about solving them just doesn't seem to fit the idea of \"I'm locked in combat with a deadly monster\". There weren't too many of them though, so while they felt kind of weird to play I didn't get hung up on it for too long.\n\nGenerally, the story was good. I could immerse myself into what's going on. My only complaint is Jude's dialogue. As a character, he's annoyingly obtuse about telling you what to do and they made the choice of putting it in all-caps too. Not the biggest fan. The later conversations between Xefros and Joey are much easier to read and more pleasant in general. Another thing to note is that so far things seem increbibly linear. The game isn't choice-based.\n\nThis episode was short. I think a little too short. That said, the story did cut off at a good point; it didn't feel like it ended abruptly. Would I say it's worth it for the price? Honestly, not really. $7.99 is a bit steep for something that only took 2-3 hours to play through. But we'll see whether future acts deliver on being more worthwhile.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIf you're a homestuck fan, it's nice. If you think you can happily enjoy 2-3 hours of homestuck stuff as an actual game, rather than a webcomic about a game, for the price it's being sold at, go ahead and buy it. It's not bad, and I certainly don't regret getting the game. Just keep in mind its strengths and flaws.\n\nIf you're not a homestuck fan, I'm not sure it's worth getting, especially at the current price. It has in-jokes and familiar terminology and mechanics that would be lost on anyone not at least slightly familiar with the homestuck universe. It's clearly geared to those already familiar with the source material. If you're interested anyway, try reading Homestuck first.

The characters, the writing and humour, the references, the art and sweet jegus the music. \n\nI do have one complaint though, and that's with the cutscenes. Now, i don't know if it's just my laptop or the game iteself, but from what I've seen from other people's reviews I'm not the only one with this problem. The cutscenes don't work most of the time, they would start and freexe after only a few seconds. Then it would stay frozen until the cutscene is \"finished\" and go back to reglar gameplay. This does take quite a bit away from the experience of playing and the main reason why I haven't finished Act 1 yet.\n\nThough if you can ignore the cutscenes not working for now and you have a yourself a great first act of Hiveswap.

After so long, I was very much worried there were still going to be a lot of bugs and I wasn't going to enjoy the game as much.\n\nThen I reinstalled the game. The resolution was a misshap of the download it seems because it got fixed immediately. That one loading time still seemed wonky, but the Skybox was back in its rightful place- As long as you didn't check it IMMEDIATELY after switching rooms. Outside of that room however? When I got out of the very first room, things transitioned smoothly. The animation is gorgeous, the references are lovely, the additions to the lore are deeply intriguing. Every piece of dialog has been interesting so far, either in its quirkiness, how it adds onto the lore (Which so far has even been a tad depressing), or how it gives clues to how to proceed. The puzzles aren't too obscure either, and the Combat Sequences are more akin to timed puzzles than actual battles, which are a nice break from the slower paced rest of the game.\n\nI've only just begun this adventure, but I am already enthralled, and the very, very few bugs I found didn't come back once I went out of the very first room.\n\nThis is the Game I've been waiting for 5 years.\n\nThe wait has been incredibly worth it.\n\nThank you. <3", "timestamp_created": 1505432502, "timestamp_updated": 1505432502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959959": {"recommendationid": "34959959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066328897", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505435740}, "language": "english", "review": "while im not personally a fan of point and click adventure games, hiveswap is indeed pretty fun and as a homestuck fan i just need to know more,so all im saying is,the game is good,hope act II releases soon and if you have read homestuck it's pretty much a must buy,tho no alchemizing,time shenanigans or pchoooo as of act 1,act 2 better have one of the three", "timestamp_created": 1505432431, "timestamp_updated": 1505432431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959951": {"recommendationid": "34959951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133383577", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506735899}, "language": "english", "review": "Well...

I backed this game on Kickstarter five years ago, back in the height of the Homestuck craze.  So much has happened since then, both in the webcomic and with my life, but playing Hiveswap reminded me of the magic of that time, sitting on my new college friend's dormroom floor at 3AM devouring surprise updates.  If you're like me, an old Homestuck fan, I think you'd be pretty safe in picking this up and enjoying it.\n\nThe overall writing quality is fantastic. Though Hussie did not write this himself, his trademark slightly dry, tongue-in-cheek narrative voice is wonderfully prominent in the object descriptions and interactions.  There also is unique text for many, many, many strange combinations of objects, as you would hope in a point and click adventure. However, I feel that the character dialogue was a little different stylistically than I was expecting.  It wasn't bad per se, just not quite as \"Homestuck\" as the rest of the writing. This is especially noticable in the later parts of the game, where two characters are interacting much more frequently.\n\nThough it was quite short, I believe that Hiveswap stayed for about as long as it needed to for this Act. I finished it in my 2.5 hours of playtime and I did quite a lot of random clicking and combining, though I do read much faster than the average person.  What Pumpkin kept the zones pretty small, which kept the time spent getting stuck to a relative minimum.  I am admittedly a point-and-click philistine, but this more confined space allowed me to finish without feeling frustrated, or looking up a solution, which has happened other times I've tried to play games in this genre.\n\nOther users have reported some debilitating bugs and graphical glitches.  In my playtime, I had no crashes or game breaking bugs, though there were a few minor UI blips.  Hopefully these issues get patched soon, but it isn't 100% broken.\n\nIf you're a Homestuck fan, I don't really see any reason not to pick this up.  If you're not a Homestuck fan, it's still a solidly written, beautifully drawn short adventure.  As long as you're not expecting some gigantic Joycean epic, it'll definitely be an enjoyable afternoon of attempting to tapdance at every clickable object in vicinity.", "timestamp_created": 1505432019, "timestamp_updated": 1505432019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959854": {"recommendationid": "34959854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312841752", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507160801}, "language": "english", "review": "Really awesome, well worth the money!

And after 5 years of delays, hiatuses, and a mess of a fandom constantly reeling at the idea of a video game being *somewhere*, I can honestly say that not only was this worth the wait, but I'm already excited for Act 2.\n\nA word of caution that's been thrown around for quite a while about this game: If you haven't read Homestuck, it's *very* recommended that you do so beforehand. It's not necessarily required, but it definitely will help you quite a bit in terms of understanding the backstory to this game. Plus, it shines a lot of light onto the universe you're diving into here.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is certainly a 90's-style point-and-click in every sense of the term. There are the occasional puzzles here and there, but you're not going to be constanly fretting over them like say, Myst or Secrets of Monkey Island. They're quite simple, and don't take too much thought. Your inventory will have at most 10 items, and only 5 or 6 things can be combined to solve the puzzles. Still, that doesn't discount the game in my eyes.\n\nIf you're playing this, you're doing it for the experience. The game itself looks stunning, with the beautiful background sets, incredible sound work by James Roach and Toby Fox (Yeah, *that* Toby Fox), and the occasional interlude of animation, very much styled in the form of Homestuck's flash panels.\n\nIf you're taking your time and reading all the flavortext, checking out everything in your environment and taking the experience in, this game will last you around 3-4 hours per playthrough, and on my first playthrough I only got about half the achievements, so there's room for replayability.\n\nIt's hard to say if I'd recommend this for someone who hasn't read Homestuck, just because you'll be diving into an integral part of the story's universe in this game, but if the game does interest you, I'd say the source material is worth the read. It'll take you a little while, but the art and music that spawned from the webcomic should definitely get you excited to delve into this adventure.\n\nAt this point, all I can do is wait excitedly for the next entry, which hopefully comes sooner than later.", "timestamp_created": 1505430075, "timestamp_updated": 1505430075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959436": {"recommendationid": "34959436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132096092", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506284440}, "language": "english", "review": "after waiting for this game for years, i can firmly say that it was worth the wait, the music is fabulous and the art style is super fun and loveable, a couple of jokes will go over your head if you haven't read homestuck, which i personally am near the end of, but other than that this game is funny and fun and lovable and like now one of my personal favorites and i cannot wait until ACT 2\n\n\nalso a couple of things\nthe game is a bit glitchy with the UI but it might just be me, also the game came out today and im assuming it'll get fixed very soon", "timestamp_created": 1505430051, "timestamp_updated": 1505430051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959421": {"recommendationid": "34959421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019973355", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505429913}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome! great sense of humor and lots of fun. a bit short tho. cant wait for the rest of it!", "timestamp_created": 1505430004, "timestamp_updated": 1505430004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959386": {"recommendationid": "34959386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199356073", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505969105}, "language": "english", "review": "5 years", "timestamp_created": 1505429825, "timestamp_updated": 1505429825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713079", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959384": {"recommendationid": "34959384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112496074", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505430522}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and fun art style, not very far fro the beautiful concept art. wish the hint system was a little more helpful and I expect the battles to be actually like HP and stuff like that but still interesting, waiting for more parts to release, it might feel more complete then.", "timestamp_created": 1505429822, "timestamp_updated": 1505429822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959381": {"recommendationid": "34959381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419314656", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511293082}, "language": "english", "review": "Though I beat it today it is really fun!

Sometimes the cursor is very buggy with recognizing things, the screen keeps oddly shifting and gets visual glitches (Such as slivers of last scene showing on the border etc), screenshots come out awfully cropped in windowed mode, there isn't a borderless window mode, there are save corrupting crashes.. \n\nIf we assume the episode length to be constant, the sequel to be same legth as this and the price to stay constant..\nThen they plan to milk us for 32$/12h twice.. at 64$ for 24 hours of gameplay it sounds like AWFUL proposition. Sure lets hope the episodes get longer but... don't hold your breath. \n\nI'm sad because the art of the game is gorgeous. The writing is fantastic. But the game play, the game engineering are mediocre at best. The value proposition is awful. I wish all the best to What Pumpkin but as this game stands (and the future prospects it holds) it is hard sell to anyone who wasn't already planning to buy it regardless of the price and delays anyhow.", "timestamp_created": 1505428712, "timestamp_updated": 1505428712, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660191", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34959128": {"recommendationid": "34959128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018712490", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505606405}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never actually played Homestuck so my exposure to this game is pretty much isolated from the larger franchise.

This will however be fixed when the other acts come out.\n\nThe other thing I have to mention is minor bugs and glitches, these will of course soon be fixed and didn't affect my gameplay. As long as you change to the right resolution for your screen you should be fine\n\n[PROS]\n\nI think you should buy this game, as a homestucker the game is LOADED with homestuck references, everything from a Signless plushie to \"PLAY HAUNTING MELODY\" two character from homestuck actually (somewhat) being in the game. You can easily miss or not understand the references but they had me smiling throught the entire game (now my cheeks are tired Dx)\n\nAs a non-homestucker this game is a beautiful cartoony puzzle-game with unique characters, abilities, quirks and beautiful cut-scenes. The game is a prefect game for someone who wants to get motivated to start getting into the homestuck fandom, but also for the indie/puzzle/casual gamer, as the game is set BEFORE (most) of Homestuck. The game has nostalgia for the 90-s kids with old-school games and whims that makes your nostalgia-senses tingle. \n\nHiveswap can be played in 2 different ways, the fast way, you don't click or look at most of the things currently in the game OR you can spend up to 4 hours clicking and interacting wth every single item you can find. When I get more time I WILL for sure go back and make sure I have looked at everything (even though I think I almost got it all)\n\nThe game is beautiful and really cool especially since it was made by only a few developers, writers and artists! I will for sure keep my eyes glued to when the next act comes out, and I hope you do too.The game has weird and hidden achievements, lots of humor and hidden interactions that you can play around with.\n\nAs I said before the game is not very long and is kind of cheap, so I you want to search through a gold-mine of fun for a few hours and play around with it I certainly won't stop you. As for the later acts you will probably have to wait for a while to get the chance to play them, but as far as I know Hussie will probably have something up his sleeve to keep us entertained in the meanwhile!\n\nIf you have 2-3 hours and a little money in your steam wallet I think this game is a must have.\n*finger-guns' away into the abyss but trips over a log and get's run over by a steamroller*", "timestamp_created": 1505427371, "timestamp_updated": 1505427874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958809": {"recommendationid": "34958809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374910815", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505426584}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1505427274, "timestamp_updated": 1505428464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958800": {"recommendationid": "34958800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255978741", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505603320}, "language": "english", "review": "((you cant fight the homestuck playing in the distance))", "timestamp_created": 1505427231, "timestamp_updated": 1505427231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958789": {"recommendationid": "34958789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039866639", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505426767}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished my first run of this chapter.

Every tiny thing was filled with details and Hussie's signature humor style. The music is fantastic and the characters are really well made. You can tell how they feel about things by their words and surrounding. The story has a lot of potential and I can't wait to see more. The puzzles are fun. And for 8$, it\u2019s a fantastic game.\n\nDOWNSIDES: With a 4 hour game time if you just do the essentials, it may leave you unsatisfied. You really have to take your time and not rush the story. Enjoy the small things. If you breeze through, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of fun.\n\nCONCLUSION: All and all, a great game, really delivered with the content it had, which wasn't much unfortunately. I'd recommend waiting until all the games are out, then buy and play through them all to get the most out of it. If you don\u2019t want to wait, be sure to take your time and enjoy the world.\n\nGreat job Hussie, can't wait for more!\n\n~Eric Witney\n", "timestamp_created": 1505426923, "timestamp_updated": 1505426923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958709": {"recommendationid": "34958709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011887368", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505538956}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm glad this came out, finally.

However, I feel like this might have harmed the game's length, check below for what I mean.\n- Vast breadth and depth of references that are subtle enough to not be cringey (and in fact would go over most players' heads, there were even humanimals references), but recognizable enough to still make you smirk.\n- Good worldbuilding and setup, I can see future acts having a really good plot.\n- Very, very good characters. I wish Jude could have been fleshed out more, but I guess that's for Hauntswitch so I can't complain!\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- Music transitions are buggy, especially around strifes. Volume is also extremely inconsistent across rooms, even compared to sound effects. Seems more of a programming issue than anything related to sound design, however.\n- Weird \"hitboxes\" for items, and a few \"conflicts\" between movement and interaction. Particularly, having to use an item on a door was unexpected, considering the icon didn't change from the regular movement icon when you hovered over it with the item, and the fact using items on transitions was unprecedented.\n- ANY button skips stuff, even the screenshot button. A nitpick, but an annoying one.\n- Relatively short, took me three hours while taking my time. I would have vastly preferred a bigger amount of interactions between the characters over item combination/interaction text, which I enjoyed, but wouldn't deliberately seek out. That said, this is no big deal: I have to remember it's only Act 1.\n- It's just too easy. I got stuck one time, and that was with the door incident I mentioned above. I definitely don't want an obscurely frustrating experience like with some old adventure games, but I feel like the only times the game made you use your head were ruined by the fact you got unasked hints for them right afterwards. Maybe make the hints optional in future acts?\n\n\nConclusion: [b]8.5/10[/b]. A very fun adventure game, and a great Homestuck experience (if you're into that), but a bit too easy and too short to be perfect. I hope future acts make you think a bit more often. \nI can recommend it to everyone who enjoys adventure games, and it's definitely a must-play for Homestuck fans.", "timestamp_created": 1505426403, "timestamp_updated": 1505426782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 116, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876077", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958587": {"recommendationid": "34958587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057846492", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512191789}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOMESTUCK TO ENJOY THE GAME![/b]...aham...just to be clear.\n[code][h1]HIVESWAP[/h1][/code]\nOpening case: Hiveswap always got me intrigued, as the game's development was turbulent and the fact that I love Hussie's work, I've been heart broken once by Mighty N.9 and didn't want to go through the pain again, either way I spent all day on my computer refreshing the page so I could help people on the same page as I was.\n[code][h1]ACT 1: Presentation to new audience[/h1][/code]\nThe First act released a few hours ago and I'm pretty happy with it, every room is packed to the brim with objects to interact and different ways to do so, point-and-clicks are alredy hard to come across, ones with different dialog on each object depending on how you interact with it is really something to praise, I spent 3 hours on the first act and half of that was only interacting with the background to read the neatly written dialog.\nMusic is fine, didn't have time to become repetitive, it's nothing to buy the soundtrack for yet, if they continue making songs for the next episodes I can see why one would buy the soundtrack edition, I didn't tough.\nNo puzzle was really hard to figure out but I don't think they are suposed to for now as the first act seems like a tutorial, that said they are really well integrated to the plot, there is also a minigame and I hope more are added, it's a nice contrast to the gameplay.\nThis first episode was a little slow but I think it was needed to present the world to players, I'm overall happy with it, it ended on a high note and I'm with good expectations for the next episode!\n\n\nI'll be reviewing the next acts as they come out, as of this review I came across two bugs, one which crashed my game and made me waste around 10 minutes, it's far from a mess but they are there, save often!", "timestamp_created": 1505426402, "timestamp_updated": 1505426671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501850", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958570": {"recommendationid": "34958570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116694730", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1515719557}, "language": "english", "review": "whats better than the game is if you look down the positive review column you'll find review after review whose poster has only posted one review (this one) and whose profile pictures are homestuck related.", "timestamp_created": 1505426353, "timestamp_updated": 1505944193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958514": {"recommendationid": "34958514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063427726", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505605858}, "language": "english", "review": "They weren't joking when you could combine literally every item and object together with unique commentary.

Everything is 30 fps, which makes anything moving look as if they're constantly lagging. Also, moving around with only the mouse is fine, but going up and down stairs is a hassle without keyboard function. \nThe game has a slow begining which it didn't start to really pick up till [spoiler] you are transported onto Alternia [/spoiler] but after that the game ends within 30 minuets of actual game. Which this honestly really pisses me off, because I spent 8 dollars expecting at the very least 4-5 hours of game play, but most of the actual game play was an hour at most... The entire game is mostly filler dialogue while clicking things.\nI personally spent about an hour searching for the attic key because I was impaintent and couldn't figure out what I needed to do. But it was mostly because I skimmed the dialogue I needed to actually pay attention to. Which makes this even worse time wise because this was basically a 2 hour game for myself if I don't include the hour of pure anger searching. \n\nA lot of issues with achievements as well, after giving up on finding the key I saved and quit and upon playing the game, any achievements I was suppose to earn I didn't recieve. I finished this act completly with only the begining 4 achievements. I looked up the list of them, it appears I should have earned up to 5 more just by progression..  Which mostly what gave this away was when [spoiler] you change to jude and I didn't get the achievement for just being him [/spoiler]\n\nI will most likely add more to this review, I  have high hopes for this game and since there are 3 more acts I will hope that Andrew will listen and try fixing a few issues... I mostly would like to see the graphics changed. \n\nBut honestly, I was really hoping to play this longer than it lasted.. There is nothing more I can really do with it now, Hiveswap Act 1 will just sit in my library because I have gotten all the game play available out of it, and I just find that very disapointing.", "timestamp_created": 1505423901, "timestamp_updated": 1505602376, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34957972": {"recommendationid": "34957972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256654073", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514273112}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly?

Hay obvias referencias en el juego sobre el webcomic que me han hecho ilusi\u00f3n. Sin embargo, si no has le\u00eddo Homestuck o no tienes ni idea de que va no pasa nada. Al menos por lo que he visto en el 1 ACT se puede jugar sin haber le\u00eddo ni una sola p\u00e1gina del webcomic.  \n\nEs un point and click encantador, puedes investigar muchas cosas y tienen ese toque de humor t\u00edpico de Hussie. El arte incre\u00edble, la m\u00fasica como ya me lo esperaba, genial. He adorado a la protagonista, Joey y a su hermano as\u00ed como al otro personaje que aparece m\u00e1s adelante. \n\nNo me ha parecido dif\u00edcil, tampoco da pistas obvias y lo he disfrutado cada segundo. Solo en una parte he dado demasiadas vueltas sin saber qu\u00e9 hacer hasta que el motivo de que me quedara estancada fue porque se me olvid\u00f3 dar click en un objeto.\n\nMe ha dejado con ganas de m\u00e1s.\n\nAh, tiene algunos errores y he tenido que cargar el juego varias veces, pero no se han repetido demasiado y espero que saquen alguna actualizaci\u00f3n para arreglarlo en el futuro.

The art and music is incredible and really carries on the feeling of Homestuck, the web comic that this extends from. You certainly do not need to know anything about Homestuck to enjoy this, but there's a ton of stuff packed in for fans to appreciate and lore to speculate about.\n\nThe game itself had no issues, although the screen does have black bars around the top and bottom occasionally, or some clickable parts of the screen half-cut off. This is most likely related to me playing the game in fullscreen in 4k resolution, but I figured I'd mention it anyway. That's about the most I've noticed here and there, but it doesn't stop you from experiencing all the game offers.\n\nIt's basically an old-school point-and-click puzzle solver and there's tons to explore. You can interact with just about everything you can see in the environment and use items together or on the surroundings and it almost always gives you a unique message about it - there has to be literally thousands of all unique lines. The highlight of the game is probably that - the cute and quirky dialogue, with an obvious huge amount of thought put into it.\n\nThis is, as to my knowledge, act 1 of 4. After that, a separate game will be released which tells the events from the opposite perspective. The first act was pretty short, but with about half the steam achievements unlocked from one playthrough, it's pretty guaranteed that there's way more I missed, even though I was pretty careful about exploring. I'd say you'll get about two or so hours out of this, which is pretty good because there's replay value in my opinion, especially for fans of Homestuck. The pricetag at $8 USD is an amazing value, and the soundtrack is so dense and great, I'd say get it if you have the money to spare.\n\nCongrats to Andrew Hussie and the developers at What Pumpkin!

I'll touch upon that in a moment,) and following an initial restart due to some graphical glitches (sky dissapearing in one section, main world screen minimised and jumping about as I moved) I found myself having a very enjoyable experiance with the game. The small references are great but not enough to alienate any new comers to the homestuck series, as well as leaving you ready for more. The story itself is great and the characters are interesting and lovable! (or at least the ones you're meant to love.)\n\nMy first run through of the chapter took me about 2.4 hours, and what interests me is I'm still missing around 20 achievements. I don't know if this means theres more to the game than I've done, but the only none-secret achievement talks about 'picking up where you left off.' I don't know if this means there's more to this first chapter that I'm missing, but  if I'm not then I have mixed feelings about this time spent. On one hand, I enjoyed every moment of it and would happily play it all again, but on the other hand it feels fairly short considering the time spent putting it together. I'm aware it's episodic and I now hope that following chapters come rather swiftly? But if we wind up waiting a year+ for roughly 2.5 hours every time, then I can't help but feel a little cheated. \n\nAs a whole, however, the game itself is fun and interesting!

As with the webcomic which inspired it, Hiveswap's cast of characters are well-realized and quick to grow on you, their eclectic interests and personality quirks mixing well with the game's frequently referential, frequently metafictional, and constantly wry sense of humor. \n\nAnd speaking of humor, it is -everywhere-. Every one of the numerous environments are packed with clickables with amusing bits of dialogue, and nearly every obtainable item can be used with any other item, or any background object, to produce a unique dialogue or interaction. The amount of (optional) text in this game is absolutely boggling. \n\nAs of writing, the game suffers some occasional graphic bugs, depending on your resolution, including improperly aligned cameras. It is not immediately clear what background elements can and cannot be interacted with from a glance, which interrupted gameplay, though this happened rarely, and was a minor issue. The graphical issues are annoying, but hardly deal-breaking. \n\nThose gripes aside, the game is bursting with personality, promising a weird and hilarious adventure through a mysterious and enthralling world.

I understand that the game is being released in acts, but until the other three are released, or at least have /some kind/ of release date, I'd strongly reccomend against purchasing it. \n\nAs it stands now, Hiveswap plays more like a demo for the full game, instead of a full game.

Know this before going in.\n\n\nThat aside, there are small bugs within the game, including a really, really bad issue with the camera panning over to other rooms while still staying on the room you're in. On top of this, there is no \"losing\" hivewap, it is esentially a visual novel, and less of a game. These are minor issues overall, and didn't impact my playthrough all to much, but they are worth noting.\n\nOn the upside, the art is fantastic, and the animated cutscenes have some charm to them. The writing did give me a chuckle, and was very evocative of Homestuck, if that's the kind of thing you care about. The soundtrack was limited, and became really repedative, but was very enjoyable for a while. \n\nOverall, Hiveswap is a silghly more involved visual novel, with pretty pictures and nice animation, but doesn't actually feature very much outside of the content shown off in it's trailers.

I'm only 'halfway' or maybe even one fourth of the way through the game (considering I dont really know where it ends yet), but it's gripping.

There's so much nostalgia here for me. I grew up in the period this game is set, so there's so many toys and other junk that I recognize. That aside, this game is, SO FAR, fantastic. If it keeps this level of quality that I've had in the first hour, then it's going to be one of my all-time favourite point/click adventure games.\n\nThe music, the visuals, the humor! And the hidden achievements! I just got an achievement for trying to feed the Bubsy poster a pet treat. The result was hilarious.\n\n\nEDIT: I've just finished ACT 1, which is currently all that's available. Here's my thoughts on my experience:\n\nI'm sure if you only spent your time solving puzzles, you could beat it in about 20 minutes. But that's not what I did. I spent as much time as possible using every object and action on everything else even to the point where I got an achievement for trying to use a pigeon on 30 different objects.\n\n3 hours later, I was very satisfied with the experience, and I will probably play through it again tomorrow to try different object interactions. I hope ACT 2 doesn't take too long to release.\n\nIf you're looking for reviews of specific things or whatever, then here you go.\n\nVisuals: Very familiar to Homestuck fans. Some camera errors that don't impede gameplay that I'm sure will be fixed soon.\n\nAudio: The soundtrack is stuck in my head.\n\nUI: The top bar can get in the way of some puzzles, so if you're stuck, maybe try minimizing it while you look around. On the subject, there is no highlight on the interactable objects (aside from your cursor changing when hovering over), which I feel was actually a good choice. When you discover some funny writing by doing something like, as a previous example, feeding a pet treat to a Bubsy poster, it feels all the more special by the knowledge that the game didn't explicitly try to tell you there was stuff you could do with it at all.\n\nStability: Well, in all the time I played it, it didn't crash. That's something.\n\nStory/Writing: Top quality writing. The story definitely seems to be accessible to people who have never read Homestuck. In fact, I think it will make those people go and start reading it.\n\nIf you've got any specific questions, leave a comment on this review.

[/h1]\nI'm going to be honest: I really don't like point-n-click games (with the exception of the Ace Attorney series) and this game presents my problems with them: Gameplay-wise, they're boring. A lot of meaningless text, with no voice acting. Most of the time you find yourself relying on a guide because you easily get lost on what you have to do to progress the story because solving the puzzles aren't clear enough. (\u25d4_\u25d4)\n\nHowever, despite that P&C games aren't what I would usually play, this game just kept me smiling the entire way no matter what. It just has this adorable charm to it that makes it impossible to hate it.\n\n[b][u]THIS GAME SO FREAKING CUTE![/u][/b]\nIt doesn't matter if I'm a bit bias for games that have hand drawn art styles, I am in love with this game's art! (\u2267\u25e1\u2266) \u2661 It's just so adorably cute and it fits amusing story and characters so perfectly. Just take a look at the screenshots of the game and tell me how it doesn't make you want to play the game to completion. There is just this immense child-like innocence you feel while playing HIVESWAP. The animations are so charming that I can feel it touching my inner child. While the soundtrack wasn't legendary by any means, it definitely did get my attention. It's a perfect rhythm for the theme of the game. \n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\nI've already said what I don't like about P&C games and that this game has pretty much all of my issues of why I don't play them. It was kinda annoying to have to rely on a guide to beat the game, and while I accept that it's not my style of play, I believe better hints can be placed for those who aren't too familiar with P&C games. \nThere was some interesting RPG-like battle segements in the game that I have mixed feelings about. The battles are like a hybrid of Point & Click and RPG, there's no damage stats and all that jazz. It's more of a puzzle than anything. And while I do think it works with the game just fine, I still wish it had a traditional RPG experience with it that balances with the game's P&C game style.\n\n[b][u]The Story[/u][/b]\nI love the characters and the writing is amusing. The best thing about the games loveable characters is that the art style suits just how cute and loveable they are. I really did enjoy playing as Joey all the way and I'm really interested in where this is all going. I'm not one for episodic games (especially when you have to wait until each chapter is released), but HIVESWAP: Act 1 really delivers on what an Episode 1 of a game should do: [i]Make you excited for the adventure that awaits, while keeping the beginning a fun experience[/i]. You obviously won't get mind-blowing plot twists here, however I'll say it's a really good start for an adorable and fun story. Without trying to spoil anything, I would say the strongest point of Act 1 is really when it concludes. It's so cute and concludes nicely without feeling like an annoying cliffhanger.\n\n[b]Do I recommend HIVESWAP: Act 1?[/b]\nABSOLUTELY. Even if you despise Point & Click games, if you find the game interesting enough to play, I highly doubt you will feel disappointed as long as you know what you're getting into.", "timestamp_created": 1516530162, "timestamp_updated": 1516530830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39502881": {"recommendationid": "39502881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050652725", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505618534}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "HONK HONK", "timestamp_created": 1516517118, "timestamp_updated": 1516517118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39502019": {"recommendationid": "39502019", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976129379", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "last_played": 1516513072}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked any part of Homestuck, you'll probably enjoy this.

So I probably missed some of the inside jokes, it was still a lot of fun to play even as a non Homestuck fan. Hiveswap has very charming graphics and a witty written storyline. It's a classic point & click game with a lot of text, at some points the game felt more like a Graphic novel story, however the game does have fun puzzle elements. The game has unique Combat scenes, sometimes you will encounter monsters and you will have to tap dance, ballet dance and use other tricks to get past them.

You had EA and their shady game-ruining Business practices, PUBG  became very annoying and unplayable, A Horrible PUBG clone comes out called Fortnite, Raven and Sledgehammer releasing that poor excuse for a COD game, The New Wolfenstein and its, unlike the other games, Stupid attempt at a story telling along with the lack of game mechanics the First one had, Unturned Literally Died, and not to mention the piles and piles of Triple-A games with that $60 price tag but nothing under the shell. Hollow games. I have had, as many others have had, a game Dehydration. Games dont seem like games anymore. Except this game. This game blew me away. As a Homestuck fan, I was naturally excited for this game, but, I didnt expect much from it. Watching the trailer, I knew it was going to be great. I didnt think, though, that i would actually become a total mega fangirl over it. Well thats what happened.. The soundtrack is beautifully created with the obvious sense that it was made not for profit, but to immerse the player. The cutscenes were animated finely and had pretty little art touches in them that made me personally get goosebumps from how great it was. The characters clearly have alot of work put into their writing as each has a personality and behavior that is signature and special to each character. Plus, Not saying that this game is directly in the same universe as Homestuck, Which it may be, i dont know, but You could fit the whole game so far into the Homestuck timeline and with some connections it makes complete sense. For example, Jade Harleys Grandfather from Homestuck looks and has the same interests as \"Pa\" (the dad) in this game. Hell, In this game, Judes last name is Harley. And to top that, A wall mount that has two rifles on it in the house That you start out in in the game Has a Symbol or Engraving, or something that looks exactly like Bec, Jade Harleys \"Pet\" (from Homestuck). Alright then.. Ill save the theories for later.. But do check out this game. Some people say its boring, but those are the people that if they dont get wowed in the first 20 seconds, they quit and talk trash about the game. But its super good.. just look at LITERALLY EVERY REVIEW, 99% ARE POSITIVE! Anyways..

Even though I understand all of the drama surrounding this game's production (really, I've been nothing but supportive and patient over the years), I'm left feeling just... bitter that Hiveswap's first installment feels more like some kind of demo/teaser. Most of my hours put into this game were after my initial playthrough when I decided to achievement hunt. I got distracted a lot and just tabbed out, letting the music play in the background. At most, you're probably only going to get a couple hours out of this game's first act, and that's only if you're hellbent on testing out every item interaction.\n\nRight now I only tentatively recommend Hiveswap.

I'm quite the Homestuck fan so this game has immediately gotten me in love with the Homestuck universe again.\n\nFrom this game though, it's quite balancing for people who are new to Homestuck, and those who aren't.\nFor people who are new, I believe it gives you a great introduction to the characters in the story. It doesn't just toss you into it expecting you to know something, which in other cases is rather poor design in my opinion in gaming, unless it's just a series continued after the first one, which is of course always recommended to start the first part of the series. \nIf you haven't read Homestuck though, and are completely new to the Homestuck universe, I really do highly suggest you read it. Homestuck is a wonderful web comic that everyone says is terrible, but it's really not.\n\nThen of course for the people that actually know about Homestuck and have been through the hell of reading all of Homestuck, you can be like \"Hey there's <insert name here>!\", which in my opinion is a treat for those that have read all of Homestuck.\n\nAnyways, general gameplay talk though.\nThe whole point-and-click thing, I'm totally in love with it. I think it's done well, just like many other point-and-click games out there. Nothing too extreme or simple, which in this case is good for this type of game. I feel it's more story based than actual game mechanic based. Or I could be wrong, I don't entirely know, just going by what I experienced. \n\nThen there's the story progression. The story progression I feel is just the right amount of pace. It could be because of how much time I spent on the puzzles, I don't know hard they actually are in general but it felt like the right type of pace for me.\n\nThen there's the music. The music is outstanding, I'd get the music but oh well, money. The music fits with the scene just right, feels like I could actually think about the scenes just listening to the music by itself.\n\nLast but not least, my most favorite part of the game, the artwork. The artwork is SO well done. I don't know why but the artwork just allures me so much. It's for sure taken them time to actually implement the artwork, unless they're extreme professionals and did most of it in just hours, which is still even impressive. It's for sure a step up from the actual Homestuck comic, which don't get me wrong I love Homestuck's style of art, it actually inspires me. This type of art is quite detailed though, and for sure a bump up of what Homestuck was. So the people who made the artwork, bless your soul. \n\nI'm really excited to see where this game will take us all, thanks for making it so great already. \u2764 (Also sorry if this review is sloppy, I'm not some professional reviewer.)", "timestamp_created": 1520628209, "timestamp_updated": 1520628209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40691290": {"recommendationid": "40691290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338903579", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520472574}, "language": "english", "review": "And here I thought I got away from Homestuck...", "timestamp_created": 1520624350, "timestamp_updated": 1520624350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40643420": {"recommendationid": "40643420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290536323", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520039596}, "language": "english", "review": "5/5", "timestamp_created": 1520473920, "timestamp_updated": 1520473920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40641800": {"recommendationid": "40641800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275965183", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78, "last_played": 1520538762}, "language": "english", "review": "coming from a homestuck fan, this is pretty amazing. the graphics and musical score are absolutely fitting.

There was an issue with the payment not going through so they sent me a Steam code this morning for the trouble.\n\nI became aware of this game quite a while ago. As a long time reader of MS Paint Adventures, and a fan of Homestuck, it was hard to NOT know about this game and the controversy surrounding its development and its delays. All that aside, I did not expect much from this, as games stuck in that kind of limbo generally either never come out, or just don't do well when they finally are released. I ended up being pleasantly surprised.\n\nAlthough short (around 2 hours), I ended up running through Act 1 in one sitting. I'm pretty excited for Act 2 now. The writing is done very well, and is very reminiscent of the Homestuck comic. I also enjoyed the animation, although it was a little blocky at times. The decision to go with 2D after the original 3D plan was a good one, but you can tell that so many design changes had an effect on quality of the product.\n\nThe last thing I want to comment on is the music. Homestuck ended up with a nice little trove of aspiring composers, and I know some of them also worked on this game, although I'm not sure which ones. Toby Fox of Undertale acclaim was involved in the music here, and I can definitely hear some of his tones coming through.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this if you are a fan of Homestuck - some of the references thrown in are a nice little touch.

As much as I love Homestuck, and all its ironically/ maybe not ironic glory, gentlepersonly showmanship, and actiony whimsical jokery, it's a good thing that you don't HAVE to have read the webcomic in it's entirety, or possibly at all to get what's going on in the game. Will you see some easter eggs if you have? OFC! But, you don't have to come from it to learn something and have a great time. Whether you're fresh off the Homestuck express, or green as a scallion in the ground, you're sure to have a good time here, and that's what's up.\n\nThe characters are well thought out, as usual, and they have their own unique personalities that follows in the same vein as we've all come to love. Or at least, I do. It's super interesting to see what different hobbies and differences each character embodies over time and how they grow from those beginnings to the individuals they end up as in the end. It's an evolving spectrum of character development and the friendliness and care shown between the characters about what is and isn't a good relationship between two people is really enlightening for the player as well as the characters themselves. It's a ride in itself. Like in Battleblock Theatre, we're taking a journey on the great ship, Friendship, who knows where we'll end up next.\n\nThe artwork is classic Homestuck style, which was comforting to me, and led me to something familiar where I could venture from Nostalgia into a vast beyond of a new world unfamiliar to me as of yet.

Then they form a game studio, called WHAT PUMPKIN Games, and create an game that became the best of 2017, and brought back the point and click genrie. That came is called HIVESWAP. This is my extensive review. \n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is an nostalgic Point and Click game, and works well with that favor. The controls are tight and the strife battles are cool too. It really fits with that story too, it being basic and simple, yet rewarding.\n\nStory and Characters:\nThe story of Hiveswap ACT 1 takes place in 1994 at the Harley Manor in Hauntswitch in the B1 Universe, following Jude Harley and Joey Claire, 2 siblings that were playing outside with their dog Tesseract as they are attacked by mysterious monsters. Joey, who runs into the house and Jude runs to his treehouse. After Joey finds her way into the Attic via LOTS of puzzles and rushing away from an swarm of monsters, she uses a weird key she found in her room and it stuffs itself into a machine infront of her,then she gets thrown into a Portal from it, transporting Dammek, a Troll from the planet of Alternia planning a Revolt against the abusive Highblood Trizza, to Earth while Joey gets transported to Alternia where she works with a troll named Xefros to find a way back or help with the revolt.\n\nJoey : Joey is an intelligent, even-tempered 14 Yearold girl with a knack of puzzle-solving. Joey is a dancer, practicing both ballet and tap, which she uses to escape some tricky situations in creative ways. She is also an aspiring veterinarian, and keeps a small kit of medical tools on her person.\n\nDue to her difficult childhood, Joey is deeply frustrated with the adults in her life and sometimes feels insecure due to the neglect she faces. Joey has little tolerance towards bullying and abuse, and will not hesitate to stand up for people she sees as being mistreated.\n\nAlthough she is constantly confronted by strange events and circumstances, she repeatedly shows herself to be adaptive and creative despite it all. All in all, Joey is a survivor which makes her really stand out. \n\nJude : Jude is around 10-13 Years old, and is largely defined by his neurotic tendencies and love of conspiracy theories, among them aliens. He constantly investigates strange tabloids and is keeps a close ear on the activities of a Mysterious Cult from a nearby mansion. Although often overly cautious, Jude proves himself to be dependable and is shown knowledgeable in strategy, security and avoidance tactics. He is not above pestering and pranking his sister, however, and is generally a goofy, clumsy kid.\n\nXefros : Xefros is around 6-7 Sweeps, and is a timid, passive troll with a kind heart and low self-esteem. Due to Dammek's influence and the general mistreatment of low-bloods in Alternia, Xefros does not think highly of himself or any of his abilities, and shows some anxiety over his fading childhood. He has a tendency to apologize a lot. He is also training to be a butler, and is not very excited at the prospect.\n\nHe also seems to be more accepting and comfortable around the subject of cleaning supplies and buckets compared to other trolls, and keeps his hive relatively cleaner than his peers.\n\nDespite his weaker tendencies, Xefros shows a compassionate, trusting nature, and is willing to put himself in danger to help someone in need. He is a passionate follower of Dammek's rebellion. \n\nUnfortunatly, Dammek, and all the others shown in the game don't have anything yet.\n\nSoundtrack :\nTHIS IS THE BIG ONE, The music is amazing. It fits really well with the atmosphere and is jamming to listen to even without the game. In my opinion, get the soundtrack.\n\nGraphics : \nThe graphics are pretty impressive, all of it drawn and cellshaded, and looks really nice and has that MSPA feel. The game was going to be in fully 3D But was cut and reworked due to issues with the budget, but I don't mind because I prefer this version. Animation is really sweet too, and looks fluent. \n\nCompatability : The game runs well enough. I don't have issues running it, Day 1 was a disaster with low end specs but the game litterally requires NOTHING.

There is a healthy balance between fun and an unfolding, intriguing story. The pixel art is beautiful. The characters have personality. The intrigue is such that I just wanted to skip work so I could keep playing this game! I enjoyed exploring as much of the world as I could without having to stick to the main quest and finding treasures.\n\nThe only downside is the lack of variance in characters' attack and skill effectiveness as you add points to attributes on level up. Also, the experience points you recieve later on from tougher enemies is not much more than that of the common weaker enemies. That may be a result of creating a freely explorable, open world but it was odd to me but not enough to detract from my overall experience.\n\nIf Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger are your type of game, I would highly recommend Ara Fell.

Besondere Erw\u00e4hnung soll hier das Crafting-System finden, dass ruhig etwas umfangreicher h\u00e4tte sein k\u00f6nnen. Auch das Kampfsystem ist nicht standartm\u00e4\u00dfig und l\u00e4uft teilweise in Echtzeit ab. Ebenso vorhanden ist eine Karte mit Questmarkern und Fog of War, ein Teleportsystem mit freischaltbaren Wegpunkten und ein H\u00e4ndler bei dem man, zugegeben wenige, neue F\u00e4higkeiten erkaufen kann.\n\nVon der Schwierigkeit  her sind die anf\u00e4nglichen  K\u00e4mpfe etwas m\u00fchseelig, da man kaum Erfahrung oder Geld erwirtschaftet. Je l\u00e4nger man spielt, desto einfacher wird es allerdings. Fans des Grindings sollten wissen, dass man \nin diesem Spiel lieber auf die EP achten sollte als auf Geld, da dies wirklich knapp ist. Ein Level-Up bringt effektiv, zumindest meiner Ansicht nach, mehr als ein neues R\u00fcstungsteil, da man eigentlich gen\u00fcgend davon durch Crafting und Truhen erh\u00e4lt. \n\nDie Geschichte, die das Spiel erz\u00e4hlt, ist nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig spannend, hat aber seine H\u00f6hen. Es handelt sich um das gute alte Helden-Retten-Die-Welt Szenario. Ohne gro\u00dfartig etwas Spoilern zu wollen, kann man sagen, dass das Ende abschlie\u00dfend ist, dennoch trotzdem Platz f\u00fcr einen Nachfolger bietet. Dabei werden die meisten Fragen gekl\u00e4rt, die einem im Spiel einfallen. Zu der Hauptquest gibt es noch einpaar Nebenquests, die allerdings alle relativ kurz und unbedeutend sind. Mehr w\u00e4re auf alle F\u00e4lle sch\u00f6n gewesen, es hat aber definitiv gereicht um zu Leveln und extra Loot abzustauben. \n\nAlles in allem war das geld gut investiert und ich hatte viel Spa\u00df daran dieses RPG-Maker spiel zu beenden. Daumen Hoch und weiter so! Weiter unten gibt es noch einpaar Tips, die ich so Spoilerfrei wie m\u00f6glich halten werde.\n\n\n\n\nTIPS: \nNachdem der Hauptheld seinen AOE-Magieangriff lernt, kann man ruhig auf Intelligenz und Mana umskillen. Der reine DMG durch ATK ist niedriger als auf einer INT-Skillung und die Gegner sind gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils schwach gegen den AOE-Magieangriff.\n\nReflektieren des Tanks sollte so schnell wie m\u00f6glich erlernt und beinahe bei s\u00e4mtlichen K\u00e4mpfen als Er\u00f6ffnungszug eingesetzt werden, da es so ziemlich alle AOE-Angriffe von Gegnern annuliert.\n\nSpart es euch auch nur einen Punkt in ATK bei eurem Unterst\u00fctzer zu verwenden, steckt 6 Punkte in DEF, 2-5 in AGI und den Rest in Mana und INT. Es gibt ein Item mit dem man mehr Mana regeneriert, dieses hilft Wunder.\n\nEuer Magier sollte so schnell wie m\u00f6glich 5-8 Punkte in DEF haben, danach alles in INT bis der Neutrale-AOE-Zauber freigekauft wurde. Hier besonders Interessant: Man kann eine R\u00fcstung ohne Extrastats craften, die den Mana-Verbrauch halbiert. Diese erl\u00e4ubt es euch den Neutralen-Single-Target-Zauber mehrmals hintereinander zu casten und keine Manaprobleme zu bekommen. Mit 2 Punkten in MANA kann mann auch den AOE 2 mal hintereinander casten, was eigentlich f\u00fcr s\u00e4mtliche Trashgruppen locker reicht.", "timestamp_created": 1513009201, "timestamp_updated": 1514305810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645923", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38219934": {"recommendationid": "38219934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000076668", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512934856}, "language": "english", "review": "The game almost made me cry just because it is so nostalgic.\n\nI've seen the trailer and a few pics and I immidiatley new I'd love this game.\nIt has beatiful music for most of the areas, the story is great and the fighting and the skill systems are nice. \n\nJust a thing I kinda dislike; there is no change in music when a fight starts or when you win one, therefor it doesn't really feel like fighting or winning.\n\nStill a really fine game, I hope for a part 2 or a new, comparable game!\nGood work guys! :)", "timestamp_created": 1512936755, "timestamp_updated": 1512936755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585492", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38147118": {"recommendationid": "38147118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091682853", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512706514}, "language": "english", "review": "I won't lie, I was just a smidge bit underwhelmed with how the ending went, but, overall, I loved the game for being such a throwback to old school rpgs.\n\n-Good story\n-Humor was juuuust right\n-Doren just -knows-\n-I mean, he -really- knows...things---...and women\n-Shout out to Talani for best stalker grill\n-N>MOAR HEIGHT-CHALLENGED JOKES/JABS\n-Use of out-of-battle skills need work as they're underutilized", "timestamp_created": 1512717725, "timestamp_updated": 1512717880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38139466": {"recommendationid": "38139466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014420543", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485622038}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun game for a RPGMAKER kind of game.

Alguns efeitos sonoros e m\u00fasicas realmente foram t\u00e3o bem com as cenas, que me surpreenderam.\n\nJOGABILIDADE\nJogar Ara Fell \u00e9 t\u00e3o simples quanto jogar os RPGs cl\u00e1ssicos nos quais o jogo se inspira. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito mist\u00e9rio, \u00e9 praticamente s\u00f3 memorizar os comandos mais b\u00e1sicos e seguir com eles at\u00e9 o final do jogo. O sistema de batalhas por turnos com modo autom\u00e1tico e o modo de hist\u00f3ria pode ajudar quem tem pregui\u00e7a de lutar. E a customiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos personagens deu um qu\u00ea a mais pra quem gosta de apelar com stats alt\u00edssimos (cof, cof, nunca fiz isso). O sistema de quests \u00e9 simples e charmoso, me diverti bastante atendendo a tasks bem aleat\u00f3rias. Dentro das dungeons, h\u00e1 puzzles legais de se fazer, mas acredito que muitos achar\u00e3o bem f\u00e1ceis. Nada t\u00e3o desafiador.\n\nHIST\u00d3RIA\nDeixei o melhor pro final, porque sinceramente... what in the Abyss was that?\nO clima desse jogo \u00e9 ao mesmo tempo leve e estranhamente pesado. A beleza da neve fina que cai do c\u00e9u o tempo todo em Aloria n\u00e3o denuncia as guinadas sombrias que Ara Fell d\u00e1 em alguns momentos. O jogo consegue soltar diversos mist\u00e9rios no ar e resolver satisfatoriamente boa parte deles, enquanto desenvolve bem os personagens. Lita LeCotta, por exemplo, \u00e9 uma das protagonistas femininas mais interessantes que j\u00e1 vi. Detalhes pequenos, \u00e0s vezes negligenciados pelo jogador, podem revelar mais sobre algu\u00e9m no jogo. Esteja no clima pra bons di\u00e1logos com mocinhos e vil\u00f5es, porque v\u00e3o rolar. Esteja no clima tamb\u00e9m pra um grupo de personagens principais com motiva\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00f3lidas pra se juntar a Lita na sua jornada, e pra um romance aqui e acol\u00e1, que ningu\u00e9m \u00e9 de ferro...\n\nEm resumo, maravilhoso. Ara Fell \u00e9 meu 10/10 dos jogos de RPG Maker <3\n\nSPOILERZ\u00c3O DO FINAL POR SUA CONTA E RISCO:\n[spoiler]Gente. Ara... fell? SERIOUSLY??!

They even patched in an epilogue to offer a glimpse into the future of the characters' lives after the events of the story, which does a good job in finalizing the chapter of Ara Fell.\n\nPros:\n- Rich Story\n- Character development\n- Ability to control stat level-ups is cool\n- Controls\n- The soundtrack is amazing!\n\nCons:\n- Very easy, with no hard mode option (more below)\n- Character development (yes, both pro and con)\n- Replayability is non-existent. One and done, no reason to revisit.\n\n\n--Character development\nOn one hand, the characters have great detail and a clearly developed personality. This is wonderful and helps to engage in the story, because the characters actually care about the world and its inhabitants. Some even have growth as they endure the story's hardships/uptimes, and character arcs that unfold as the story progresses.\n\nOn the other hand, some characters seem devoid of character growth [spoiler] Seri Kesu ... she was so amazing, but grew/revealed so little [/spoiler] or end with a real left-field head scratcher [spoiler] Looking at you, Talani and Doren. Granted, I burst out laughing at the bluntness of it. [/spoiler] - which is sad because they are so cool and they deserve more growth/reasoning.\n\n-- About it being easy\nI found the game super easy, to the point I nearly felt it impossible to lose a battle. Granted; I'm good at these types of games. Just to try to keep the battles somewhat entertaining, I purposefully NEVER equipped top-tier equipment on my characters and left old armor on them instead of upgrading -- or used the armor that provided No Stats (but half MP bonus is crazy). For that purpose; you can mitigate this issue by NOT equipping strong gear(which you can acquire very fast), then the battles can be somewhat more entertaining.\n\nI wouldn't have said anything about this if there were a \"Hard mode\" option available for us veterans/fans. It would offer a form of replayability.\n\n\nOverall? I would say this game is worth a play, even at the full $10. I have heard the author is working on a sequel, and do intend on purchasing it when it is released.\n\n\nTL;DR Beautiful Soundtrack! ...but not immediately available via steam / for sale.

I didn't know what to expect at all when I bought Ara Fell; I noticed that someone on my friend list had it and the premise seemed interesting enough and the art, like I mentioned above, made me super nostalgic. I figured there would be no harm in trying it out! \n\nBut wow. After completing Chapter 1 of the game my feelings went from vaguely interested to actually invested. And it is so rare for me to get so emotionally invested in a game's story and characters so quickly, but Ara Fell did it. What I thought would have been a clich\u00e9 story actually ended up surprising and shocking me on many occasions. (I also may or may not have teared up once or twice.) \n\nThis game shines in its ability to do so much with dialogue and pacing (Lita can be downright hilarious), in the way it is grounded in its lore and world-building (without spoiling, the plot reveals, revelations, and raising of the stakes were all really well done), while not falling* too heavily on combat or exposition, and in creating memorable characters that I ended up truly caring for and looked forward to seeing again (Seri Kesu may just be one of my favorite video game characters of all time). \n\nAll of these elements, combined with a touching, engaging soundtrack and surprisingly powerful atmosphere, make Ara Fell one of the best RPGs I've played this year. So happy that I didn't let this game pass me by. Also, as I saw that the epilogue was added on a bit after the game's initial release - I have to say that for me, personally, it was greatly appreciated. It gave me a much-needed sense of closure after completing the main story of Ara Fell that I would have been otherwise searching for had I been left with the pre-epilogue ending. \n\n*Can I get a +1 for my first time ever using a pun in a review?\n\nThank you so, so much for sharing a bit of one of your worlds with us, Stegosoft Games!

While I had some issues with the game, ultimately I found it to have a lot of heart. It won me over, and I can't wait to see the next title from these developers.\n\nMost of the game's emotional moments felt impactful. The way the game presented the characters and their plight was effective. Sparing use of blood and death heightened the stakes.\n\nThe battle systems and stat progression could have done with some rebalancing. The plethora of gear and stat combinations you can come up with seems to invite experimentation, but all the skills/spells scale heavily on Intelligence - even the physical attack skills. Around the midpoint, this leads to a dominant strategy of giving all of your party members high Intelligence, and using multitarget attacks to win. Once the sorceress character is available, the game seems to encourage doubling down on this tactic. I liked the idea of the freeform level up system, but in practice it didn't quite work out. That said, I still loved seeing my characters level up and giving them more stat points. Certain rewards seem to never get old.\n\nSome of the music could have used a few more compositional ideas, but I enjoyed the texture and contemplative feel of the soundtrack. For example, the music during the prologue adventure had an attractive air of mystery, and it made me want to learn more about the story and game world.\n\nFor the next title from Stegosoft Games, I feel that a more flexible game engine would suit them better than RPG Maker and its limitations. I suspect not being able to move the menu cursor during a battle animation was one such limitation. I would love to see a choice of engine that allows their vision to flourish, as I so enjoyed their storytelling and characters. The RPG Maker stock sound effects are serviceable, but I hope to hear assets of a bit higher quality in their next title.\n\nDespite my complaints, I think this game will stick with me.

But they can, and this game does. This is a game for those of us who love the story-centric RPGs of old (Final Fantasy 4 & 6, Chrono Trigger). However, it may disappoint those in it for the tactical combat (Final Fantasy 5 & Tactics).\n\nWhile Ara Fell doesn't nail every aspect, none of its flaws are enough to hamstring an otherwise great game. A few examples include combat that is rewarding for a while but some oversimplification of mechanics leads to many fights playing out the same way. The story and level design leading up to the end feel a little rushed. Puzzles are another weak point.\n\nBut you won't care because you'll want to see how these characters will grow and reveal more of themselves to you over time. You'll wonder what's beyond this bridge choked with fearsome trolls. You'll thirst for that next big equipment upgrade and a challenging boss to use it against.\n\nI should note that this is a shorter game than those that inspired it. It took me 18.8 hours to fully explore, do side quests and complete the game. In that time it tells a complete and satisfying story. It may be on a smaller scale, but it feels a little bit more intimate.\n\n[u][i]Full review:[/i][/u]\nI really enjoyed the writing in Ara Fell. There is no voice acting but each character still has a distinct voice because of the way they are written. They all have their own flaws, quirks, mysteries and struggles. Character portraits depicting different emotions fill in nicely for voice tone and body language. Frequent light hearted moments and a few running gags keep the mood light. I did notice a few typos and spot genre tropes at times, but nothing near enough to ruin the experience.\n\nIt's not just the heroes that are well written but the villains as well. Not all of them are as fleshed out as I would have liked, but those that are display motivations deeper than the raw evil you often see. While their actions are still wrong, they do become more understandable once you've seen their perspective. Their past is integral to the lore of this magical land in the sky. I like how distant history is poorly kept in Ara Fell because it forces you to constantly question whether the information you come across is myth or reality.\n\nNon-story related NPC dialogue is competent but could have used more depth and variety to truly shine. It is better earlier on in the game but thins out later on. There is enough change in what they have to say after major events in the story to make this world seem reasonably alive.\n\nThe recently added epilogue is a very welcome addition. I can see how the original ending was too abrupt right after the climax. Now we get closure while still leaving the door open to a sequel.\n\nBattles follow a familiar turn based system where each party member has their own specialization. It's main unique feature is that MP pools are small but quickly recharge, allowing you to make liberal use of special skills. There is an unfortunate lack of variety and progression in skills though. Once you gain access to a character they'll either already have all their skills or will quickly learn the rest of them.  Having a single, full party buff spell on the healer means you'll start every boss battle by using that spell, without question. Seemingly in an attempt to streamline, the developers forgot that having options is more fun. Thankfully, frequent bosses do a decent job of shaking things up with their own gimmicks.\n\nIf there is a sequel I hope to see puzzles removed or vastly improved. I'd say that this is Ara Fell's weakest feature. Some are so simple as to be merely busy work. Dragging a brazier onto a glowing spot of the floor presents zero challenge when you can both push and pull. It's impossible to get stuck yet they have a floating orb nearby that allows you to reset the puzzle. There was really only one puzzle that I thought was good and it was a central element to the dungeon it was in, so you'd expect it would be.\n\nThe game is technically open world, however that doesn't make much difference in practice. Story events must follow a specific path and there's little incentive to venture into areas far above your level. There are some gated areas too. They do a good job of marking when a new area is significantly harder than the zone it connects to. I also like the save reminders before important events. I used these as turn back points when I knew there were still side paths I hadn't explored.\n\nIt's worth delving into the nooks and crannies since money is relatively scarce. Most of my gear upgrades came from chests or crafting rather than shops. I've seen other reviews complain about this, but I think it was fine. I was constantly striving to get to the next upgrade until the very end of the game when I was able to max out every equipment slot. Leveling up is less impactful than most new gear, but it does allow you to customize your stats if you want to specialize more.\n\nVisuals are impressively done in a retro SNES style that will appeal to any who fondly remember that era. The colors are vibrant and the land is richly detailed. Plants are numerous and diverse; harmless wildlife flutters overhead and scurries underfoot; and the creations of people display signs of life from both present and past.\n\nAs you might expect, the soundtrack is also a prominent part of the game. It adds impact to cutscenes and flavor to the world. It may not be very complex but the melodies are pleasant and memorable. I'm glad the soundtrack is included for free in the game files folder.", "timestamp_created": 1509960857, "timestamp_updated": 1509960857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36235324": {"recommendationid": "36235324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168268351", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509687268}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not normally go out of my way to write a review after finishing a game, but after finishing it a few minutes ago I was too delighted with Ara Fell to not say something. I'm a child of the triple hits - Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy 6, and Chrono Trigger - and occasionally pick up an RPG Maker game here on Steam to feed my inner 10 year old something 16-bit. It didn't take long into my seventeen hours of play to appreciate the extra layers of development that had been put into Ara Fell's creation, compared to the other RPG Maker games I'd played. My favorite of these extras is the amount of fauna roaming the landside. From rabbits, to birds and butterflies, Ara Fell is never a lonely place. I was reminded of another mid-90's game, Tales of Phantasia, in this regard.\n\nFor a game with much less hours under its belt than the ones listed above, I thought the main characters were well rounded, interesting, and consistent with unique voices. Even most of the important NPC's packed a developed character in their small fraction of an appearance. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that many of the game play elements I appreciated in the early hours of the game gradually took a back seat as the story entered into the last half of the chapters. Free exploration, the crafting system, and any real need to fight battles on the map all lost their touch. The latter half of the game doesn't have much useful off the beaten path discoveries, I'd often have better gear by the time I could craft a useful item (due to the great gear that can be found during the free exploration of the first half), and it was easy to over level from intentionally fighting every monster group at least once.\n\nI'd say this was all forgivable due to the story structure being able to hold itself up the whole way. I'm glad I played after the introduction of the epilogue, because it gave me just the right balance of both wanting a sequel and feeling like the story was done. \n\nAll in all, Ara Fell has a way of raising the bar on the RPG Maker genre, while being disappointing only in that it doesn't give you more of itself. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for more from Stegosoft Games, whether or not they choose to make a direct sequel (yes, please!)\n", "timestamp_created": 1509692900, "timestamp_updated": 1509692900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36160094": {"recommendationid": "36160094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124160434", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509436290}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought on sale, worth the price for the music alone.

I'll try to keep this short since I tend to ramble.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game. The plot is pretty standard RPG fare, but the character design is quite a bit more interesting. I really did feel like the characters were more believable, and because of that I definitely got more attached to them. As others have likely said in their reviews, even the villians are written well - they have their own reasonings for doing what they're doing, and you can feel somewhat sympathetic towards them. Somewhat, anyway.\n\nControls/UI wise, the game played well. I found it odd that ending a battle with a character selected and ready to attack caused parts of the UI to overlap, but I suspect that's a problem with RPG Maker itself. I am VERY glad that there is controller support now, the game picked up my Wii U pro controller without issue. Although, I expect the game would play just as well on keyboard.\n\nI will say that I found the inventory somewhat hard to manage when it came to buying new equipment and comparing stats sometimes, but again, guessing that's a restriction of RPG Maker.\n\nGraphics and sound, I think is somewhat subjective. I know some people LOVE this sort of retro/pixel theme (I'm one of them), but I understand others may not. I will say that I loved the music in this game as well, but I also am a fan of this style of music anyway.\n\nNow for my only real issue with the game, at least in some ways... difficulty. Overall, the game wasn't terribly hard, but I also went out of my way to explore absolutely everything, do all of the sidequests, etc. I only really had to grind once, and that was before I got my full party. After that, I felt like just doing sidequests and occasionally clearing out monsters as I traveled to new areas sustained my leveling. I feel like random encounters are a bit unbalanced in terms of the difficulty/exp given ratio. Maybe I'm incorrect, but there's one specific location with easier enemies early on that was just far easier to grind at than anywhere else available at that time, and it was because those enemies didn't get upgraded after getting my full party together like everything else did.\n\nAs for coins, I felt like random encounters were a bit stingy, but at the same time I also didn't have any issues funding my potion uses throughout the game. This may be because of all of the sidequesting, or it may be because all of the smaller amounts from each random encounter added up.\n\nAnd for a couple random points before I end this... random encounters. There aren't any. You can clearly see where monsters are, and you can just... avoid them if you prefer. This made this game FAR more enjoyable, since I tend to hate random encounters in video games. Another random point is poison/other status effects - I NEVER found any sort of item or spell that could cure status effects, and that irked me a little. I do understand they contribute to the difficulty, but I wish I had some sort of ability to counter it. It didn't seem like the heal spells did anything against them, at least in my experience.\n\nI think that's everything, and this ended up being ridiculously long as I expected it would be. Oh well... to summarize - I loved my time playing this game, and I feel like you would too, if you enjoy RPGs with interesting and believable characters and a good story. While it does have a few flaws here and there with the difficulty and a couple of (purely visual) UI issues, it's overall a well put together game. To give a number of hours, my second attempt at playing it was around 15-16 hours, and that's with me attempting to find most of the secrets this game had to offer (and likely still missing things). Not an extremely long game, but well worth the price, in my opinion.

I also like how the major vampires (save Baramon) aren't flat villains and have their own sympathetic reasons for wanting the Sunstone. However, Doren's love life seems like it could be written better, [spoiler]especially in the epilogue where he seems to get back together with Talani mainly to repopulate their race. [/spoiler]Additionally, I think some characters' backstories should have had flashbacks, especially in the case of Baramon, Nash, and Doren, to flesh them out.\n\nGameplay: \n\nThe good news is that the bosses are balanced so that lone bosses have much higher speed than a properly leveled (or even overleveled) party, making it so that the player's headcount advantage isn't enough to curbstomp the enemy. In contrast, group bosses are more evenly matched with the player in speed, though they should probably be given a bit more HP so that they can't be cheesed with AOE skills.\n\nLike many players might have stated, the strategy for all bosses after Nash's first encounter is pretty much the same, due to how overpowered Doren's buff song is. It's pretty much a \"do everything\" buff that requires very little thought. Additionally, there's little incentive to use any of Seri's spells other than her Elemental Burst spells, since most random enemies will die before status effects become useful on them. And bosses tend to resist most status effects, making it pointless to use any element other than maybe ice to lower their defense. I guess players can challenge themselves by not using Elven Song or Elemental Burst.\n\nThe crafting system makes it easy to get some good equipment early, but I find that crafting potions is pretty pointless. The total sell amount of all the ingredients for a potion exceeds their price in a shop, meaning players are better off selling the ingredients to buy items. This could be remedied by making the crafting system generate multiple items so that crafting is more efficient than using the shop.\n\nPersonally, I think the EXP rate should be lowered and the money drops should be increased. Even though I found a specific area (south of the Springs) where the EXP was low compared to the money and sellable item drops, I still felt like I leveled too quickly before I could afford to buy what I wanted.\n\nThe touch encounters are a nice feature and are implemented in a way where the monsters don't chase you too quickly and there's still some room to move around them, making it possible to avoid them if the player is skilled enough. Many other games implement this in a way where the enemies may as well elite security guards who are nearly as wide as the hallways that they're guarding.\n\nThe stat building system is designed in a way where every stat is useful while making it inexpensive to reset one's choices, making it a more fun and less anxiety inducing than if all stat decisions are final. This allows the player to freely experiment with different builds while getting used to the game's balance.\n\n3.5/5", "timestamp_created": 1509150078, "timestamp_updated": 1509693314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35977327": {"recommendationid": "35977327", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965215862", "num_games_owned": 2737, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508914411}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1]\ud83c\udfae [u]Ara Fell[/u] \ud83c\udfae[/h1]\n\nAra Fell ist ein klassisch rundenbasiertes RPG, welches mit dem [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/362870/RPG_Maker_2003/]RPG Maker 2003[/url] erstellt und entwickelt wurde. Inspiriert wurde es von \"Buffy - Die Vampirj\u00e4gerin\" und erinnert stark an Konsolenklassiker wie Zelda, Chrono Trigger oder Final Fantasy. Einige Spieler neigen dazu Ara Fell als eines der besten RPG-Maker-Spiele zu bezeichnen, welches in all den Jahren entwickelt wurde. Leider nur mit englischer Sprachausgabe.\n\n[b]Setting und Gameplay[/b]\n\nW\u00e4hrend die meisten RPG-Maker-Titel mit vorgefertigten Texturen und Tilesets daher kommen, gab man sich bei Ara Fell M\u00fche und individualisierte viel, sodass eine liebevoll und detailreiche Welt kreiiert wurde, die in einer Pixel-Retro-Grafik daher kommt. Diese M\u00fche machte man sich auch beim Komponieren und Erstellen des Soundtracks, welcher wirklich zum Spiel passt, abgestimmt wirkt und die Atmosph\u00e4re steigert. Somit rentiert sich auch das Erkunden der scheinbar unendlich gro\u00df wirkenden Open-World-Welt, denn man merkt gar nicht richtig wie man in selbige eintaucht und in sie versinkt. In meinen Augen ein emminent wichtiger Punkt bei Rollenspieltiteln, wenn die Atmosph\u00e4re stimmt.  \n\nDabei spielen auch die Charaktere, welche ebenfalls liebevoll designed sind, eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Mit Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten ausgestattet, gestalten sich die Dialoge als sinnvoll und angenehm. Es passt einfach! Die Story orientiert sich, wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, ein St\u00fcck weit an Buffy und ist gut erz\u00e4hlt, l\u00e4sst zum Schluss jedoch ein paar Fragen offen und wirkt daher abgehackt. Fr\u00fcher gab es einige Probleme mit dem Controller-Support, welche seit dem 8. Oktober und einem [url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/440540/announcements/detail/1457336803399631280]Major Update[/url] jedoch ad acta gelegt werden kann. Ich hatte jedenfalls beim wiederholten Durchspielen mit dem XBox 360 Wireless keine Probleme mehr. \n\nBeim Balancing scheiden sich wie so oft die Geister. Zu schwer, ausgewogen/unausgeglichen oder zu einfach? Das ist eine individuelle Frage und muss jeder f\u00fcr sich entscheiden. Erfahrene RPG-Spieler werden sich zurecht finden und ihr Urteil selbst f\u00e4llen, aber auch Anf\u00e4nger haben schnell den richtigen Weg gefunden.\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\n\nDas Spiel kann man, im Vergleich zu den meisten anderen komerziellen RPG-Maker-Titeln, empfehlen. Die Entwickler haben wirklich viel Zeit und M\u00fche in das Spiel gesteckt und das merkt man auch. Die Spielzeit betr\u00e4gt circa 15 Stunden ehe man das Ende erreicht hat. Sicherlich g\u00e4be es Spiele die mehr Spielzeit generieren, aber qualitativ vergleichbare Spiele sind rar ges\u00e4t. Hinzu kommt der f\u00fcr solche Spiele un\u00fcblich stark daher kommende Soundtrack. Meine Spielesammlung und die Aktivit\u00e4t auf Steam seit M\u00e4rz 2004 sollten als Erfahrung und um das beurteilen zu k\u00f6nnen, ausreichend sein. Gute Spiele und Entwickler sollte man unterst\u00fctzen.

The reason I bought and finished this game, was because it reminded me of Final Fantasy VI, which is my favourite oldschool RPG of all time. However, the more I progressed in Ara Fell, the more I noticed on what could've been done better. In the next bits, I will take Ara Fell and Final Fantasy VI at face value and outline the differences between these two games.\n\n1. First of all, I want to focus on the gameplay. I usually like turn-based combat, if it is accompanied by some feeling of progression, inventive (boss-/enemy-) mechanics and consequently, adequate difficulty spikes. I can't deny that Ara Fell's combat gets the progression-part down, still, there is a lot to be desired on the latter aspects.\nIf you ever encounter a boss with a new mechanic, these won't affect you much (Debuff every round, kill everything around the boss first, etc.). \n\nIn Final Fantasy VI, I remember encountering a boss that would randomly possess one of your characters without any indication of who the possessed one might be. While the boss stays invulnerable, you have to find out who the possessed character may be, by killing them yourself one by one.\nTo me this is one of many examples of how to make turn-based combat infinitely more interesting, engaging and tactical.\n\n2. Now to the plot. Ara Fell has a very passable plot, although it is a little generic imo. Essentially, it's all about saving the world from the bad guys with a little help of some artifacts and so on. \n\nIt would be unfair to compare this plot to FF VI, as Ara Fell is a 15 hour game at most.\n\n3. And finally the music. I'm usually not a fan of video game music, but I happened to like the first track at the start of the game a lot. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty solid, though these songs didn't surprise me like the first one. \n\nIt's mostly the same concerning the music of Final Fantasy VI. The soundtrack is solid all in all, though I wouldn't listen to any of that given the opportunity.\n\nThere's a lot I wanted to point out like e.g. animated facial expressions, but I feel like cutting it short here. \n\nIn conclusion, Ara Fell feels like a mini-RPG, content- and plotwise. It doesn't drag on to long, everything is clearly explained, the characters are okay, the plot is okay and the visuals are neat. All in all, this game may be good for people who haven't ever played any RPG and want to try something new. \n\nI personally appreciate and understand the effort of the one person who made this game by himself, which despite its shortcomings warrants a thumbs up.\n", "timestamp_created": 1508356833, "timestamp_updated": 1508356833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35702942": {"recommendationid": "35702942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347568394", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507506293}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't use Steam.

This may be a pretty long one because I would try to go in depth here. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!\n\nI wrote this review when I spent 5 hours in the game and I was telling myself \"It is not bad but if  it did get so overwhelmingly possitive reviews your game will surely do so too!\" I was almost sure about that as the game started as a an usual jRPG - a very unique idea in the center and a lot of cliched tropes filling the rest of the game.\nThe main plot line was likeable but the side quest were there just for the sake of having some side quests. I guess most of you are already tired of killing N amount of monsters to help someone \"clear the infested area\" or to \"control the population\". Did any of you feel the urgency to capture the Rangers' Guild bounties? I doubt it. These supposed criminals seemed to not be related to the rest of the world at all. Hell, the supposedly horrible bandits even refused to kill a party of warriors that kept attacking them.\nAlso, the character's roles and powers were debateable. Adrian was a heavily armored peasant boy and Seri Kesu was a great mage who happened to get her ass handled to her by some bandits and by most  of the monsters wandering around aimlessly.\nAs the game continued on though I started seeing better and better why this game was so successful. It has characters you start to care for. Despite the world being very unrecogniseable amongst the most of the other fantasy worlds the game had a cast of characters that you need to see winning, overcoming all the obstacles and saving the day. I can bet that the world build was not the premise but was done mostly to serve the characters and the conflict between them. The author knew the story he would tell long before he knew how Silvara fed itself and most probably even before he knew how a half of the world is super cold and the other is cosy warm.\nHaving said that I need to address the few issues I had with the plot. I would skip the cliches like the arrow splitting the previous one in half, the unlikely hero, the prophecy, the traitor who becomes the main villain etc. Tropes became tropes because they were successful but still I dislike it. I disliked the most of deus ex machina moments we had, especially the Talani one. I never really used Talani and I ignored her all the way. Her saving the day had no impact on me and deus ex machina having no impact is a failure by definition (at least for me). The moment with the dwarves saving the day in the grove was okay and I guess that the army coming to Lita's aid at the end was okay but a little overdone by having even her little brother come to fight Baramon (WTF?! What were they thinking?!) Also, the Asari one was pretty out of place IMO. The destruction of the Sunstone was anticlimactic. Also, I was kicking Kefk...uh, Baramon's butt until he pulled off a 9999 attack out of his sleeve which I tend to despise. And I could not agree with how things turned out for Nash or to be more precise what Nash did until the end. I think that he should've joined forces with Lita. These and even more moments pulled me out of the game and its world.\nHowever, even if there were 10-20-30 such moments it is not too much as I tend to be more critical usually and this happens with each and every game I play. For example I liked the variety of movement - jumping and swimming but I felt that it got overused at some point (especially the swimming). Also, there were a lot of places with an open area at the end of the map. I get that it looks better but it is not a good thing. You create a rule (\"The map ends in an open spot = you can go to another map\") and you do not break it. At least that is what I value more than the otherwise very good mapping.\nOverall the game held well and I liked the most of it except for the battle system. I tend to prefer the turns before the timer based and the hybrid ones. I disliked it not only because of that though. It just felt non-responsive most of the time. It felt super unpredictable in terms of who comes first and if I would be able to just click faster and heal/attack before I receive an enemy attack or not.\nOverall I think that this game suffered from it being started by a developer who grew up and started understanding what makes a fantasy world better but did not want to drop his project. The game starts slow and rather usual but as the plot continues forward it is becoming more and more interesting and better overall.\nI listed pros and cons below. They turned out to be an equal amount but IMO the pros overweight the cons by a signifcant margin. I liked the game a lot and although I have been super critical here I really see what it did right and it even inspired me to keep on working on my own project and finish it some day.\n\nPros, Could've-been-betters and Cons:\n+ Easily the best mapping I have ever seen from an RPGM game\n+ Heroes were well fleshed out and likeable\n+ Customizable stats\n+ No random encounters\n+ Interesting plot\n+ Good music\n\n* Crafting is not bad but had more potential than that\n* Skills had more potential than that\n* The world build is okay but I think that more could've been done here\n\n- A lot of clich\u00e9s\n- A few bad deus ex machina moments\n- Very slow, non-coordinated and sometimes frustrating combat\n- Mostly ininteresting level design with the exception of the flying circles but they get old fast\n- Uninteresting side quests\n- Somewhat uninteresting weapon/armor system\n\nOverall:\nI loved the game. It came at the right moment and gave me the spark I needed to restart work on my own projects and assured me that I am on the right track. However, I would prefer that we stop reusing Tolkien's ideas and start seeing more unique fantasy content.

It's atmosphere is so unique, it's soundtrack so well-fitting, seriously, I love this game. At my first hour playing this game i thought to myself: \"I'm gonna spend some time exploring new areas\" and when i noticed it already have passed 4 hours. I don't even know how much time i spent looking to the scenery but i can tell ya that it were time well spent.\n\nNow, to some good points:\n\n[*]RPGMaker (If you love RPGMaker games you can stop right here)\n[*]Scenery (It's overwhelming how rich of details were each of the game's areas)\n[*]Soundtrack (It's simply perfect)\n[*]Side-Quests (I'm a lover of completionism)\n[*]Story (The most important, Ara Fell's story is [b]SO[/b] rich in details and it is so well written.)\n\nNow, to the bad points:\n\n[*]Grinding (Which fun enough, you can totally forget as before you start your journey you can choose wether you want to fight enemies or not)\n\n\nTo summarize, this game is totally worth it's full price.\nNow, if you're into Fantasy Adventures, it's a must have.\n\nGod I love Lita", "timestamp_created": 1501096056, "timestamp_updated": 1501096214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33779826": {"recommendationid": "33779826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154127298", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500957533}, "language": "english", "review": "I don;t know how these work persay, but I wish to say ahead of time, please let this rate Very Positive.\n\nThe land of Ara Fell is a special place, groups of Islands floating in the sky for untold ages, families living in caves made into homes, nature and magic living in peace side by side. Of course such a lovely utopia can't go unspoiled forever and even though this is a review, I'm not spoiling the story, as this is the reason you are buying this game.\n\nThe Story is amazing, and for those who wish to experience it, the developer has included a \"story mode\" attack. It will, in essence, end any battles you encounter, and I would highly recommedn you choose to have it, not because the game is hard persay, in fact I find it pretty well balanced in terms of enemy strength vs player strength, but because there are times you want to get to the next story bit and it will make things much easier. The characters, not just the main cast but any npc who gets more then 2 boxes of dialogue feel very fleshed out and you'll fnd yourself agreeing with them many times. A lot of User Friendly features have been put in to help you get aquainted to the game world and how the game itelf works, and while some of them may feel a little hand holdy (The game will flat out warn you that your hitting a Point of No Return and offer to save, then offer to let you back out of continuing, but to its credit, it also lets you skip long cutscenes should you have died to a boss and are going back)\n\nIt's not perfect, as there are a few clear polish issues that I discovered, like difficulty in figuring out what was a decoration on the ground and what would actually heed my progress moving forward, towards the end of the game my character seemed to acquire the ability to jump when going horizontally (though there was a \"reset jumping\" option that may have fixed that that I never tried) and a large one in that I completed a side quest involving a old necklace and while the game informed me I'd gotten a new item, I had to stop playing shortly after and when I came back, I still had the old necklace and the quest giver was gone (i.e. quest completed)\n\nRegardless of the few bugs mentioned above, if you are or ever were a fan of JRPG's that didn't rely on shoving a world big enough to qualify as a GTA game, wish for a showing of how Narrative can be a bigger draw then combat, or just want to relive the days of old, Ara Fell will certainly scratch that itch.", "timestamp_created": 1500959600, "timestamp_updated": 1500959600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33759594": {"recommendationid": "33759594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038337141", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500875761}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is worth more than full price.

I also could not craft past tier 1 despite getting training.\n\nAnyway, I still think it's worth the money and it did keep me interested and entertained.

There are also a few times in which it's easy to get lost because the paths don't show up as obviously as they should.\n\nAll that said, if that's the worst I can say about a game, it's worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1499221479, "timestamp_updated": 1499221479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33217243": {"recommendationid": "33217243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009728815", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499110318}, "language": "english", "review": "This RPG game is one of the best RPG games (created with RPG maker) that I played.\nBut why is it good :?\n\n- The story is good and interesting to follow. \n- The music is much better than simple 16 bit sounds.

So many games nowadays seem to be shying away from solid, satisfying, grand endings, and this game doesn't.\n\nThis might count as an upside or a downside depending on the player, but I also found it very easy to break the combat system to the point that, a little over halfway through the game, I could just leave most random encounters on \"Auto\" and be confident of winning. I still appreciated the option to just turn combat off. More games should have that consideration.\n\nI would say my big con is that this is a game that it's pretty easy to get lost in. It can be hard to find out how to get to where you're supposed to go to next. Also, before you get a lot of fast travel points set up there is a lot of backtracking that can get pretty tedious - especially when often the only way to find out if you're not supposed to be somewhere yet is to wait for the enemies to squash you flat. You get a lot of sidequests early on that you're not supposed to do until much later. It took me a long time to find out how much later. \n\nStill, definitely a good find and a good experience.

It's pretty nice to see the complete game on Steam more than a decade later.\n\nWhat really impressed me when I played this originally were the graphics and atmosphere. Everyone who's tinkered with RPG Maker 2003 will recognize the famous REFMAP tilesets, and they're used extremely well here, with a lot of birds, butterflies and critters moving around the maps, which really gives this game an atmosphere which stands out among other RPG Maker projects. It's not the first RPG to use floating islands as a setting, but a lot of Ara Fell's quirks (people living in caves, vampire / elven designs in ruins...) contribute to making it more original.\n\nThe music is absolutely amazing. The theme that plays in the quarry caves (and some other places as well, but I heard it there first) is up there with all those SNES and PS1 classics.\n\nThe scenario is a bit different from what I remembered from the demo, but It's probably better now (although it still is about a chosen one fighting vampires, it's no longer rife with Buffy references, which is a good thing since it clashed a lot with the setting, on top of being very fanficsey). The writing is good and the characters likeable, even though the main antagonist feels a bit underdeveloped - I liked Vampire Lord Nash better.\n\nGameplay-wise it uses RPG Maker 2003's default battle system, which I pretty much despise (it tries to emulate Final Fantasy's ATB, but sadly it's extremely slow and clunky, it often interrupts you mid-action and the targeting is awful), although the dev tried to balance the stats / equipment (which is actually pretty rare in RPG Maker games) and make complex boss battles with a lot of special moves and scripted events, so that sweetens the pill. Thankfully, at the beginning of the game, you can also activate a special mode to give you a skill that rains 9999s on the battlefield, which helps with the grinding (I remember adding something like that to my characters whenever I tested RM2003 games, glad the dev thought ahead of me this time).\n\n+ Great visuals and atmosphere\n+ Excellent music\n+ Interesting boss battles\n+ \"Story mode\" which cuts on grinding\n\n- RM2003 default battle system (I [i]really[/i] don't like it)\n- Ending felt a bit rushed\n\n7/10 Despite engine-related woes, it's still leagues ahead of most other RPG Maker games that try to emulate SNES RPGs, and I recommend it if you're into that kind of thing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1498561587, "timestamp_updated": 1498561587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32838668": {"recommendationid": "32838668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045041723", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498583741}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun RPG that's very satisfying for an old-school RPG fan.

I cannot... Cannot... CANNOT GUSH OVER IT ENOUGH!\n\nIt truly is the perfect ending to this story, and gives the opportunity for a NEW beginning. Also.. Doren you saucy fella! Don't wanna give anything away for those that haven't played, but all I can say is, for someone who loves RPGs for their story, this story is complete. This story will make you smile, laugh, cry, go 'huh?', look askance, wonder, excited... satisfied and warm.\n\nThere's a meaning to it really. People, with a will, can always make a way out.\n\nHUGE shoutout to the game developer(s)! I'm still flabbergasted that my insignificant review has sparked this amazing turn. Cannot wait to try your other games!\n___________________________________________________________________________\nLemme just start out saying: Having a 'story mode' where you don't actually need to fight = ingenious. More often than not, RPGs are repetative, the same actions over and having to grind puts a damper on the story. It was great to be able to just go through easily and enjoy the true heart of RPGs, the storyline.\n\nThe music for the various areas was very, very suitable as well. For the last part, the music was so rousing that even my lazy self felt a sense of urgency to complete what had to be done.\n\nI have two main issues with the game:\n1. How certain areas are misleading. Lemme explain. Some areas, look like you can access it, yet a small twig sticking out from a tree blocks your way. Then swimming. In itself, is really cool. But having to try every body of water that has the sparkle, yet doesn't really let you go anywhere... It wouldn't be so bad if swimming was as fast as walking, but noooooo... =.=\n\n2. The ending.............. Look, many people play RPGs for the storyline. Folks naturally want closure. I don't wanna spoil anything, but lemme just say, I DID NOT get the closure I was seeking. \n\nAs such, I cannot in good standing, as someone who bought the game for the story, recommend it to anyone else who may want to buy it for the story. Oh, and I feel that this game really shouldn't be for kids. Maybe I'm too old-fashioned, but seeing characters actually being killed and 'blood'... I wouldn't want any kids I know playing this.\n\nJust my two cents worth.", "timestamp_created": 1496516655, "timestamp_updated": 1508253758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567078", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32088552": {"recommendationid": "32088552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014664861", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496245849}, "language": "english", "review": "A lovely little game.", "timestamp_created": 1496246060, "timestamp_updated": 1496246060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32080576": {"recommendationid": "32080576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347107781", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496210789}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing JRPG with an amazing storyline.

It had this whole \"Secret of Mana\" vibe with a tinge of \"Illusian of Gaia\" with it's text, it's gameplay semi resembled games like Breath of Fire and Final Fantasy, or even Treasures of the Rudras.\n\nThat all caught my eye and it stood out amongst the other RPG maker games out there, so I did a little more research. I checked the official YouTube video to see it's ratings. Good amount of views and good ratings usually mean people generally like the game. I then checked Steam reviews, not for the reviews themself, but for the average amount of time people had put into this game. I didn't want to buy a game that had like 2 hours of gameplay alone, I was looking for something that had more like 20+ hours, especially for an RPG. This game DOES have that apparently, based on the average amount of hours involved.\n\nSo, I bought Ara Fell and immediately ran into a problem. The game launched in a window instead of fullscreen which most games do immediately. This is fine, just really odd. The problem I ran into was that my corded Xbox 360 controller wasn't recognized and my keyboard couldn't control any of the keys... \n\nNot a good start for Ara Fell. I tried different USB slots thinking it could be the engine didn't detect USB 3.0 or something, nothing worked. I finally took to the game's steam forum and searched \"controller\" (which I shouldn't at all have to do, the game should work out of the box!) and found some work around with launching the game with new compatability settings (XP service pack 3).\n\nSo I finally launched the game and it worked fine with the controller, I was even able to set the game to fullscreen and stretch it's aspect ratio to fit my monitor; however, after playing a few minutes of the game, I immediately noticed input lag in some areas of the game. I have no idea what's causing this as my PC has updated hardware, enough to play higher-end games like Blizzard's \"Overwatch\" and Funcom's \"Conan Exiles\". My guess is the RPG Maker engine isn't optimized for \"Windows 10 64-bit, or the code within RPG maker isn't optimized, and thus, the game just lags. It could also be me running the game under that forum poster's suggestion of running the game with Windows XP Service Pack 3 compatability. \n\nPros\n+Beautiful music\n+Stunning sprite work\n+Lush thought-provoking story\n+Non-linear exploriation\n+Diverse crafting system\n+Storydriven Cutscenes\n+Rewarding Minigames\n\nCons\n-Work arounds are required to use controller and fix lag...\n-No diagional movement, can only move Up/Down/Left/Right.\n-No battle music, boss music, or fanfare themes.\n-Very laggy/almost not useable Crafting System.\n-Convoluted, frustrating, and esoteric map system.\n-No hotkeys for key features of the game, such as item menu, world map, or crafting menu.\n-Cannot Shift+Tab to open steam menu", "timestamp_created": 1494616577, "timestamp_updated": 1495134945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589195", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31698703": {"recommendationid": "31698703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052817358", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494497457}, "language": "french", "review": "Je n\u2019ai pas encore termin\u00e9 Ara Fell, mais je me permets d\u2019en faire une critique, car j\u2019ai perdu un peu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et je n\u2019ai pas un go\u00fbt incontr\u00f4lable de continuer ma partie. \n \nCe n\u2019est pas un mauvais jeu. Si vous \u00eates un habitu\u00e9 des jeux faits avec RPG Maker et que vous aimez le genre, vous ne serez pas extr\u00eamement d\u00e9\u00e7us. Ara Fell est quand m\u00eame bien. Cependant, ce jeu manque de finition. Par exemple : \n- Quand on passe de l\u2019exploration au combat ou inversement, la musique ne change pas. C\u2019est la m\u00eame, qui continue en boucle ;\n- Compte tenu que les musiques sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement calmes, voire endormantes, l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re stressante qu\u2019on est suppos\u00e9 ressentir en combat est totalement absente ; \n- Il n\u2019y a pas de fa\u00e7on de trier son inventaire. Les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont utilis\u00e9 une version de l\u2019engin qui ne le permettait pas et n\u2019ont pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019implanter cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 ;\n- Dans l\u2019inventaire, on retrouve des qu\u00eates, des tutoriaux, l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une carte et la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er des objets. Au lieu d\u2019avoir chacun leur menu propres, les d\u00e9veloppeurs se sont content\u00e9s d\u2019utiliser le menu d\u2019objets existant. Ainsi, on se retrouve rapidement avec un fouillis total dans un ordre al\u00e9atoire qu\u2019on ne peut pas classer ;\n- Les animations dans les combats sont tr\u00e8s de base, tout comme les sons qui vont avec. On dirait que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris tel que disponible dans l\u2019engin RPG Maker, sans grande modification. Cela enl\u00e8ve de la personnalit\u00e9 au jeu. \n\nCes points, pris s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, ne sont pas dramatiques. Toutefois, quand on regarde le jeu dans son ensemble, il perd un peu de sa personnalit\u00e9. \n\nBon, je ne serai pas de mauvaise foi, il y a aussi de bons points : \n- On peut sauvegarder partout et \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s n\u2019importe quand ;\n- Il y a un syst\u00e8me de personnalisation des personnages quand on monte de niveau (m\u00eame s\u2019il ne semble pas autant au point que dans les RPG occidentaux) ; \n- Les d\u00e9cors, pendant la phase d\u2019exploration, sont tr\u00e8s jolis (m\u00eame s\u2019ils sont tr\u00e8s r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs et que dans certains cas, on ne sait pas si la carte continue vers une autre zone ou s\u2019il y a un mur invisible).\n\nD\u2019accord! J\u2019ai peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 de mauvaise foi en glissant des d\u00e9fauts \u00e0 travers les points positifs! :-)\n\nBref, bien entendu, on ne s\u2019attend pas \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un jeu fait avec RPG Maker soit aussi bon que les classiques comme Chrono Trigger et Final Fantasy 6. Mais on s\u2019attend qu\u2019ils soient aussi bons que les jeux moyens qu\u2019il y avait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque comme Secret of the Stars ou 7th Saga. \n\nMais ce n\u2019est malheureusement pas le cas.

Still, it is the kind of music you would not mind to listen to also outside of the game.\n\nThe ending makes you wish for a sequel in this same world, maybe even with another group of heroes, maybe in another region or time. This to me means that the game is able to draw you into its world and make you care about it, which is rare.\n\nWell done to the developers!", "timestamp_created": 1494354563, "timestamp_updated": 1494354898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561856", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31596295": {"recommendationid": "31596295", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982784967", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508900778}, "language": "english", "review": "Pro:\n\"What do people on the ground think about this floating island and the dead bodies that rain from it?\"\n\nCon:\n(Lacks significant options menu.

The story is also both gripping and emotive, with characters that won't fail to elicit a reaction because there are very few characters are clear-cut good or evil, with you potentially pitying your adversaries and questioning your allies, while never failing to make its elements of subtle humor get a laugh.

Considering the variety of skills overall, I can give it a positive review, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nStory: 9/10- I was pleasantly surprised of the details of the story. All party characters were fleshed out very nicely and I definitely enjoyed the interactions between characters.\n\nDeveloper: 10/10- The reason the game won't get an overall 10/10 is due to the bugs, but I felt there should be a special note for how helpful and prompt Stegosoft was when I encountered a bug which would have negatively impacted my playthrough.

It's good. It's shorter and has less content, overall, than AAA titles from back in the day like Chrono Trigger or Secret of Mana, but it is still worth playing.\n\nLonger version; I mostly only have positive things to say about this game. The music is enjoyable; the songs are short and loop alot, but they are still good and I didn't find it annoying at any point. Obviously, as an RPG Maker game, it has sprite graphics and is pretty predictable, but it is done well and they tried to use alot of the available effects. The world is fairly large and detailed and very, very beautiful. The story is a little on the predictable side, but it's still heart-warming and funny and sad and everything I like my JRPGs to be. Characters have 5 stats to increase and 5 equipment slots, and a fair amount of equipment, so there's some depth to it, although again, it's not equivalent to a Final Fantasy. Combat is fairly hard early on, but gets easier. \n\nThis actually leds into one of the only complaints I have about this game; the pacing. Early on, you are given access to alot of places and fights you can't possibly win. Stores stock literally ALL of the pucrhaseable equipment right from the start. For crafting, you can make most stuff very early, and you can see everything you can make from the start as well, allowing you to plan around it. What this is all kind of means is, you aren't sure what you should do. I like having options in a game, but at the same time, the old standard of having new gear at every store kind of helps keep you on track. What I ended up doing here was muscling through the first chapter or so without spending hardly any money, and then I started buying the strongest armor available, one piece at a time. It was a bigger boost to get one piece of level 4 gear than getting several pieces of level 2 gear. But then you end up finding alot of mid-level gear in the game, so it really is just strange. The combat difficulty starts out moderately hard, then, it just gets easy, with an embarassingly east final boss. The story can feel that way too; sometimes it feels like you are taking FOREVER to get through one event, and sometimes it skips along too fast. It's a little bit unsatisfying near the end too, for various reasons, but the game really needed an epilogue. \n\nSo basically, like I said, it's a solid game. Bit short, almost completely lacking in any kind of replay value, but it was very worth playing. If the team behind it makes another game that's a little bit longer, a little bit more spread out with an even pace, they'll will have a fantastic title.

It would undoubtedly become an immortal classic loved by entire generation of players who to this day have great memories of \u201cChrono Trigger\u201d or \u201cFinal Fantasy\u201d series. You know how there are dozens of bad RPG Maker games trying to offer an epic fantasy story about saving the world, but fail miserably and laughably? \u201cAra Fell\u201d is a game those games want to become. It succeeds in almost every aspect and is one of the best retro-jRPG-style games I\u2019ve played.\n\nThe story is decent, characters are developed, battle is fun (and if you don\u2019t like the turn-based battles, you can just skip them!), graphics are gorgeous (and some of the animations and cutscenes amazing), music and sound effect great...\n\nHowever.\n\nThe game has its problems. Some of them are minor and I\u2019ll come back to them soon, but some are related to the core experience itself. The game starts with the most magical, beautiful areas, music and small-scale characters interactions which are all extremely cute and fun. But the further the game goes, the less risks it tries to take. Even at the beginning it uses some safe story clich\u00e9s such as \u201ca girl finds a magical (piece of jewelry) and becomes The Chosen One\u201d, but after some time it basically reminds you reading \u201cThe Grand List Of Console Role Playing Game Clich\u00e9s\u201d (you can Google it if you want). Sure, all of the implemented ideas are well thought out and everything is fine... But it\u2019s just fine. Fine and basic. If you are new to RPGs or have a huge amount of nostalgia, you\u2019ll be charmed, but if you are like me and you just love new, creative stories that make you Think, it\u2019s not what you\u2019ll find here.\n\nThe game overall uses a lot of weird RPG-Makerish ideas which don\u2019t have much sense for an outsider and don\u2019t help the experience at all. Why can we walk into every house and just rob citizen\u2019s chests, taking away their life savings? Why do so many characters just \u201cwalk in one place\u201d (it\u2019s a basic RPG Maker way of symbolizing \u201cthe character does something but we can\u2019t animate it\u201d... but it looks really bad), even on trees? Why is the game filled with random encounters which demand you repeat the same fight 10, 20, 30 times? Why are there crafting mechanics if you can find, get or buy most of the powerful armors and weapons anyway? \n\nYou also need to get ready for not being able to make any significant choice considering the plot \u2013 the game is not only very linear, but also has one and only one version of story to offer, what is very common in jRPG world, but for western RPG players it may be rather weird. You need to know that you don\u2019t play this game to participate in the story, but to spectate it. \n\nThere are some minor bugs but the major problem I had was the annoying repetition of music. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the music itself is mostly fine, sometimes great, but there is not enough of it to fill entire 15-16 hours of gameplay. Sometimes you are going to explore an area for an hour or so and you\u2019ll keep listening the same minute of tunes over and over again, to the point you\u2019ll start getting insane. I\u2019m autistic so it didn\u2019t bother me As Much, but when my girlfriend was sitting nearby she made me wear headphones since she was \u201cgetting crazy\u201d (her words) from this music. The game definitely needed variety and this aspect sort of spoils the experience.\n\nOne of the redeeming features is that the game is very player-friendly. You can build your characters\u2019 statistics by yourself and if you think you made a bad job, you can reset them and try again thanks to NPCs located in many convenient places. You are almost always close to a friendly merchant and trading itself is very easy and accessible. One of the greatest tools is the so-called \u201cstory mode\u201d feature \u2013 you can turn it on to give your characters a special ability that instantly kills your enemies, so if you\u2019re not enjoying some of the fights or are tired of grinding, you can just quickly roll with it and oneshot your path through. The game remind you to save before any major encounter and allows you to skip some of the cutscenes as well as just walk away and postpone the fight. The characters regenerate outside-of-battle very fast and you can sometimes find special monuments explaining how strong your party should be before fighting in a new area. I love how convenient and comfortable playing this game is.\n\nEven if you are not a part of the core target of \u201cAra Fell\u201d, I want to make one thing perfectly clear \u2013 this game would be absolutely great for a 10-13 year old kid (as long as he or she has an open mind and can accept a game with unrealistic graphics). It has some creative, creepy imagery, but nothing terrifying. A difficulty level isn\u2019t very high for an experienced gamer, but for a person new to this kind of entertainment it can be quite challenging. I think this game would be a perfect gift for a young person \u2013 and I\u2019m sure I would absolutely love it with my whole heart if I could play it when I was 10 (...and if I magically would learn English back then ; )). I just wish the game would be less nostalgic and more creative, but it\u2019s really good nevertheless.

Prepare for a wall of text...\n\nI got pretty hooked to this game, it's pretty good. Story is a bit cliche, but the beautiful graphics and combat made up for it. It's like an indie game version of Final Fantasy 6, except that it's not as grand or as character driven (but that's just me setting high standards; FF6 was full of pretty deep character development after all). Most of the music here are so-so, but some soundtracks are pretty unique and catchy.\n\nThe story is a \"Chosen One\" sort of story, which has been done to death. I came to this game having high expectations (people were praising it and I thought I was gonna have the same experience as FF6), and was pretty disappointed. To me, I hold the character development of an RPG to a really high regard; but for Ara Fell, please don't have high expectations like I did lol.\n\nSPOILERS FOR STORY BELOW\n[spoiler]I didn't care much for Lita (probably because of my biasness; I'm not a fan of kids being chosen ones; but considering the dev started this 14 to 15 years ago where this kind of archetype was probably popular I'll let it slide). But she was way less annoying than a lot of kid protagonists, and she was pretty reasonable at times (as well as her emotions) so I'll give her that. (I do like how her relationship with her dad went though)\nI was interested in Adrian and how he deals with his general relationships with other people besides Lita, but the game didn't really expand upon his past or his own development or anything--just his feelings for Lita. And even when they got to that, it's kinda...anticlimatic.\nHis design can be a bit jarring at times; he's a pretty face with tank stats and I get that the dev might wanna make it a contradictory character design thing but it doesn't work that well. I am a big fan of his skills though.\n\nI do like Doren and Seri more though. I admit that when I finished the game I was sad that the game didn't expand much on their arcs or development either(especially Seri; where did her snarky, cynical personality come from and what happened between the two of them exactly?), but whatever interactions they have with each other and other people, I really liked it. I wanted more of that. Doren as a playable character is especially refreshing; unlike Adrian, his design actually works quite well with him, and his clear role as a healer complements well with his personality.\n\nI wanted more Talani, too. Even though I pretty much predicted she's an elf and her involvement in the end was kinda contrived, I loved her personality and she really grew on me.\n\nThe plot itself...well, I was expecting an epic plot twist or something, but I got a pretty solid linear story with a few good (though predictable) twists. Despite some cliche moments, overall it's still pretty neat, so I'll take it.\n\nHowever, there is a trump card that made me really invested; Nash's final battle. Though the dialog's attempts to make Nash's scene emotional didn't really faze me a lot, his sprites during battle were the one that actually made me feel a lot more than the usual cutscenes or character deaths. Me as a player, I'm beating him up as usual with the 4 party members, when his sprite changes. And as my party members beat him up even more, his sprite gets more and more devastated and more gory, and it made me feel so bad, and made me remember his intentions and his tragedies of losing his brethren. But I had to beat him, and it really tugged on my heartstrings. So kudos to the developer for using a normal RPG battle to invoke such a powerful scene to players to really feel for this character as he battles to his end.\n\nThe ending was really anticlimatic...I get that the dev is making an epilogue, and that the story is fully complete and perfect and came full circle, but...it was seriously anticlimatic. Please add one ASAP or I will never rest in peace dev!! :0\n[/spoiler]\n\nEven though story and character development wise it's not among my top 5 favorites, the combat system takes many flaws that old school RPGs had and threw them out of the window. (I mean, I wouldn't know much since it's been a long while since I played an old school RPG besides FF6) For one thing, the strategy is pretty straightforward and not overly complicated, the Auto feature is added which is really useful at times for people who just don't feel like doing combat, and a Story mode is added, which is really good for casual players who have no time to go through the combat to enjoy the story (we're all busy folks in the 21st century lol. I didn't go through Story mode though). The enemies, compared to FF6 where enemies can randomly appear, can be seen and easily avoided; and even if you touched them you can still easily escape, which is amazing considering the fact that past RPGs can be painful due to the complexity of whether you can escape or not, lol.\n\nI also do like how Adrian always gets a turn first so that players can either flee or cast Reflection(though it can be boring for players who want a challenge).\n\nNon combat wise, I really like how the game always nicely reminds you to save before a big scene. To me, it helps a lot; a great improvement from the usual old school RPG games where it was frustrating to go into a big scene while forgetting to save. It's also really nice that you can save anytime, too.\nSide quests are varied, plenty and really bring out the world of Ara Fell, so I'm happy with them too.\n\nAs for flaws, the waiting time for combat can be pretty long at times.\nI was kinda disappointed that there wasn't much strategy in terms of elements, about how ice sprites are incredibly damaged by fire and all that; sometimes basic, cliche strategies can work very well too. But that's just a small complaint of mine.\n\nMap wise, it's ok. Though the almost hidden stone sprites at the final battle made me get stuck at times, and though some paths that I thought could be explored lead to nowhere, all in all it's really good. I love the weather change, the little details they have, the animals, the exploration and getting to treasure chests and all that. The sprite work is detailed and beautiful; I can tell a lot, a LOT of effort has been put into that.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty solid game that got me really hooked and moderately invested (again, high expectations).\n\nFinal Verdict:\nStory: 7/10\nCharacters: 5/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1493311946, "timestamp_updated": 1493311946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31389815": {"recommendationid": "31389815", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968685726", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493210205}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game.

I was intrigued by it and waited for it to go on sale, and that's when I bought it. But Ara Fell is more than worth its full price of $10.\n\nPros:\n+This game's charm level is off the charts. It is very polished and the world it creates is beautiful.\n+Characters are likeable and fun. The dialogue is very well-written and the story is captivating. It plays off of typical fantasy elements (elves, dwarves, humans, vampires, etc.) but does so in a way that doesn't feel too cliche.\n+The ending. I wasn't expecting it and it was very good.\n+The action bar battle system is nice.\n+The game is suitably long. It gives you your money's worth without becoming boring.\n+Lots of fun side quests.\n+Boss fights are really fun.\n+Most battles are avoidable and there are no random encounters.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the battles get repetitive. It seems that there are only a few different patterns of enemies that show up in each area, and once you learn the optimum way to defeat them, battles become a little tedious. There is an auto mode, but it doesn't skip the battle; it simply plays it for you. There is also a story mode which (from what I understand; I didn't use it) skips battles completely.\n-The game felt too easy to me. I did complete most of the side quests (which give you experience), so I think I was higher level than I should have been for most of the game, but even still...I almost never felt concerned that I would lose in a battle. The one exception to that is when I would venture into a side quest that involved killing a boss which heavily out-leveled me. But I just came back later and beat it. The upside of this is that grinding is unnecessary.\n\nDon't let the fact that this is an RPGMaker game turn you away.

The world is genuinely beautiful, and it's a pleasure to explore.\n\nTight, enjoyable combat coupled with a great score and charming graphics make this a JRPG you probably shouldn't miss if you're a fan of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1492534690, "timestamp_updated": 1492534834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31212417": {"recommendationid": "31212417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061766827", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491519814}, "language": "english", "review": "I came across this game the other day while looking for a good RPG Adventure Story to play.

The story and the backing of the story is well thought out, they keep me intrigued and wondering \"whats going to happen next?\". \n\nLita stole my heart instantly. I hate damsels in distress. I love that she's headstrong and can stand up for herself but at times can still be worried and crying about what she has to do. It makes her feel real. Something else that strongly attracted my attention and amused me greatly was the portraits of the characters when they are talking. I think that it was Genius to add their facial expressions with their daialogue. \n\nThe ability to play \"story mode\" and not have to fight is a genius idea! Sometimes you just want to know what is going to happen without having to grind night and day to move forward in a game.\n\nThe one thing that did take a bit of me getting used to was the combat system.

I'm not done with it yet but I'm (I think) probably 70% done and will finish it with relish. I'm 32 years old and grew up playing the likes of Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger and while Ara Fell isn't in the same scope as multi-million dollar projects of that kind it absolutely deserves to stand with them in terms of simple craft. I get ticked off extremely easily at JRPG writing, design, and gameplay, and Ara Fell not only avoids all of the ordinary pitfalls of workman-level attempts at this problematic genre, it transcends them to achieve something quite unlike anything I've played before; a synthesis of Zelda-like exploration and tight, miniamlistic, refined JRPG combat with a free-form leveling system and a crafting system that give just enough player choice to be enjoyable without being overbearing. The game isn't hard for an old master like me, I got ahead of the difficulty curve early on and stayed there, but for players less experienced with the genre it should provide just the right level of challenge, and the joy and excitement of finding hidden items and defeating increasingly difficult encounters shines through as well as it does in the genre's classics. This game has my highest possible recommendation and it deserves the support of everyone who ever enjoyed a JRPG.\n\nA special commendation goes to the game's writer(s), who are unquestionably the most talented JRPG writers working in the genre today; the dialogue manages to stay short and punchy while simultaneously achieving emotional depth and avoiding the worst of the genre's tropes, and the plot and setting will be comfortable and homelike to any fan of fantasy without quite falling into a strict formula.

The fighting is pretty straight forward did find out if you don't focus the rainbow cat you basically insta lose cause your attack meter never goes up after their earth attack. Also dissappointing the basic attacks from enemies are just they glow and your char explodes. . . could have some more animtions.(maybe they'll add later idk?)

The story is interesting and I've found it to be much more addicting than I expected.  The game play isn't super complicated, but for me at least, it makes it sort of relaxing and doesn't distract from the story. I also really like the colors scheme and I think the soundtrack is fantastic.  There are a number of handy quality of life components, like prompts to save before bosses and notifications when you're crossing irreversable points, that also contribute to the relaxing feel and enhance enjoyment (for me personally).\n\nMy largest critique is that the random creeps are fairly repetitive but the leveling system still feels pretty rewarding. I think the rewards for defeating bosses are substantial enough, it prevents you from having to do a lot of grinding if you just naturally play through the story.  Bosses are the opposite of the random enemies, each one so far is fairly unique and thought out. They fit well within the story, and that increases the satisfaction of defeating them.\n\nOverall, I think the game is a great value. It's cute and amusing that makes a nice diversion from life.

In fact, it conjures what even many million-dollar projects can't seem to get down - a sense of intimacy and real character. \n\nThere's something about 16-bit RPGs that feels inherently nostalgic, no matter how modern or updated in style. And in that vein, Ara Fell definitely feels \"modern\" (despite originating more than ten years ago) compared with those SNES classics, with its increased emphasis on atmosphere and an \"open world\" sensibility. \n\nThe story is adorable - but it's the exploration, and sheer sense of atmosphere - the birds and creatures fluttering about, the ambient sound effects, the attention-to-detail on every map - that make this experience great (and distinct from many retro games).\n\nI'm probably among the minority of jRPG fans that doesn't love the number-crunching grinding fair, which is also why I appreciate Ara Fell. The character-writing feels sharp and believable, even with the game's NPCs. Lita is a sarcastic, excitable anime archetype, without ever becoming too obnoxious or contrived. The art design feels truly \"floating\" and vividly otherworldly, despite the occasionally generic map tiles. The soundtrack is completely original, and likewise adds to the majestic/fantasy aesthetic. \n\nI discovered this game many years ago now; and I've always been inspired by it. Having tried my hand in RPGMaker personally, I know the incredible patience and time-commitment it requires to deliver even a halfway-competent experience.

For a long time, the game was abondoned. It had a remake in progress which never got finished. However, in 2016, the project was back and completed. And oh boy was it worth it.\n\nAra Fell is definetly what it promises to be, a throwback to older rpgs. Of course, as a 16 year old who hasn't played that many games before the playstation era, I wouldn't know that too well and I can't exactly call it ''nostalgia''. But one thing is for sure; if this came out back then, it would probably be revolutionary. Anyway, I'm just mumbling. Let's get onto the actual review.\n\nAra Fell's most outstanding aspect is the graphics. It uses a free stock asset pack, and it uses it well (Ps: Do keep in mind that there are customs in there, but made to match the style of the pack. Some examples would be the blue crystals or the battlers.) Mapping is where it really stands out, as Ara Fell's world feels detailed and large while also being a good enough size to leave you time to explore as you play along. It honestly feels like an island in the sky, and can crete atmosphere just using maps. The rpg maker 2003 engine (which is what the game is made in, fyi) has a lot of limits, and Ara Fell cleverly pushes those limits to their limits with fully animated battle skills, a crafting system and a level up mechanic that lets you increase whatever stats you wish to increase. \nThe story is not the best thing out there. It's fairly cliche, but the really well written, humorous dialogue definetly makes up for it. Usually, what causes me to drop most long games is that I'll get stuck or end up in a situation where I have to backtrack a lot. Ara Fell makes sure that doesn't happen with quick travels (which should probably be a thing in every rpg tbh) and its length of 15 hours is just about perfect.\nThe game's music is pretty neat. It doesn't have a lot of tracks, but the few it does have are quite good. There's one battle theme that I found great. It is titled ''Ara Fell Final Boss'' in the files, though in the game it's not actually used for the final boss (A shame, because it's actually much better than the final boss theme we get.)\nThe game has few flaws, but none that make the game ''not worth playing''. The most minor thing is a few graphical glitches here and there. There's a few scenes where the character gets cut-off by tiles that should be below her, but are above instead. The more major flaw of Ara Fell is the battles. At first, the battles start out difficult, but once you're done with the first chapter or so it becomes much more easier. In a game, the battles should go from easy to hard, not from hard to easy. There's one quest where you have to defeat a bunch of enemies in the area, and without using the easy insta kill option (The game asks you if you want it at the beginning if you want the insta kill option if you just wanna get on with the story instead of spending time on battles, though you can just choose not to use it during battle) it's quite a pain. I really appreciated how quick the game was in healing you though. If you walk a few steps you'll recover hp, and I really liked that.\n\nThis has been kind of a short one, but Ara Fell has very few bad sides and is overall a game that's really worth buying. The price is just about perfect, if not a little too cheap. You should really give it a try if you enjoy rpgs.\n\nPS: If you come across a shop that lets you upgrade your skills, get Elemental Burst ALL.

This game is a tribute to the good old jRPGs and I highly encourage all the fans of these games to play this one. The graphics and music are superb (the only thing I would improve are character portraits), the story is well-done, the characters and their dialogues well-done (there were a few moments when I really couldn't stop laughing). \n\nThe only things I would like added to this game is even more story. [spoiler] I would like to see more of Nash's story and perhaps an attempt to mend fences with him. I actually really liked the twist in which vampires were born out of lust for power and then ended up just wishing for a cure. I think that Baramon's potential was also not fully used and I would have loved to see what made him the way he was. The moment the Sunstone was being uncovered I actually started thinking that perhaps it was not a stone, but Goddess's power sealed within a living being that Baramon once cared for and wanted to set free.

I saw a lot of ugly and sloppy designed RPG-Maker games here on Steam. This is a refreshing change. Also, it took more than just a few hours to finish. Again, unlike other similar games found here.\n\nOn the negative side: The grinding unfortunatelly was kind of annoying, I don't like this kind of thing. A matter of taste, anyhow. And I was disappointed that on most of the occasions where the character was able to swim, the path lead nowhere, not even to a bit of loot.\n\nBut all in all good work.

For me the story is the most important thing I care about such games, and I was not disappointed.\n\nHowever, imo, the battle system wasn't optimal. Firstly, the INTEL stat is much more superior than the ATTACK stat, for all classes (excluding the fist part of the game when you haven't got much MP). It is rarely worth wasting a turn to simply \"attack\". Spells do much more damage (even for the figher and archer) and scale 2 times more with INTEL. With enough MP you will rarely ever run out of MP to cast. And of course, INTEL also gives magic resist.\nMy suggestion would be to simply remove/reduce the INTEL scaling of these classes.\nAlso, the \"Elemental burst\" spell is too powerfull, and if u raise the MP of the mage, and craft the armor that halves the MP cost, then you can annihilate everything with ease at the mid-end phase of the game, with just the two elemental burst spells (the ALL and ONE). That makes the mage too monotonus, and the other elemental spells are rarely ever used. All the other classes have a good diversity, with various useful spells.\n\nLastly, the battles at the mid-late game were all very easy (possibly because of these elemental bust spells). Also, I didn't like the increasing \"reset level\" cost, because it made me nervous when i was thinking to use it.\n\nBut despite these flaws, this game is a gem amongst rpg-maker games.

As someone who has loved  RPG games since Final Fantasy 1 (would have liked ultima and wizardry too if I had a computer back then but I was just a poor single parent kid), I have played many over the years, and this one is clearly a homage to the SNES type.\n\nFirst off, while I wouldn't call the music to be like Seiken Densetsu 3, it has some elements of it and instrumentation (sometimes)...something NO other game I've played really has (at least not the same elements this one has). Which is great because I really like the bgm in that game, even more than some of the cult faves like chrono trigger.\n\nThe map design detail is frankly better than any of the commercial snes games I recall. The whole floating sky thing with snow lightly drifting melting into rivers that drift off the floating island virtually everywhere you go is really sweet. You know that feeling you get when you enter shevat for the first time in xenogears or whtaever? The whole game is like that kinda, and the whole thing looks good, it doesn't taper off after the first chapter or whatever, or have noticeably less effort.\n\nThe characters are enjoyable. Lita is something like Estelle from Trails in the sky, Seri-...uhh. I suck with names. Seri-whats her face feels like a real person. I mean...she basically says the things you think ought to be said that never get said in rpg games, and then she says it and you're like THANK YOU. I particularly liked it when she interrogates someone on their romantic escapades because I was thinking just earlier on 'gee that guy really gets around, I'm surprised someone doesn't call him out'.. welp he does.\n\nThe combat system is passable, nothing to write home about imo, but I'm pretty hard to please in that catagory. for example I never really thought chrono trigger had a great combat system either. I would say this one is pretty similar (the whole position th ing in chrono trigger is really fluff imo, line/circle attacks play little role past early game imo, and you can't position your characters anyway so blah). But I imagine people disagree because while I think CT was a good game, I'd say it's a bit over-rated... I think it's due to being one of the earliest rpg games many people have played along with ff7, cuz it came out at around the same time, so there are nostalgia sunglasses going on there.\n\nThe length of this game is prob about 10-15 hours (I clocked 15 but I had to afk for a couple no doubt, I was taking my time but wasn't trying to grind, and I avoided a lot of fights later on.. like pretty much as many as I could), which isn't bad given the price, but I have to say the introduction video really makes the game look like an epic 60+ hour thing like trails in the sky... it's not... I mean I know the devs never said it was, but that video really makes it look like one. Great intro video btw.\n\nI feel like the ending was a bit rushed though.. I can't really elaborate without spoiling anything. i mean the final dungeon is well detailed and long, but the enemy variety in it gets tiresome pretty quick, and the final boss is pretty tank and spank which is strange since like the first 3 had special mechanics somewhat. Plus there is a huge opportunity to have meaningful dialogue between many new faces near the end and they're gone as soon as you meet them and it feels kinda like you get cheated.\n\nI feel like the end also sets the world up for a bigger sequel, which I would welcome, I would certainly buy and play it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485768792, "timestamp_updated": 1485768792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29515535": {"recommendationid": "29515535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040938858", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485494668}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good, had fun playing the whole game :]\n\nLooks good, fairly good music, nice characters, funny at times..

So good that the creator had to remind me 10 times or so to leave a review (but that's because I'm terrible at remembering this kind of thing, not any aspersion against the game.)\n\nI've followed the game since it's conception, way back in the early 'noughties', and the charm it exudes has been present from day 1. The characters, the world, the atmosphere... all come together very well in order to create a cohesive picture. \n\nThe graphics are a combination of the ever-beloved REFMAP (aka Mack and/or Looseleaf) graphics and edits/custom tiles. They are bright, beautiful and work well together to present the land of Ara Fell to the player. Many lighting effects are in use (some a little non-sensical... really BL, you should know better! ;p ) but it's easy to lose yourself in the game due to the atmosphere and setting.\n\nSound is great from what I did hear, though nothing stuck in my mind that much (I'm terrible at noticing music unless it's earwormy. Sorry!)\n\nThe cast is endearing - Lita is handled especially well and is a firebomb of emotion who steals the show. She's bright, sarcastic, independent, childish and is treated well by her creator. She is strong, but isn't afraid to show her emotions - fear and uncertainty, determination and sadness, joy and condescension. She's multi-faceted and her struggle is shown off quite well. The other characters move to her beat, but are not drowned out by it, finding a good balance of time spent on each. \n\nGameplay involves a lot of exploration and battling. There are on-map skills that are needed to find all the treasure in the game, as well as optional bosses and side-quests aplenty. Enough optional content exists to enjoy for those who prefer that kind of thing (like me!) Battles start off a bit slow, but as your characters grow stronger, they get faster, however they never become a complete cake-walk despite that.\n\nCharacter growth is determined by weapons, skills and personalisation. You can choose on each level up where stat points are placed, customising your team to how you like, taking advantage of the different spell components required for better abilities. Skills rely on your stats to be more or less useful, so choosing spells that coincide with your build is necessary. There are enough skills to allow for various build types (I personally turned who should have been the main magic user into a one-hit slayer with the use of a particular optional weapon and increasing only strength and defense skills. Fun times were had by me~) \n\nFrankly, this is some of the best that RPG Maker has to offer, so if you'd like to look at what the engine can do, check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1485140391, "timestamp_updated": 1485140391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581630", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29433745": {"recommendationid": "29433745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008966025", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485126713}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty solid little RPG. The battle system has a little variance from the traditoinal JRPG. Your health recovers out of combat and you regain MP each turn, so you end up really using all your skills. Also, you assign skill points with each level, so you can trick out your team. Music was good. Visuals were very nice. Story was pretty good, if a little predictable (though I didn't see the ending coming). Some of the UI is wonky (questlog, crafting, and the world map are all special items in your inventory), but perfectly functional. Um, combat occurs when you touch an enemy on the map, which is never my favorite, but it worked well for this. There's quite a few side quests to find and they give really rewarding bonuses, which I thought was cool.\n\nI guess my only gripe is that there's a plethora of enemies of each map (which I usually went systematically through), so it can feel a little grindy. I guess, though, this strategy was a choice on my part and, since encounters are contact based, a sneakier player could have avoided it.\n\nAnywho, really enjoyed it overall.

The game is not perfect by any means, but if you can forgive a battle system that isn't terribly showy, it's a fun adventure.  I've only just started, but the writing is good.  It's not an immersive game, but it is self aware, funny, and likes to play with the tropes of the genre.  I'm also a sucker for worlds set in floating islands.  If there are any recycled assets from a cookie cutter spread sheet, I'd be hard pressed to find them here, as every character, even nameless ones, have a portrait for talking, fairly distinct sprites, and even a little portrait animation here and there.\n\nThe game is lacking a bit in the showiness as battles aren't slow, but the character animation seems to be a bit sluggish and without pizazz.  Also, no battle music except for bosses.  It's a bit jarring to fight moon cats while the same peaceful choral forest theme plays in the background that loops over and over again.  Good thing the music itself is good.\n\nArafell is a game I recommend as someone who loves JRPGs, but not RPGmaker games.  It's got pretty good writing, a beautiful world to explore, and some nice modern conveniences like showing you where quest items go, warning you before entering areas and giving you save reminders, and teleport gates.

Jahren - habe ich RPG-Maker Games wie \"Vampires Dawn\" und andere gespielt und diese Perlen haben mich seinerzeits echt begeistert.\n\nDar\u00fcber hinaus habe ich mich selber einmal an einem RPG-Maker Game versucht und kann deshalb nachempfinden was f\u00fcr eine immense Arbeit dahinter steckt - vor allem wenn man \u00fcber das \"Standard\"-Material hinausgehen m\u00f6chte, was einem der RPG-Maker bietet.\n\nKommen wir aber zu Ara Fell ... ich habe bisher \"nur\" ca. 5 Stunden gespielt (zum Zeitpunkt der Review) und habe gerade mit \"Chapter 2\" angefangen und bisher muss ich dem Spiel ein sehr gro\u00dfes Lob aussprechen. Die Liebe zum Detail und die M\u00fche die hier in alle Ecken reingesteckt wurde ist Wahnsinn. Hier hat jemand sehr lange und ausgiebig dran gearbeitet.\n\nGameplay:\nEs handelt sich um ein klassisches RPG im weitesten Sinne wie fr\u00fche Final Fantasy Teile, Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, etc... eben alte SNES Klassiker. Entsprechend findet man hier alles was das Herz begehrt:\n\n- wundersch\u00f6ne Pixel-Retro Grafik\n- eine unfassbar detaillierte Umgebung\n- tolle Soundkulissen, Musik, etc...\n- haufenweise Texte (nur in englischer Sprache)\n- liebevoll designte Charaktere\n- viele selbst erstellte Grafiken\n- etliche zus\u00e4tzliche Systeme (Level Up-System, Oberwelt-Map, \"Quest\"-Log, etc... welche nicht standardm\u00e4\u00dfig durch den RPG-Maker gestellt werden\n\nDie Story vom Spiel ist bisher sehr sch\u00f6n erz\u00e4hlt und durchaus etwas anderes als die \u00fcblichen \"Szenarien\". Man bewegt sich auf einem \"Land\", welches in den Wolken schwebt. Somit gibt es endlos viele Br\u00fccken und Wasserf\u00e4lle die ins Endlose fallen. Man kann im Hintergrund und der Innenarchitektur oft sogar auf den weit entfernten \"Boden\" schauen. Ich konnte auch einen Blick auf die \"Ingame-Map\" werfen und die Oberwelt scheint riesig zu sein - es scheint also als h\u00e4tte man in diesem Spiel Einiges(!) zu tun.\n\nAm Schluss kann ich diese kleine Perle hier jedem Fan von klassischen rundenbasierten RPG's ans Herz legen. Ihr solltet aber der englischen Sprache einigerma\u00dfen gut m\u00e4chtig sein um alles im Spiel zu verstehen.\n\n-----\n\nAlle Game-Reviews von mir in meinem [url=steamcommunity.com/id/skorkwb/recommended/]<< Review Bereich >>[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1483901876, "timestamp_updated": 1514676645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29110105": {"recommendationid": "29110105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128665251", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484017037}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very fun game.

I am thrilled that today the game is now released, streamlined and refined. It uses RM2K3 (which some idiot thinks is cheapskate - but that does not take from the charm of the game, in fact it reminds me of Secret of Mana, that's exactly the style it needs to go for). Back in the days, me and many others used this game to learn about such things as game design, creative writing etc. and here's to hope this cute little game, now one of many on a saturated indie market, inspires a new generation of devs as it inspired the last.\n\nThe characters are refined, relatable, interesting. Exposition is a little heavy-handed, with a couple of bad writing points (the archery contest is particularly cringy, as the rules seem to change as the scene goes) but it's much better than the 2007 version. The story, while I am afraid probably short or at least not much beyond the original game, is engaging. It's more of a visual novel, though it has good RPG elements to match. Obviously, the graphics is where the game shines. As far as 16bit goes this is beautiful. This game features an almost open world, too - no world map here, you literally walk from one area to the next. This amazed me as a kid, and this is still appreciated today. Now, of course the story is nothing ground breaking, but it's likable and fun, which is more than I can ask of many AAA games today.\n\nGame design isn't too bad either, RM2K3 is far superior in this respect than RMXP/VX even with custom scripts. While there has been some effort in streamlining progression since 2005, it often feels a little hapless. Case in point : The first boss -literally- requires you to grind to reach it, though.  The first boss has an attack that can prevent you from using abilities (Thunder does that), and has a pattern you need to understand but too often you can't actually beat the pattern unless you've grinded quite a bit beyond what it says are the level requirements.\n\nOther minor cons would involve all of the quests etc. dumped into the inventory.

Versteht mich nicht falsch, das Spiel ist gut und geh\u00f6rt definitiv zu den besseren Vertretern kommerzieller RPG-Maker-Titel, aber ich habe schon bessere Maker-Games gespielt und getestet. Das Einzige was Ara Fell wirklich hervorhebt, sind die selbst kreierten, liebevollen Grafiken und der wirklich tolle Soundtrack. Gerade die Trailer-Melodie hatte mich dann auch \u00fcberzeugt mir das Game im Sale zuzulegen. Bereut habe ich es nicht, aber abseits des audiovisuellen Aspekts, sollte man nicht mehr erwarten, als von anderen Maker-RPGs gewohnt. Kleinere positive Eigenheiten wie die Semi-Open-World werden halt auch wieder durch \u00e4rgerliche M\u00e4ngel wie das schlechte Schwierigkeitsgrad-Balancing ausgeglichen. Unterm Strich ist es ein gutes Spiel f\u00fcr Freunde von klassischen JRPGs. Nicht mehr, aber auch nicht weniger.\n\n\nPro und Kontra:\n\nPro:\n- hervorragender, speziell f\u00fcr dieses Spiel komponierter Soundtrack\n- selbsterstellte Grafiken, also keine Maker-Tilesets und -Sprites, mehrere Aufl\u00f6sungsstufen\n- gewohnt unkomplizierte Steuerung mit Controller-Support\n- keine Zufallsk\u00e4mpfe, Gegner k\u00f6nnen leicht umgangen werden\n\nNeutral:\n- Handlung und Charaktere sind ganz gut, aber das Spiel l\u00e4sst gegen Ende einige Fragen offen und bietet keinen vern\u00fcnftigen Epilog\n- das Gameplay ist zwar Grundsolide, bietet jedoch abseits einiger Kleinigkeiten nicht wirklich etwas besonderes\n- 10 \u20ac f\u00fcr max. 15 Stunden Spielzeit\n\nKontra:\n- das Balancing des Schwierigkeitsgrades wirkt nicht sonderlich gut ausgereift\n- das st\u00e4ndige Nachhaken, ob man denn nicht speichern m\u00f6chte ist sehr nervig und irritierend\n- es gibt kein Questlog, aktive Quests werden als Gegenst\u00e4nde im regul\u00e4ren Inventar abgelegt, WTF!", "timestamp_created": 1478361330, "timestamp_updated": 1495648453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26422652": {"recommendationid": "26422652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995744404", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478123121}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't do many reviews, cause my grammar and spelling sucks, but I always write one, when I play a totally underated gem. You can bash me later.\n\nI haven't played any games on RPGMaker 2k3 for the last 10 years until now. This game proves that even after 10 years, that style of RPG can be still more enjoyable than modern RPGs.\n\n\nWARNING: Major Spoilers may appear after Gameplay and Music Section Review\n\n\n\nGameplay:\nI really loved how I had a main quest and instead of following the main route, I prefered to explore the map and as many locations as possible, looted everything and did all side quests. The battle system is very nice especially in boss fights, when special events occur and you have to fight under new circumstances. Additionally, crafting system was innovative and easy to understand. I loved the puzzles, solving riddles to advance, however what I disliked was the repeated search of the keys for the next rooms or the let's go a long walk to active this button, then the whole way back and to another button the same loooong way, would have preferred more puzzles though. The auto-save reminder came helpful at the beginning, but as you progress the story it starts to get annoying, because after I've always saved, when I was expecting a boss fight, it popped up and asked me to save again. (Didn't found it to turn it off, overlooked it maybe). One of my favourite mechanics in this game and that was really something else and I have to mention and praise it, that you can f***ing crawl, swim, jump and fly! You see that rarely in a RPGMaker game with those features.\n\n\nMusic:\nSimply wow. It had everything, calm chilling forest music until thrilling boss battle themes. I really loved the music, it fit so well in every aspect and scene.\n\nWARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS STARTING HERE\n\n\nStory:\nLittle Girl finds a ring, gets the quest to save the elven race, enemies are vampires and one plot twist after another. The beginning was sold so well, as the story advanced it kept me further going. I really didn't want to stop playing this game or try to play another one in between. Finished the game in one go with sleeping to the next day included. I wish the story could have had more content, but I'm satisfied how it is. I assume there won't be a sequel, so I'm not treating this ending as a potential cliffhanger. It's an open end and many things are still unsolved like why did Baramon even create vampires, why was Lita really chosen and succeeded (even many before tried to lift the curse and failed). My theory is still that she has the inner goddess inside her, but that's just my conspiracy. Why was Ara Fell even in the Sky? (laughed at the pun when Ara litereally Fell)\n\n\nCharacters & Design:\nWhen I saw all the characters, which would have been in my party I just thought \"urgh, I don't like them except Lita.\" In the end I loved them all. There is so much character development in each of them and I definitely have to say that Doren is my favourite character. It felt like he was the main character, because he saw the beginning and witnessed it to the end. At first I thought he is just a random bard in Lita's town, screw me. Totally laughed at all his ex-girl friends. Seri Kesu must felt so betrayed by him. Unlike Seri Kesu and Lita, Adrian felt really poor like he doesn't fit much as a main character in my opinion. The interaction between the characters, mostly between Adrian and Lita (awesome portraits sometimes) were hilarious, made me smile really often even in dangerous situations in the story. Design of the World was beautiful. The map in the beginning so confusing, but after crossing almost every map like 20 times, it came pretty handy.\n\n\n\nSPOILER END\n\n\nGameplay   9.5/10\nMusic    10/10\nStory    9/10\nCharacters & Design  9.5/10\n\nOverall 9.5/10\n\n\nTo Sum up, it is the best RPGMaker 2k3 game I've played since Vampires Dawn 2 and i played many RPG2k3 games in the past and would definitely recommend it to people who are looking for a good 2k3 Maker game. \nThe chance is slim that there might be a sequel, however I hope one day there will be one, because the ending is a real big cliffhanger or you can make a prequel, to answer all those remaining questions. I would definitely put out my wallet and gladly pay 30\u20ac or more for a 2nd part, aslong it has more than 20 hours gameplay and all the mechanics and features from the first game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1478291394, "timestamp_updated": 1478291394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26354290": {"recommendationid": "26354290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145011709", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478006054}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Attention[/h1]\nBefore I review this game I'd like to say, that I didn't play this very far yet.

It doesn't reinvent the wheel, it plays a bit like Final Fantasy with a touch of its own. But its working concept so who cares?\nIt doesn't force you to grind the life out of your characters. And the CHARACTERS! Oh I love them! They're human. They're not 100% storydriven robots. They're moody teenagers (I'm talking about you Lita~) and the first vampire (Boss?) the one who mattered, he's funny. I'm glad he didn't die the first time I killed him. I expect alot of fun coming from him.\n(I love how the faces next to the dialogue change depending on the situation. Beautifully drawn.)\nThe atmosphere is just right. You don't live/play in a preprogrammed world, full of NPC's that tell you pointless things or help you finish your goal. You wak among actual people being nice, mean, stupid or whatever. Stupid. Definitely Stupid. Who'd build their house on a floating Island, with giant holes in their bedroom?! You can see the earth beneath your feet and theres not even a safety net or something. I certainly don't have the guts to sleep like that.\n\nWell there was something that I did hate about this game though. Aside from the little things that had to be improved in the earlier version, there was one melody that drove me crazy. It sounded like a cheap ripoff off Coolio's Gangsters Paradise made into a loop. It was funny at first but it isn't after 30 minutes. I hope all who read this burn with me from now on =_=\n\nIf I had to rate the game, which I will do, I'd still say its among the top 15 RPG's I've played or seen in my life.\nUnfortunately I didn't get to finish it last time but I'm sure it could become my favorite RPG.\nThis game is for picky people. Its pure gold. You just have to love it. Grab it. Especially if its on sale.\n\nPersonal Opinion after about 10 hours of gaming (I'm a slow player so it didn't get me very far)\n4 out of 5.

Liked the sassy and feisty main character and the story\u2019s smooth flow and generally could not find any good reason to hate it. \n\nSo I installed the full game and OH MY GOD\u2014all my saved games are gone!!

After I calmed myself down and thought about it for a bit I looked in my Steamapps folder and OH MY GOD\u2014there all my lost saves where under the Ara Fell Demo folder. With sweaty hands I moved them over to the folder of the full game and OH MY GOD\u2014yes, all my progress was there and I was right where I left off (had to first save a game in the full version so I would have a place to put them).\n\nThat was close because I have been burned out of hours of game play in the past by upgrading to the full version of games.

If you're a fan of old-school RPGs reminiscent of the SNES classics, you will enjoy this game. I'll break it down the best I can here.\n\nStory: 10/10\n\nThe story here was quite interesting, even though it was somewhat cliche. (Not too bad, though!) Throughout the game I found myself actually reading the dialogue, rather than skipping past it to continue on. The thick layer of humor applied to a lot of it was also quite refreshing.\n\nMusic: 8/10\n\nWhile I enjoyed the soundtrack of the game thoroughly, I found that there was a little less variety than I imagined there would be. Typically, you'll hear the same track across multiple maps and on different ends of the game. Somewhat disappointing, but at least it was [b]good[/b] music and not something annoying.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nThe gameplay is where Ara Fell really shines. This isn't your typical \"walk around, kill stuff, walk around more\", etc. kind of RPG. There are times where you have to crouch, swim, climb, and jump to reach the next area, or secret areas. Also a bit of puzzle solving, which is nice. There's quite a bit of back-tracking, too, which is also nice considering how linear most games like this are. Speaking of linear, you're free to explore wheverer you're capable of going. Considering you can avoid combat 90% of the time if you like, you can even access a few select areas a bit early to acquire a few powerful items that I ended up using until almost the end of the game.\n\nCombat: 6/10\n\nWhile the combat was good, I was also a bit disappointed in it. It goes a bit slow at first, but once you're used to it it isn't too terrible. What I found disappointing, though, is that the array of combat abilities each character has is... rather small. (None has more than... 7? abilities to use, though you can upgrade them all one time later on. (From level 1 to 2.))\n\nThe main character has a special \"Scout\" ability that you can use to see an enemy's stats, and a later character has two different magic menus (Single/Multiple target)... but other than that, it's the typical \"attack/defend/flee\" menus.\n\nMenus aside, the amount of skills each character has is very limited, which I found disappointing. No combos between team members, coupled with the small pools of abilities to begin with, made me feel like combat was fairly lacking. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly could have been better.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nDespite my few gripes with the game, I really enjoyed it over all. I wish it was a little longer, but I'm a bit of a \"speed runner\" when it comes to RPGs, even those that promote exploration, and typically find myself finishing them quickly, even if I go for 100% completion.

It was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, and I highly recommend it.  The story picks up in the later chapters, and the combination of sprite animation and music make for some moving scenes.  \n\nWhat follows is my original review.\n\nI am really enjoying this game.  It's reminiscent of SNES JRPGs like Final Fantasy VI with its art style and side view battle system.  But instead of having an over-world map to link individual towns, it's all there as a series of screens tied together in the same manner as Secret of Mana or Zelda:  A Link to the Past.  This adds an openness to the game, and it gives a sense of adventure as you are able to explore so much of the world right off the bat.  \n\nI'm only in the second chapter of the game, but from what I've played so far, the story seems about what you'd expect for a JRPG in the sense that the world is ending (more or less) and you're the only one that can stop it.  The characters don't seem too distinctive so far with the exception of the protagonist, and the dialogue seems to be used more as a means of moving the story forward rather than giving unique voices to the characters.  \n\nHowever, there is a charm to this game from the stirring music to the ubiquitous animations that make everything so vibrant.  Just the opening scene where there is the animation of the main character leaping out of bed alerts the gamer to the level of detail that's been put into creating an enjoyable gaming experience.  \n\nAnd these details extend into smart game design decisions.  For example, you have the ability to save the game whenever you'd like, and if you are approaching a point of no return or a strong enemy, the game will prompt you with the option to save so that you don't accidentally lose all your progress by wandering into an area that you're not strong enough to handle.  And in some cases, if there is a cut scene before a battle, you can choose to skip it, which is helpful if you die and need to try fighting the enemy a second time.  Additionally, there don't appear to be random battles, there is a means of \u201cfast travel\u201d for when you want to get from one town to another in a hurry, and the boss battles seem challenging without being frustrating.  \n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game.  Rather than reinventing the mold of the 16 bit JRPG, it refines it and feels really polished.  If you like Golden Sun, Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger, or Zelda:  A Link to the Past, then I think there is a good chance you'll like this game too.", "timestamp_created": 1467666353, "timestamp_updated": 1468284193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24053723": {"recommendationid": "24053723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064352968", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485385215}, "language": "english", "review": "Blown away. \nRPG Maker Games are usually a game creator looking to tell their vivid story, but limited by the assets within RPG Maker.

Would have preferred a Hard Mode. \n- Would have preferred that there are actually cutscenes of flashbacks, which this game seriously needed.\n\nBad:\n- Many strange wordings, grammatical and spelling mistakes especially in the 2nd half of the game (makes one wonder if the testers actually tested the game properly. I would have overlooked this if this isn't a commercial game. But this is a commercial game, and so I would be stricter when it comes to commercial games)\n- A number of minor bugs (for example, there are some guards in some buildings like in Castle Atana and the tower at Apple Orchard who weren't stoned when the Stone Curse is activated)\n- Anti-climatic final boss and ending. Ending felt pretty rushed too.\n\nIf I would rate this, I would give it a 3/5. Sorry, but while I did enjoy the game to some extent, it doesn't really blow me away in the end. And this is coming from someone who has played the old Ara Fell (yes, I was from that era).\n\nStill, this is a game that I would encourage people to play, though it doesn't deserve to be at a price of US$9.99.

The idea that more, or longer is innately better. The problem is if you look at some of the best games of the genre, a lot of them are better partly because of how short and focused they are. You can beat Chrono Trigger in less than 20 hours on your first time through, and I don\u2019t think more needs to be said about Undertale.\n\nAra Fell took be a grand total of 9 hours to playthrough and that is actually a massive point in it\u2019s favor. Aside from being a respectable length for a $10 game, the developers didn\u2019t waste time with menial side quests or filler and busy work that was there just for the sake of padding things out. There are plenty of optional quest along the way that grant rewards that make them worth it if you take the time to complete them, but it\u2019s never a scenario where the story is somehow gated off until your complete some side mission that you may not really care about, keeping things constantly moving towards the final goal, instead of arbitrarily drawing things of the sake of a long run-time.\n \nAnother key strength is how the game is smart enough not to take itself so ludicrously seriously. Ara Fell is more comedy than it is Lord of the Rings style fantasy adventure, and a lot of that comes from the exceptionally well written characters.

At the time I didn't know that it was incomplete, and I was devastated when I reached the end with no more development to happen. Imagine my surprise when a random reddit post announced the completed version of Ara Fell up for sale.\n\nI have yet to complete the game, but in the small amount of time I've been able to play, this game is truly a gem and stands out as the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the homebrew RPGmaker market. The game offers a colorful palette of characters and scenery, and much love went into crafting the vibrant locales. Snow drifts from the sky, rats dart around dark caverns, butterflies flutter through the shrubbery -- the sheer amount of subtle eye candy stuffed into each screen is unrivaled by any of the SNES-style RPGs this game is related to.\n\nThe battle system doesn't really offer anything new to the JRPG genre, but that's not a bad thing. There is much more than I expected to make up for it -- tiered crafting, bounty hunting, lots of miniature side quests... and a semi-open world approach that is practically foreign to the jRPG market. Yes, that's right -- early on in the game much of the world becomes immediately open for exploration, blocked only by creatures far above your current levels. Of course, some areas are blocked off due to plot reasons, but it definitely reminded by of Secret of Mana in that regard.\n\nI should also add that the author is heavily involved in updating the game and visible to the public -- it seems like there's always a minor update going out, fixing the bugs that I have yet to encounter but likely exist (seriously, I have yet to encounter any bugs). This tells me that the author is invested and cares about the quality of his/her product.\n\nWhen all is said and done, with an interesting story, lovable characters, and a beautiful world, I can't recommend Ara Fell enough.

The game isn't bad, it's a solid JRPG with a bit more freedom than usual, but i does not live up to what is advertised. In case you have already forgotten, the description says:\n [quote]Ara Fell combines the best parts of Japanese-style roleplaying games with the best parts of western RPGs, as well as including elements of visual novels and adventure games[/quote]\nLet's parse that a bit:\nJRPG - yes. You get most of the hallmarks, including teenage protagonist, somewhat weird setting (but still not veering too far from traditional high fantasy), preset party, strictly linear plot, and active-time battles.\nVisual novel - probably, although JRPGs tend to have lots of cutscenes by themselves, so I'm not sure what's the distinction here.\nAdventure game - absolutely not. The few puzzles there are, are traditional RPG fair of pulling switches etc. They all also have clues nearby that basically tell you the solution in a very unambiguous manner. \nWRPG - here it gets a bit tricky. Technically, yes, the game has a supposedly open world and character customization. In practice, however, you are cut off of large parts of the world until specific points in the (very linear) story. The openness here is mostly retrospective - you can return to any areas you've visited, yes, but are very limited in the ability to unlock them out of order. There are sidequests, but they are all simple fetch/kill quests - hardly a \"best part\" of any genre. \nCharacter development, on the other hand, is made largely ireelevant by the fact that each charcter, in typical JRPG fashio, has their own set of skills and equipment, Skills' effectiveness scales with certain stats, so to keep your character effective you just have to increase those stats with little leeway. Also, there are only 5 stats. \n\nOther parts of the game - combat, exploration etc. - are, I guess, alright. As I've said, it's not a bad game, although it doesn't venture far enough from the RPGMaker template for my tastes. But if you truly want a game that combines best parts of Western and Japanese RPGs, try Voidspire Tactics, Lords of Xulima or Betrayal at Krondor, a classic.", "timestamp_created": 1465758244, "timestamp_updated": 1465760513, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739178", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23524275": {"recommendationid": "23524275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052378971", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485109193}, "language": "english", "review": "Ara Fell is a really good game. I enjoyed it emensely. It had everything that I look for in a SNES style game. Secret goodies, and puzzles, the ability to do some stuff out of order if you grind like crazy (completely optional) a really good story and a fun combat system. \n\nOn a slightly spoiler femenist note I also really admire that it flips the hero trope a little bit, the girls are actually the better fighters than the men as well as a woman who Pre Katniss has to tell the guy who likes her, \"hey let's deal with emotions after we do all of the saving of the world, mmkay?\"\n\nWould strongly reccomend. \n", "timestamp_created": 1465753250, "timestamp_updated": 1465753250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474696", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23509198": {"recommendationid": "23509198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006276098", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468415947}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who is always skeptical of RPGmaker games being cheap poorly constructed cash grabs; I have to proclaim this game is certainly not one of them. I don't know much of the whole past with this games history before it was released as a pay game on Steam. What I do know is for this first attempt it's really quite a lovely RPG. \n\nIt features alot of nice things that RPGmaker trash games usually miss out on. Some fun but no overly insane side quests. A open world map with explorable towns that actually vary in look and feel. Good balancing, nice over all sprite work. A rather stereotypical plot but honestly that's not really a bad thing if you're looking to find an old style turn based RPG that feels very much like the old console JRPG's of old. \n\nMake no mistake though, Ara Fell is not a bland game which I believe is one of the biggest issues that is associated with RPGmaker titles. The characters and events are actually interesting and memorable. The story is compelling enough in my opinion to keep you interested and wanting to see it through to the end. \n\nAra Fell seems to draw certain inspirations from games like Secret of Mana, Zelda, Lufia II. Battles take place in turn based style but you're more or less free to explore as much of the world as possible fairly early on. Doing so is actually fun an rewarding at times when you stumble upon a secret wall or a hidden path to discover some cool loot. \n\nThe game isn't without it's flaws and you do come across parts where you sort of feel like it could have been much better polished. All in all though it's pretty well done and beats the pants of alot off 98 percent of RPGmaker games. I hate to even lump it into the RPGmaker game category in way because this game surpasses so many of them and feels like a solid 16-bit console JRPG should. \n\nI'd give this a recommendation for people longing for a bit of past nostalgia when it comes to these style of games. Generally I'm pretty picky when it comes to what RPG's I like. Ara Fell didnt disappoint me whatsoever. It's also well supported with the developer constantly working on stamping out any bugs reported which is very nice to see his dedication. \n\nThe price might seem a wee bit high; although I think it's important to remember you're not just buying the game but helping to encourage someone to keep developing an using their up and coming talents to build more games in an even better fashion if you appreciate that type of thing. \n\nThe game itself also lends to casual play by using what is called a Story mode. Which basically results in you never being able to lose a battle and one shotting everything including bosses, for those who just want to see the story play out without putting much effort into character developing. Even in normal mode it doesn't require much grinding if any at all to complete. In fact I think the only real thing you might need to grind for at times is money to be able to afford some of the higher tier armor and weapons if you desire to own everything possible. \n\nEnemies are generally easy to avoid if you don't wish to get caught up in a fight. The game is very friendly in that it normally always prompts if you'd like to save first before entering into a boss battle. It also gives you warnings of what level you would probably like to be at when coming across areas with stronger enemies as you go along.\n\nThe leveling up stats system is pretty similar to Super Mario RPG where you earn points on leveling up to distribute into things like magic, defense, ect. It also includes a crafting system to create things like potions or unique weapons and armor that you cannot normally purchase in shops. You also have purchasable skills and of course a variety of weapons and armor which you tailor to your own play style and character builds. \n\nYou can also discover warp points by way of a warp crystal for all the major locations in the game which makes back tracking fairly painless and quick for getting to your destination once you've located them all. Along with that you also discover an ability which allows you to fly and land at certain fixed points on the map. \n\nThe game has even improved and added more since the time I wrote this and completed it for the first time. That speaks highly for the amount of care going into making this an excellent quality game. \n\nLong review short, if you looking for a bit of classic RPG fun Ara Fell is a pretty good choice to purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1465679385, "timestamp_updated": 1466793308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23493904": {"recommendationid": "23493904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164306900", "num_games_owned": 3031, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498638715}, "language": "english", "review": "Ara Fell\n-------------------\nNice Opening, Great sound effects and music, as well as a decent title graphic.\nI'm already intrigued and ready to play!\n\nThe optional story mode is nice for people who like game novels I guess, but i'm going to skip right past that, cuz im not a loser, I game for my stats lol\n\nNormal Mode here we Go, As someone who had dabbled a little bit with Rpgmaker, and have played hundreds of RPG games, I can tell a lot of dedication and work went into making this game, The Sprites are very beautifully done as well are alot of the effects.\n\nFirst thing I noticed On Controls was the ability to crawl, and jump I can't off the top of my head recall of this in any old school rpg like this, it adds a new dynamic to the game.\n\nThe tutorial for the attack system was well done, and the way the visual movements in battle are also fluid. \n\nThe Music and sounds effects during gameplay are great, I also like the lighting effects, this game was really thought out.\n\nThe game has a crafting system, and now my mind is blown. Great addition.\nOne error when I went into crafting and selected life potion I a pop up screen showed up and had life spelt lfie. \n\nI liked that I was able to choose to engage in battle with the bats if I want to, this was nice.\nThe interfaces are well designed.\n\nLol the Heads up joke on the Skull was funny. Not going to spoil any more of the game, but its got a nice sense of humor.\n\nThe Storyline is written good and the gameplay mechanics are most certainly fun, I'd def put this up in my top 20 RPGs of all time and i've played probably 100 or more easily. \n\nI Honestly Can't say enough good things about this game So I'lk try to mention the bad, Minor gramatical or spelling errors, not so open worlded? Limited, Alot of rpgs are like this, its not neccesarily hindering, as it keeps a player to a story, But it doest take away a little freedom, really doesn't hurt this game tho at all. \n\nOverall Ara Fell is a great RPG, I was proud to play and one the makers should be very proud of making.\n\nPros \n+Pretty Much Everything\n+Steam Trading Cards\n+Controller Support\n\nCons\n- Minor Txt Errors\n- No Achievements \n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/. \nYou're also welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.", "timestamp_created": 1465608167, "timestamp_updated": 1465608167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23482917": {"recommendationid": "23482917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014003348", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465559057}, "language": "english", "review": "Story: 9/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nEntertainment: 12/10\n\nI initially clicked on this game's page not because the banner showed some Anime chick with a bow, but the name really caught me as strange. I looked at the screenshots and it reminisced me of the good times I had playing JRPG games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy, and it was on sale so I said \"why the hell not?\" I was not disappointed with my purchase. It has an amazing story, fun characters, good gameplay and a really nice set of developers who are there with you every step of the way. Though the game has some bugs, I see the devs constantly scouring the forums to fix bugs, and that's what I love to see about developers after a game release. \n\nThis is my first time really loving a game and its community, so I decided to give a full review on my part to show my support for the devs and their game!\n\nStory: 9/10\nI love the story, how I get to piece the information I slowly build to formulate my own opinions while the game throws a twist at me and makes me rethink the whole situation. It's fresh, and it was a great experience to see the game escalate in tone towards the climax.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nAt first, gameplay was very fun, leveling up your characters and finding gear to hit for bigger and bigger numbers, achieving new spells to cast and new foes to beat up. However, as you progress towards the end of the game, you unlock all your skills and pretty much find the best gear (or craft it) and it becomes a game of doing your character skills in the correct order. Gameplay got very repetitive and lackluster for the regular mobs, and I rekindle my love for the fights in each unique boss with their own special minigames.\n\nEntertainment: 12/10\nHaving my mind blown by the story's twists was really a fun experience, and the little humor and dynamic character portraits really helped maintain my immersion in the game's story, which flows really well. Besides having a weird map to navigate, the game flows extremely well and really gets you on the edge of your seat. You don't really expect what will happen next most of the time, as anything goes!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time spent in this game.

I usually got bored with them due to boring stories and repetitive combat.  This was the first one I've ever completed and the only one I'd recommend.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\n\n8/10\n\nOverall, I found the story to be pretty good.  All of the characters had backstories and motivations independent of \"just group together to save the world!\"  The game also didn't boil down to just good vs evil, as there were multiple factions with goals and allegiences that might coincide for part of the game or put them at odds for other parts.  I was interested in a lot of characters - not just the main party and the story was interesting enough to get me through to the end.  I wanted to see how it would all end and the closure and ending were satisfying.  \n\nUltimately it was sort of a \"beat the bad guy to save the world\" kind of story, but it was an inspired take at that old rpg story archetype and given how much of a love letter the game was to rpgs of the past, I'd say it was intentional and well-executed.\n\n[b]LEVEL DESIGN[/b]\n\n8/10\n\nThe level design was impeccable not just for an rpgmaker game, but for rpgs in general.  For most of the game, you are put in the larger world of Ara Fell - an open world.  You have a map to show you the entire continent and where everything is, and you can navigate the world map to go almost everywhere.  Generally, the main story has you going to dungeons on the main map, with a few smaller side areas to explore as part of side quests or extra encounters.\n\nThe dungeons themselves were very well designed.  The puzzles are not so complex that seasoned puzzle game players will be challenged, but they were difficult enough to satisfy the typical rpg player.  Dungeons themselves would require the solving of multiple puzzles to progress, sometimes in a non-linear fashion through the dungeon.  I thought the dungeon design was one of the strongest points of the game and figuring out exactly where to go next in the dungeon was something I enjoyed doing.\n\nThe one complaint I have is there wasn't quite enough \"meaty\" side-content.  In the old rpgs of yore there were often larger end-game dungeons hidden in the game with an \"ultimate boss\" sort of enemy at the end, often stronger than the final boss.  There was no side-content that large in scale in this game, and I would have enjoyed it if there were more dungeons overall.\n\n\n[b]COMBAT AND ENCOUNTER DESIGN[/b]\n\n9/10\n\nThe combat and encounter design were the strongest points of this game for me.  Usually, the combat was the weakpoint of rpgmaker games I tried in the past, where it was so reptitive I would get bored and stop.  In poorly designed rpg combat, the player quickly discovers a \"dominant strategy\" - a way of playing out combat that can be used to win any combat, against any enemy in the game.  Limit break spam in Final Fantasy 8 would be an example of that.  That ruins combat by making it really boring.  This game did not have that weakness.\n\nThere are no random encounters in this game - you have to walk into an enemy on the map in order to get into a turn-based rpg battle.  For these encounters against non-boss enemies there generally are dominant strategies to just easily win in 1-2 turns every single time [multishot spam + elemental burst deal with trash very quickly].  If combat against \"trash\" mobs was more interesting I would have probably given the game a 10 in this category.\n\nWhere the game truly stands out is the \"boss\" battles.  The dominant strategies generally do not work in these, and they are sufficiently difficult.  I wiped several times this game on bosses, learning the mechanics.  Not only that, but the attacks of bosses varied enough that your defensive strategy [when to heal, when to use items, etc.] will differ based on boss encounter.  Also, there were a [i]lot[/i] of boss battles in this game and it was obvious thought went into each of them.  \n\nI'd also like to note that it is definitely possible to grind in this game, though I never had to.  \n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game.  It took me about 16 hours to clear, the game had strong level design and combat.  It also had an interesting-enough cast of characters and story to keep me engaged and wanting to know what came next.  The game also had lots of clever quality-of-life additions that all rpgs should have: saving at any time, asking you to save before boss fights, asking if you'd like to skip cutscenes before a boss, auto-combat, an option to play the game without any combat [story mode], and an option to check what the next step in the main quest is and where to go to do it.\n\nI did encounter a few bugs throughout my playthrough that would require me to reload an old save once, and others that prevented completion of a couple sidequests.  I also encountered a bug that prevented completion of the main quest.  I made a thread on the discussion thread about the main story bug and the developer responded within minutes and a few minutes after that a patch was out that fixed it.  \n\nI hope the developer creates another rpg, I really enjoyed this one.", "timestamp_created": 1465183734, "timestamp_updated": 1465183734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730068", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23404428": {"recommendationid": "23404428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025904034", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465302576}, "language": "english", "review": "there is no neutral option otherwise i would have chosen that. \nPROS\nAra Fell is a story driven game. the story will hook you into it from the start of the game.

I started this game without knowing what it was about, only have seen the trailer for a little bit, but I enjoyed the ride! Overall it is a great game and I definitely recommend other people to play this. If you want to hear my opinion about the game (spoiler free) Continue reading.\n\nStory:\n\nSo in short, the story is about a floating island that is doomed to fall out of the sky and the girl needs to stop it. It's a pretty good story and enjoyable. When I started the game, the story was well introduced. It explained itself pretty well, so I didn't feel like I jumped without knowing anything. You could read all the stories about the island on the bookshelf's pretty soon in the game. There weren't any plot holes that I could find.\n\nArt/design:\n\nThe art is really good in this game. It is a japanese style kind of game. Everything was designed pretty well and you really felt like you were exploring (This is why I bought this game, because it looked really good). Everything looked finished and done.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is really good, the ost's were really rememberable! Would love to buy the soundtrack and all.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThis was probably the major turndown for me which I can call annoying for some people. The humour need's to be your cup of tea. How the characters react to certain kind of things in the game was in my opinion a bit mehh. I see where they were trying to do with the humour, but that made it seem like the characters were not real at all. I never got a emotionally attached to the characters, because they seemed fake. From time to time the girl was serious about things and the other time she was completely joking about it, she didn't even seem bothered by all the dead bodies in the game which they also joked about. This was part of the humour though, which again you have to like.\n\nPve:\n\nI don't play alot of turn based games, but I enjoyed this one! It could have been a bit more difficult, because I actually didn't have a hard time killing things. I never died on my run, only a few times when I tried to kill stuff that was waaay above my lvl. The mechanics were decent, it could have been a bit more various. Overall it was great though and I haven't really encountered anything, which I can call bad. Although I loved the lvling up system you could really have a big impact on your characters, if you wanted to have more defense you could choose that, or if you wanted more damage. Mana actually gave every character a purpose, everyone had to use it and everyone had different abilities. You could even lvl up spells which I think is a great mechanic.\n\nBug's/things:\n\nThere are some slight bugs here and there that you are going to encounter, but it's thankfully not game-breaking. One more thing I would like to mention that some mechanic later in the game can be a bit annoying, not the pve but for the main quest which I hated alot. Ofcourse I can't say what, because that would be a spoiler;)\n\nOverall thoughts:\nI did enjoy this game really much, because the gameplay was amazing, loved the exploring, doing all the sidequests. Prepare yourself in no-lifing these 26 hours of playtime like I did, because it gets addicting. The ending was pretty satisfying and again the art was amazing and certainly well done.

The whole time you're playing, you're not paying attention to the game itself or how it was made - the graphics, script, character designs, etc. You're simply absorbed into the plot like you do when reading a good book, because that's what you've found: a good story. \n\nFew games, whether made by indie developers or big console companies, have been able to succeed at this, but Ara Fell is one of the exceptions - and it's made with RPG Maker 2003, no less! The developers of Ara Fell make creating a JRPG seem like a piece of cake, but only when you look closer, do you realize that a phenomenal amount of skill, time, and creative energy was put into making something valuable. And it IS valuable. Besides the story, there's just the right amount of challenge, puzzles, exploration, tactics, and side-objectives to make a nearly perfect JRPG. \n\nMy only 2 qualms are that 1) the map can be confusing and a little frustrating when you're trying to reach a quest point, but I've eventually been able to figure the paths out given enough time, and 2) I wish there were time stamps on your saves so you could load from the correct save slot easier.

Likewise, the animations have enough frames for most actions to appear smooth, which is something I tend to find lacking in many rpgs these days.  As a pixel artist who works on games, I definitely approve.\n\nThe story is amusing, cute, and interesting enough to keep me playing.  In all honesty I keep expecting the game to be over for the small price point I paid, and yet there's still more for me to do.  Lita is a sweet, if stereotypical, female protagonist and her companions all prove to round out the gameplay.  Speaking of gameplay...\n\nIt's just fun to play.  The fights have this weird mix of Lufia and Final Fantasy going and I like it.  There's active time combat, characters pop around the screen to do their attacks, and the enemies array themselves in different patterns.  Overall it's enjoyable and I rarely feel like I'm grinding because most of the encounters can be avoided if you wish.\n\nI do think the game is a bit too hand-holdy even with the tutorials disabled, but other than that it is an extremely fun and worthwhile addition to my library -- and hopefully -- yours.", "timestamp_created": 1464990229, "timestamp_updated": 1464990229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23363025": {"recommendationid": "23363025", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994585644", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466995979}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: The developer has implemented more controller support.

They're just little animations and have no skill involved).\n    [*]The stats seem to require you to become a jack of all trades to survive. It's not interesting to customise a character's stats each level if I have to pick all of them. To clarify stats never raise automatically, so unless you raise your mana stat you'll have 10 mana for the entire game (enough to use the basic skills once), same goes for your health.\n    [*]While I'm on the topic why do all stats start at 10 except for agility, which starts at 100 for all characters? \n[/list]\n\nSmall niggles aside I'm having a great time.

I sent a message to developer Stephen Anthony, and he acknowledged it. A couple of hours later, I noticed that the game had an update. Curious, I played again from the start, trying to recreate the bug, but found it had been fixed. Whether or not this resulted from my message doesn't matter; this is proof that the developer cares.

I could have rounded it out to 20 but I skipped some side quests towards the end because I was so into the story I needed to know how it ended.\n\n\nAra Fell is a solid classic jRPG with good characters, good combat, a good story, and a great world. I'm not going to go in depth in this review, but I'll highlight my favorite parts of this game:\n\n1) Some of the boss fights in this game are very interesting. I can't say I expected actual boss mechanics from this game but man were they sick. Nothing super crazy but it definetly required some thought and planning to take some of them down.\n\n2) The world is really fun to explore. You'll be exploring caverns, jumping, climbing, swimming, etc. When you're exploring the towns and larger buildings there are extra rooms and NPCs that are seemingly useless. While they have no function they add to the world to make it seem more complete and real. Add gorgeous pixel graphics and we got a nice package.\n\n3) The story is interesting. Its a big gray area almost the entire time, twists around every corner, and things aren't really that predictable. Even within the last hour of the game I wasn't sure how it was going to end.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in just the story there is a 'story mode' where monsters die in one hit. A useful feature for maybe younger players or..well if you just care about the story. I wish there was a hard mode for some extra challenge, but I can't knock it for that.\n\n\nAdd some awesome developers that almost instantlly responded to my bug report and had it fixed and a patch uploaded to steam within an hour.

Even though a lot of the chipsets are the default, the game looks great. The maps have so much detail and there's so much to explore. There's tons of wildlife running around, people are walking around the villages. Especially compared to other RPGMaker games, Ara Fell just feels so much more vibrant and alive. And the soundtrack is so good. I hope they release a soundtrack eventually! I have bad sense of direction, and sometimes I find myself getting lost though and have to reference the map. One time I wandered into a den of wasps and got killed, which wasn't super fun.\n\nSTORY - You play a young heroine who has to save the world, though more out of dumb luck than destiny. Not super innovative, but it definitely tells the story it wants to tell, and it's very well-written. You root for the heroes. The bad guys are compelling and multi-dimensional, and there's way more going on than at first glance.\n\nMECHANICS - As a RPG, your main mechanics are combat and levelling up. Normally I don't like turn-based combat systems, but Arafell does some stuff that makes it fun. Your magic regens during combat, so you can keep using your skills rather than saving them, and HP regens out of combat. I really like that system. Also the bosses are pretty cool and require some thought to beat, which I liked. Levelling up is cool too because you get to make decisions where to put attribute points, though I'm still figuring out if I'm making a solid build or not for each hero. The dungeons aren't just fighting. Since the enemies are persistent, you can avoid them if you want (though you might be underleveled for a boss battle), and you also have to solve puzzles to progress. Ara Fell has a crafting system which I like but haven't played around too much with (I mostly make healing potions), and a quest-tracking system which is really helpful for keeping on track!\n\nOverall, I like Ara Fell a lot! It has beautiful visuals, music, and writing. It tells a compelling story, and the game mechanics don't get in the way of that and are actually pretty fun! For an RPG, that's definitely what I want to get out of it. <3", "timestamp_created": 1464879613, "timestamp_updated": 1464913194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23345113": {"recommendationid": "23345113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031120631", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507409168}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the prettiest, best-written games I've ever played.

There's a self-aware aspect to this game's story and it plays on itself sometimes. It's really clever.\n\nAnyway, I love this game.

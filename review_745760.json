There were a couple other character voices that were a bit offputting but eh it's fine. \n\nThe art itself imposes a nice unique style to the game as a whole and has some amazing effects added on in later scenarios for spoops. It's a refreshing reprieve to have something visually unlike any other. I found myself scanning each new scenario over to admire the art while the story was read to me by some good VAs.\n\nAs I said though I'm not much for VNs so not sure what to critique asides from dialogue, art and voice acting.

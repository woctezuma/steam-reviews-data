Plataformas y accion en 2 dimensiones con secretos por doquier, se necesita jugar cada nivel multiples ocasiones para encontrarlos a todos.

Lo suficiente como para plantear un mundo, un personaje principal con su motivaci\u00f3n y algunos villanos para completar. Se puede obtener un poco mas de contexto encontrando unas runas en cada nivel, solo si te gusta saber un poco mas o si queres completar todos los secretos, no hay otra recompensa.\n\nLo recomiendo para quienes buscan ese estilo de juego reminiscente a los plataformeros de la epoca de los 8 y 16 bits.

The classic NES titles that inform so many indie games now were products of very different times and sensibilities, and much of what worked then doesn\u2019t fly today. That\u2019s what makes games like Odallus so special, because they manage to bring the good parts of retro design forward and merge them with modern concepts. The result is an adventure that looks and feels like the games you grew up with, but plays with all the intelligent balance and conveniences you\u2019ve grown to appreciate.\n\nThe old gods are dead, and the new ones are not the kind and forgiving type. In fact, they like to torch towns and carry off children, which is precisely what happens to your William Wallace-looking hero Haggis. He\u2019ll have to travel a dark fantasy world of crumbling ruins and haunted forests to reach the castle of the evil deity who ruined his life, and kill hundreds of twisted creatures along the way. There\u2019s also plenty of ancient secrets to unearth like legendary swords and armors, inscriptions of the past, and relics that can grant Haggis fantastic new powers.\n\nIt\u2019s something of a level-based metroidvania, where each stage features open spaces and multiple paths to explore in search of new treasures and secrets. \u201cVast\u201d is a completely apt term for the realms you\u2019ll traverse, too, because it can be quite a hike or series of jumps to reach the distant corners where goodies lie hidden. Right from the start there are blocks to push and climb on, hidden walls to tear down, and ledges to mantle up. That last one is key not just to exploration but to gamefeel, as you can hang from any ledge and pull yourself up to reach new areas. Needless to say it\u2019ll also save you from some frustrating falls, and will also be used for its own tricky platforming challenges in later areas.\n\nMantling up is a prime example of how Odallus brings modern sensibilities to classic gameplay. Without it the controls would stray towards the old pre-Iga Castlevanias with their stiff movements and all-or-nothing leaps. But the tight air control and mantling option opens up the levels to free exploration, and the later character upgrades open it up even further. Aside from the usual double-jump there\u2019s a cloak that slows your descents, a dash move, a bracer that lets you move huge blocks, and the ability to breathe underwater. Because of how vertical and how varied in topography each level is, unlocking a single upgrade can open up new paths in almost every area and often grant access to the game\u2019s many secret levels.\n\nSecrets are the lifeblood of Odallus, the reason it ends up being such a compelling platformer. Each level has four to six big ones, including life upgrades, bag upgrades for your subweapons (which are also used to uncover secrets!), new swords and armor, and exits to hidden levels. This is on top of all the hidden chests containing souls, which you trade to a skull-wearing fellow peddling spears and torches and soups. It\u2019s worth mentioning, though, that hidden levels aren\u2019t really optional here. There\u2019s only four levels between you and the final boss but you need seven pieces of a gem to face him, one from each level boss and that includes the hidden ones. That means Odallus isn\u2019t really a title for gamers who like to book it to the end, but it\u2019s a dream for secret hunters and completionists.\n\nFans of dark fantasy will also find plenty to love here, especially in the enemy designs. A friend observed how close many of the foes look to the nightmarish monsters in Berserk, and they\u2019re absolutely right. You\u2019ll be facing all sorts of twisted creatures with hands coming out of their eyes and heads on writhing stalks and spines and needle-teeth everywhere. The blocky NES look is faithfully recreated with prominent color palettes for each level and enemy, and stiff but evocative animations. The sound design is nice and moody as well, and while I didn\u2019t like the huge UI bars on the sides of the screen I soon got used to them, and found that the game is mostly designed with them in mind. And that\u2019s the thing about Odallus, nothing was really left out of its design. It takes all the best parts of classic NES games, polishes them up with secrets and fair challenges, and gives you a huge game to explore and enjoy them in.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

You can buy health, ammo for sub-weapons and extra-lives and every time you buy something the price of the item you bought goes up.

The game will also be hard if you don't find some secrets (lvl 3 sword YES) The music was ok. Some tracks were pretty good but there were a few that weren't really doing it for me either. The story is reminiscent of Berserk. Very much so, actually. There are quite a few throwbacks to amazing movies and shows. The creators of this game have good taste I can say that much.\n\nAll in all... is it worth the full price of 10? Sure if you have an 8 bit itch go ahead. But for 5 or less?

Ein besonderes Lob verdient neben dem einfallsreichen, stylischen Level- und Monsterdesign, und der butterweichen Steuerung die musikalische Untermalung und Soundkulisse. Hier wird eine d\u00fcstere Atmosp\u00e4hre aufgebaut, die ich schon in Vergessenheit glaubte, und in ihrer Dichte ph\u00e4nomenal in den Spielablauf integriert ist.\n\nDie Story, unser Recke Haggis zieht aus, um das B\u00f6se zu vernichten, rei\u00dft nat\u00fcrlich niemanden mehr vom Hocker, wartet aber mit einigen dezenten \u00dcberraschungen und Wendungen auf. Die Umsetzung ist fabelhaft: die vom B\u00f6sen befallene Welt, die von den alten G\u00f6ttern verlassen wurde, ist insgesamt stimmig und hochwertig entworfen. Die Gegner sind mannigfaltig, die Bosse knackig, die Bewegungen f\u00fcr ein Spiel dieser Art fl\u00fcssig animiert, das Kampfsystem ist ausgefeilt,  und die Lenkung der Spielfigur von haargenauer Pr\u00e4zision; so muss das sein! \n\nDen Vergleich zu Klassikern wie Castlevania, Ghost\u00b4n Goblins oder Demons Crest braucht dieses Spiele-Kleinod nicht zu scheuen, im Gegenteil: es h\u00e4lt ihren glanzvollen Geist mit Bravour aufrecht, und f\u00fcgt sp\u00e4rlich neue Spielelemente- und mechaniken hinzu, ohne das Genre zu verw\u00e4ssern, oder zu sehr vom Wesentlichen abzulenken: der kurzweiligen Monsterhatz in einem glaubhaft \u00fcberzeugenden Fantasyszenario.\n     \n\nDas Spiel ist exzellent, preiswert und geh\u00f6rt in jede seri\u00f6se Spielesammlung!", "timestamp_created":

They're generally a great blend of action, platforming, great music, and tons of weird monsters. The series has had far more hits than misses, and it's disappointing to me that Konami appears to be withdrawing from the video game market. Doing so will take Castlevania away from us forever, and we'll be left replaying those excellent classics and wishing we had something new. But the indie developers at Joymasher also apparently loved Castlevania, because Odallus: The Dark Call bears its influence proudly and it's magnificent.\n\nOdallus is a neo-retro game; it's obviously a fully original game but its done in the style of games made 30 years ago. It's got the Ninja Gaiden style cutscenes, beautiful sprite based 2D graphics, and a chiptunes soundtrack. On my hard drive, it takes up 415MB so it's far beyond the storage capacity of an NES cartridge, but the look and feel is all there. It even occasionally has NES-style graphical glitches.\n\nAs Haggis, you find that your village is burning and your child is missing, so you strike out to fight demons and monsters and all sorts of nasty stuff and get him back. Haggis is armed with a sword, which isn't a chain whip, but it's perfectly satisfying when it comes to chopping up monsters. There are also subweapons that augment your fighting capacity. It mixes up the Castlevania formula by giving you a throwing axe that flies straight, a torch that burns like holy water, and a javelin that flies in an arc, and all three are readily available once you've found them. You'll often rely on those subweapons to do real damage, at least early in the game, because your starting sword is a little weak and slow.\n\nOdallus also takes some influence from the Metroid series in that you can find relics that enhance your movement abilities, such as being able to breathe underwater and double-jump. The game is also full of secret areas, some of which require these relics to find. It's not a fully open map like Metroid, but it's broken down into levels that can revisited from the world map. Stuff like secret areas and multiple level exits are things that I loved about old NES games and they're done well.\n\nDifficulty in the game is almost perfectly balanced. It's falls just on the right side of almost infuriating but still encouraging you to try again. Every time I ragequit on a boss (which happened once or twice), I'd jump back in after 10 minutes because I wanted to beat it and I knew I could. The final boss is absolutely brutal and I beat it with barely a sliver of life left, but it was so rewarding when I did.\n \nI really don't have much to complain about here. The mine cart level kind of sucks a little, but it's nowhere near as frustrating as some classic counterparts. Odallus: The Dark Call is a must-play for Castlevania fans, or retro gaming enthusiasts.

Haggis, un guerrier parti sauver son fils, enlev\u00e9 par de cruels d\u00e9mons.\n\n[h1]Les plus :[/h1]\n\n- Difficile, mais pas injuste. Le jeu impose un skill assez \u00e9lev\u00e9, parfois impose aussi de faire plusieurs fois le niveau, afin de passer un endroit afin de connaitre tous les timings, et les patterns des ennemis, mais les checkpoints sont g\u00e9n\u00e9reux, surtout avant les boss.\n- La bande-son est vraiment sympa. Musique 8bits r\u00e9ussie.\n- Une bonne dur\u00e9e de vie, j'ai mis 14h \u00e0 faire tout le jeu, sans trop fouiner pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer tous les items, le jeu ayant us\u00e9 de ma patience. (et ma manette)\n- Graphiquement, c'est du pixel-art, un peu brouillon, mais \u00e7a va. Les d\u00e9cors sont vari\u00e9s, et ont une \u00e2me.\n- Tout est question de loot et de recherche si l'on veut s'am\u00e9liorer. Vous voulez plus de vie ? Cherchez la ! Vous voulez une meilleure arme/armure ? Pareil ! Ca pousse le joueur \u00e0 fouiner dans tous les niveaux afin de d\u00e9bloquer un maximum d'avantages.\n- Le gameplay (manette plus que recommand\u00e9e !) est r\u00e9ussi. Sauter, frapper. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que vous avancez dans le jeu, vous d\u00e9bloquerez des \u00e9quipements sp\u00e9ciaux qui vous permettront de pimenter vos parties, passer certains endroits inacessibles auparavant, etc... Ce qui rend le tout moins ennuyant. Vous disposez aussi d'armes de jet, afin de pouvoir attaquer \u00e0 distance (d'o\u00f9 le nom \"de jet\"..)\n\n[h1]Les moins :[/h1]\n\n- Je suis pass\u00e9 totalement \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'histoire. Insipide \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt.\n- Musique r\u00e9ussie, mais qui ne change pas souvent.\n- Pas de VF.\n- Pas compatible avec le Steam Controller.\n\n[h1]Conclusion :[/H1]\n\n[b]Odallus: The Dark Call[/b] est un excellent jeu de plateformes, \u00e0 classer tout de m\u00eame dans la cat\u00e9gorie \"Difficile\", m\u00eame si certains sont bien pires (je pense \u00e0 Volgarr...).\n\n_ _ _ _\n\n[h1]Si vous avez trouv\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation utile, venez rejoindre notre [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AlternaTyff#curation]page de curation et nos forums ![/url][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1504560179, "timestamp_updated": 1504629590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625707", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34741267": {"recommendationid": "34741267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012420137", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504734819}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, addicting, and hard.", "timestamp_created": 1504550293, "timestamp_updated": 1504550293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34686823": {"recommendationid": "34686823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034914403", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512486089}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "bom", "timestamp_created": 1504363002, "timestamp_updated": 1504363002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34598604": {"recommendationid": "34598604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010992095", "num_games_owned": 2410, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501833288}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll add more to this later, but my initial feel of the game is that it's a lot more refined than Oniken.

Every miniboss and boss defeated felt rewarding after struggling to learn each pattern.\n\nThe different upgrades you collect throughout the game progress very well with the difficulty as well but also has the added challenge of achievements for attempting to play the game without upgrading certain parts of your gear.\n\nThe shop and lives system is not perfect but works well enough. I sat on my currency for most of the game, buying something every once in a while not understanding why certain prices went up or why vendors only had certain items but the lives system makes a little more sense when dealing with the final level.\n\nThe one real drawback to the game is that there was no story attachment. There was a story there but I gained nothing from it. It was mostly an into and then a 'shocking' finale. The finale would have been more impactful had I cared about the character (or any of the characters.) \n\nI enjoyed this game immensely.

Levels are big and fun to explore. There is a very light metroid element to it, where you can collect new powers and revisit old areas. \n\nIt is, however, an old school game. It's not just the art style and basic mechanics, it's old school all the way. I personally find that a bit of a turn off, because we learned a lot about designing games in the last 30 years and a lot of common tropes back didn't age well in  my opinion. But I'm not judging the designer's choice here; there is an audience for this, for sure.\n\nIt's not as hard as other old school games. But enough to trigger a few rage quits, which for me is a problem; that's not the kind of experience I like in a game. I've had my fair share of those already.\n\nI also have  a problem with the dash, an ability you find later on the game. The dash is triggered by double tapping the d-pad, like it used to be on many old games. If I didn't have more buttons on my controller/keyboard  I would take that as non-ideal but acceptable solution, but I do have more buttons. And ever since I got that ability I keep throwing myself at danger accidentally, because this is a platformer that requires a very agile dpad control! So I tap it constantly to adjust my trajectory and position. You can see how that's a problem. Then, of course, just to make me more frustrated, whenever I'm in an urgent situation and need to dash quickly, it doesn't work. Because of course not.\n\nI do wish I'd see more games looking at the past for inspiration. There are many interesting things games used to do that is almost lost today. But I'd rather see some experimentation on top of that as well, rather than direct transposition just for nostalgia sake.\n\nIf direct transposition for nostalgia sake is what you're looking for, look no further.

T\u00f4 nos subchefes da ultima fase, mais precisamento o \"Fantasma\" que \u00e9 como chamo, al\u00e9m de ser dificil demais o uso da primeira espada do Haggis n\u00e3o ajuda muito, tirando migalha do HP do chefe, acho que em todas minhas tentativas n\u00e3o tirei metade do HP dele.\nDe resto n\u00e3o tenho muito mais acrescentar, apenas para aqueles que tem duvidas sobre a qualidade do jogo, uma coisa que n\u00e3o falei \u00e9 que a gameplay \u00e9 enxuta, muito bem executada, s\u00f3 a dificuldade em pegar o jogo no come\u00e7o mas nada que uma meia hora de jogo resolva, n\u00e3o citei as musicas, a da fase do \"carrinho\" tem a melhor musica do jogo (MINHA OPINI\u00c3O), o level design das fases  que \u00e9 algo primoroso, a vastid\u00e3o de inimigos, que ali\u00e1s s\u00e3o t\u00e3o bem animados que se prestar bastante aten\u00e7\u00e3o, consegue escapar de alguns golpes (tudo depende de sua habilidade nesse quesito). Isso sem contar que por ter um modo HARDCORE, e as conquistas como citei d\u00e3o um fator replay, \n\nEnfim como disse no come\u00e7o, 9/10, fique claro que n\u00e3o tirei UM ponto do jogo por causa das conquistas, mas sim por uma coisa bem simples que deixei pro final, as skins, entendo o estudio ser pequeno, ainda se tratando de um estudio feito por Brasileiros onde o apoio \u00e9 quase sempre zero, JoyMasher tem um padr\u00e3o de qualidade invejavel, mesmo sendo jogos simples, tem todo seu charme, e eu diria que at\u00e9 inovador, mas as skins... Se entrasse nas promo\u00e7\u00f5es igual os jogos (Odallus/Oniken) vivem entrando, eu compraria tranquilamento, mas pagar 2 reais pra usar uma skin do Artur, ou do Simon, entenda que por 2 reais eu comprei Portal 1 e 2 (s\u00f3 exemplos), essas skins deveria ser algo desbloqueavel, zerar no normal ou veterano sei l\u00e1, mas cada um ser pago \u00e9 quase uma EA...\n\nEnfim isso n\u00e3o desmerece o jogo, e super recomendo. S\u00f3 uma coisa, n\u00e3o \u00e9 pra todos, al\u00e9m de ter de ser amante do g\u00eanero (hack n slash, metroidvania, 8 bits) tenha em mente que uma das coisas que mais vai ver \u00e9 sua morte, grande maioria por sua culpa, mas comigo aconteceram certos bugs que at\u00e9 comprometeram meu save...

However if you hate backtracking or games considered \"Nintendo Hard\" then I'd say skip.\nIn fact: It's hard for me to simply go \"yes I recommend this\"\n\nBy using your eyes you can see that Odallus: The Dark Call is trying to go for an NES styled game. It's not a game that's 1:1 with Castlevania; the game tries to do it's own thing by having a more nonlinear approach to progression. The main way to get through the game is by exploring to find powerups and upgrades. It's because of this design choice that you'll end up going through each stage mutiple times. \nI can see how backtracking through the eight main stages is seen as annoying, tedious, or \"padding,\" Each level has secrets for the player to uncover, with each stage showing a counter of how many the player has found and how many are in the stage. And the game has both secrets not worth mentioning and 3 hidden secrets. Unfortunately there isn't a map or a proper checklist. It's because of this that it can get tiring to 100% the game.\nBesides the secrets there is the issue with the levels themselves. Every level can be simply...boring honestly. The levels can standard forest level, standard water level, or standard slippery ice floor level. It really doesn't help that the OST for this game is boring and forgettable. None of the BGM ever tries to be exciting or fast paced. All the music is slow, repetitive, and uninspired.\nEven with all that, this game can still be fun thanks to the tight controls. With all the upgrades found your character is really mobile. It definitely makes finding each secret feel worth. Also the combat is very simple; think of something more like Ninja Gaiden rather than Castlevania. Even if it's simple the game is still challenging enough to make you actually pay attention to not getting hit.\n\nTo recap\n+Wonderful spritework and art\n+Good controls\n+Game lasts a good enough length\n+-Challenging\n+-Backtracking\n+-Secrets required to finish the game\n-Boring OST\n-Your character's hitbox can be a little too big sometimes\n-Levels can feel samey", "timestamp_created": 1496626808, "timestamp_updated": 1496626937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32152167": {"recommendationid": "32152167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031410667", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496495154}, "language": "english", "review": "A pleasant surprise, wasn't expecting much.", "timestamp_created": 1496495283, "timestamp_updated": 1496495284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32075625": {"recommendationid": "32075625", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996247534", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496194292}, "language": "english", "review": "A very rough diamond in the lately-trendy metroid-vania style of games.

There's an awesome catchy soundtrack all the way through, and the colorful design and choice of palette wonderfully manage to create this gloomy and yet badass atmosphere that is so typical of the Castlevania series.\n\nThe gameplay itself is even more awesome, though, for there are a few features from modern platformers that make the character more maneuverable than fellow Richter Belmont, while the gameplay keeps the rigidity and tight controls we learnt to love in this kind of games.\n\nDifficulty-wise, it's what you should expect from a modern game that looks to feel like Castlevania. Normal mode might feel hard for those who are not that much into that kind of games, but it's still forgiving enough to not be a pain to beat.\n\nOn the other hand, Veteran mode (NG+) is some serious shit. The game is cleverly reworked to be harder, but not in a repetitive way. You get to see new enemies, to go through a new route, for areas and item locations are different, bosses have new patterns, and running out of lives does matter.

g\u00e9nero Metroidvania, que son los que en teor\u00eda unifican, por medio de las dimensiones, distribuciones y localizaci\u00f3n de elementos, un mundo de juego que est\u00e1 categorizado o diversificado por zonas, en el cual el jugador tendr\u00e1 libertad para escoger el camino que mejor vea en cualquier direcci\u00f3n, siempre que no haya algo que se lo impida.\n\nLos Metroidvania tienen por costumbre formar un conjunto de caminos que est\u00e1n exentos de una orientaci\u00f3n formal por los mismos, en su lugar son esquematizados de alguna forma para concluir una serie de puntos clave que habr\u00e1 que localizar y que tendr\u00e1n que ser solventados en el momento o con los objetos adecuados. Esto consigue formar un g\u00e9nero propio para estar todo el dia parriba y pabajo, parriba y pabajo, parriba y pabajo...\nLa gran mayor\u00eda de los metroid suelen incluir teletransportes entre zonas para no frustar mucho al jugador, sin embargo tampoco se descuida en ning\u00fan momento el retroceso libre o en cualquier direcci\u00f3n por los mismos, siendo por norma general una jugabilidad ecuanime o paralela en el sentido de la direcci\u00f3n.\n\nOdallus The Dark Call se plantea como un metroid de rasgos agudos en donde una prioridad en la expresi\u00f3n y su funci\u00f3n connotan en una mezcla, que sin llegar a querer serlo, reune aspectos de otros juegos, t\u00e9cnicas de otros tiempos y globalidades en los g\u00e9neros, para terminar siendo algo que es breve y simple pero completo y estable.\n\nUnas 5 reliquias que ofrecen habilidades cruciales como lo es el doble salto, las armas y armaduras hasta nivel 3 que nos proporcionar\u00e1n la fuerza y resistencia suficiente para los bosses, los corazones que mejoran los puntos de vida, unas p\u00e1ginas secretas con textos, y una ampliaci\u00f3n de la mochila conformar\u00e1n los aspectos localizables y libres por el mapa. Y aspectos m\u00e1s acumulutativos sin localizaci\u00f3n como lo son el dinero que ganamos al matar enemigos y la apertura de cofres con m\u00e1s dinero o armas secundarias se encarguar\u00e1n del aguisantado.  Las armas secundarias se cuentan por 3 tipos que podremos acumular y alternar para cualquier molestia pero lo m\u00e1s destacable es su uso en algunos puzzles para acceder a objetos importantes. Tenemos un control simple de 3 botones,  m\u00e1s otro para alternar las armas a distancia secundarias.\nEl dinero servir\u00e1 en las tiendas para comprar vida o armas secundarias. Las tiendas estar\u00e1n puestas medio al tun tun, normalmente cerca de alg\u00fan checkpoint.\nLa interfaz ofrecer\u00e1 todos los datos del personaje o juego en la pantalla para evitar cualquier interacci\u00f3n fuera del control del personaje. El personaje estar\u00e1 aumentado, centralizado y seguido por la c\u00e1mara en todo momento para entre estas dos cosas visuales lograr un enlace hacia su motor de juego que en este caso ser\u00eda

I have probably 5-6 hours in it.)\n\nAction game inspired by NES classics like Castlevania that takes its slavish devotion a little too far, with graphics that would be called terrible if not for the retro connection, music that deserves that term regardless, a reversion to the bad old days of save points miles away from difficult boss fights, and errors like enemy pop-in and dodgy hitboxes that might be excusable on low-end hardware but not here. This is a NES game that requires a 400MB download.\n\nIt's a sort-of Metroidvania, \"sort-of\" because there are multiple independent levels, not one interconnected world, but with the same sort of backtracking/area locking where finding double-jump boots (or whatever) allows reaching a new exit. That's all fine, but it's a minor quibble that it's done much less obviously than most Metroidvania-style games. On first playthrough it's easy to assume that levels with \"secret\" entrances are optional, when in fact they are required for completion and for the optimal order of play. One of the first secret levels provides a crucial underwater breathing item, for example, which is required for just about every other unlock, like the critical armour and weapon buffs.\n\nBy far the best reason to play is the grim aesthetic, which owes a huge debt to \"Berserk\". The plot is far darker than Nintendo would have ever allowed and the monsters are all twisted, uncanny-valley things of human faces on bulging flesh-tentacles. If you have fond memories of Castlevania and want to try a new version with art direction by H.R.

There are times it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be- a modern take on a classic formula or an authentic late 80s-styled game, and so as a result stumbles a bit in both. \n\nI also found it too hard in an unfun way. The levels, enemies and bosses are challenging but generally fair. But the non-linear approach is galling because it really IS linear, and if you do things in the wrong order its incredibly difficult. I had to look at a suggested stage order after I got tired of dying over and over trying to figure out what to do next.\n\nI still recommend it though, because there are definite flashes of brilliance and the moment to moment exploration and combat is very satisfying.

Worried for his son, he rushes home to find the town ablaze, set upon by horrific demons, and his son missing. Enraged, Haggis embarks on a final, desperate quest to rescue his son and uncover the mysterious motivations of, and ultimately defeat, the dark forces who have invaded the land.\n\nUsing a reliable input device like the XBox One controller, the gameplay is crisp, quick, and responsive. The combat and platforming elements are challenging - at times, even a little frustrating - but never feel cheap or contrived. The well-balanced difficulty curve and thoughtfully-distributed progress saves and powerups ensure that when you die - and you WILL die - you'll feel compelled to jump back in to get just a little farther, to give that tricky boss one more go, to find that next secret. Odallus is hard work at times, but the experience is rewarding and fun.\n\nImmediately upon starting the game, fans of old-school action platformers will be impressed by the cohesive art style and fantastic, if simple, controls, but will soon discover that the real star is the near-perfectly-executed level design. Each of the unique stages features a diverse cast of enemies, difficult (and often disgusting) bosses, and intense platforming sections. Each stage also introduces new gameplay mechanics, granting Haggis new skills and powers. Returning to a beaten level armed with your recently-acquired double jump or water-breathing ability allows you to reach previously-inaccessible areas containing powerups which enable you to progress even further, or grant entry to hidden stages filled with their own rewards and perils.\n\nWhile [i]Odallus: The Dark Call[/i] is undoubtedly an homage to the console and arcade classics of yore (right down to some suitably-cheesy dialogue), nearly all of which saw their heydey before the birth of your average Steam gamer, its outright charm and obvious quality of vision and execution propell it well beyond mere fan service or mimicry.

And where so many indie games have failed, Odallus does a decent job of carrying the old formula and at the same time feeling like bringing something new on the table.\n\nYou play as Haggis, en Ex Soldier and now a hunter who has lost his wife.The war is over and now he lives a peaceful life with his son. One night when he left the village to go for hunting demonic-like creatures evaded his village and kidnapped his son. Now he is set on to find his son back and take revenge for pillaging his village. \n\nThe graphics are 8 bit style and it is so NES alike they even went with a NES color pallet. You are presented the story through dialog and through some artifacts that you discover throughout the game. The background graphics however are more detailed and look more 16 bit. Personally I would prefer it, if they had made a 16 bit design but I understand what the developer was aiming for. The music is decent, -more on the depressing side, which I think fits the serious tone of the game. Everything else that evolves presentation is simplistic, like the Map, the inventory, the dialogs etc.\n\nThe gameplay will be familiar to those who have played retro action platformers. While it is very simplistic it takes some time to get used to the controls etc. There are the classic mechanics - most of them you acquire as upgrades as you progress- like double jumping, dashing, secondary attacks, armor upgrades and more. The game overall might not offer a lot of replay ability since it is very straightforward but it gets very addicting when you start getting the achievements. \n\nSome things I didn\u2019t like are first of all difference in difficulty in some areas. It gets really hard in some stages and a piece of cake in others. Also the bosses are very creative from a design perspective but you can beat most of them by just taking the damage and spam attack their weak points. The last boss however is one of the hardest ones I have ever played and a very memorable in my opinion. Some other minor things like the attempt to make funny dialog while the game is super serious doesn\u2019t make sense as well. \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my time with Odallus, the exploration, the tight controls, the overall dark theme and the hunt for achievements make an addicting package that anyone who likes those types of games should give it a shot.

Framerate is stable and there are not any graphical glitches,\nAesthetics: The art direction is gorgeous. Both levels and sprites emulate the late NES konami/capcom era very well. The game does takes some liberties, but they end up being for the better. \nSound: The soundtrack itself is average, but it gets the job done. Sound effects are more similar to what you would expect to hear from a megadrive, but that it is not detrimental for the game in any way.  \nGameplay: It feels very similar to a pre-metroidvania Castlevania, specially Rondo of Blood. You have the sword as your main weapon and your secondary weapons that must be replenished. The game have a few metroidvania elements though, as backtracking is necessary in some points in order to find acessories that will allow you to continue your progress. I do feel the B levels would benefit from being interconnected, but I see what the developers were going for.\nStory: The game preaches the principle \"show don't tell\", which is just great!

They don't really make these Gargoyle's Quest-style games anymore -- games that are similar to the Metroid style because of the gradual acquisition of power-ups that open new pathways, but it plays more like an action game, with limited lives and checkpoints and separate stages instead of one huge interconnected world. It's nice to go back to that.\n\nBut sheesh, Odallus is not very fun to play, and most of that displeasure comes from the combat. I groan internally when combat situations come up (and they come up a lot), because I really don't want to have to suffer through another awkward fight.\n\nI don't want to deal with enemies that are the exact right height that my sword slashes go right over their head. Or maybe they're one pixel too far away from the tip of my sword to hit them, despite it looking like the strike connected. Or maybe I [i]did[/i] actually hit them, but the feedback is so subdued that I didn't realize I landed the attack.\n\nI hate having to deal with enemies on awkward ledges that require me to waste my scarce projectile ammo to have a chance of cleanly damaging them; otherwise, I've got to jump up at them and usually get hit during my climbing-up animation, or leap down at them and hope they don't smack me first, since I have no downward strike to give me the initiative. Even Firebrand from Gargoyle's Quest could at least cling to walls or hover and shoot fire from a distance to give him the advantage, but no such luck here.\n\nAnd did I mention the enemies tend to not get stunned from attacks at all? And a lot of those enemies are pretty quick. So while you're desperately trying to chop their face off, they'll probably just barrel straight through your attack and straight through your body too. I eventually tried to avoid enemies whenever possible, though you usually can't since they're often blocking your path.\n\nEven ignoring the combat, you've got these surprisingly large levels with multiple routes and secret areas, but no map to speak of in order to assist navigation. Did you get looped back around to an area you've already been to, or is this a new location that merely [i]looks[/i] like a previous one? Where was that blocked-off route that you couldn't enter before because you didn't have the right item? Have fun trying to find out.\n\nAnd while you're doing that, you get to enjoy a bunch of absolutely insipid music. Not bad enough to make your ears bleed, but still repetitive and uninspired enough to quickly become grating.\n\nOh well. If nothing else, getting the DLC and playing as a pantsless gargoyle was fun for a bit.

It took about 4.5 hours to beat the game and find almost all of the secrets. Great controls and a couple different weapons that always had a use at some point which made finding them and keeping stocked up worth the effort. There were plenty of puzzle / maze aspects that will keep you searching for the next armour or weapon upgrade, both of which are incredibly important for beating the last boss. (He's tough!)\n\nMost of the boss battles were a challenge, but most of the challenge came from learning their patterns. Once you got that figured out it was a good ol' fashion smack down! Each stage has it's own difficulties which can be overcome by finding items that give you the ability to double jump, float, or dash. It's never easy though because near the end stages you are bombarded by enemies and spike traps.\n\nPros:\n- Stage selection screen. I've always been a sucker for an overworld map.\n- Challenging, but not impossible\n- Responsive controls\n- Puzzles make you think but aren't over done\n- I never felt lost\n\nCons:\n- Items cost progressively more the more you buy (the price caps eventually though). I found this kind of annoying because generally it was never a struggle to have enough money to buy things. Although, there were times where I used up all my money on extra lives and didn't have money to buy spears to get through a secret passage. This meant I would have to go back to early levels to grind for money. This didn't add any challenge to the game, it just increased the amount of time you run through already completed stages, which wasn't that fun.\n- The float button is the same as jump, so when you get double jump and float, you have to double jump before you float which is frustrating on some levels with spikes on the roof. I didn't explain that well but once you get to that point you'll know.\n\nI really don't have anything terribly bad to say about Odallus. As you can see, my cons were pretty specific nit picky stuff and not devestating game flaws. I would totally recommend this to anybody who enjoys metroidvania style games. Maybe $10 is too high of a price for some, but this game goes on sale often so I say pick it up!", "timestamp_created": 1482589735, "timestamp_updated": 1482589869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28592430": {"recommendationid": "28592430", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999311958", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482523363}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to be honest I didn't really think I'd enjoy this game. It was part of a HumbleBundle which I got for another game. I started it to kill a bit of time and as a bit of a palate cleanser after a flurry of turn-based combat or combat light games. I expected to only play an hour or so but found myself sucked in. A bit of description, Odallus is a NES Castlevania style game where you play a warrior looking for his son. The game is steeped in the NES style of Castlevania gameplay. While challenging, I felt this game was fair at all times and was within the realms of beatable by mere mortals and not 6 fingered god creatures (which is how I picture people who can beat the tough as nails versions of these classics/inspired by classics). The only exception is the final boss...good luck beating that without the secret armor. Definitely a game i was pleasantly surprised with, however with only about 6 hours of content (including unlocking a butt load of the secrets) I'd be hard pressed to recommend it at full price. Although I hear there's a pretty big sale on at the moment where you could snag it for cheap...\n\nIn Summary: 3.5 Vicious Pricks out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1482581261, "timestamp_updated": 1482581261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28550892": {"recommendationid": "28550892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023407118", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482319151}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for something that would remind you of Castlevania, look no further. Odallus is a pretty good platformer that takes inspiration from the famous classic horror series, but still stands on its own.\n\nIt plays like older NES games, even going as far as to include life counter, yet with the inclusion of the world map, it also offers a Metroidvania experience. First and foremost, however, it's still a platformer. Just with a couple of side-paths and power ups. Don't expect it to rival actual Metroidvania games in that aspect.\n\nI should probably mention right away that lives won't bother you much. There are shortcuts that you activate within levels that will always stay open, and Game Overs only put you back to the beginning of the level/world map. It's definitely one of the less-obtrusive live systems in any game.\n\nThe gameplay and controls are tight, and, thankfully, also don't emulate worst part of older games. You're always in control, and if you fall down a pit, it's always your fault. \n\nLevel design is not bad, but there are a few annoying gimmicks along the way. They're all really small, and Metroidvania aspect helps with that a lot. For example, there is one really annoying boss that comes to mind, but you can open up a level where you can get a Level 3 sword before fighting him, and make him a non-issue.\n\nThe game's relatively easy if you've played many platformers, but it will provide enough challenge to keep you entertained. Took me about 6 hours to beat, and that's just the normal difficulty setting. There's also a harder one, which promises new item placements, among other things, but from what I've seen, it's quite annoying. The first level had randomly spawning enemies on bosses, which isn't a good sign.\n\nOne thing that felt weird was the shop system. Throughout the game you find shops where you can buy weapon ammo, lives and health items. Once you buy any of the items, the price for that item rises. Considering that sometimes you need items to solve puzzles, it's a weird decision. If you're not good at the game and, for example, keep losing to a boss, I can see it leading to grinding money, which is just bad. Consider this your PSA: do not buy items unless absolutely needed. Restocking on, say, 2 axes you've wasted on every opportunity to do so will probably lead to grinding.\n\nThe only thing that I really didn't enjoy were a LOT of bugs I encountered. One boss' attack was broken, text box that displayed lines of code, what seemed to be broken AI in some places, and plethora of smaller issues that weren't really major, but definitely annoyed me. Still, nothing gamebreaking.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a pretty good retro platformer with a great atmosphere, get it.", "timestamp_created": 1482474608, "timestamp_updated": 1482811164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28547660": {"recommendationid": "28547660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010746619", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482902025}, "language": "english", "review": "Yep, it's amazing.

The music fits well with the dark atmosphere and retro style.  \n\nThe gameplay is very good.  Movement and combat feels tight and balanced.  Subweapons provide combat variety as well as exploration and puzzle-solving tools.  The many secrets and powerups provide bonuses to those who take the time to explore and revisit old levels.  Some provide additional movement capabilities that benefit both exploration and combat.  Interestingly, all of them seem to be optional, so one could play Odallus either linearly or Metroidvania-style.\n\nThe game wasn't very difficult until the final boss.  There aren't any insta-death spots in the game, and almost every challenge can be overcome by precise movements and attacks.  I never felt that any particular section was unfair (except maybe the minecart portions in an optional level).  There is a hard mode for players who like additional challenge.\n\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this game.

The art and music are excellent and the gameplay is some of the best I have found in this genre. This game is definitely worth a look, particularly if you have an interest in retro platformers - Odallus feels every bit as memorable as the old games that inspired it.\n\nA key element of gameplay is exploration. Many important items, including those which are needed to progress to new areas are hidden across the game. Finding new levels and secrets will often require returning to previous levels after acquiring new abilities. Odallus demands more exploration and secret-finding than most games. I ran into a bit of frustration in my first playthrough when I didn't know where to go, but in the end I am glad to have eventually discovered everything without needing to look up a guide.\n\nThe difficulty of this game is very well thought out. There are no cheap tricks or instant deaths. Bottomless pits are rare and when you do happen to fall into one you are returned to your original location with only a small penalty to your hitpoints. Dying in this game is usually the result of being worn down over time, rather than sudden, unavoidable damage. If you are having trouble in a level, you can often explore elsewhere and find something to tip the balance in your favour. Combat is uncomplicated and effective, and you have plenty of weapons and abilities at your disposal. The real challenges are often found in enemy and boss encounters. Well balanced difficulty, great combat and open ended gameplay make Odallus a definite advance over the usual platformer formula.\n\nI enjoyed Joymasher's previous title Oniken a lot, and Odallus shows immense improvement in terms of presentation, pixel art quality, level design and gameplay. The music is evocative and complements the unique feel of each area - 'Gael's Castle' is one of my favourite chiptune tracks. The attention to detail in the art and design of each level makes this game feel like a real adventure. Once you have discovered where everything is, Veteran Mode gives you another opportunity to play without knowing all the secrets and enemy locations - definitely one of the best implementations of a harder difficulty/new game plus mode.

It is a series of levels that have some minor amount of secrets, exploration, and branching paths. But it is NOT a singular, connected, big, nonlinear map. SIDE NOTE: There IS back-tracking, but the upgrades aren't that overpowered. In stuff like Symphony of the Night and Guacamelee your upgrades kind of break the game (like Poison Mist Form or Goat Fly) when brought to the earlier sections, and that makes back-tracking fun rather than a chore.\n\nDefinitely sticks to its guns on being retro. I really hate to give this a thumbs down. I think the people who made this game really did a great job. I might have enjoyed playing this game, but I ran out of lives on level 4. The funny thing is, you can grind money to buy extra lives. And that's what I did to get through some sticky situations. However, the vendor before the boss that killed me didn't sell extra lives that time. So I hit retry. That sent me back to the beginning of the level. Mind you, this game has two difficulties and I chose the easier one.\n\nSorry, I grew up with these kind of games. Personally, I'm not nostalgic for this stuff. I'm spoiled by modern games that have checkpoints and what amounts to \"infinite lives\" by these old standards. When I do play old NES or SNES games on an emulator, you better believe I abuse save states. I just don't have the patience for this stuff any more.\n\nSo for me it all comes down to the fact that it needed something other than difficulty to offer. Like an intriguing story or truly Metroidvania-style, rewarding exploration.\n\n***\nEDIT: Removed some inflammatory wording, added extra words for what I want from the game. I've also found that my point on difficulty needed some further elaboration. Because I have played games that are as hard or harder, and I should lay out the difference between difficulty that is fun and satisfying and what makes this game frustrating and annoying.\n\nI mentioned the lives system already, but let me get into why this and how it affects the game is a problem. I'll use Symphony of the Night as an example (since that is the definitive Metroidvania anyway). That game doesn't have lives. When you die, you immediately game over and have to reload your last checkpoint. That sounds harder, so why does Odallus come across as so much more difficult?\n\nWhen you die in Odallus, you do NOT get back anything you spent during that life. On top of that, each subweapon has its own ammo. There are no candlesticks to break open, enemies do not drop anything but money (I think). The only ways to get more ammo are to go back to specific areas where they spawn or to buy them from a vendor. And every time you buy something from a vendor, that item becomes more expensive for the next purchase. On top of that, the vendor will remember these prices when you die and when you continue. This means that it's possible to put the game into a potentially unwinnable state. Or, at least, to a point where getting more lives means a mountain of grinding. At that point, it's potentially better to restart the game!\n\nA lot of old games felt like this. You pretty much had to play again and again to figure out the best way to do EVERYTHING so that you could THEN get from beginning to end in (essentially) one swoop. But do you know what old games also had? Passwords. Yeah. Not only did these serve as a means to continue when saving wasn't a possibility due to hardware limitations, but many games also gave the player a means of catching up when using a password. For example, in Castlevania you can quickly get back your upgraded whip just by breaking a few candlesticks. And in Mega Man, the password system included weapon unlocks and other power ups.\n\nSo I hope that illustrates how above and beyond this game went with difficulty. I actually watched a Let's Play of this game just to see the end. And you know what? The poor guy actually ran into the exact problem I was anticipating! He got to the last boss and gave his last two lives. The cost of an extra life had gone up to 200, and he had like 180 or so in his pocket. When he died, a hard edit occurred and then he was standing in front of the castle with 9 lives; he didn't want his viewers to watch him grinding all that stuff back, heh. For me, dying fills me with way too much anxiety in this game. And, again, I chose the easier difficulty setting.", "timestamp_created": 1479626042, "timestamp_updated": 1480924713, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520534", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26693749": {"recommendationid": "26693749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020495456", "num_games_owned": 1977, "num_reviews": 284, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495045165}, "language": "polish", "review": "Odallus to powr\u00f3t do starego \u015bwiata, gdzie wa\u017cniejszy by\u0142 gameplay, poziom trudno\u015bci i \u015bwiat przedstawiony, a graficzne wodotryski ust\u0119powa\u0142y pixelom. \n\nJe\u017celi masz ochot\u0119 poczu\u0107 si\u0119 jak za starych dobrych czas\u00f3w i lubi\u0107 oberwa\u0107 po dupie od pixelowych potwor\u00f3w to \u015bmia\u0142o, we\u017a w d\u0142o\u0144 miecz, top\u00f3r i spr\u00f3buj odeprze\u0107 ataki czarcich pomiot\u00f3w prosto z...\n\nOcena:  8/10 \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfWOhtFXJg", "timestamp_created": 1479570376, "timestamp_updated": 1479570376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463419", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26692954": {"recommendationid": "26692954", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967685936", "num_games_owned": 1768, "num_reviews": 581, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479567743}, "language": "english", "review": "Game has the appeal of old castlevania, I remember playing those when I was a kid, but these sort of retro games can be done better, example Shovel Knight, without weird controls and issues.", "timestamp_created": 1479567829, "timestamp_updated": 1479567829, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26688535": {"recommendationid": "26688535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018936218", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489796682}, "language": "english", "review": "I great little throwback to old school NES Castlevania games.

When I played this game, I always thought that it's a very good NES game created by veteran NES game developer. From the tunes, sound effect, and color pallete seems plausible to be crammed into NES Cartridge. And most of the stage design adhere to 80s game tropes. Ice stage? check. Jumping lava stage? Check. Underwater stage? Check. And some of the enemy design is very gruesome and creepy, that's an achivement for the developer. Unfortunately, the soundtrack isn't really great, most of them is forgetable.\n\nThe game itself is quite good. It's in the vein of Metroidvania, so expect a lot of backtracking. the enemies and stages' boss is fair and balance (of course, after you know it's patterns), it's possible not to get hit from stage boss. The stage is well designed and challenging, there's no cheap death trap or lame pit. You sub weapon is very very useful, unlike Castlevania, Odallus' subweapon is powerful and a lil' bit harder to find.\n\nThe control is simple and tight. You only needs 3 buttons: attack, jump, and change weapon. Gamepad if very preferable than keyboard. I'm using a Sega Saturn USB controller and it works quite nice, the game launcher will recognize my standard USB controller device, unlike some other game. But, I wish I have NES controller with usb adapter to play this game, I think it will be a better experience.\n\nThere's a little things that I don't like from this game. I need to grind (or harvest) souls to buy 1up, so oftentimes I prefer to 'save and exit' before I die while exploring the stage. And this is kinda a needless hassle for me.\n\nOverall, if you like NES 8-bit graphics, Metroidvania-like game, and adequately challenging game, then this game is for you.\n\ntl;dr\n[b]Is it recommended? Yes.[/b]\n\nAnd I don't know why this game reminds me to Berserk manga.....", "timestamp_created": 1479095447, "timestamp_updated": 1479095536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26593310": {"recommendationid": "26593310", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967229781", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 310, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479085700}, "language": "english", "review": "Odallus: The Dark Call is a retro metroidvania where you play a father in search of his son who was kidnapped by an evil cult looking to summon old gods and reclaim the world that was once theirs. This game is a real labor of love and you can tell that the team spent a lot of time trying to get all the little details of what made older console platformers great. \n\nVisually, Odallus is stunning despite being so simplistic. The color palette is dark but not obnoxiously so and enemies look like they fit into the environment they\u2019re in. The screen even has a decent scanlines filter and the edges are distorted as-if you were viewing the game on an old curved CRT monitor. The music and sfx are great too and have the feel of an old sega game, especially the low fidelity voice clips sporadically mixed in.\n\nOdallus also has its fair share of nostalgia thrown in, but it\u2019s not done in an in-your-face \u201cDOES ANYONE REMEMBER THIS?\u201d kind of way like how other games do it. Subtle things like a mother-brain themed boss and a half-finished quote by the merchant are scattered about just enough to be interesting without turning into a reference-fest.\n\nGameplay is another part where Odallus shines. Controls are snappy and responsive, save for a few ledge-grabbing issues, and the precision makes combat fun and intuitive. The majority of secrets are sensibly hidden just well enough to make you work for them but still giving you a sense of satisfaction for having figured them out. Most bosses are fair, with a few exceptions, and have their distinct patterns that you can study until you are able to beat them without taking a single hit. Later on though, you will need to upgrade your weapons and armor as the difficulty curve takes a massive spike in the final areas. \n\nThis game is, of course, not without its setbacks. The shop system is fairly nonsensical in that as you buy an item, its price increases. I guess they didn\u2019t want players farming items to make certain parts of the game easier but if that\u2019s the case, why did they put a ceiling on the item cost? The extra lives mechanic is also fairly pointless as you can just continue indefinitely and all the lives do is give you the ability to respawn at a checkpoint instead of the beginning of the level. Bosses and minibosses defeated during your previous life stay dead and game switches thrown stay thrown (e.x. doors unlocked/portals opened). So it\u2019s kind of silly to even have the lives in the first place but that\u2019s a really minor issue IMO.\n\nSo the question you\u2019re probably asking yourself is: Is Odallus: The Dark Call worth the buy? If you like frustratingly hard but fun games that beat you until you beat them back followed by a triumphant fist pump, then I think you already know the answer.\n", "timestamp_created": 1479088485, "timestamp_updated": 1479088485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26588233": {"recommendationid": "26588233", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970515125", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479685349}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic old-school Metroidvania.", "timestamp_created": 1479066616, "timestamp_updated": 1479066616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26587311": {"recommendationid": "26587311", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995749658", "num_games_owned": 1297, "num_reviews": 938, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491053646}, "language": "german", "review": "Metroidvania\nSehr gute (360) Controller Unterst\u00fctzung.\nIch musste TV-Modus ausstellen um es zu starten.\nSehr gescriptet.

You start out being able to jump and swing a sword.  As time goes by, you'll gain more abilities/upgrades such as sub-weapons, floating, extra hit points, better armor, etc.  Enemies occasionally drop orbs which act as money that you can spend at shops located on stages to get more subweapons/hit points/extra lives.  Stages also have chests lying around which will give you sub-weapons, life, or orbs.  There are 9 stages to complete, usually with a couple secrets, a mini-boss guarding some sort of upgrade and a main boss guarding part of the crystal.  There are 5 stages on the surface that go in a linear order, but each of the first four surface stages has an alternate exit that leads to an underground stage.  Certain stages and secrets can only be gotten to by acquiring upgrades from other stages.  Upon completing a stage or deciding to leave a stage, you can choose where you would like to go.  The stage selection screen gives you information on whether you've beaten the final boss of the stage as well as the number of secrets you still haven't found.  You'll start with 3 lives.  If you die, you'll spawn with full life at the last checkpoint you activated.  If you run out of lives, you'll restart at the beginning of the stage you're on with 3 lives again.  On veteran mode you lose all of your orbs if you run out of lives, not sure if this happens on normal or not.\n\nIt's hard to comment much on the difficulty since I used the cheat code to activate veteran mode from the start, so I never played through on the normal difficulty.  The game is fairly challenging and you need to get better at it in order to complete it, so don't expect to just breeze through it like many games nowadays.  You start with 4 hearts of health and can get up to 8 total from upgrades.  Enemies do anywhere from 1/4th of a heart worth of damage up to 1 \u00bd (Usually bosses).  While you can recover health during stages at shops or from chests, you can't carry health items with you, so don't expect that crutch to get you through boss fights.  Most enemies are fair, with an occasional annoying enemy here or there, learn their patterns and you shouldn't have many issues with them.  Bosses work much the same, learn their patterns and exploit them.  Some stages have environmental hazards that make them more difficult to navigate through.  There is a little artificial difficulty in the game, but it doesn't occur very often, and rarely results in your death.  Took me around 8-10 hours to complete the game 100% on veteran mode.  I died plenty of times, but those deaths usually occur while learning areas, enemies, and bosses.\n\nThere's a bit of story in the game, but nothing deep.  It's mainly there to give your character an excuse to be there.  Characters aren't really explored either.  Music and sound are both fine.\n\nA couple of complaints about the game, none of them very big deals, but resulting in an occasional annoyance or frustration.  1.  While the controls are usually fine, there are moments where they seem insufficient.  There were occasional times where the game would ignore my inputs, usually when I tried to do two things at once such as turn & attack (resulting in me turning but just standing there instead of attacking) or float & use a subweapon (resulting in me not using my subweapon).  2.  Grabbing onto ledges is an automatic ability in the game.  Some enemies can be placed close to a ledge, so you can jump up meaning to hit them and drop back down to safety but grab onto the ledge accidentally instead and take a hit.  3.  The game has no map, which means if you revisit stages to get all the secrets, you need to remember the whole stage or re-explore the whole stage.  4.  Usually enemies do not respawn unless you travel a certain distance from them and come back, but some enemies will respawn once you leave the screen.  Had an occasional issue with an underwater enemy that would respawn below me when I would double jump to see what was up above me.  Was pretty much unavoidable taking damage upon coming back down.  5.  The game has a couple bugs as well.  Got a bug where an enemy pillar tried to create 4 separate ice shards to throw at me, instead the game freaked out and about 100 of the shards appeared on the screen flying all over the place and kept re-appearing.  I killed the enemy quick and the shards all froze on the screen and would hurt me if I touched them, but I was able to cut through them and get out of there.  Found another bug on the mine cart level.  Completed a mine cart section, but eventually took a path back to the beginning of the same exact mine cart section to get a secret.  The mine cart was kind of phased out but I tried jumping in it and it wouldn't move and I became permanently stuck inside of it.

Do you actually remember gaming in the late 80s? Like seriously? There was nothing better at the time because it did not exist yet. Was a game in the 80s torturously difficult with controls that make you want to throw your controller into the wall so hard that it sticks in like a shuriken? \n\nSucks to be you, because adjusted for inflation to 2013, games in the late 1980s on NES cost $89 before tax, so unless you or your parents were loaded, buying another game was not feasible. I only recall my parents ever getting me 3 rentals on NES (Mickey's Mouse Capades, Zelda II (SCREW that game), and Super Mario Bros 3), so renting another game obviously wasn't something some kids could do, either. Those games that pissed us off as kids? Well, many of us were stuck with them and couldn't get more for a long time, if at all, so we just \"made due.\" We played the games for hours upon hours, trying to beat them and either never succeeding, or finally winning and realizing the \"trip\" to that victory was so miserable that it wasn't worth it.\n\nToday, however? Whether you're a kid or an adult, there are so many more video games now than back then, obviously, so you have choices. Your average parent, who says \"Fine, I'll buy you one sixty dollar game this year,\" would agree to buy their kid 12 games for $60 cumulatively, becasue it's so much more value and less risk of the kid not liking it. With Steam, you can ACTUALLY get 12 for $60 on sale. Heck, you can get a lot more than that if you stick to the $0.99 games on sale, but quality will be of diminishing value, most of the time. Not only do you more games to choose from, but there are more advanced games to choose from. \n\nGenres and mixes of genres are around today that were not around in the 80s, controls have been made slicker and more responsive. Want a 2D Metroidvania with great controls, fun gameplay, beautiful artwork, and an okay story? Then play Dust: An Elysian Tale. So many other alternatives other people could probably suggest that Odallus: The Dark Call, but sheer nostalgia alone does not a great game make. I could ramble on, but let's get to talking specifically about this one game.\n\nMusic and visuals: The game looks and sounds like an NES game. Fine by me! It doesn't detract from me having fun. No complaints and I actually really like the visuals and the music here. Good stuff!\n\nStory: What I've seen thus far is nothing interesting or impressive, but there's more than your average NES-era Castlevania game, as best as I can tell. It seems pretty \"throw-away\" thus far.\n\nControls: They could make the game control smoothly, but they deliberately chose not to. There is no true benefit to crappy NES-quality control. Will I get nostalgic because I remember back when games used to piss me off because movements were clunky? No, I'll just be pissed off. The world has freaking VR headsets and motion controls now, so it's not too much to ask for controls that feel good in a type of game that has been around for 30-ish years.\n\nGameplay: Although the controls are part of this, there are things aside from that which are an issue. As in the 80s, enemies will typically respawn on the edge of the screen if you leave that part of the screen and go back to it. When you're playing in areas with lots of places you can fall, missing multiple platforms on the way down, resulting in at least a one-minute trek back up, assuming you don't fall again due to a missed jump, all the enemies that whittled your health down in an already-challenging game, are whittling your health down even more along the way. It gets very old and annoying trying to get throgh certain areas just to reach a boss, and you can die before reaching that boss without making any sort of progress that can help you to do better the next time you try.\n\nContinuing on from that, though there are checkpoints in the levels, if you lose all your lives, you have to start the entire level over. Money only seems to matter for buying a couple of extra lives here and there, and if a boss is absolutely wrecking you, you're going to have to start the level over, meaning your odds of beating the boss this time are even lower than when you were attempting back-to-back runs on the boss from a few rooms away, because now you've had time away from the boss and fall out of the groove of battling it. Unlike a game like Dark Souls, you can't just go grind for upgrades to be more powerful than the first time you tried the bosses, either, so misery, misery, annoyance, annoyance.\n\nIn short, this game is only for the following: 1. people who value nostalgia at the expense of the actual positive changes that have come to video gaming since the 80s and early 90s, as well as 2. masochists who just want to lose constantly because difficult just equals fun to them so the more aggravating and punishing the game is, the better, and 3. braggarts who just want to dedicate too much time to completing the game so they can brag about doing so, thus stroking their egos in the process. If these sound like you, then you'll probably love it! This game's really abusive, difficult, and insulting in that it didn't bother to update what was worth updating with the times. \n\nIf you don't fall into any of those three camps of people, it is highly unlikely that you will enjoy this game. I believe that most people who play games fall into one of those three categories, so most people -will- enjoy this game. However, since I am not within those camps of people, it is a miserable experience and a terrible reminder of a little of what was good and a lot of what was bad in gaming back in the day, so I will not recommend it so as to represent my demographic.", "timestamp_created": 1478461440, "timestamp_updated": 1478461448, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512560", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26462155": {"recommendationid": "26462155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084306788", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478614458}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e04\u0e33\u0e40\u0e15\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19 Player \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e20\u0e17 \u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e46 \u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e04\u0e34\u0e14\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07 \n\n+ \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21 Classic \u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 8-bit \u0e2a\u0e44\u0e15\u0e25\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e22\u0e38\u0e04 80-90s \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e42\u0e14\u0e14\u0e40\u0e14\u0e48\u0e19\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\n+ \u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e40\u0e07\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e02\u0e36\u0e49\u0e19 ( \u0e2d\u0e38\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e02\u0e36\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e46 )\n+ \u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a Orbs \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d Soul \u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 Darksoul \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48 Orbs \u0e08\u0e30\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e14\u0e41\u0e21\u0e49\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e15\u0e32\u0e22\n+ \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e22\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22 Route \u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e08\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e49\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e01\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e08\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e32 Secret Route \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e06\u0e48\u0e32\u0e01\u0e47\u0e17\u0e33\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e08\u0e30\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 Shard \n\n- \u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e49\u0e22\u0e38\u0e04\u0e40\u0e01\u0e48\u0e32\u0e46\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21 Bit \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\n- \u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01\u0e06\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48\u0e07\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b.......

Being stuck in the past can never be a good thing. I can admire Odallus\u2019 courage and efforts of not standing out, but to simply blend in and offer either a nostalgic or a new taste, depending on the age of its players. Is it a bad game? Far from it. It perfectly emulates the feel and mechanics of a story-driven retro platformer. But it also carries on the flaws of those games. A simplistic chromatic pallete coupled with an equally shoddy set of sounds. Should I mention the rage-inducing difficulty? I remembered pretty fast why I stopped playing such games and moved on to other genres. \n\nIf regenerating health and the large list of in-game hints you posses now in almost everything you play, seem like an extreme form of dumbing down, know very well that there used to be a time in which the only solution to a difficult game section was to either ambition yourself to overcome it, or to stop playing altogether. I\u2019d say that qualifies as the other extreme to the one mentioned above. The thing that disappointed me the most about Odallus: The Dark Call is ironically, not even related to its gameplay. It charges an exorbitant asking price and it also has a set of \u201cwonderful\u201d DLCs which are little more than glorified sprite packs at 1 dollar a piece. Even more amusing is the fact that JoyMasher\u2019s first project on Steam and Odallus\u2019 predecessor is Oniken, a game that is built in similar fashion but far more decently priced. \n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Evocative of a bygone video gaming era.\n+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- Unbalanced difficulty.\n- Ridiculous price tag and equally preposterous DLCs.\n\n[b]Rating 5/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews]Imperial Reviews[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Cubbes]Cubbes[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1478073428, "timestamp_updated": 1483475066, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26365994": {"recommendationid": "26365994", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989438523", "num_games_owned": 2373, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478051617}, "language": "english", "review": "This game would be worth a positive review, but I was playing just now with a controller, and as it turned off, there was no way to play back on the controller, it went automatically to the keyboard.

No matter how many games claim to be a \"modern day NES game that wasn't released in the day\". Usually you can feel that they are not. Some aspects of them are usually too modern in the way they are executed - be it the art or the interface or cetain gameplay aspects. This doesn't make those games bad or anything it's just that they don't match the description.\n\nOdallus is different here. It feels 98% like it yould have been released on an NES cardtridge except that a few things would not have been possible on the old hardware (screen sized bosses for example). Otherwise this is a game that channels all the right things from castlevania and the metroid series into one medieval package. Little bits and pieces thrown in from other games as well.\n\nThings you might want to know before buying:\nIt has tough parts. Some frustratingly tough parts but nothing in the style of 1001 spikes. Mostly fair tough (except the cart-* rides - you will know what I mean).\n*  Bosses are pattern learning fights. Get the pattern down - defeat the boss but ...\n*  ... search your power ups. You will need them.\n* controlls are very precise and responsive\n\nOverall super cool game. Highly recommended for people who know the type of game they are getting.\nOtherwise ask people 30+ years old if they can show you what an 8Bit game looks and plays like. ;)\n\nOne thing that really annoyed me, though:\nThe underwater effect. I assume most players don't mind it that much but it made me really dizzy at times.\nUnfortunately there are a lot of underwater effect passages - even rather long ones.\n\n\nOtherwise though - loved it.

And the game is hard enough that the power upgrades were extremely welcome - though the final armor (the hardest upgrade to get) didn't offer anything I actually used (But then maybe if I learned how to use it the final boss might have been much easier, who knows.)\n\nThe monster design is also hilariously fun if you like the Lovecraft style. I was surprised again and again at the creativity of the each boss abomination. I could totally understand being put off by the NES aesthetic, but I think it worked well enough. A lot of it reminded me of Contra's art and music style more than any other game, which is weird considering plays more like a newer Castlevania.\n\nIf I made any complaint it's that trying to find all of the secrets got a little tedious when you've checked every nook and cranny only to find out that it was behind some cracked wall the entire time - but then that's kind of a staple of many \"Metroidvania\" games.\n\n\n4 out of 5.", "timestamp_created": 1477957070, "timestamp_updated": 1477957070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26333011": {"recommendationid": "26333011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040152871", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477907694}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "good...but,So much hard", "timestamp_created": 1477908191, "timestamp_updated": 1477908191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26326895": {"recommendationid": "26326895", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998089591", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477871645}, "language": "french", "review": "I have just finished it .

I'm here to let you know what to expect.\n\neveryone else, I give this game a SITUATIONAL RECOMMENDATION. I have problems with this game but I got it for a very small amount of money from the humble bundle. I don't have a controller so that may be the problem.  \n\nI'm spoiling the gameplay, but not the story.\n\nSo right off the bat we are reminded of \"dark fantasy\" nes games like \"castlevania\". We have a great aesthetic, cool chiptune music, and an actually interesting enough story. So why is this only a situational reccommendation?\n\nWell, the game seems to really like parts of old nintendo games that I don't like. Parts that shovel knight didn't keep. The difficulty doesn't actually feel very fair thanks to giving you a lot of holes in your abilities, theres parts of the game where the gameplay changes drastically along with a corresponding difficulty spike (don't worry, it doesn't go battletoads on you, though the mine cart sections aren't fun in any way.) Further, you never feel like you have a bag of tricks ready to use on most things. You have a sword, three subweapons, and maybe a charge function if you found three secrets.\n\nYou start the game with a sword with roughly similar feel to the belmont vampire killer. similar enough range and decent attack speed, without the delay. you better love the way it feels. the only upgrades for that specific weapon are an 2x attack speed buff and a 2x damage buff. It's not like super castlevania four where you can slash diagonally.\n\nSo alright, it hits hard but isn't very versatile. This game has sub weapons though! An axe takes the place of the knife, and although it can do more damage because it can pierce through multiple enemies and bounce off a wall and still do a little damage to the guy it just hit to get to the wall, it feels too situational to be helpful. The torch takes the place of holy water! It's great! its arc is a little awkward though. And its unusable underwater. I may get back to that. The spear feels like a worse castlevania axe to me. it has a predetermined arc with the final angle being straight down rather than at an angle, which makes sense, its a spear, but it doesn't go as high as the axe. this games sprites are huge so you can't really see above you enough to miss it, but still.\n\nIf you find a super special series of unmarked secrets, you can charge them up! but it takes 10 charges(!) and you can only keep 50(!). And thats fully upgraded! And they're all very situational. The Axe makes you charge like a flash through multiple enemies, the torch makes a fire shield which damages enemies (provided they're within licking distance) and the spear is the obligatory full screen monster that you won't use often because theres never a huge amount of enemies. None of them FEEL powerful enough to be worth it.\n\nI have told you every way you can hit things now. Lets talk about the funnest part of metroidvania style things, which this kind of is, movement! It's okay. You get a double jump, a short range dash that I couldn't use well because you have to double tap a movement key, and a glide. cool.\n\nAs far as defense, you can find armor, but its not going to make you a meat shield. You can stop (most) projectiles by hitting them with your sword, which is super triumphant feeling, but you can't block melee attacks, and theres a LOT of those. your dash doesn't seem to have invulnerability frames either. And you can't heal unless you get meat or stew, and you can't carry them with you or anything. you have to buy them from a rather unfunny fellow for quite a bit of currency, or find them in chests.\n\nso as you can see, if you are attacking a very fast, very powerful melee enemy, you are at a vast disadvantage. you can't block their attacks, you're rather slow unless you dash, but its a burst dash rather than a sustained dash, theres a maximum distance. And a very powerful very fast melee enemy (though he starts shooting fire and lasers in the second phase) is the first two phases of the final boss. I couldn't get past the third phase, the first two phases always wittled me down too much. \n\nOkay, but how is the rest of the game? is the level design cool? are the secrets hard enough to find?\n\nActually, I like most of the level design. I can narrow down my complaints to two things:\n\nThe mine cart section, which is in just one level. Its a mandatory level to get to the final boss, but its managable.\n\nAnd the water sections which are in every single level of the game. They're there only to make sure you pick up a specific item to gate you from getting past them, and they're miserable. They're just miserable. They make you move slower, they remove a sub weapon from your arsenal (FIRE DOES NOT WORK UNDERWATER, BYE TORCH) and it adds this annoying woobly filter across the screen that starts moving faster if you're falling or rising. I did not like these parts.\n\nSo the game is fine. It's just fine. Not amazing. Not absolutely putrid. A little bit of a letdown, I was really looking forward to it, but a servicable game with some bits of brilliance. If this came out 30 years ago, it would have been a hit.

This is where the metroidvania aspect comes into play as you need an upgrade from further in the game to access the hidden path.  It kind of is comparable to Castlvania: Lords of Shadow style of Metroidvania, except it's far more well done.  If you've read my review of that game then you already know why I hated it, but this game does a better job at going about it.  \n\nThere's also hidden items & upgrades such as weapons, equipment, heart pieces, etc.  It even has a vendor that sells you weapons, health, & lives in exchange for souls kind of like in DMC or Darksiders, but every time you buy from him the item goes up in price making it harder to utilize him if you buy from him too much.  This I think adds a bit more strategy to the vendor making you think before you buy.  Should I buy this chicken leg or traverse through the level more in search of food myself?  Or maybe I'll just buy some more lives instead.  There's also checkpoints in each level, sometimes near the vendor & sometimes not.  When you beat a level or exit to the main menu the game auto saves.  The main menu is like an overworld in the style of Super Mario World of sorts.  You choose which level you want to go to but it also shows you how many secrets you've found & bosses you've defeated in each level.  You can go back to each level at any time after beating it.\n\nThe enemy encounters & boss fights are patternized, so once you memorize what they do it's fairly simple.  The game does have a Veteran mode for those who want a greater challenge but it recommends it for people who already beat the game as it adds new puzzles & enemy locations.  It's basically a NG+ that you can choose at any time, but without the upgrades.\n\nGameplay is simple.  You move, jump, attack & use items.  It's another NES style game where you can utulize a NES USB controller if you have one with the Classic Control Scheme. If you've played Oniken, you know what I'm talking about.  The Classic control scheme is pretty much the same as it was in Oniken.  Up+B is your special weapon, A is Jump, B is Attack, Select is swap weapon, etc.  It almost makes me with I had a USB NES controller.  You could always choose the classic style anyways though & use it with a modern controller.\n\n[b]OVERALL[/b]\n\nOverall the game so far is very good.  If you like classic style games like Oniken, you'll probably also like this game.  If you didn't like Oniken, you'll still probably like this game.  It's not as hard but is still challenging enough to have that old school difficult vibe.  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys oldskool platformers, adventure or metroidvania style games or for those looking to check out a well done retro style indie game.", "timestamp_created": 1477425958, "timestamp_updated": 1477426156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26188411": {"recommendationid": "26188411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005647560", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502273255}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.

The art alone gets Odallus much deserved attention and praise. I found the sounds and music above average as well. Granted there are a great many indie games with fantastic throwback art and sound styles. But Odallus also delivers at it's core mechanics. The controls are extremely polished and tight. So smooth in fact I didn't even find myself lamenting the atrocious 360 d-pad because I was able to use the thumbstick fine! speaking of, I would say a controller is heavily recommended here. It is easy to pick up and play but worth the effort to master. The simple story kept my attention from the standard beginnings to the gruesome ends. The level design is truly top notch and each world is varied and worth the time to explore completely for the abundant secrets. Nothing is impossibly hidden or unfairly set up for memorization and perfection. This is a nice open platforming adventure that rewards you for taking the scenic route. I 100%'d the in game check markers on the default difficulty and came away with 7 solid hours of sloppy play.\n\nWhat starts as perceived difficulty does give way to your growing boldness once you get more of a feel for it. I polished off more than one boss with my better equipment and pure attack spam. And while I don't see how you would make things more difficult without taking away continues or making things unfair, I do think the challenge ends up in the medium range for the game style. I could hardly count this against the game as there is a higher difficulty as well as achievement challenges that I admittedly won't be doing. So in the end it was the right difficulty for me, but the more self described hardcore might have to work harder for a challenge. It is a good step above casual though.\n\nAnother thing with this game is the comparisons it gets to the Old Gods of gaming. The recommended/positive reviews are ripe with comparisons to games but with little accolades for what Odallus does on it's own. I would actually stop short of calling this a \"Metroid-vania\", particularly the latter part. It draws the heaviest from those two franchises but there is plenty more inspiration as well. I felt a little of everything from Mega Man to Donkey Kong Country in there! Highlander and Blade Runner (the movies) aren't afraid to show up either. And to go even deeper with apples and oranges nonsense, the entire time I was enjoying this I was thinking \"Man, this is everything Volgarr the Viking wasn't for me\"... But. All of this is unfair. This game stands on it's own despite it's clear inspirations. While it'd be at home on a cartridge it brings new styles, enemies, and ideas. Notably that wonderful use of the widescreen format for inventory and information that most throwback games would insist throwing in a pause menu. Odallus: The Dark Call is it's own beast and deserves judgement on it's own.

La mitad de los habitantes est\u00e1n muertos o desaparecidos, y el resto han enloquecido. Tras buscar a su hijo, sin \u00e9xito, el guerrero recorre el pueblo en busca de alguna pista de su paradero e informaci\u00f3n sobre la invasi\u00f3n y su origen.\n\nCon un estilo muy marcado, clara referencia de los primeros Castlevania, nos adentramos en un juego bastante divertido y en momentos, desafiante. Desde un mapa global de la zona, iremos desbloqueando nuevas \u00e1reas que explorar, al mismo tiempo que consee guimos \u00edtems que nos ayudar\u00e1n a alcanzar lugares que al principio no son accesibles, como todo juego \u201cmetroidvania\u201d debe ser.\n\nNo hay que complicarse a la hora de jugar y juzgar a Odallus. Es un plataformas ligero, medido, que te har\u00e1 recordar aquellos a\u00f1os dorados de las primeras consolas. Bajo ese aspecto retro, el juego esta bastante pulido. Los mapeados est\u00e1n bien construidos, llenos de secretos y con detalles que le dar\u00e1n variedad a la partida. Los enemigos, sin ser un alarde de IA, tienen pautas de ataque bastante buenas, que como anta\u00f1o, nos obligar\u00e1n a fijarnos en sus rutinas y a aprender a sortearlos mediante el cl\u00e1sico \u201censayo y error\u201d. Los jefes son asequibles, aunque algunos no pondr\u00e1n las cosas f\u00e1ciles a la hora de acabar con ellos, sobre todo llegando al final del juego. \n\nEl juego cuenta con vidas, aunque una vez se acaben, podremos seguir jugando, eso si, desde el principio de el nivel en el que estuvi\u00e9ramos jugando. Los mapas pueden recorrerse las veces que se desee, y muchas veces nos pedir\u00e1n que volvamos a otro mapa anterior para alcanzar una zona a la que antes no se pod\u00eda llegar.\n\nUn punto bueno que tiene Odallus es que posee dos niveles de dificultad. En el normal jugaremos al juego de forma normal, pero en Veterano, la cosa cambia bastante. Los mapeados est\u00e1n llenos de enemigos mas poderosos que en el modo normal e incluso aparceran enemigos nuevos que dar\u00e1n aun mas guerra. Ademas los \u00edtems cambian su localizaci\u00f3n, por lo que el trazado de fases cambia por completo.\n\nCon una duraci\u00f3n de unas 7-8 horas si se quiere encontrar todo al 100%, y rejugabilidad en modo veterano, Odallus es un buen juego, cuidado y divertido. No es f\u00e1cil, legado de los antiguos cl\u00e1sicos de NES, y por todo ello, creo que es una compra recomendada.\n\nValoraci\u00f3n: 6,5 / 10\n", "timestamp_created": 1472988295, "timestamp_updated": 1472988295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25309021": {"recommendationid": "25309021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025169284", "num_games_owned": 1166, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472837623}, "language": "english", "review": "I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE A REAL XBOX 360 WIRELESS CONTROLLER, OR ENJOY PLAYING KEYBOARD.

Foi desenvolvido pela JoyMasher, est\u00fadio Brasileiro e criador de Oniken, um jogo deste mesmo estilo que fez muito sucesso recentemente.\n\nSe eu disser que Odallus foi amor \u00e0 primeira vista, estarei mentindo.\nEmbora ache extremamente competentes, n\u00e3o sou um grande f\u00e3 deste estilo de gr\u00e1ficos, de trilha sonora. E de quebra havia jogado o pr\u00f3prio Oniken e n\u00e3o tinha gostado muito.\n\nMuitas cr\u00edticas positivas e recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es diretas me chegaram neste tempo e enfim dei uma chance ao jogo.\nE que sorte a minha ter dado uma chance! De um jogo que \u201cn\u00e3o tinha muito a me oferecer\u201d, Odallus passou a ser meu novo jogo Brasileiro favorito, lista onde figuram jogos incr\u00edveis como Chroma Squad e Aritana.\n\nA princ\u00edpio Odallus \u00e9 um jogo comum, mas seu primeiro grande m\u00e9rito \u00e9 ter a consci\u00eancia de que fazer um jogo estilo 8 bits n\u00e3o garante o direito de fazer um jogo antiquado, problem\u00e1tico e com a jogabilidade naturalmente mais limitada da \u00e9poca, como acontece com muitos jogos por aqui que tentam resgatar a atmosfera da gera\u00e7\u00e3o 8 bits.\n\nO clima de jogo de 8 bits para nos visuais, nas m\u00fasicas e na nostalgia, porque  a jogabilidade \u00e9 redonda, precisa, meticulosa.\n\nO segundo grande m\u00e9rito \u00e9 um game design primoroso. Grande variedade de inimigos, boa variedade de ataques, movimenta\u00e7\u00f5es e muitos detalhes que n\u00e3o comentarei para n\u00e3o dar spoilers. Cen\u00e1rios cuidadosamente concebidos, hist\u00f3ria simples, por\u00e9m interessante, personalidade do universo criado, chef\u00f5es, etc. Odallus faz tudo certo.\n\nPara coroar o excelente game design, vem o elemento que me fez n\u00e3o conseguir largar o jogo at\u00e9 terminar: a dificuldade.\n\nComo era de se esperar, Odallus n\u00e3o pode ser considerado um jogo f\u00e1cil. Ainda que seja bem mais \u201camig\u00e1vel\u201d que seu antecessor Oniken, n\u00e3o est\u00e1 perto de ser chamado de jogo f\u00e1cil.\nPor\u00e9m a maneira como a dificuldade \u00e9 apresentada, como ela evolui, como o jogo te pune pelos erros at\u00e9 que voc\u00ea aprenda a jogar e as maneiras que ele encontra para te recompensar por persistir s\u00e3o exemplares e ao inv\u00e9s de afastar e causar desinteresse te prendem mais ainda. \n\nN\u00e3o \u00e9 uma dificuldade que est\u00e1 ali somente para quem terminar o jogo sair dizendo que \u00e9 hardcore ou a dificuldade artificial que tanto vemos em outros jogos: aquela que simplesmente multiplica inimigos na tela e aumenta suas barras de vidas, que jogam um ataque indefens\u00e1vel na sua cara a toda hora somente para que voc\u00ea tenha menos chances.\n\nA excelente jogabilidade coloca o personagem em suas m\u00e3os, fazendo com que aprender a lidar com os desafios dependa exclusivamente de sua habilidade, aten\u00e7\u00e3o e rapidez de aprendizagem. Existe sempre algo novo acontecendo, algum inimigo novo, \u00e1rea n\u00e3o explorada. \n\nSe mesmo assim voc\u00ea acha que o jogo est\u00e1 f\u00e1cil, jogue no modo veterano e com certeza ficar\u00e1 satisfeito (ou mais provavelmente deitado no ch\u00e3o em posi\u00e7\u00e3o fetal, chorando sangue).\n\nOdallus n\u00e3o tem um grande n\u00famero de fases, mas estas possuem um bom tamanho para um jogo do g\u00eanero. Se voc\u00ea jogar sem pressa e explorando, provavelmente o jogo lhe render\u00e1 de 8 a 10 horas de divers\u00e3o na primeira jogada. O backtracking e a vontade de jogar de novo contribuem para a longevidade.\n\nA evolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos desenvolvedores entre Oniken e Odallus \u00e9 vis\u00edvel e Odallus n\u00e3o apenas me deixou com um sorriso no rosto ao concluir a aventura como tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 me fazendo querer voltar, al\u00e9m de me levar a dar uma nova chance para jogos do g\u00eanero que eu n\u00e3o havia gostado antes, como Shovel Knight e o pr\u00f3prio Oniken.\n\nOdallus \u00e9 tecnicamente impec\u00e1vel e n\u00e3o deixa nenhuma ponta solta, uma execu\u00e7\u00e3o primorosa.\n\u00c9 uma alegria muito grande de tempos em tempos encontrar uma p\u00e9rola como esta perdida por aqui. Odallus tem muitas inspira\u00e7\u00f5es, mas tem personalidade pr\u00f3pria, tem alma, tem algo \u00fanico a acrescentar. \n\nVer jogos Brasileiros com este n\u00edvel de qualidade, que s\u00e3o bons sem precisarem de um \u201cempurr\u00e3ozinho\u201d ou de argumentos que elenquem as enormes dificuldades dos desenvolvedores nacionais \u00e9 motivo de alegria, otimismo e esperan\u00e7a.

SFXR's great but some more post sound editing work on those would have been great, those purple bats sound like fucking car alarms. \nTwo or three of the musics are memorable but the rest is fairly underwhelming unfortunately.

I see a lot of comparisons to CastleVania and Shovel Knight, but I struggle to see the similarities. Odallus is the type of game that looks better on paper (or in screen shots) than it performs in practice.\n\nFirst and foremost, if you are expecting a metroidvania style game, this is not it. Yes, the game does have back tracking, but it is not connected in one large world, it is hard segmented into different specific levels. This game is more similar to Demon's Crest for the Super Nintendo, which is not a bad thing, but please be aware of what you are getting.\n\nPerhaps the most critical weakness of Odallus lies within the core gameplay mechanics. It wants to be a tightly controlled NES style platformer, but it does not live up to this expectation. The controls are very responsive, and in fact feel great at first. As you progress you will however notice that the hit detection leaves something to be desired as your character is honestly, just too large. The scale of the game does not work for the type of tight manuevering and platforming that the game expects. It's certainly not the worst I have experienced, but it could be much much better.\n\nOnto the 2nd downfall, the music. Just take a look at this game. It deserves an inspired, gritty, hard cut NES synth style soundtrack. Unfortuantely the developer had a different vision. Outside of perhaps the first level, the music really has more of a dull and moody vibe. The tracks generally fail to pop out and give that punchy memorable vibe you know so well from titles like CastleVania.\n\nLuckily, despite other drawbacks, Odallus is beautiful. The art is wonderfully detailed and converys a very dark and sinistar overtone throughout the game. If Odallus has one strong point, this is it, hand down. Unfortunately, this is also what makes the game rather misleading when basing your purchasing decision solely from screen shots.\n\nOverall, I'd say the issue with Odallus is simply that...it's boring. I never felt excited about the levels, the music never got me pumped, the gameplay isn't refined enough to keep me coming back. It's a dull muddy experience that is carried by some excellent art direction. If you are going to buy this game, I recommend that you watch some videos of the gameplay first. 15 dollars is too steep, but at about 5, I'd say it's right where it needs to be. Regardless, I am not going to recommend this game as it fell short of delivering a memorable and fun experience, time could be better spent discovering old NES classics you have never played, or replaying the good ones you already know.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1471413501, "timestamp_updated": 1471413501, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651350", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24961576": {"recommendationid": "24961576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022377661", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521201970}, "language": "english", "review": "I had been waiting for a good Castlevania game for a very long time.

'nuf said.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Comments:[/b]\n\nI personally love me a good 8-bit Castlevania, even more so when it absorbed Metroid into its amorphous gelatinous mass. So I have no problem saying that \"Odallus: The Dark Call\" is a decent throwback to that entire genre. I won't spoil anything regarding the gameplay, as it's largely self-explanatory from the start if you've played Castlevania or Metroid (If not, why not?). However, there is one gripe I have with the game and that's the spike in difficulty right at the end.\n\nSo I've nearly beaten \"Odallus\" and have collected everything in the game, but that final hurdle is quite a doozy. Anyway, the fight begins with a largely equal opponent, being able to deflect attacks and special weapons is his main attraction. Basically, the player has to bait out his attacks to deal damage, which wasn't really needed in the entirety of the game up to this point but I guess that's the final bosses charm. However, his attacks are erratic and without a set pattern when they are baited out, sometimes he'll do a three-hit combo and other times just a single strike all of which throw you across the screen, go through any invincibility you may have, and take a heart each. All of this is manageable, but it's rather jarring since it hasn't come up until now.\n\nOnce that fight is done there's a little talking time, and then begins phase two which is step up the intensity scale. Your foe gets a slew of new attacks, in which he has more mobility, has projectiles, and an invincible super move along with his attacks in phase one. It's about here when I noticed that it was a lack of detail on the controls, sometimes I'd need to use the dash to get out of a situation and it wouldn't respond. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but in the final fight it can result in some serious life complications (mostly with the life part).\n\nI haven't even reached the third stage of the fight yet, but that's largely because the first two phases are a seriously long, drawn out affair. However, beyond that little spike near the end, the game is largely quite tame and can be played at a decent pace. \"Odallus\" is a decent challenge for those looking for an old school Castlevania-esque adventure, so I will recommend it even if it has that difficulty spike.", "timestamp_created": 1470396772, "timestamp_updated": 1470397030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24647673": {"recommendationid": "24647673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009025693", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501654818}, "language": "english", "review": "Please fellatio this game", "timestamp_created": 1470034904, "timestamp_updated": 1470034904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.384215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24594641": {"recommendationid": "24594641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096027225", "num_games_owned": 625, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466032145}, "language": "french", "review": "un bon jeu oldschool", "timestamp_created": 1469793909, "timestamp_updated": 1469793909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24561379": {"recommendationid": "24561379", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992049198", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470264377}, "language": "italian", "review": "Odallus \u00e8 un piccolo gioello retr\u00f2!

So I wouldn't exactly blame anyone for reading Odallus' store description and giving it a pass - but if they did, they'd be missing out on a modern classic. Odallus definitely lives up to all three of those series, and is proof you can still make games like them. \n\nJoyMasher's last game, Oniken (which I would also gladly recommend), was inspired in large part by Fist of the North Star, and Odallus has its own 80s manga inspiration in Berserk, which you can see in a lot of the enemy designs and some story ideas. You play as Haggis, a soldier-turned-hunter who returns to his village one night to find it ablaze, as a local lord has invaded, killed almost everyone, and kidnapped his son. What's worse, people are transforming into demons. It's definitely dark fantasy, which gives it a unique flair compared to Castlevania and Ghouls and Ghost (though not quite Demon's Crest).\n\nGameplay-wise, Haggis has his sword, which has a decent amount of range, as well as three sub-weapons: an axe that goes straight, a torch that goes downward and causes a fire for sustained damage, and a spear that flies up in an arc. They're all useful in their own right and can help you out a lot against certain enemies. Haggis also feels very tight to control, and while there are some tricky jumps it never felt like the game was unreasonable at all. The game's bosses also all pose a threat, but are fair about it.\n\nOdallus also has some Metroidvania elements to it, as the game's Ghouls and Ghosts map contains several bonus levels you won't be able to access immediately, and every level has things you'll need the ability to push big blocks or glide to get to. It also lets you save and head back to the map whenever you want, meaning you don't need to go through the whole level again just to find whatever you're looking for. I beat the game in about five hours, but there is an extra difficulty mode that I hear changes things up a lot. All in all, if you're jonesing for some new Castlevania stuff, Odallus could tide you over quite nicely before Bloodstained is finished.", "timestamp_created": 1462176230, "timestamp_updated": 1462176230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22733987": {"recommendationid": "22733987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062677867", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460638582}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "o jogo e muito bom vale a pena jogar .\nshow de bola.", "timestamp_created": 1462065634, "timestamp_updated": 1462065634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22582066": {"recommendationid": "22582066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003511572", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461809318}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an excellent retro platform adventure game.  It draws inspiration from many games during the NES era, while integrating some modern mechanics to keep things interesting.  Initially the homage to the first three Castlevanias is very apparent, the graphics, level select and movement all bring back a familiarity that even later Castlevania's have trouble envoking. The level design and game mechanics also pay homage to many other franchises from that era as well.  \n   Progressing through the levels I found areas that reminded me of jumping through the tree tops in Wizards and Warriors, a mythology and backdrop as rich as The Battle of Olympus and plenty of secret areas initially unaccessable which would require me to return with specific relics that allow me to perform great feats much like a Zelda game.  \n   Then there are the bosses fights.  These delightful bouts with demon knights and giant monsters will seem familar to anyone who has played Castlevania or Metroid but the boss fights also draw influence from modern games such as Dark Souls.  The patterns for some of the bosses are incredibly complex, drawing the perfect amount of anxiety between each move. I'd fumble and die many times before learning their entire cycle.  By the end I'm ducking and hanging off of edges, jumping and cleaving all in perfect sync creating some of the most fluid and dance like boss battles I've witnessed in a game. \n\nThis game has a lot of depth to it, and despite borrowing heavily from so many classic games, once the rose coloured glasses associated with the nostaligia it invoked wore off it is a well polished and interesting game that holds it's own weight.  The player has lots of control over the character, you can climb ledges and move blocks, trade with merchants, or find relics to add some extra abilities.

Come ogni gioco di questo genere che si rispetti, a inizio gioco ci si sente molto deboli rispetto allo scenario in cui ci si trova, ma i potenziamenti ci faranno sentire sempre pi\u00f9 indistruttibili.

Vous \u00e9voluerez dans un monde tr\u00e8s h\u00e9roic-fantaisy, et souvent assez glauque, en particulier vis-\u00e0-vis du design de certains ennemis. Les animations sont simples mais claires, tout comme les hit-box, ce qui va de pair avec un gameplay assez solide. Autre aspect assez bien foutu, toute l'interface est visible \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran (points de vie, armes, reliques obtenues, ...), ce qui, en plus de donner un cachet arcade au jeu, s'av\u00e8re tr\u00e8s pratique.\n\nNiveau gameplay donc, le jeu se veut action-RPG, avec une touche pour l'\u00e9p\u00e9e, et une pour le saut, rien de plus simple.

Combat is precise and rewards thoughtful play. Areas are well designed. Backtracking is well designed such that you always get rewarded for your trouble. Difficulty increases steadily throughout the game. Platforming is not cheap and punishing, but is instead a lot of fun. The setting and plot of the game is reminiscent of Berserk. If you like Symphony of the Night or Mega Man X you will be right at home here. \n\nIn-depth review:\n\nThe thing that really struck me about this game is that it is one of the fairest games I've ever played. Most other \"retro\" games nowadays bombard you with cheap deaths and bullshit enemies, but not this game. Every enemy and obstacle in the game can be overcome with precise timing, tactics, and spacing. Every enemy has an attack pattern that it will follow, which is what you as the player need to analyze and overcome. One or two bullshitty enemies aside, everything in this game fits that mold. Platforming sections are much of the same. Once you figure out what sequence of button presses you need, you can do it perfectly every time. If you can't figure out how to do it with just your sword, there are 3 sub-weapons available to help you. These sub-weapons are ranged attacks with different trajectories, similar to the knife, axe, and holy water in Castlevania. \n\nThe other thing that really delighted me was the strict adherence to the action part of the action platformer genre. The difference between an action platformer and a regular platformer is the focus on combat. No instant death pits, no knockback when you get hit, no pixel perfect jumps, etc. Though the game has a lot of platforming sections, most of them are pretty easy and straightforward. It is the combat with enemies that will wear you down. A really cool feature of this game is the ability to parry enemy projectiles by hitting them with your sword. This allows you to stay on the offensive much more than you normally would be able to because now instead of jumping all around to dodge stuff, you can stay right up in your enemies face and block all his stuff while hitting him at the same time. This adds another layer of skill to the game, as well as forcing the player to think about the risk/reward of blocking projectiles. As I mentioned above though, enemies obey strict timings in their attacks, which you can master. In the end you feel like a badass while also feeling challenged. \n\nThe last part of the game I want to talk about is the exploration and the secrets. It's really good. The game has a very open and vertical layout, more similar to Wizards and Warriors than to any Castlevania game. The game follows the same general formula as every metroidvania games. You will see a part of a level that is unreachable to you, making you say to yourself \"oh, there must be an item that lets me get that\". However, the item progression is very much non-linear in the sense that you will not get the double jump item right after you encounter you first jump that requires it. Most items like that are buried deep at the end of a labyrinth, usually requiring you to traverse a large area while hitting a bunch of switches that will lower a gate with an item behind it. The first time this happened I had no idea what to expect, each time you get an item (save for one instance) it is a complete surprise. This is a nice break from the scenario I described above where you can pretty much perfectly predict when you will get a certain item.\n\nThe reason the exploration aspect of the game is so good is becaue of the level design and layout. The level progression is basically taken straight from Castlevania 3. Every level has two exits, one that will take you to the next main level, and one \"secret\" exit that will take you to a different level. The levels aren't really secret as they are required to finish the game, but I'm going to call them by that name. I noticed that the secret levels have a higher difficulty level than the main ones, which is a nice touch because the game is designed such that you access those levels later in the game. What basically ends up happening is that you find an item in a main level, then go back through every previous level and secret level until you find a spot where you can get somewhere you couldn't before. This will often lead to another new item that will let you reach other new areas in other levels. This cycle continues until you have every item, but also gets more difficult as the later secret levels are quite a bit more difficult than the main levels. The game also tells you how many items there are to collect in each level so you don't to crazy trying to keep track, a much appreciated touch.\n\nOf couse the game is not perfect so here I will talk about the stuff that I didn't like or stuff that could be improved on. The shops in the game suffer from severe Skyrim syndrome. What I mean is that they are nice to have in the beginning of the game and can be quite useful, but by the end you will be skipping every one becuase you never have the need to buy anything. In addition to this, your gold total is ever increasing with nothing to spend it on. This isn't really a problem as much as a nitpick, but I went in expecting at least something important to be available in the shop, but the only things to buy a healing items, sub-weapon ammo, and extra lives. Nothing new is ever added. \n\nThe other thing I don't think is quite perfect is the bosses. The games combat is set up in such a way that once you figure out the bosses pattern, it becomes trivial to defeat. This is fine for regular enemies, but I would have liked to see some of the bosses with a rage mode that changed up attack timings and added new attacks. I also think some of the bosses could have done with some more health, I was able to kill some of them after just a few attacks. On the flip side though, this game has some incredibly creative and original bosses, which I love to see. At the end of the day though, defeating the bosses didn't really fill me with satisfaction as much as it filled me with the feeling that I had just completed a chore. \n\nOverall the game is fantastic and is the best retro style game I've played since they became a thing, even beating out Shovel Knight and Axiom Verge.

And to the horror of the TotalBiscuits of the world, the options menu is sparse, and only accessible before the game actually launches.\n\nTechnical problems and bugs: Odallus is picky about controllers. I ended up using an old SNES controller piped through a USB adapter. If you die during a boss fight, you'll occasionally end up with both the boss music and the stage music playing simultaneously. And after the second boss fight, I had to faff around to get the game to accept character input again - I found entering and exiting the start menu worked most reliably.

Odallus is great, but it's not for everyone. In fact, while I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of Castlevania and other games of that ilk (and difficulty), it's not without its flaws and quirks. If you can look past a handful of non-gamebreaking (though maybe you'll need to repeat a level once or twice) bugs, some questionable gameplay decisions, and a script that's as filled with errors as the average NES port, jump on in (albeit perhaps on sale; I 100% the game in less than six hours. While I prefer my games on the short side, and think $15 is a fine price point for a game of this quality, some may feel that's too high a dollar to hour ratio).\n\nSome things I liked:\nThe actual core gameplay is fantastic. Taking its cues solidly from Castlevania, but updated to be more user-friendly, combat is all about balancing offense and defense. Normal enemies are mostly easy fodder, but the boss fights range from mildly tough to rage-inducing (especially if you don't know where to hit, as sometimes it's not quite obvious [I'm looking at you final boss final form]). A handful of subweapons have varying usefulness, and you can eventually get sword upgrades that attack faster and deal more damage. \nThe platforming is pretty great too, and unlike Castlevania, you can alter your jump after you've leaped - no more sailing into the abyss. Well, you'll still sail into the abyss, but you have slightly more control over your fate.\n\nExcept for the minecart level. That's just death over and over.\n\nThe levels are all unique and all very cool. A town being razed. An icy mountain. A forest. A watery temple. Each with their own enemies, boss fights, and items and gadgets to find.  Like a Metroid-style Castlevania game, you use these items to backtrack to different locations for different upgrades and equipment, and fortunately the game is incredibly backtrack friendly. In each, there are doors to open, floors to break, and bosses to fight. But once opened, broken, and slain, they remain that way; backtracking through levels becomes fun to find the last secrets, instead of a frustrating grind through a place you already mastered. It's a great way of balancing difficulty, and makes the last level very hard, but not overly infuriating, as parts of it stay beaten even after you fail.\n\nThe soundtrack. Damn, the soundtrack is fantastic. Crunchy retro tunes really set the mood, and help you feel exactly like a barbarian trying to avenge his ruined town and dead son. Or something like that, I can't really relate. Put that on the box, not a relatable main character.\n\nSome things I thought weren't quite perfect:\nI got stuck on the minecart level a few times because if you die above ground, sometimes you get stuck and have to exit to the main menu and start that level fresh.\nSome boss hitboxes aren't well-defined.\nUpgrades aren't just a happy bonus, but damn near essential for beating the game proper. Doing it without is possible, and there are achievements for it, but I'm a casual baby and could barely beat it with all the upgrades.\n\n\nOverall, it's an excellent game, and as a big fan of Oniken (who couldn't beat it :() I'm pretty much down for whatever Joymasher does next. They truly nail the area between retro fanservice and modern quality-of-life improvements.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606", "timestamp_created": 1452166458, "timestamp_updated": 1452166458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20333998": {"recommendationid": "20333998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060317193", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452076717}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um jogo que \u00e9 PURA nostalgia.

It breaks this annoying trend with indie games where it's an excuse to have bad and lazy graphics and gameplay and just call them \"retro style\". Shovel Knight and Odallus are two of the only game's I've seen actually come close to replicating an old school 8-bit platformer both visually and mechanically. However since it mechanically plays like an 8-bit game, there are finicky 8-bit problems, like the \"sticky\" platforming for example. Odallus also takes back to days where things were so cryptically annoying sometimes it made you shut off the game until a buddy told you what to do. Some gameplay design also feels intentionally dated for no reason other than to replicate the feel of an NES game, like respawning enemies and bad pop in. These were issues with games that were either unintentional bugs or hardware limitations, neither which can be an excuse for modern PC gaming. However just as easily you can pick apart Odallus and find it's flaws, it's just as easy to fall in love with the charm of the game. The artstyle is fantastic, the gameplay is as good as it can get for it's goal of replicating an NES game, and the soundtrack is catchy and energetic. Honestly, I'm surprised Odallus launched under the radar because it is a very fun and interesting expirience that would remind many of Castlevania or Ghosts 'n' Goblins/Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts with it's punishing (and sometimes straight bullshit) gameplay.

Alors que les fans de Metroidvania pleurent la disparition des jeux Metroid/Castlevania en 2D, une lueur d\u2019espoir \u00e9mane de Odallus : The Dark Call. Contrairement \u00e0 Haggis, les Dieux ne nous ont pas abandonn\u00e9s, nous ![/b]\n\n[h1]Mon royaume pour du pixel[/h1]\n\nVoici donc le deuxi\u00e8me jeu de JoyMasher, petit studio qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 s\u00e9vi chez les PCistes avec Oniken. N\u2019attendez pas de moi une comparaison entre les deux titres, je n\u2019ai pas eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019y jouer (mais promis je me rattraperai un jour). En tout cas, pour le petit fr\u00e8re, pas besoin de tergiverser : un simple trailer du titre montre que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un \u00ab clone \u00bb des \u00e9pisodes NES de Castlevania avec sa r\u00e9alisation 100% 8-bits aussi bien sur le plan graphique que sonore. Encore une fois, les r\u00e2leurs (comme moi) peuvent chouiner sur ce choix artistique qui pullule depuis tant d\u2019ann\u00e9es qui tire trop sur la fibre nostalgique dans un but purement d\u00e9mago\u2019. Mais l\u2019avantage, au moins, c\u2019est que \u00e7a tourne sur toutes les config et m\u00eame sur le netbook de m\u00f4man. Et puis, il faut \u00eatre honn\u00eate : c\u2019est plut\u00f4t bien fichu, les d\u00e9cors et sprites sont ma\u00eetris\u00e9s d\u2019une main de ma\u00eetre et une atmosph\u00e8re r\u00e9tro particuli\u00e8rement envoutante s\u2019impose au joueur. La cerise sur le g\u00e2teau, c\u2019est d\u2019activer l\u2019option \u00ab filtre TV \u00bb qui rajoute des scanlines donnant l\u2019illusion de jouer sur une bonne vieille cathodique. Ah, c\u2019\u00e9tait la bonne \u00e9poque les 80\u2019s\u2026 m\u00eame si je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas n\u00e9 !\n\nComme le veut la tradition sur les jeux du genre, les 3 lignes de sc\u00e9nario qui servent d\u2019opening annoncent tr\u00e8s clairement la couleur : on ne va pas jouer \u00e0 Odallus pour sa narration. Malgr\u00e9 le peu de PNJs pr\u00e9sents durant l\u2019aventure, il est tout de m\u00eame fort regrettable de ne pas avoir une petite traduction fran\u00e7aise malgr\u00e9 le choix de langue entre l\u2019anglais, le russe et le\u2026 portugais. Le pitch central nous conte l\u2019histoire de Haggis qui r\u00e9clame vengeance apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un dark lord ait massacr\u00e9 son village et enlev\u00e9 son fils. Allez hop ! Direction le ch\u00e2teau du grand m\u00e9chant arm\u00e9 de notre gourdin de niveau 1. Chose tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable et qui donne le sentiment de tenir une manette NES dans ses mains : le jeu n\u2019a que deux boutons d\u2019actions. On constate d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu que les sauts sont ajustables en pleine chute, et que la physique offre de bonnes sensations loin de la lourdeur de certains jeux des ann\u00e9es 80. En revanche, on ressent une certaine rigidit\u00e9 (chose voulue je suppose) avec les coups d\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e. La majorit\u00e9 du temps, il n\u2019est pas possible de \u00ab combotter \u00bb un adversaire juste en martelant le bouton, il faudra donc opter une strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne qui consiste \u00e0 frapper et esquiver rapidement via un saut.  Pour ne pas casser les codes impos\u00e9s par les t\u00e9nors du genre, on dispose de plusieurs armes de jet (hache, torche, lance) qui se lancent en maintenant la fl\u00e8che haut et le bouton d\u2019attaque. Rien ne peut \u00eatre pris en d\u00e9faut sur la maniabilit\u00e9 : Odallus mixe les phases de plate-forme et d\u2019action avec succ\u00e8s sans que l\u2019on se sente frustr\u00e9\u2026 sauf peut-\u00eatre dans les passages \u00e0 bord d\u2019un chariot de mine qui laisse un petit arri\u00e8re-gout amer qui rappelle un certain Donkey Kong Country sur Super Nintendo.\n\n[h1]Symphony of the Knight[/h1]\n\nAu fil de l\u2019aventure, on ne peut que tirer notre chapeau aux d\u00e9veloppeurs qui se sont arrang\u00e9s pour caler ce qu\u2019il faut en terme d\u2019exploration et situations vari\u00e9es. Au joueur de r\u00e9soudre quelques \u00e9nigmes et puzzles (sans grande aide) pour progresser et toujours \u00e0 lui de trouver les upgrades cach\u00e9s comme les demi-c\u0153urs de vie dans les niveaux (et sans mini-map pour se faire guider). Il sera \u00e9galement indispensable d\u2019obtenir des reliques de double-saut, dash, etc. pour avancer et surtout terminer chaque stage \u00e0 100%. Ceci \u00e9tant, il est int\u00e9ressant de constater que Odallus n\u2019est pas qu\u2019un b\u00eate encha\u00eenement de niveaux, chaque niveau a une sortie secr\u00e8te qui donne acc\u00e8s un autre sur la wordmap. Les niveaux sont donc au nombre de 8, chacun a son propre lot de saloperies pixellis\u00e9es qui fait office de bestiaire. D\u00e9licieusement r\u00e9pugnants, chacune des zones a un mini-boss et un gros bien immonde qui rappelle souvent la belle \u00e9poque de Castlevania. D\u00e9truire ces 8 gardiens est la cl\u00e9 pour d\u00e9bloquer le niveau final. Jouissant d\u2019un challenge relativement correct pour les habitu\u00e9s du genre, Odallus n\u2019oublie pas de nous concocter un boss de fin en 3 phases assez ardues et un combat optionnel avec en r\u00e9compense une armure ultime (et un poil cheat\u00e9e). En revanche, la balance se d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 on abuse des armes de jet, surtout la torche.\n\nAu final, que puis-je reprocher \u00e0 Odallus le grand qui offre une copie quasi-parfaite \u00e0 tous les niveaux de r\u00e9alisation. Et bien mes amis, sachez qu\u2019il est dans mon devoir de chercher la petite b\u00eate. Prenons par exemple la dur\u00e9e de vie. Bien que le jeu fasse des efforts pour varier les plaisirs avec son cheminement non-lin\u00e9aire, on arrive \u00e0 une dur\u00e9e de vie plut\u00f4t maigre de 4-5h en ligne droite. Bien entendu, il y\u2019a toujours moyen de d\u00e9crocher le 100% pour allonger le plaisir mais on grappille seulement \u00e0 peine 1h de plus \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des items auront d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s durant l\u2019aventure. La question de la re-jouabilit\u00e9 se pose \u00e9galement vu qu\u2019il n\u2019y pas de modes suppl\u00e9mentaires et rien \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer apr\u00e8s. L\u2019exp\u00e9rience globale n\u2019est pas non plus sans d\u00e9faut, j\u2019ai moi-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de petit soucis de scrolling avec la cam\u00e9ra lors d\u2019une chute, d\u2019un boss qui n\u2019ex\u00e9cute pas son pattern et d\u2019un blocage plusieurs fois de suite en discutant avec le marchand. On esp\u00e8re quelques futures mises \u00e0 jour pour patcher ces petits d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments.\n\n[b]Cela va sans dire, mais Odallus : The Dark Call est une petite perle. L\u2019\u00e9quipe de Joymasher envoie une lettre d\u2019amoureux aux nostalgiques tout en respectant l\u2019h\u00e9ritage pr\u00e9cieux laiss\u00e9 par les ann\u00e9es 80-90 tout en marquant son territoire avec son univers glauque \u00e0 souhait et une r\u00e9alisation divine. En esp\u00e9rant que leur prochaine production se rapproche encore plus pr\u00e8s de l\u2019excellence.[/b]\n\nVengeurMasquay", "timestamp_created": 1447772637, "timestamp_updated": 1447772637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19035023": {"recommendationid": "19035023", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975567178", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447237005}, "language": "english", "review": "Real good combination of NES or Metroidvania styled games.

This one is a superb mix of Castlevania, Metroid, and Astyanax.  It's got a dark story about gods abandoning the world and one man's quest to find his son and reclaim what little joy there is to be had in his life.  The sprites look great and the design work for the bosses is inspired with some horrific, sometimes even Lovecraftian nightmares staring you down.  Controls are tight and superb and the game has a plethora of secrets to find, with control schemes for classic NES controller, keyboard, or modern 360 controller.  It also does away with instant death traps and pits, for the most part, only taking a bit of health when you die...so in my opinion it's more polished than many old school NES games from way back when.  There are cut scenes and I wish we had more of them, but overall, there aren't too many flaws here.  If you want an old school NES game done right, with the polish and care of true pros, I say don't be dissuaded by this games price tag.  It's only 4-5 hours long if you really drag it out, but it's well worth the price of admission.

I've probably never done this before.\ntl;dr:\nThe game is cool and it does feel like an oldskul title.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are sometimes obviously much better (as they benefit hardware wise), using capabilities that were not available back in the day.\nTheir blend of pixel-art-style is unique and somewhat strange as they intentionally used very few colors for every character and creature in the game (less than you normally would expect from an actual 8-bit title). Unlike an actual 8-bit title, the sprites don't share colors often. Each sprite has it's own set of colors and each color-set is somewhat distinct and specific to a single sprite. This makes for a very crisp and clear display that also stirs some strange emotions at times. There was something very alien at times about the graphical choices in old games and I think this bizarre use of (very few) colors captures that very well and even builds up on this making for a very unique vibe that somehow melds in my mind with 80's and early 90's Heavy Metal albums.\nThe intro animation is pretty fantastic.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is rather good. It is very enjoyable with a joypad. I'd imagine that without one (using the keyboard), it would not be so much fun probably. You constantly feel like you are freshening up on your action platformer skills. You will improve if you play carefully and pay attention to patterns, doing what you can to learn from your mistakes. \nExploring the game is fun and it is vast so there is plenty to explore for a few hours.\nThe weapon and armor upgrades feel right and the secrets are fun and rewarding to look for.\n\nChallenge:\nThe difficulty in this game could be vastly mitigated by the weapons, armor and hearts you find along the way, as well as the shops that are simply a play to grab additional health and ammo.\nSome enemies are harder to figure out than others. Some enemies are fairly easy once you understand their patterns.\nThe game isn't hard but it's also rarely too easy (although that does happen). This is subjective. Some people find it too hard and I feel there are areas in the game that are more challenging than others. Overall there are no annoying spikes.\n\nStory:\nThe story is a pretty simple plot about Dark Gods, evil demons and a lone superiorly skilled soldier made demon hunter going around, searching and slaying more and more evil creatures that happen upon his path. The texts are pretty good and fit with the atmosphere of the game.\n\nSound:\nThe sound effects and the music are good, I've never felt the urge to listen to music in the BG when I'm playing this game even though I imagine that Heavy Metal would suit this wonderfully.\n\nOverall:\n* Do you like Metroidvania games?\n* Do you prefer a gritty dark atmosphere in games?\n* Do you like the aesthetics of old games like Golden Axe and Rastan?\n\nIf you answered yes, there's a good chance you\"ll love (or like) this game.\nIt is pretty good. Don't think there is any other game on Steam that really scratches that itch. Well actually there is! Axiom Verge I believe but the two games are very different.

The stories were told through minimal pixel art and music was chip tune heaven. These games hold a special place in my heart not only because they were amazing to play as a kid, but because they used what they had for the time giving story, music, tone, and narrative through very little means. These games are accomplishments in game design as much as they are fun to play.\n\nOdallus seeks to capture the magic of games of yesteryear and bring some classic gaming nostalgia along with it. I am happy to say it does this in oodles and with it's own unique style. Odallus like the aforementioned titles is a side scrolling action/platformer, paying homage to each title in its own unique way. The story of the game is about a great warrior in a dark time, the gods have turned their back on all humanity and demons and monsters begin to reap souls to their delight. The warrior (you) must fight the onslaught of an army of darkness in search of his son. This immediately sets the tone to one of dark, gothic, horror, and this is captured perfectly. The monsters are grotesque, the architecture is strange, even the save point is a giant skeleton!\n\nOne thing that immediately caught my eye was the amazing pixel artwork in the game. Yes, the monsters are hideous and ugly but damn they look good. Cut scenes are reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden(NES) where they are told in clips and scenes that reveal more of the story of Odallus. The main game itself is simple and retro in style. Each area has a color palette and tone to it. This doesn't mean that Odallus is boring to look at, but in fact makes each area feel unique and distinct from the last you were in.\n\nThe gameplay is also rather deceptively simple, there is only about 8 buttons for you to manage, that's including the start button. You have an attack, movement and special. There are items that you can also pick up in the game like axes and torches that you throw at the enemy. Things do get a bit more complicated in the late game but I will just cover the basic experience from go. One thing Odallus excels is fantastic level design. The levels are not necessarily straight forward to the boss, rinse and repeat. Matter of fact there are plenty of paths and secrets to discover, even in the first level. This is what takes the simplistic gameplay and makes it unique and challenging. You could just rush to the boss and clear the level but if you take time to explore, gather power ups, heart pieces and other upgrades, these make future battles much easier. Power ups can be found Shovel Knight style, littered about the game, perhaps behind a hidden wall or requiring another power.\n\nSpeaking of the battles, Odallus just like games of yesterday, is damn hard! Your character isn't exactly the most agile fighter in the world. Enemies are just as dangerous as the boss, are numerous and respawn very quickly. You constantly must be on your toes or take needless damage. There are things in the level to counter act this, from shops to chests containing standard hunks of meat. There are times that I did rage quite a bit, as Odallus can sometimes have difficulty spikes. Bosses are standard as well, having patterns that once mastered become second nature. I shouldn't forget to mention the map system that let's you choose where to explore. Making returning to earlier levels easy and downright required.\n\nAll this is backed up by many modern touches and features. Rebindable keys, controller support, TV mode, and leaderboards. The UI sits on the sides of the screen displaying all important information and upgrades. This is one area that I would've loved a bit of an option on to turn on/off depending on when I needed it. This is a minor complaint and hardly an issue. The only other area that I had an issue was the start up menu. While it was easy to use, on my screen it was super tiny. Sometimes I had to squint to see what I was looking at.\n\nOther areas of the game are also given the classic retro touch, such as the sound track and sound effects. Chiptunes are plentiful having the same gothic tone. This gives the game a definite Ghoul 'N Ghost vibe and every level was like a flash back to a much simpler time. Matter of fact that's how you could just sum up Odallus. It's a flashback to a much simpler time but does things right when it comes to modern features. Things like voice-acting aren't present because that would throw off the tone of the game. \n\nThe replay and game length are solely dependent on the player's drive to find all the hidden secrets in the game. This does require retreading the same areas sometimes, so that can be seen as repetitive, but most of the time it would involve an area you haven't been through. The game can probably take anywhere from 5-7 hours depending on your skill level. \n\nI think anyone who loves retro style games will love everything Odallus has to offer. With Shovel Knight giving a resurgence to these style of games. It really deserves your attention if you are looking for something similar. While the game isn't super innovative, it masters the features that we have all come to love and expect from these types of games. From classic power ups, chiptunes, and great pixel art, Odallus brings back the old school flair with style.", "timestamp_created": 1440322173, "timestamp_updated": 1440322173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734144", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17663790": {"recommendationid": "17663790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072182182", "num_games_owned": 1715, "num_reviews": 185, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440211285}, "language": "english", "review": "A very ambitious game from the makers of [i]Oniken[/i]!

It's some of the finest pixel art you'll ever see in a game!

No son tan memorables como las melod\u00edas de, por ejemplo, Castlevania en su \u00e9poca de NES, pero est\u00e1n a un buen nivel.\nLos efectos de sonido en general tienen la fuerza suficiente para resaltar, y llaman las atenci\u00f3n las imitaciones de \"voces digitalizadas\" que hace el juego, cumpliendo a un buen nivel.\n\nEn el apartado jugabilidad es tambi\u00e9n un clara imitaci\u00f3n de un juego de NES, f\u00e1cil de asimilar, de pocos botones y responde bien. Sus mec\u00e1nicas son simples, f\u00e1cil de hacerse con ellas, y a medida que nos hacemos con nuevos objetos y habilidades estas se pueden ejecutar con bastante facilidad. Tal vez un escollo inicial es lo \"torpes\" que son los espadazos del protagonista, que son lentos y con una colisi\u00f3n bastante extra\u00f1a done la espada a veces parece quedarse corta al golpear para lo grande que es. Esto esta hecho a prop\u00f3sito para buscar las versiones mejoradas y con el tiempo nos adaptamos, pero no quita al sensaci\u00f3n de que si fallamos un golpe no es nuestra culpa, si no de lo mal que lo hace el protagonista. Es curioso como este efecto tambi\u00e9n lo encuentro en otro juego de la misma compa\u00f1\u00eda, Oniken.\n\nEn el apartado desarrollo si nos encontramos con el escollo importante. Como juego de plataformas cumple muy bien, los retos van mejorando a medida que avanzamos poniendo a prueba nuevas t\u00e1cticas y las habilidades que vamos encontrando con nuevas mec\u00e1nicas de nivel en nivel, representando un juego retante pero sin abusar de la paciencia del jugador. Los jefes son retantes, tengas o no las habilidades requisito para superarlos, y requieren varios intentos para ser derrotados teniendo de aprender sus patrones y ataques, pero resultan siempre posibles de vencer.\nPero como aventura... se queda corto, muy corto tanto a nivel de duraci\u00f3n como profundidad. Al principio todos los descubrimientos son impresionantes y te emocionas con lo que descubres. Pero una vez ha pasado la primera impresi\u00f3n, los descubrimientos se convierten en algo mecanico sin requisitos adicionales a nivel de inventiva o imaginaci\u00f3n, acostumbr\u00e1ndonos a ver \"muros que romper\" o \"bloques que empujar\", volvi\u00e9ndose todo demasiado obvio. Compar\u00e1ndolo con \"Demon's Crest\" de SNES, en ese juego hab\u00eda una serie de secretos obvios para las mec\u00e1nicas m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicas que te permit\u00edan acceder a las habilidades o objetos m\u00ednimos para completar el juego, mientras hab\u00eda otra serie de secretos m\u00e1s complejos y elaborados que te obligaban al jugador a romperse m\u00e1s el coco y masterizar las habilidades si quer\u00eda completar el juego al 100%. Aqu\u00ed se ha optado por no exprimir tanto y ser menos exigente con el jugador, siendo muy probable que termines tu primer partida con el 100% del juego completado sin dificultad y en un tiempo bastante corto de apenas 3 horas.\nAdemas, el juego no da pie a ser rejugado. Si en \"Demon's Crest\" el progreso final determinaba distintos finales para la aventura, siendo incluso posible acabarla con los menos objetos posibles, consiguiendo el final m\u00e1s malo, aqu\u00ed  solo hay una extensi\u00f3n del final normal al conseguir el 100% del juego, el cual ya se ha dicho que se consigue sin mucho secreto, y no tiene casi diferencia con el final normal. Si bien se que tiene algunos logros que aun no se han desvelado y parecen secretos, pinta que seran easter eggs m\u00e1s que algo que a\u00f1ada rejugabilidad al juego. \n\nEn definitiva, un gran juego par aquellos que buscan rememorar los dias delante de la NES o SNES, recomendable para los fanaticos de las plataformas en 2 dimensiones, pero un bocado demasiado peque\u00f1o para aquellos jugadores con ansias de aventura o de romperse el coco con un juego. \n\nPuntuaci\u00f3n: 8,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1438171644, "timestamp_updated": 1438175640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17258402": {"recommendationid": "17258402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165093399", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444541875}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um ponto que me surpreendeu nesse jogo foi a sua hist\u00f3ria, ela \u00e9 complexa, sendo apresentada por di\u00e1logos e runas escondidas nos mapas; o universo criado \u00e9 rico, interessante e sombrio.\n\nOs mapas do jogo s\u00e3o complexos e apresentam um bom desafio para encontrar todos os itens, que melhoram os atributos do protagonista ou contam a hist\u00f3ria do mundo no qual o jogo se desenvolve.\n\nO design dos mapas, inimigos e do protagonista \u00e9 muito bom, e passa bem o clima sombrio da aventura.\n\nOs inimigos apresentam um bom desafio, alguns chefes s\u00e3o complicados, mas o jogo apresenta um desafio menor que Oniken (da mesma empresa), porem os respons\u00e1veis pelo jogo j\u00e1 prometeram um modo de jogo mais dif\u00edcil ( fonte: destructoid).\n\nA trilha sonora \u00e9 muito boa e cumpre bem o seu papel, combinando com a \u00e1rea explorada no momento.\n\nN\u00e3o constatei bugs enquanto jogava, palmas para os desenvolvedores.", "timestamp_created": 1438043989, "timestamp_updated": 1438043989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17257530": {"recommendationid": "17257530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028075144", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437775923}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very, very good.

Developer Joymasher has constructed a much more solid effort in the form of Odallus: The Dark Call, a more exploration focused affair set against a swords and Satanism backdrop. Though the term \"Metroidvania\" is being thrown around with this one, Odallus actually has more in common with the NES Strider game than with pre-SotN Castlevanias. In short, it's what I had hoped Rondo of Blood would be before I learned that Rondo of Blood isn't actually that good.\n\nThe thing that makes this game click for me is, while the stages are laid in the framework of \"go from point A to point B and fight a boss,\" the areas themselves are actually quite massive and reward a bit of poking around. It follows the motif of being locked off from a certain area before collecting THE THING that opens that area up, but discovering the alternate exits in the stages that lead to their sublevels or just seeing the way the routes loop back on each other is a reward in its own right for exploration nerds. It can get a bit overwhelming at times, the game has no automap and unless you're taking diligent notes, you're going to have a bit of a time remembering where you have and haven't poked around in your search for that last secret in a given stage. However, this approach is a bit more organic and fulfilling than \"color in spots on a map\" and helps extend a rather brief game in a manner that doesn't feel tacked on. I'm not sure exactly how much is required to uncover before you're allowed to make it to the final stage, but we'll probably get a good idea with future speedruns or Games Done Quick events.\n\nThe game does have some rough edges. While controlling Haggis is responsive enough for the most part, combat can be frustrating given the short reach of your sword and the sometimes dubious hitboxes. If your experience is anything like mine, you're going to end up cheesing the hell out of a boss or two just to keep the game moving. Jumping while attacking is especially wonky, since this is one of those games where jump height is controlled by the duration of the button press. There's sometimes some weird stuff going on with the scrolling, each stage will have arbitrary spots where the screen has to quickly scroll vertically to reveal some area that's off the beaten path. The effect can be disorienting and at times even causes Haggis to jerk around like a catfish on deck. I'm also not sure if some of the grammatical errors in the admittedly over-dramatized dialog are an intentional tribute to the rushed localizations of the 8-bit era, or just natural goofs. They don't show up quite frequently enough to suggest that they are intentional, but they're about the only comic relief in a story that plays it 100% straight.\n\nIf you prefer your sprites and your gameplay decidedly on the 8-bit portion of the spectrum, definitely give Odallus a shot. Visually, it's a gorgeous game, even at its most grotesque, and it will probably hit the same kinds of buttons that Shovel Knight did for players who grew up in the pre-polygon era.

The atmosphere of the game is haunting, in the same way how Castlevania just really nailed the  feel.\n\nCons:\nIt could use more challenge. Challenge-wise, it feels more like a modern handheld Castlevania title than the original NES. Those were tough, and I miss that when I play this. EDIT: They came out with a new challenge mode, so this may be out of date.\n\nIf you're into old-school gaming, love the NES and appreciate a well-produced game, I would recommend this 100%.", "timestamp_created": 1437676787, "timestamp_updated": 1448306870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17187213": {"recommendationid": "17187213", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961218844", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437625732}, "language": "english", "review": "More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.com\n\nEver want to relive the experiences and emotions that you had when you played Ghost \u2018n Goblins on the NES or maybe the SNES version back in the day? Or maybe you have always loved a good side-scrolling challenge with a retro twist\u2026 Odallus is calling your name. It\u2019s kind of a dark calling, but it\u2019s there saying hi.\n\nOdallus starts you out on a hunt when you notice something is amiss back at home. You know how it goes though. You see some smoke at your village and you run back as fast as you can, but no matter what you do, it\u2019s always mostly gone before you arrive and all you can do is dig through the rubble. You find out that some cult of weirdos is behind it and they\u2019ve got your kid to boot! There\u2019s only one thing a man with the name of Haggis can do (yes, his name is Haggis and yes it grows on you): grab your sword and go share it with some evil creatures. Well, that\u2019s a start at least right?\n\nThe developers really went out of their way to make Odallus aesthetically old school. Odallus really looks like an 8-bit game. The way the character moves, jumps and attacks all take me back. There is obviously additions to the classic formula like weapon variety combined with the ability to switch between them and lack of pixel jumping like when a cartridge gets old or the system needs cleaning. Some things you can just leave out when you go for this genre though. There is also some secret paths that will have you coming back to the beginning of the game to find the areas with hidden power-ups or different paths to lead you through another way to get to the end.\n\nThe difficulty is probably the main thing that will grab people\u2019s attention and get them to come over to the Odallus side in the first place. (That\u2019s just a big thing currently.) I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s your usual difficulty that some Indie devs have been going for lately. A lot of the time it\u2019s a speed or overabundance of enemies/bullets/spikes that will overwhelm you in most recent \u201chardcore\u201d sidescrollers. JoyMasher hit the nail on the head with the legitimate retro feel. Odallus\u2019 difficulty seems to be based on your level of patience. Nothing will jump out of a spot that wasn\u2019t there before or what-have-you or force you to move your fingers way faster than you may be able to. It\u2019s a classic \u201cslow and steady wins the race\u201d. When you start getting frustrated and rush into things is when you\u2019ll die. Calm down and take your time and measure your enemies (bosses included). There\u2019s no time limit (thank goodness) so you have no reason to speedrun Odallus\u2026 unless that\u2019s your goal. If that\u2019s the case then, hurry up man! There is an achievement after all.\n\nScore: Gewd/Tasty!\n\nI haven\u2019t run into many issues with Odallus: The Dark Call after the few patches they put out a little after I initially downloaded the game and before it officially launched. Since then it\u2019s been smooth sailing and I\u2019ve really enjoyed myself. That, of course, is only because I\u2019ve learned to walk away after a few deaths on the same area. When I get too frustrated I tend to just walk away for a very long time. With a myriad of level types and the ability to obtain new weapons (and suck at using all of them other than the sword) there\u2019s actually a lot to experience here. There are puzzles, platforming and stabbing stuff all while pulling off the retro feel better than most, Odallus is pretty dang good. That\u2019s coming from a guy who doesn\u2019t appreciate too much of a challenge anymore either (I\u2019m getting old and just want to have fun, get off my back!) If you\u2019re looking for a nostalgia trip, a retro-themed game, or just a game that won\u2019t let you be too mindless, Odallus will satisfy your hunger.

In short the game is great. Gameplay, while having nothing really new, feels great. You have your normal sword which you find upgrdes for and three types of sub-weapons. There are no useless things in your inventory, you will find yourself using them at some point. \n\nThe difficulty is decent: it offers a good challenge without becoming a nightmare to live through. What is nightmarish, though, is the enemy design: you can find many kinds of demonic creatures, some of which people might find disturbing. Overall design seems to be inspired by Berserk manga (it's so obvious that even I, who never read it, can see that) which adds more appeal for dark fantasy fans.\n\nUPD. Veteran Mode is out and boy it is hard. New difficulty setting provides an even better challenge, introducing new enemy types and changing power-up locations. However, they also added a lil' bit of fake difficulty: bosses now summon lesser enemies to assist them which often puts you in a situation when the damage cannot be avoided.\n\nI had great fun with this game, and frankly speaking, it's the best Castlevania-like games I played in recent time, deserving a solid 9/10.\nP.S.

However, the execution is much closer to the cult classic Super Nes title, Demon's Crest. \n\nRather then taking place in one gigantic and interconnected world (ala Metroid and later Castlevania games), Odallus divides its world into a set of areas and locations, accessed one by one through exploring prior areas, like Demon's Crest. This allows the game to focus a bit more on action, crafting stages that offer multiple paths and secrets to find, but with a tighter, faster pace.\n\nThe design of these stages is very solid. None of them overstay their welcome, and usually end at just the right time. Alternate paths tend to flow into one another, so stages offer a bit of freedom of progression without the hassle of backtracking. Secrets are hidden and require some hunting, but aren't so out of the way that they take you out of the action.\n\nThe exploration is well executed, but the actual moment to moment combat and action falls into the \"good, but not great\" camp. The protaganist, Haggis, controls well enough, but he's not particularly interesting to play as either. He doesn't have any unique gimmicks to set him apart from other protaganists. He's neither very fast nor very slow, and his primary attack feels oddly laggy despite being easily cancellable. Likewise, many of the enemies and bosses Haggis faces don't require a great deal of tactics or reflexes. Basic pattern recognition will easily dispatch even the strongest foes. The battles in Odallus are enjoyable enough, but they aren't as unique or inspired as the action game titans of yore.\n\nOne place Odallus triumphs though is in its art direction. Backgrounds and monsters are rife with detail despite the simple 8-bit approach, and the whole adventure exudes a lovely dark fantasy atmosphere that's strengthened by some great boss quotes and snippets of lore scattered about.

Like Joymasher's first commercial game, Oniken, this is a true love letter to old action platformers, made with careful execution. A homage to the games like NES/SNES Castlevanias and even Faxanadu and similar ones.\n\nOdallus is an action platformer, that features quite a lot of explorable stuff, secrets, stuff to find, bosses even some puzzles. I personally wouldn't quite put this game under the label \"metroidvania\", as this is something that could've happened before Symphony of the Night came out and that label was born. I'd go as far as saying, that this is what Castlevania could've been, if it would've got another sequel for the NES after Super Castlevania IV and before the SotN. Odallus has a nice mash-up of separate levels, that aren't linear - the world is not really connected and thus the backtracking isn't as heavy. This also has in my opinion allowed the developers to do a way better level design, as the player isn't having an option to always come back the very same route. And yeah, the level design is good indeed - I never felt, that I got killed or took damage unfairly, eventhough some sections require you to be really alert. I also love the way you have to progress in this game: first you beat some worlds and later you have to FIND routes to the next ones.\n\nThere are a lot of enemy variety, and I feel, that all of them have their purpose, especially as the level design complements the enemies and their placement always. Bosses are also well executed, having a lot of variety, that forces the player to use proper tactics. Some might feel, that the bosses are a bit pattern heavy though (not me, but some might :)).\n\nLike Metroid, this game don't have leveling up. Every upgrade (weapon, armor, health, ability) you have to find. With money you can only buy secondary weapons, food and lives. Like I said earlier, this game has quite a lot of secrets, and so on, to find out.\n\nGraphics are a top notch stuff, emulating the 8-bit aesthetics pretty truthfully, especially with the TV-filter on. Soundtrack is also amazing.\n\nOdallus isn't the easiest game, but it is fair and thus really satisfying. I personally feel, that it has just the right amount of challenge, but if you're not experienced with games like these, prepare to die a lot. :)\n\nHUGE recommendation.

Let me start by saying that I have been looking forward to this game since its announcement.  That being said, the game did not disappoint me.\n\nSo what is good about the game?  It is a solid retro game.  In the full time that I played the game for my twitch stream, I did not find any real incidents where I was left scratching my head over bizzare hit boxes, goofy control issues and generally annoying bugs that crop up from rushed development.  This game is rock solid, plays well, and is pretty fair in terms of its difficulty curve.\n\nIt is very metroidvania lite, but that isn't nessesarily a bad thing.  The collectible items are evenly spaced throughout the game, so you are never left wondering when the next pickup will be.  It is also very refreshing to see that every single stage in the game (barring the first one) impliments uses for all of the ability powerups you collect in your journey.  This is not a game that gives you a powerup, and then only has you use it once to pass an obstical.  The ability uses make sense, and can be fun to work with when needed.\n\nThe controls are solid, it was entirely my controller that had me throwing sub weapons by accident (rolling D-pads are terrible), I tested the issue out on a keyboard and never had a similar problem.  The level designs are fun and engaging, and never really overstay their welcome.  Revisiting a stage will typically involve powerups that you had collected later in the game, thus movement that was bothersome before, becomes much easier, getting you to those target areas you may have missed before quicker.  The game is pieced together perfectly.\n\nThere are small puzzle solving sections in the game, lever puzzles and such, and while I was worried at first about them breaking the flow of the game, they ended up not being that much of an issue to solve.  Demon's Crest, Ghost and Goblins, and Castlevania; the games that the game takes inspiration from, are done justice as far as I am concerned.  Scattered through out the game are various tributes and nods to each of the games, without breaking immersion to the world and game setting.\n\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, the game runs like smooth butter, and the sound effects are not ear sores to listen to as you play.  All and all, as stated above, the game is a very solid package of fun, and a brilliant retro classic style game.\n\nBut its not without its flaws, and those flaws are namely small issues that will not directly impact the gameplay at all.\n\nFirst off, the game is advertised as being 4+ hours long.  My very first playthrough, I managed to not only collect 100% of the items, and clocked in at 2:57:38.  I did not speed my way through the game, I legitimately took my time to explore the game.  I enjoyed my time, but I would say that this game is more close to a comfortable 3 hour playtime.  There is no newgame+ bonuses that I am currently aware of.  Once finished, the only thing left to do is start fresh a new game.  Is three hours a bad thing?  Not for me it isn't, but I would be foolish to not assume that an advertised 4+ hour game time, being marketed at a 15 dollar price tag (at the time of this review), is pretty excessive.\n\nGiven the gametime as a whole, I would honestly recommend this game for 10 dollars not 15.  This is unfortunate, because there are so many games out there for 15 dollars that will give you more game time and value for your money.  Unless you are like me, who plans on engaging in some speedrunning to try and see if I can best my previos times, there is really only one playthrough.  Regardless if that short playthrough is fun or not, the price point is a factor in recommendations, and it may drive away some customers who would otherwise look this way.\n\nThe other issue I had was a general lack of story telling.  The game sets itself up with a pretty epic story line, but the only real spaces where that storyline is engaged are involving the begining of the game, two bosses in the game, and the end of the game.  There is really no basis for WHY your character is going out of his way to explore and collect relics and artifacts for the cause, outside of \"game reasons\".  A great opportunity to tell a story would have invovled collecting the individual \"shards\" after each boss.  Each stage boss could further the plot and add more impact to the big climax and twist of an ending.  The story unfortunately, is kinda lost in its presentation, which leaves the game standing on its only real strength which is that the gameplay is just simple and great fun.\n\nThe final issue is the difficulty.  The game is really easy.  I was never really presented with much of a threat through the entire game.  Adding difficulty options to the game may help this (and I am not saying to damage sponge the enemies to artificially inflate the difficulty).  As it stands, there are extrememly generous save points, and remarkably generous amounts of sub weapons and health power ups.  It makes the game simple and enjoyable, but sacrifices the ball busting difficulty of the titles it was inspired by.\n\nThese flaws are not game breaking problems in their own rights.  They are just observations that I had through my full playthrough of the game.  I beat it in one sitting, my audience enjoyed the show, and I will probably keep playing this title even more as I attempt to beat it in faster and faster times.  The price is a pretty heavy sale though.  I do recommend the game, but I would suggest waiting for sales to arrive unless the Developers do deside to drop the price.  10 bucks for what you get seems fair to me.  15, is a little steep.\n\nTerrific game though.

Indeed, you should not look to Odallus: The Dark Call if you want to experience the new achievements of mankind in the technology sector. Experience it when you want an unusual \"foods\" or want to evoke the feeling of playing and the \"love\" of childhood.\n----------------------------I LOVE---------------------------------\n++++++++OLDSTYLEGAMING+++++++++++\nRight from the first minute experience, Odallus: The Dark Call exudes atmosphere \"old\" with 8-bit graphics, sounds and motifs monochrome classic hero. Based on the series Castlevania inspiration (2D) or Demon's Crest, simple control mechanism with the movements, jumping, sword or use secondary weapon.\n\nOdallus: The Dark Call no factor should be the actual level of the player work period gave the game their way - more puzzle. In addition to the main task is to destroy all bosses 8 adults, Haggis also to find the secret pathways, the few puzzles (not too hard) to collect the treasure, swords and powerful new armor more. Only when equipped with powerful items, you actually become a \"monster\" in the game.\n\nEach different enemy brings about a way of moving and a separate attack. It's not just where to hit aggressive encounter that is finished, remember that in addition to the remaining bosses are born to the way people play. Can you kill a few guards but in return you can take a blood clot due to not understand their actions. Instead to flooding \"primary love\" blood drag you along boss fight, just jump overcome them and go on watching?\n\nHowever, sometimes the \"hunt\" became reluctant monster, simply because you need to collect a lot of money to buy the network, weapon accessories (torches, axes, spears ...) or recover the amount of blood lost before While wars with such dark knight.\n\nBesides, in my opinion, this is the most interesting thing, food (heals) were very scarce in Odallus: The Dark Call - do not fall off by enemies - should the store become fixed in game very important for the players. So that the frequency of actions and interactions with the surrounding environment is still very lively and not merely byway and \"sightseeing\".\n\nActually, if you're a gamer experienced, even with play style might be, the game still belongs to you only.\nOverall, Odallus: The Dark Call with fast-paced and intense. The game really has brought the challenge at the peak of the game platform to continually confuse it with you in each screen play - the meticulously arranged - along the segment calculating boss fights.\n------------------------------------DISLIKE----------------------------------------------\n++++++++++++++++SHORTY+++++++++++++++++\nI noticed that a normal player takes a few hours and was able to finish the game no-longer-that anything-to-visit-out again. Not every short too long as well, but the game will record how many the emotions?\nOdallus: The Dark Call really interesting but there is one thing that developer has not done that prolonged duration of play.

Fortunately this distant land (we'll call it Cleveland) has a weary, two-weeks-from-retirement hero... just sort of hanging outside his home village in the woods \u2013 hunting I think, waiting for purpose to show up. And when purpose descends upon his village and sets it on fire he gets off his keister to save his son. Because he's no ordinary hero. He's Haggis.\n\nNo, seriously. That's his name.\n\nHaggis, the national dish of Scotland.\n\nWere Kimchi, Pierogi, and Couscous busy or something? God I hope Borscht is alright, we go way back. \n\nAll joking aside Odallus: The Dark Call (OH, Dallas!) is pretty darn fun. Empanada visits 8 stunning, lovingly crafted levels, cutting his way through your standard sword and sorcery baddies. As you progress you'll unlock new weapons and abilities to aid Gazpacho on his quest. Some of these weapons and abilities help you access previously inaccessible areas (torches to melt ice, spears to break hard-to-reach rocks, some kind of accessory to breathe underwater).\n\nAt the end of each level Sushi must face off with a boss; they're all great looking. There's a necromorph lookin' dude and a sand worm and Mother Brain and Skeletor \u2013 all primed and ready to challenge brave Kibbeh. And while they look really cool they're kind of push overs. I'm not really good at these kind of games, never have been. But I was able to brute force a lot of these guys and kill them on the first try \u2013 so don't expect some kind of white-knuckle challenge... health and weapons and checkpoints are plentiful. \n\nAnother minor quibble is the fact that, while I can replay a level, it doesn't appear I can fight the bosses again, which is lame. And sometimes the platforming is a little loose, a little floaty. You'll make jumps you shouldn't have and you'll fail jumps you should have made. I'm playing with a controller so it might be a bit tighter on old dependable.\n\nHOWEVER, this is good fun in that same way as seeing an old friend. Sure he's showing his age and he makes unintentional gross body noises... but it's nice to take a stroll down memory lane, bask in the nostalgia for a bit, forget your troubles and just be a kid again. Odallus looks gorgeous, painted all vibrant orange, red, blue and green; not monochromatic like a lot of these \u201cretro\u201d titles look. The synthesized soundtrack is great, the monster sounds are great, and the goofy little cutscenes are great.

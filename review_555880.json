One minute i fend off one or two villians and then the other minute there is a swarm of them at once.

This game presents like pretty much any recent FPS out there but then immerses you in the action.\n\nThe controls are natural and slick, You can have weapons on your shoulders (reach back and grab), on your waist (grab at belt holster level) and then one more weapon on your lower back (reach to the small of your back and grab)\nReloading is done by simply flicking the gun up and down - this seems pretty responsive though and I haven't accidentally reloaded... yet!\nAlthough sometimes when I'm in a panic fight, I have accidentally put away a sword or swapped to a gun - this is more me than the game though, I think!\n\nMovement is done in a really nice way, its the normal press, select, release but it doesn't continue or freeze the action, it slows it down - Which means enemies moving at high speed are still coming for you, as are projectiles etc. There are plenty of configurable options for the movement too but if you go for the full movement option, jumps and bouncing off walls can be a bit disorientating at first but rapidly you get used to it and again it becomes natural.\n\nGameplay is great, you have various guns, projectiles, swords and a bow to choose from so you'll find something that suits your personal way of playing. There is character progression and weapon/armour progression too - so the more you play you can activate new traits and upgrade your weapons and armour. \n\nThe trade off...\nIts Early Access, so sometimes things can glitch, I've seen a Sumo lose all interest in me and ram a wall, and stay doing that until I put him out of his misery... I've fell through the scenery and made it back into the game... I've also fell through the scenery and watched it disappear into the abyss above while I plunge never endingly into the cityscape.\nI'm sure with a bit of effort you could break your game too and there doesn't seem to be a clean way to get back to the menu system, so its just a case of crashing out and starting again.\nOcassionally I've seen my sword be the wrong way around blade facing in, handle facing out, which renders it quite useless, but this is remedied by resheathing and unsheathing it.\n\nEven with those flaws (which I'm sure will be ironed out) I'd highly recommend this game, I've only played single player so far, but I'm looking forward to Co-oping it with friends and of course the forthcoming campaigns\n\nAs a bit of background..\nI've been waiting for games to come that peaked my interest in VR.\nWhen the Vive came with Fallout VR and Doom VR (Two of my fave series) it became a must have for me...\nSadly both of those games didn't quite do it for me - They're great but I think movement in VR is something that is still Very much under development whereas these guys seem to have gotten it just right for this game.\n\nHope that helps! :) Happy Hunting!", "timestamp_created": 1514815654, "timestamp_updated": 1514815654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544828", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38930847": {"recommendationid": "38930847", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973037073", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514510631}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most crazy and fun experiences in VR.

You have to put on an HMD, be it a vive, rift or wmr and experience these games first hand.\n\n\n8/10 needs more weapons and some foresty/more outside tilesets would be cool.", "timestamp_created": 1514277389, "timestamp_updated": 1514437994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38686141": {"recommendationid": "38686141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040864600", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1515907485}, "language": "english", "review": "THE ONE QUESTION YOU MUST ASK YOURSELF RIGHT NOW IS THIS...\n\nDO YOU WANT TO FEEL LIKE A COMPLETE FUCKING BADASS?\n\nThis game is intense, and not for the faint of heart. If you are just getting into VR, play some other shooters before you get into this, because you will need to go without training wheels. Nevermind the other locomotion options in this game. Warping is for pussies. Dashing, sliding, wall running... These are the tools of an virtually unstoppable assassin. Whether it be bullets, bows, or blades, dual wielding your choice of happy toys adds up to and end equation of fun and slaughter.\n\nBefore you are the forces of Cyber Samurai, wielding Katana hungry to cut deep through your meat, or wave slash you from a distance. Kunoichi move about cloaked in Predator tech, laying traps, and warping to close proximity to then jump in the air and throw Kunai at your face. Fatass Sumofucks sit mediating over their satisfying lunch buffet waiting to get up and any indication of an enemy, and run through you like a drunken whale. FUCKING Geisha hover around acting all hoity toity using Psychic Power to fling their fucking fighting fans at you, then warp by you far a cheap ass bitch attack when you get to close... KILL THEM ALL! Kill the other asshole enemies too, but enjoy killing the Geisha's! Seriously, those floating flying think they are better than you bitches with their sitting back and trying to KILL YOU WITH A FAN need to die. I mean really, who throws a fan? Shoot the bitches in the head. Really, they like that, their heads come off and it gives them peace. Well it gives you peace what the fuck else do you want?\n\nBasically jump around, avoid dying, kill shit, and FEEL FUCKING EPIC DOING IT! This game has the locomotion most games should have... But not all games could because, you can't be a badass fucking ninja assassin in every game. I mean imagine if Mario was a fucking badass ninja assassin. There would be no sequels. Mario would have beheaded Bowser after annihilating the entire kingdom and that would be that. No one would want to fuck with Mario or his girl after that. Besides  all this, Sairento is made by a small studio of dedicated dudes that put out a game that REALLY FEELS LIKE IT IS MADE BY A LARGER STUDIO. They take in a lot of fan input, really show they care about the gameplay, and have created something with a shitton of potential. If I could reserve Sairento 2 I would do that right now, even if it won't be out for 4 years.\n\nThese guys should wake up every morning feeling awesome, because they really outdid themselves. I am so looking forward to what is to come, because these guys STILL plan on updating the game with stuff even after the full release, and this game is already fucking awesome.\n\nSo buy this game unless you don't have the balls to experience for at least once in your life what it is like to be A COMPLETE FUCKING BADASS!\n\nOne little note, the music is meh, so I recommend turning it off, and listening to something from this list (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=epic+battle+music), this list (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yoshida+brothers), or anything hard hitting like Offspring's Smash Album or old school Metallica.

I gotta be critical of some things that bother me, before I sound off about how great being a wrecking ball in the shape of a ninja feels.\n\ni5-4690K, GTX 1070, 8GB RAM, SSD install path.\n\nI can play some of the more detailed levels, like Cemetery, with .2% Reprojection. Then, I get into some compound level that is nothing but hallways, and I'm reprojecting 50% of the time, and occasionally dropping frames. There is optimization work ahead of the team, but we are talking about Early Access, and those issues come with the turf.\n\nSometimes grabbing for a specific weapon doesn't work right. Mostly the shoulders in my experience. This can be refined. \n\nOther than being able to crank SS wayyyy up on some levels, only to be left in Async Reprojection land, with the same settings, on a more basic / less detailed instance, and the weapon grabbing inconsistency of the shoulders, I am absolutely taken by this game.\n\nI got a Vive for Black Friday, played through some Arizona Sunshine, wanted something with more RGB LEDs in it. Love Warframe, and got that kind of vibe from this titles promotional materials. I decided to buy it, expected to refund it. That said, when this game is locked to 90, it feels AMAZING! Totally VR Warframe! I went from tele locomotion, to jumping from wall to wall, following up wall runs / bounces with VR Backflips, landing on the ground and doing a groundpound. Every time I see a group of enemies, my mind FLOODS with ways I could dispatch them. Maybe I take a knee, dash forward, and use my momentum to SLIDE ON THE FUCKING FLOOR WITH PLASMA SWORDS CROSSED IN FRONT OF MY TORSO. I AM THE CUTTER OF TENDONS~! Maybe I strind teleports together with my a pistol in hand, triggering slomo, and living a moment in Tracer's shoes, while I pop up immediately behind an enemy, blow their brains out of their teeth before they can turn around, and teleport away to the next unfortunate goon! Maybe I could do a wall run, into a wall bounce off of a pillar, and do a backflip off of it, while drawing my bow, and firing an Arrow straight down an opponents spine! It's usually some kind of mix, to keep it fresh.\n\nThe game makes you feel like a god, until you crank up the difficulty in tandem with your growth as a player. It can become soul-crushingly relentless. \n\nI started with little experience in VR, and the jumping, bouncing, sliding, and all of that funn stuff is easy to get used to with bullet time. I no longer need the time distortion to do any of that, however. \n\nI am happy with my $30 spent. Some of the enemies are just... not animated well. The Sumo opponents, Assassination bots, and all of that come to mind right away. Some concepts aren't explained to you. What is that cone on the Sumo when he charges, does it mean anything? Are the bosses just anmnoyingly sponge-y, or is there something I am supposed to be doing to kill them faster? Do I care? Nah, just finna kill some more sentient Corsair Keysboards with swords, thanks. Looking forward to the Campaign, and other future updates.

I felt VR was under a bit of a lull for a while but this has reengaged my passion for it.\n\nMy only real complaint would be the AIs simplicity. It becomes easy to predict and is often incredibly stupid. I've been able to complete missions just by picking them off with a bow from a distance while they watch their comrades die and do nothing about it. Sometimes they like to stare at walls. Often you can cheese them a bit too easily by rushing to one side of the map, running them down, then rushing to the other.\n\nThat said, this is one of the best VR experiences out there right now. It can provide a true adrenaline rush in the higher difficulties, its a good workout, its challenging and theres so much fun  to be had with your approach to missions.\n\nThe publishers here really need to step up their marketing because and I only heard of it a week ago. A few of my friends who have had VR for months haven't heard of it until now either... But that might be because it's early access.

It got away from the early \"wave shooter shovelware\" issue that was (and honsetly still kind of does) plague the current offering of VR games, and I liked that a lot.\n\nI hadn't played for a while, and I know the game is still in early access but I let the devs spend some time cooking the idea, adding some vairety, etc. and I fired this back up today to see how things are going.\n\nInitially, I felt that it went from perhaps a bit on the easy side to just too far in the other direction, and was a bit too overwhelmning. I did feel the earlier builds let you take a bit too much damage, it wasn't really realistic. But now, you just get bombarded with enemies on all sides and killed without any real chance to understand what is happening before you die. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I was able to figure out that you CAN just ninja hop everywhere, liek a crazy person, to try and avoid death, fire off a shot or two, dash away again... lather rinse repeat. I Had figured out how to (mostly) not die, but realized very quickly the game was a terrible experience when played this way.\n\nI'm not one to knock a game just for being difficult, I did find the early builds a bit easy but this didn't feel any better in terms of actually having fun and felt like it would be a bad initial experience.  \n\nThe movement controls are still great and enjoyable. It just feels like, instead of really trying to figure out how to make the existing game a bit more challenging, they just bombard you with more enemies. \n\nEDIT: After some time to consider feedback from others, I went back in and gave it another shot, I was able to get much further and I figured out how to get back into a groove with this game. I Have updated my review and my recommendation of the game. The devs have made some very slight tweaks I think do make a difference without nerfing the enemies too much.

The game's role-playing elements, weaponry upgrades and overall play mechanics also all work really well together to create a wonderfully engaging and long-lasting experience.\n\nWe didn't want to put Sairento VR down, but when we did we felt like we'd burnt more calories and had more fun than we'd had with a lot of other VR games. \n\nWith the promise of more game features in future - including co-operative gameplay - Sairento VR has a lot going for it.

Being able to move around with one hand and jump/teleport with the other is one of the best feelings and the best movement I've used so far in virtual reality.

It is unique in it's movement from any other VR game I have played and I did enjoy playing, BUT I can not recommend you buy it for a multiplayer experience at the current price tag. First of all, the game was not originally multiplayer and the multiplayer is in beta. I played a few matches with some friends and it was great fun, it actually ran surprisingly smooth with the slow motion and all, but there is not enough to do for $30. There are 3 mission types and 4 maps on multiplayer. After you play 1 or 2 games you notice the repitition, the only thing to do after that is raise the difficulty. While it was fun, I will likely be refunding due to lack of content in multiplayer. I will also state that I can not truly enjoy a game when playing it solo, I almost always go for multiplayer experiences, so I AM admittedly biased.\n\nEDIT- It appears some people can not read, this review is from a multiplayer perspective, and ONLY a multiplayer perspective. If you buy this game and get more than 3-4 hours from it on multiplayer ONLY, tell me and I will be impressed. For a $30 price tag, I expect more than 15 hours of play time at the least, that would be $2 for every hour.", "timestamp_created": 1507135630, "timestamp_updated": 1507483654, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483965", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35468725": {"recommendationid": "35468725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024800960", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1515572652}, "language": "english", "review": "if i could tell myself as a child that i would have this game one day they wouldn't know what the fuck to do. this game fulfills an action hero power fantasy like no other, i could probably play this forever. put on some intense music and get to killing in style", "timestamp_created": 1507114971, "timestamp_updated": 1507114971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494700", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35454377": {"recommendationid": "35454377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054445145", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509133852}, "language": "english", "review": "Really is a great game with an active development team who listen to the community, I only hope the game reaches the vision and high aspirations the dedicated team seem to have for this title", "timestamp_created": 1507057119, "timestamp_updated": 1507057119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35448543": {"recommendationid": "35448543", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964210206", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514501236}, "language": "french", "review": "Un peu difficile \u00e0 prendre en main apr\u00e8s un jeu comme robo recall.\nAvec un peu de pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, on se rend compte qu'il y a une \u00e9norme marge de progression.

Everything is on point, from the hit detection to the art style to the weapons to the progression system to the itemization to the locomotion...The list goes on. Sairento is better than most video games not to mention VR games. \n\nIf you want to be Neo from the Matrix.... Buy Sairento.\n\nIf you want to do backflips in VR... Buy Sairento\n\nIf you want to simply feel like a bad ass....Buy Sairento.\n\nStop reading this and just buy it. You will not be disappointed.

Within 5 minutes of playing it you can tell how high the skill ceiling is based on how many things you can equip, and the various skill tree unlocks. Loot, four difficulties (with appropriate rewards), and a wide variety of potential loadouts means this game has a lot to offer. With how much I've played, I'd say I'm definitely satisfied with the game experience, and I hear it gets frequent updates from developers who really care about improving their game, so I'm looking forward to seeing and playing with it more. \n\nAs far as my impressions of how it plays, this one is at the top or very near the top of the list of VR games that make you feel like a total badass. Jumping through the air and landing multiple headshots on enemies as I soar over their heads, and then chopping a dude in half near where I land is just...it's rad. Totally rad. It's like Genji Simulator 2017, but with a hell of a lot more options for projectile weapons. Also reminds me a lot of Shadow Warrior 2, but the gameplay style works a hell of a lot better in VR. When you're the one swinging the sword and moving your arm to aim the gun and squeeze the trigger, the action gets a lot more visceral and cool. \n\nPlaying on Rift with Touch, by the way.

However, overall this is an awesome VR experience!

Nothing else quite encapsulates the feeling of flying through the air in slow motion and putting two well-placed arrows through the heads of legitimate threats with a bow that doubles as a slice-and-dice melee weapon. Despite the powerful feelings offered by the variety of jumps, wallruns, and backflips available to you, Sairento VR does a fantastic job in balancing your own godlike abilities with swarms of bullets, homing-blades, and fellow sword-wielders who can and will kill you if you don't keep moving. Mobility is key, and not once did I feel excessively \"tanky\" while playing (save, that is, for when I was playing on low-tier levels and/or at a low difficulty setting).\n\nAdditionally, though I would certainly love more unique weapons to choose from, this game does supply a satisfactory amount of tools with which to slay hordes of enemies. Pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, throwing knives, bows, and, of course, swords, with ample dual-wielding potential for almost all of these as well as \"backhanding\" for the swords, allowing for plenty of awesome combinations.\n\nAll in all, I could not recommend this game more, and though the price point is more than that of many VR games, it is worth every penny.\n\nAlso, for those on a Viveport subscription, the \"Lite\" version not only cuts content, it is a fundamentally earlier version of the game.

More variations of the fantastic enemies- they are great- just add more. Your designs are excellent.\n2. Multiplayer. I want to fight my *friends. I personally do not care to battle strangers on the net- I want to fight people I know, or even do a co-op.\n3. More environments. Again- your designs are fantastic. More, more, more!\n4. I let my friends use my Oculus to try out some games. It would be great if there were save slots- so that when I want to let them play- they aren't playing with my higher  level stuff. I want them to be able to start from scratch. Maybe there's a way to do this that I just haven't realized so far? I can put them on easy levels- but I don't want to have to reconfigure all my weapons for them, etc.\n5. Sometimes, the only thing left on the map is a hovering little bot in some obscure corner of the map that hasn't seen me yet- so I have to go jumping all around to try and find it so i can get my last kill to finish the level.\n\nThis is my first review.

Buy now game IMO; 10/10\n\nTruely makes you feel like a badass cyber ninja. In its current state its a go to every VR night game. Just to drop in an run the set of stages. I can do acrobatics and wall runs IRL; so finally having a game where I do them while shooting guns, bows, throwing weapons or sword slicing is a dream come true. \n\nThis game (at time of writing) is in Early Access; and the developer pushes out updates basically daily. These updates constanly fix the minor bugs which do appear, while typically introducing something new. \n\nThe full release is said to have a campaign, coop and multiplayer. At time of writing; this game is stages of waved enemies, survive so long, or variation on that. In its current state; easily worth the price. For the future projected state; this is a buy now recommendation. (and I basically always say wait for sale)\n\nGraphics are fantastic IMO. Levels each have their own unique feel, verticality and design. I like the enemies are varied, and are starting to have buffed versions being thrown into the mix. \n\nCurrently as usable weapons there are:\n- (3) swords\n- (3) pistols\n- (1) smg\n- (2) shotguns\n- (3) Rifles\n- (3) throwing weapons\n- (1) Bow.\n*they add weapons all the time; so this list will likley be grow\n\nYou have (5) carry locations on your body. Some having restrictions on weapon pinning (i.e. no rifle on your hip holster)\n\nThere are I think (5) current stages; but they add new ones montly it seem. Each stage feels like it's own location, offering differy ways to play through it. The latest level is huge, and offers massive verticallity; in VR this is just awesome.

Specific teired relics allow further customization of how each weapon behaves and gives you a fair amount of power to tweak your loadout. Armour has a similar mechanic: eg. boots that give you an extra jump if you want to be above the fray spaying bullets down, or wall sticky boots that allow you to gain a static vantage point and snipe.\n\nLEVELING AND FURTHER CUSTOMIZATION: Recognisable exp. leveling system opens up into a moderate skill tree that gives futher personalization of how to take on the next level.\n\nBAD GUYS: At the moment there is a satifying amount of opponents with different skills and abilities that you face. By all accounts this is only going to grow.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The game is intuitive and the most fun I have had with my Vive. Felt a degree of immersion and \"bad-assery\" like no other. Leaping into a group of Bushi's dual wielding SMG's, dodging bullets, slowing down time to draw my sword and decapitate the unlucky gunman behind me upon landing. There should be laws against this level of fun.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER/ CO-OP ETC/ CAMPAIGN: Multiplayer is apperntly on the cards, though as of writing this it is not yet instituted, and although there is no explicit story driven campaign yet (apparently planned though), the structure of the game has kept me returning through level 1 through 100 and back to do it all again. Trying new load outs, questing for that next legendary relic, changing up my skills, all compelling reasons to revisit. \n\nLOCATIONS: As of writing this there are about six locations to stage your fights. Stand out ones are a huge street level with alleys and rooftops, and a train station with randomized rooms, A hall with a fun verticle dynamic. At the moment this is an area that needs to grow, as one gets a bit of fatigue revisiting the same places, but with the developers experimenting with procedural level generation, this shows great promise.\n\nSolid 9 out of 10, with room for improvements with upcoming updates and the full release.\n\nIf you don't have it, buy it.

This is a game worthy of the expense of VR.  Early Access or not, I enjoy this a great deal - just got it yesterday.

(Looong time ago kids!)\n\nAnyway, it has an interesting upgrade system for your weapons and armor, and I found switching between weapons pretty smooth.  \n\nThe illusion of movement and not simply always teleporting around is a welcome change - including wall running, sliding after a jump, running along handrails.  \n\nThe combat is a plus and is in a good place for this stage of development - deflecting bullets, slicing fools in slow motion \"bullet time\" style, etc.  I like the adjustable difficulty and random handicaps you can sign up for, and many times the combat was simply frantic and a lot of fun.  \n\nNot a perfect game of course, but for EA - exceptionally solid and I did not regret spending the $25 bones on it.  I have spent far more for far less here on Steam.  I hope the dev keeps it going and recommend that if you are looking for something to help justify all that $$$ you spent on your VR set up, this is a good start.\n\nEA Score: 8.5/10 - After mission \"style\" scoring for the type of bad ass kills I made?

Only happened once, but it was annoying.\n\n\n\nConsiderations:\n~ This is Early Access, so there aren't as many maps as there will be when the game is fully released. Same with enemy types.

Der Test war f\u00fcr das Spiel und die Review Positiv. \nMittlerweile steige ich sogar mehr oder wenig durch, das ein oder andere entgeht noch meiner Kenntnis aber nach ca. 1,5h Played Time nicht anders zu erwarten:\n\nHier also die Aktualisierte Version:\n\nAlso ablauf des Spiels, man kommt rein, sucht sich eine der drei zuf\u00e4llig bereitgestellten Missionen aus oder benutzt die gesammelte Ingame W\u00e4hrung um 3 neue Optionen zu bekommen\n\n-Man kann zwischen 4 verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden w\u00e4hlen und das bei jeder Mission einzelt was ich sehr begr\u00fc\u00dfe, wenn ihr bock auf Hardcore habt spielt ihr so, anstrendender Tag und Chillig ein bei Ninja's nieder m\u00e4hen? Easy Mode. Nat\u00fcrlich sind die Belohnung besser je h\u00e4rter man K\u00e4mpft.\n\n- Im Level selbst kommen X Wellen oder man muss X Sekunden \u00fcberleben, \nje nach gew\u00e4hltem schwierigkeitsgrad ist das schon eine herausforderung.\n\n-Es gibt genau 3 Gegnertypen derzeit: 1 Nahkampf Schwertmeister, 1 Schotgun Heini und eine ja nennen wir sie Hexe die ebenfalls aus Distanz aber im gegensatz zum Shotgun Heini aus der Luft auf euch schie\u00dft, klingt vielleicht nach \u00d6de reicht aber um euch genug zu stressen, ich bin sicher mit der Zeit kommt noch das eine oder andere Model rein um abwechslung zu bieten.\nDieser Punkt st\u00f6rt aber nicht wirklich bei RR gibts ja auch nur 3/4 verschiedene Bots und es f\u00e4llt einem im Eifer des Gefechts nichts gro\u00df auf.\n\n- Man kann im Level aufsteigen und sich selbst bzw seine Waffen verbessern, RPG Style -> bester Punkt, so ist es z.B. m\u00f6glich gegner beim Chakra nutzen durch W\u00e4nde zu sehen, den Waffen mehr Durchschlag zu geben, Munition erh\u00f6hen etc pp wie man es kennt.\n\n- Man kann Nah- und Fernkampfwaffen w\u00e4hlen bzw. benutzt im Idealfall beides, f\u00fcr die Witches brauche ich immer eine Fernkampfwaffe, wohingegen die Schwertmeister manchmal die Kugeln mit ihrer Klinge blocken und auf euch zur\u00fcck werfen, alles ist im Loadout anpassbar.\n\n- Bietet bisher bis auf relativ kleinen Arealen (die sich wiederholen) K\u00e4mpfe, ein Typischer Kampf w\u00e4re t\u00f6te 24 Gegner, oder s\u00e4ubere alle R\u00e4ume oder \u00fcberlebe eben 60 Sekunden.\n\n- W\u00e4hrend man Chakra nutzt gibts eine Bullet Time, diese ist nicht nur Praktisch um Kugeln auszuweichen, man kriegt durch diese auch relativ coole Moves hin, da man w\u00e4hrend man z.B. gegen eine Wand springt erneut das Chakra nutzen kann um von dort abzuspringen z.B. richtung gegner um sie im Nahkampf nieder zu metzeln\n\n- Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Kritikpunk f\u00fcr mich ist das Nachladen der Waffen, was gestern bei mir garnicht gehen wollte, funktioniert heute schon deutlich besser wenn man verstanden hat wie genau(!) es von einem verlangt wird, ideal finde ich es nicht, w\u00fcrde das gern etwas entspannter haben. \nVielleicht legt sich dieses Problem aber auch nach einigen Stunden Spielspa\u00df.\n\n-Die Anpassung f\u00fcr die Touch Controller (Rift) ist noch nicht Ideal, Scrollen durch Men\u00fcs sind etwas nervig, durch leichtes dr\u00fccken scrollt man z.B. im Men\u00fc runter, dr\u00fcckt man zu stark nutzt man Snapturn, muss mal gucken ob ich das ggf. deaktivieren kann da ich ein 360\u00b0 Setup habe.\n\n-Im Schwertkampf ist die Trefferzone gef\u00fchlt nicht so prickelnd, ich stehe oft vorm gegner, treffe ihn augenscheinlich aber ingame eben nicht, was nat\u00fcrlich zu mehr stress im Kampf f\u00fchrt, bin daher ehrlich kein Freund des Nahkampfs, obwohl man mit 2 Katana (?) schon geile Moves machen kann/k\u00f6nnte\n\nDa das Spiel EA ist, seien einige Punkte zu verzeihen, es wird flei\u00dfig vom Entwickler daran gearbeitet wie ich das mitbekomme.\n\n!Alleine das der Entwickler keine 24h nach meinem Review geantwortet hat ist \u00fcberragend!\n\nAuf der anderen Seite muss ich klar sagen das ich den derzeit geforderten Preis nur bedingt nachvollziehen kann, dieses Problem haben aber auch andere Gro\u00dfe EA Titel wie z.B. Gunheart.\nEs kommt auf die betrachtungsweise an, bei RR w\u00e4re ich f\u00fcr 30\u20ac \u00fcber die l\u00e4nge ziemlich entt\u00e4usch gewesen, das ich es im Rift Bundle for Free hat st\u00f6rt mich die k\u00fcrze nat\u00fcrlich nicht,\nwas ich sagen will ist: Dieses Spiel ist Grafisch nicht so h\u00fcbsch wie RR aber daf\u00fcr bietet es mehr Content und eine langzeitmotivation wenn man alles farmen m\u00f6chte, h\u00e4tte mir das z.B. f\u00fcr RR gew\u00fcnscht.\n\nIm Sale ist es eine \u00fcberlegung Wert wenn ihr bock drauf habt und wisst worauf ich euch einlasst.", "timestamp_created": 1501617503, "timestamp_updated": 1501694674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506948", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33935234": {"recommendationid": "33935234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002097991", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507231038}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of the first games I bought for my Oculus and the game has been such an addicting expierence!

Epic. \n2) Feels like it will have some longevity.  There are skill upgrades, item upgrades, looting.  I'm interested to see how this progresses.\n3) Environment.  The areas are big enough not to feel claustorphobic.  The art style is fantastic.  I particularly enjoy the street level environment.  Neon signs, trash on the ground, you can navigate to the rooftops or back alleys... Feels like a blade runner-esque setting.\n4) Controls.  They are easy to learn.  At first, there is a lot you can do and you might find yourself unsure of what to do.  But once you have gone through a level or two jumping, sliding, and wall running become second nature.  The action is very fast, so it is sometimes hard to pay attention to running out of ammo.  But that's just because there is so much going on and is entirely based on your presence of mine.  The act of reloading is fairly simple.\n\nCons - Everything I've found so far, is something that the devs have said they are addressing as part of early access:\n1) No story.  This game is BEGGING for a cool story.  The setting is fantastic, and I would love to have some kind of story/character interaction to drive the gameplay.\n2) So far the enemy variety is small.  Again, something the devs have said are on the roadmap for full release.  I'd love to see harder boss-style enemies at some point.  With creative mechanics to defeat them.\n3) Configuration.  Other than the initial game launch, I couldn't figure out how to recalibrate my crouch level.  It may be there, and I just missed it, but it could be more obvious.\n\nAnyhow, if you have VR, I highly recommend grabbing this.  Definitely not a game to introduce someone to VR with... unless you want holes in your wall, or broken controllers.  But, it is a great example of some really fun combat.\n\nI can't wait to see this game progress through EA.", "timestamp_created": 1499408210, "timestamp_updated": 1499408210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33333281": {"recommendationid": "33333281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025308671", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503788898}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my favorite VR game to play when I want a workout....

With all the other...how shall I put it....garbage out there right now for VR, this one is worth the price. However, don't think of it as being worth the price as it is! Think of it as an investment. Updates have been nearly constant, so you're really paying to get in on the bottom floor to eventually have a full game experience. I honestly don't know if you can trust the Devs any more than those from other dead end Early Access games, but a lot of VR is a leap of faith right now. At present, the Devs' actions are speaking the loudest. They have been true to their word so far. I don't play much currently, and I probably will hold off until the campaign is released, but when it does I'll have the whole game at a fraction of the price of those who pick this up later. So, take a leap of faith (or, should I say a blind \"bullet dive\"?) and give this one a shot.\n\n****REVISION****\nI was premature in saying that I wouldn't play this game until the campaign is released. I've played more and this game is HUGE fun! I mean, it was a lot of fun the first time I played too, but I'm starting to see the immense potential even more now. I did not do this game justice in my first review. Although the levels can become quite repetitive over time, the actual gameplay is super fun. Play how you want to: Slice 'n Dice, Bullet Barrage, Spray and Pray, Ninja Robin Hood! The choice is yours, and you can do it all while making Neo go, \"Damn! I wish I thought of that!\" I don't want to insult the reader's intelligence, though. You can tell the game is fun just by watching the videos.

I'm not sure if you can hear that, but thats the sound of my mind being blown. This was not a rubber stamp response. This was a genuine response from one gamer to another, and I can't overstate how reassuring that is.

Took a little bit to learn the ropes, but it's been very fun and I have to say this is one of the most unique games I've played in VR thus far. I normally hate games with teleport, but the way it was done in this game feels so sci-fi and cool, and I was totally delighted to discovered the jumping off the walls mechanic. The feel of the haptics when reloading the gun is really cool and I had another moment of delight discovering I was equipped with swords and could slice my enemies in addition to guns. I love that the developers gave menu options for specifics with graphics, controls, and gameplay. Things like having a full-body avatar are not enabled by default but definitely improves the experience. One caveat, if you are someone who experiences VR sickness/nausea this game might be a bit intense.

I clocked about 15 hours on the cracked alpha version and that was a very barebones version compared to what the game is now.\n\nI am happy to give the developer my money as this is great VR game and has lots of hours of fun unlike a lot of games that are just an hour or two long. Saitrento has at least 10-15 hours gameplay time I can see it getting more and maybe even multiplayer one mode day.\n\nIn the 6 months or so since I've played it the developer(s) have taken this game a long way. The interface is better, the graphics are better and overall game play has much more content and just feels so much more complete. This is worth every penny and one of the best VR games out on the market. Other VR games generally feature repetitive game play or short play times Sairento does not.\n\nSairento is effectively a wave based first person shooter but it's not as simple as standing and shooting things there are actual levels to move around in rather than siting in a circle waiting for enemies to come. There are various types of enemies and four mission difficulty settings which effect rewards but offer players of different skill levels a challenge. \n\nThe game has a nice levelling and custom character load out system letting you choose many weapon types and character upgrades such as speed, health, jumping ability, ammo poll, energy and more. The weapons are as you expect melee, pistols, shotguns, sub machine guns and assault rifles. Having a sword in one hand a sub machine gun in the other slashing and shooting enemies is a lot of fun.\n\nThere are two other categories of weapons I've not yet unlocked which looked like magical powers or super hero powers of some sort. Sairento features different types of scenarios such as clear an area, wave defence or stay alive as long as possible. Level design is nice and cool too and the graphics are good even on the lower settings. Optimization is decent it runs very well on my 1080 and AMD 8350 combo so I've been able to run 8x AA and maxz settings... I'm sure it'll be just as good on older Nvidia 9 series cards and the AMD R9 3 and 4 series gpus.\n\nSome players may get a little motion sickness as there is a lot of moving around, spinning around and wall jumping to get to enemies and to avoid taking damage and gun fire. I only have a small play area so occasionally knock into my book case. I don't think it would be as fun seated so standing/room scale VR is a must to get full enjoyment out of it. Some may get bored quickly of the same three scenarios but the weapons and difficulty settings give me enough enjoyment.\n\nThink The Matrix meets Japanese Anime Cyber Shooter and you have Sairento's style to a tee. What this has over a lot of other VR shooters and wave games is there's so much more going on than pointing and shooting things. The harder difficulties require strategy, ammo management, sensible load out usage and good use of the bullet time ability. You will literally look like a crazy action hero whilst wearing your VR headset.\n\nThe only bad point or bug I've found is occasionally the pointer to select options on the main menu doesn't load after a mission and I have to quickly hit the VR Options button my VIVE controller and then close the menu to fix it.", "timestamp_created": 1497194108, "timestamp_updated": 1512421590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522786", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32335387": {"recommendationid": "32335387", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971461278", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497180186}, "language": "french", "review": "vous jouez un ninja\ndu futur\nqui ralentis le temps\nen sautant\net qui mitraille\ndes robots samourai\nle tout en VR...\n...\npourquoi vous ne l'avez pas encore achet\u00e9?", "timestamp_created": 1497161733, "timestamp_updated": 1497161733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32332139": {"recommendationid": "32332139", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982626192", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513480819}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic Game!", "timestamp_created": 1497147035, "timestamp_updated": 1497147035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32316134": {"recommendationid": "32316134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041665279", "num_games_owned": 651, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515699733}, "language": "english", "review": "Sairento VR is definitely one of the best games available for VR and one of those that you can keep returning to.\n\nThe movement system is probaly the best I've ever seen in a VR game!

This game is a blast to play.\n\nWeapon upgrades, skills, different game modes, its all very bare bones but the basics of a really fun and really awesome game are here. \n\nThis one should be more highly recognized.

While Raw Data gets a lot of publicity, this game seems to have flown a bit below the radar. It's a shame, since I'm quite enjoying it (for the record, I like Raw Data, too). I find Sariento to be a little easier to get into if I'm just looking for a quick game. The shooting is spot on, and I like the variety of weapons in your arsenal.\n\nThis game feels, to me, like a VR take on classic games like Shinobi/Ninja Gaidan ... the ability to slow time and change jump trajectory in midair feels very ninja-like. The weapons all have a good feel, though I find the sword fighting to feel a bit \"floaty\" ... but that's more of an issue with VR than this game. Since there is no real haptic feedback, I pretty much flail when using the sword. It's effective, but doen't feel realistic. \n\nI'm not super-prone to VR motion sickness, but I'm not an iron-stomach either (Hover Junkies makes me queezy after a bit) ... this game does NOT make me motion sick. Not sure why ... perhaps it's the way time slows down while jumping. I can easily play for an hour and feel fine.\n\nI do really like the reload mechanism in this game - AND the fact that they offer two options for reloading. It's better than Raw Data and Arizona Sunshine, IMO.\n\nMy gripes are few - a bit more ammo in each level wouldn't hurt - I'm not a perfect shot, so I do miss a bit, but it seems like the game is designed to force you to switch to melee by the 75% point in each mission. Also, each weapon has it's own ammo type, so there are a bunch of bullets in each level that you find, but can't use. I believe that this is a design choice, but I really like the gunplay so I'm always kinda bummed when I need to switch to swords. You could, hypothetically, load out with multiple different weapons, but I've not enjoyed that strategy.\n\nIt would be nice if you could swap your guns with guns dropped by dead enemies. That way you could improvise if you've run out of pistol ammo but just choppped up a guy with an SMG ... grabbing said SMG would be cool. (Maybe you can do this and I just haven't figure out how).\n\nBottom Line: I recommed this game - it's a ton of fun if you're looking for a new shooter.", "timestamp_created": 1492404221, "timestamp_updated": 1492404221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31186377": {"recommendationid": "31186377", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966050628", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504574045}, "language": "english", "review": "Loads of fun; a great addition to a VR collection.

It has a ton of replay value with the semi-RPG elements that remind me of Borderlands and Shadow Warrior 2. You can customize your lodout with plenty of gun and melee options as well as your armor (helmet, chest, wrists, belt, and feet) and then you can augment each weapon and armor with mods, or relics. In addition to the loadout, there are three skill trees that increase your standard things like health, health regen, ammo storage for specific weapons, loot pick-up range, enemy radar, loot radar, etc... but then there's the movement and abilities that really help to turn you into a badass ninja.\n\nWhat really makes Sairento stand apart from other shooters is the movement system/s. I love playing Warframe, and Sairento is basically a first-person VR version of Warframe, or at least the closest thing to it for VR right now. You can dash towards enemies, shooting at and slicing through them as you dash, or you can jump onto or over them, or you can wall-run pass or through them, you can jump and then trigger a double jump to a new direction, and you can even complete a landing of a jump with a combat slide and melee or shoot while sliding. In all of these actions, you can trigger a slow-motion effect if you want to really take your time in pulling off a solid headshot or lining up the perfect downward thrust of your blade down the spine of an enemy. Recently, they answered the requests of the player base and added touchpad locomotion, similar to what you're seen in Onward. This really, really helps with the melee allowing you to stealth a few enemies quietly before catching the attention of all the enemies.\n\nThe options are also well done. For audio, the music, effects, and UI are on their own sliders. For visuals you can increase (or decrease) the super-sampling level. Then you get into controls and there's a lot. You can pick your dominant hand, you can use a simple movement system or go to the advanced one and this is where you can control how sliding works, enable confort settings for teleportation, movement speed of the touchpad locomotion,  linking touchpad locomotion to head oe controller orientation, and much more.  They've really knocked it out of the park with giving players options and controll over their experience.\n\nIt's not perfect as the enemy variety and location variety could be improved, but it's got enough gameplay and locations so far that it's enough to give you a few hours of entertainment before you notice these things.\n\n5/5 Easily one of the best shooters for VR.", "timestamp_created": 1491974078, "timestamp_updated": 1491974078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569752", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31076136": {"recommendationid": "31076136", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993847308", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511946879}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to jump in a game to just shoot stuff as a scifi ninja, while avoiding cutscenes and other obstacles, this is the game to do it with.

Otherwise, you can change the settings to make the jump more teleportey.\n\nWhile I find the game to be pretty fun, it doesn't feel like a full game. I still think it's worth it just to feel like Neo.\n\nJuly 20, 2017 edit:\nThe game just keeps getting better.

seems too easy, but it's still fun. This is a game that is probably not for the beginner vr player though. With the warping around and fast movement I could very easily see some of my buddies losing their lunch. BUT! If you have had your set for a bit and have gotten your vr legs it is a fun game. Who doesn't want to be able to jump, warp and slide swinging blades and hitting slow mode to pull out your guns to finish an enemy off or just slice them up. You can progress and upgrade your armor/weapons, which is a nice feature. Let's the game have a bit more longevity with a chance to improve your skillset as well as the upgrades. It has a leveling system that let's you get upgraded perks etc also.\n\nUPDATED REVIEW\n\nIt's been a few patches and they have addressed the difficulty setttings i believe now. There were a ton of new collision problems (ie invisible walls etc. that just stopped me from playing for a bit) butttttt!!. The devs have addresssed this too. With the new difficulty and the fix on most of the collsion problems the game is superb atm. I had to reequip some of my shards on my equipment after this last patch also.

I installed it last weekend and my legs are sore from all the pivoting and crouching. I like FPS-style games and have had fun playing Bullet Sorrow, Raw Data, and John Wick. But the movement system in this game is the best I've tried for a VR FPS to date and really puts this game ahead of the other titles in this genre. Instead of simply teleporting around, you jump like a ninja and can land on things or bounce off of them and redirect in mid-air. When you land, if you crouch, you slide for a bit. \n\nOnce you get the hang of this, you start thinking like a ninja with a sword or swords in hand and instead of running from the bad-guys you start hunting them and cutting them down in a series of graceful and deadly movements that make you feel like a real bad-ass. Imagine leaping halfway across a room towards an enemy, landing into a crouching skid just in front of him, and slicing him through the middle as you glide past in a pose like the protagonist of a martial arts movie.\n\nThere is a decent variety of weapons to pick from and the guns are fun.

There are several weapon types to use (katana, pistol, sub machinegun, assault rifle and shotgun). Currently the game is pretty barebones, but what is there is extremely promising.\n\nYou select a mission type (usually either a Survival or Elimination) and are dispatched to one of the maps. They aren't particularly diverse currently and a lot are either Eastern-themed (think futuristic Tokyo) or generic warehouses. Generally your task is to find all the enemies in the stage and kill them, then head to an extraction point to escape. The enemies themselves are cyborgs which use firearms and/or swords. Difficulty ranges between extremely easy to genuinely pretty difficult, and enemies will come at you from all directions so you constantly need to watch your back.\n\nMovement is always a tricky area in VR games as it can make people motion sick very easily. Sairento gets around this by having 2 options for moving. Simple movement works like a teleport (so no movement is visible) and is designed for people easily susceptible to motion sickness. The full movement mode allows you to dash and jump. So far I haven't felt ill from it and it seems very well done. Jumping also gives you much more freedom and interesting ways of killing your enemies- you can even slide along the floor if you crouch while you're in mid-jump.\n\nWeapons feel fluid and well-tracked, though I've ditched firearms for the most part and find dual wielding katanas to be the most satisfying. You can deflect bullets, charge energy shots and attack exactly as you want to. Want to jump at an enemy and slash them as you land? You can do it. Want to hit enemies in front and behind at the same time with separate swords? You can do it.\n\nBriefly, there is also a crafting and loot element to the game- you can find relics which can be placed in your weapons (a bit like socketing in Diablo) and these give you various bonuses and allow you to find a playstyle that works for you.\n\nThe only downside I can think of with Sairento currently (other than lack of content, which is going to be addressed) is that all movement costs Focus and I found myself quite often running out of it which effectively means you can't move, aside from the small amount of Room Scale movement you can have. There are abilities to increase Focus regen but I personally don't think you should use Focus for short dashes.\n\nIncredibly immersive game so far and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops.

Basically they have created the levels, mechanics, AI, reward systems, graphics, audio and now they need to make it into a complete product tying all of this into some sort of story driven gameplay.

It ran more smoothly than I expected on my Phenom II and has very rare dropped frames when streaming it on a Ryzen 1600X with OBS at 1080p, and it has a lot of graphical enhancements I could disable if I felt the need to.  It has very short, almost unnoticeable loading screens, and nothing feels rushed or too short.\n\n[h1]Loot and skills, lots of replayability, more updates to come.[/h1]\n\nIt has a lot of replay value despite having a somewhat limited amount of stuff to do and places to visit.  Most of what you'll be doing is collecting loot and developing the character's skills/abilities and trying those skills out, but the enemies are always getting more aggressive and more complicated.  Sairento offers all the control scheme options you could hope for in a VR game, and while it causes some motion sickness and glitchiness with the jumping and fast pace, I don't want to cheapen the experience by turning the jump off.

I dont feel as though the game that I am playing is the polished  \"smooth, action experience\" that the fancy trailer illustrated. I know that there is a stellar game in here. Please deliver. I humbly object to your pricepoint for this game. Totally unready for sale yet.\n\nUpdated: 7/4/17\nHad a chance to play the updated version of Sairento a while back but forgot to update my reivew. This game is MUCH MUCH MUCH improved! The movements have been upodated and the controls are laser sharp! This team has been hard at work developing their game into what is shaping up to be one of the leaders of FPS style VR titles. Great job guys! Additionally, thank you so much for your humble hardworking attitudes. It takea humble person to accept critisim froma complete stranger, act on it and then come back and ask for more feedback. That rocks; you rock! I will continue to enjoy the great game that you all have made! \nChase", "timestamp_created": 1486705056, "timestamp_updated": 1499174460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480649", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29777916": {"recommendationid": "29777916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021550506", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515438644}, "language": "english", "review": "(Updated review for v0.5)\n\nIf you ever wanted to feel really, really epic, then this is the game for you!\n\nEven in its early access state, Sairento delivers a massive amount of fun and epic ninja-style action. There is currently no story implemented at all but you don't really need one to already have fun. The devs announced, that there will be a storyline/plot including choices. There are currently five environments which you can battle in (one of them changes everytime you play it) and there are more to come. You can choose between a rather small but diverse selection of weapons which are not simply \"bigger is better\" or \"more expensive is better\" weapons, they can actually all be used in all situations, depending on your playstyle!\n\nThe graphics are pretty solid and good looking. I really enjoyed the environment and sometimes stopped for a second to take a closer look. My system isn't a top-notch million bucks computer. It can run Vive and all of its current games with at least high, if not ultra quality and Sairento runs without stuttering, lost frames or similar problems even when on highest settings. While the latest big patch introduced a number of frame drops, the devs were very quick in providing fixes and improvement and it runs fine again, at least on my end.\nAnother noteworthy point: The player has actually an avatar, so you can see a body if you look down. So, instead of encorporating a surreal energy cloud, waving swords and floating pistols, you now actually play a person. Might not be for everyone (you can turn it off!) but I haven't seen a single other game out there which features a full player model!\n\nThe movement is the real gem in this one: You actually \"dash\" through the environment which is a cool-looking and fancyer version of teleporting, but! you can attack while you \"move\", you can slow down time while you move, you can jump over enemies, shoot them from above, land, slide some more meters and slice them up with your katana(s) while you are still sliding all in one go! It feels super-epic, certainly looks stupid from the outside and is an enormous amount of fun!\n\nThe weapon arsenal is pretty limited by now (please note the date when the review was written! 0.2 did not bring new weapons but more are planned for sure!), you have access to the usual set of pistols, katana, smg, shotgun and rifle. As it looks like, the types of weapons will stay the same but there are different versions of, for instance, handguns or swords and there are now also curently empty slots for shurikans or grenades and other stuff! They have a DPS value but that does not mean that one is better than the other! If you are an old-school ninja, you can finish a level with swords only. Prefer the gunslinger-style? Maybe also left hand sword - right hand gun?\nApart from that, there is also armor which will surely be able to be changed later, providing different kinds of protection or looks.\n\nAgain an update on the skill system: It is now a combination of relics you strap on your gear as well as skills you unlock like in any other RPG game. This allows for some interesting combinations, depending on what you want to focus your character on. There are a lot of skills and basically an infinte number of relics you can find and as such it allows the player to choose a combo that fits their playstyle best.\n\nI also have to update my final remarks:\nThis game, when I bought it, was just a very nice tech demo which was a lot of fun to play. The devs appear to work without pause and so the game did steadily evolve and develop to a now, still unfinished, but even more awesome piece of VR awesomeness. My first review version said the price was too high for it's current state, I can say that no longer. The devs are extremly active, the concept is great, a lot of progress has already been made, there is no way I could not recommend that game! \n\nThis game will, once finished, most probably define what a \"true\" VR game should be.\nIf you can play VR games and you don't own Sairento, you haven't even seen anything what VR has to offer!\n\n\nWhat's new since 0.5?\nA lot of things were added, epic, awesome and unique things. It's easier to just scroll through the changelogs on the official page. You can follow the extremly active development of the game there and get a good impression on how the game is developed.\nWhat did not change? \nIt is still THE top-notch game of its genre within VR circles, it is still being actively developed and it still has an extremly dedicated dev-team and community.\nSeriously, if you have a VR system and you don't own this game you should re-evaluate your choices in life.", "timestamp_created": 1486545511, "timestamp_updated": 1504198114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29774111": {"recommendationid": "29774111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024972019", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509144391}, "language": "english", "review": "Great gameplay.

A superb action game with a decent progression system, which rewards mobile, high-speed playstyles. A refreshing change from most shooters currently on the VR market which tend to rely heavily on cover.\n\nWith dual weilding, bullet time, melee combat and a simple but engaging loot system, there's enough content here even in the early stages of this game's development to justify reccomending this game to the vast majority of VR owners.\n\nSairento's mobility options feel very intuitive and feel extremely slick, which makes pulling off acrobatic manuvers such as double jumps, wallruns, dashes and even sliding simple and rewarding every time.\n\nOptional trackpad locomotion means that Sairento is absolutely one of the best games currently on the market when it comes to movement, as you can freely explore the level without feeling rooted in place. Even without it, the emphasis on verticality and rapidly dashing between enemies makes the gameplay feel far more dynamic than most games.\n\nThere are a few rough edges which are understandable for a game that's early in development: Sound design is fairly minimalistic, with no enemy cues and very few ambient noises. Melee combat is functional but lacks presence and weight, and there's a lack of variety in environments and enemy types, but even with these issues it's a solid, entertaining game.\n\nThe devs seem to be putting a lot of effort into making the game as good as they can, so I'm very eager to see how far they take it. As it stands, Sairento is a very interesting and fun shooter that offers an experience that makes most of its rivals feel flat in comparison.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485908084, "timestamp_updated": 1485908084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29604997": {"recommendationid": "29604997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174105265", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499072232}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u6211\u4e70\u4e86\u7684\u4e09\u5341\u591a\u6b3evr\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u505c\u5730\u7a81\u7a81\u7a81\u780d\u780d\u780d\uff0c\u4e0d\u8bba\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\u8fd8\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u90fd\u9887\u50cf\u5f71\u5b50\u6b66\u58eb\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u4ed6\u89c6\u4f5c\u5f71\u5b50\u6b66\u58eb\u7684vr\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f53\u9a8c\u90fd\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\uff1a\u723d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3avr\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8be5\u505a\u867d\u7136\u4f53\u91cf\u5c0f\uff08\u6bd5\u7adf\u4e0d\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7248\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u723d\u5feb\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7edd\u5bf9\u5b8c\u80dc\u540e\u8005\uff1b\n\u6211\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e09\u5173\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u653e\u5f03\u70ed\u5175\u5668\u53ea\u7528\u6b66\u58eb\u5200\u4e86\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6325\u780d\u624b\u611f\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u683c\u6321\u3001\u5982\u540c\u5149\u5251\u822c\u780d\u5b50\u5f39\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5251\u6c14\u6280\u80fd\u540e\u4f60\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u50cf\u6e90\u6c0f\u4e00\u822c\u5f00\u88e4\u94fe\uff0c\u53cc\u6301\u3001\u53cd\u624b\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u81ea\u5df1\u4e2d\u4e8c\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u4e00\u901a\u4e71\u780d\u4e0d\u4ea6\u4e50\u4e4e\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89c9\u5c31\u780d\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u671f\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u5f88\u8212\u670d\uff0c\u4e0d\u50cfvanishing realms\uff0c\u73a9\u4e2a\u5341\u51e0\u4e8c\u5341\u5206\u949f\u773c\u775b\u5c31\u7d2f\u7684\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u672c\u4f5c\u73a9\u4e86\u4e2a\u628a\u5c0f\u65f6\u8f7b\u677e\u4f9d\u65e7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f00\u653e\u5546\u5f88\u673a\u667a\u7684\u628a\u79fb\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e3a\u51b2\u523a/\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u77ac\u79fb\u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u771f\u7684\u662f\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u907f\u514d\u7729\u6655\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u914d\u5408\u5b50\u5f39\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4e8c\u6bb5\u8df3\u5b8c\u6210\u5404\u5f0f\u82b1\u54e8\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u60ac\u7a7a\u5c04\u51fb\u3001\u60ac\u7a7a\u6c14\u6d41\u65a9\u3001\u8df3\u5288\uff09\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u624d\u662fvr\u52a8\u4f5c\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\n\n\u6700\u540e\u8bf4\u4e0b\u81ea\u5df1\u5bf9\u540e\u671f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u6700\u7ec8\u8981\u7684\u4fbf\u662f\u5b8c\u5584\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u8a00\u4e86\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3a\u6570\u4e0d\u591a\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u6587\u7684vr\u6e38\u620f\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u826f\u5fc3\u4e86\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u672c\u4f5c\u8fd8\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u4e00\u4e9brpg\u5143\u7d20\u7684\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u800c\u8a00\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u5934\u75bc\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u81ea\u7136\u662f\u5b8c\u5584\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u4e86\uff0c\u672c\u4f5c\u7684\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u9ad8\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2a\u4eba\u8fd8\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u52a0\u5165\u65ad\u80a2\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u4f4d\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u8bba\u523a\u51fb\u8fd8\u662f\u6325\u780d\uff0c\u780d\u811a\u8fd8\u662f\u65a9\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6325\u780d\u7684\u529b\u5ea6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u654c\u4eba\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u662f\u4e00\u6837\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u6216\u591a\u6216\u5c11\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u5f71\u54cd\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb", "timestamp_created": 1485867720, "timestamp_updated": 1485867720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29599107": {"recommendationid": "29599107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991443676", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508332162}, "language": "english", "review": "Too limited in terms of replayability after getting cap level.

I think they got it wrong here - this is essentially a one trick pony right now so I have to give this a thumbs down for content versus price point. Considering all the games I have and what I paid for them, on balance, sorry but this is overpriced at around \u00a320.\n\nSince I shelled out for this, and it has promise, I'd like to see it develop much more though, so here's my constructive critiscm for the devs.\n\nWhat I liked\n\n+ cyberpunk setting (generally)\n+ sword fights (not much of a fight right now though)\n+ sliding into enemys with a death blow\n+ graphics and textures are good\n+ mocap is very good and smooth (more please)\n+ control scheme is good, and clever\n\nI'd like to see \n\n- please made it easier to switch weapon, its too cumbersome to Press button/Select/Grasp, perhaps use the left hand thumb pad\n- more rewarding sword fights (ie combos!)\n- more sword techniques rewarded (ie horz slash/vert slash/stabbing/decapitation/limbs!)\n- different enemies with unique challenges (samurai/karate master/male and female/etc)\n- bosses?\n- more focus on core gameplay less on DLC upgrades\n- Arena fights (1 v1) to develop skill and combos\n- Multiplayer\n- more game modes\n\nThings I noticed\n\n- Ammo tokens said FULL, but I seemed to be empty...?\n- during training enemy freeze/running stationary (not in game though)\n- please put a reminder on Easy levels how to open red boxes for new players\n\nFinal Words\n\n- So much promise, please make me come back :o)", "timestamp_created":

I didn't think I would be motion sick until I played the roller coaster style games. I feel good with the jumping in this game but am glad the developer included that option. It shows that companies are making progression in VR by realizing that not everyone can tolerate it. Most games have the attitude of \"not our problem you get motion sick.\" It is nice to see developers who care about the player.\n\nThe controls are not as straight forward as they could be.

Where to start? First we have weapon selection done by a floating menu rather than a pie menu. Floating menus don't work, never have, you're never going to make them work. They lack sufficent feedback to the player for them to swap weapons effortlessly through muscle memory. To top it off, accepting items in the menu is performed by the grip buttons.\n\nUsing grip for accept is intutitivly backwards. Whenever we reach to pick something up (accept) we clench with our forefingers (trigger button) we don't clench with our middle finger, which is used for the grip buttons. Furthermore if you drop something (cancel) we relax our middle finger (releasing a grip press). Accept for every game should be button down on the trigger. Cancel for every game should be button up on grip. It's more intutitive, it's more immersive, I shouldn't have to think about un-natural actions to do what I want to do in these games.\n\nOn top of this we have reload bound to shaking the remote. Was a decade of Wii games not enough to realize this is not a smart thing to do? What's even more annoying is that there's not feedback to know when you've sufficiently waggled your remote enough so you need to waggle your remote for a few seconds to get it to reload.\n\nSomething that Sairento does kind of in the right direction is using dash teleport to \"jump\", or ascend vertically. One reason why vertically aligned levels are usually bad is because there's a break in the action as you have to accilerate up, stop, then accilerate down, and stop again. It's a lot more 'clunky' than a horizontaly arranged level where you can run around without interruption. As I was saying I was looking forward to vertical assention, but instead of dashing to your location, the game falls in the same pitfall of normal jumping when there's no reason for it. If the game wants to avoid clipping it does a bad job as levels are designed with arches everywhere you're jumping it seems.\n\nAs pretty as this game is, the controls just make my head explode with rage.

Below is gameplay and commentary on Master level difficulty exhibiting typical gameplay from my VR channel.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah8KcZcpXvo\n\nI was initially cautios about purchasing this game at the \u00a319 price tag for early access. Owning Raw Data already this game seemed too similar in theme and gameplay for me to invest. Nonetheless I did and do not regret it either.\n\nSairento VR delivers fast paced, yet strategic sword-and-gun gameplay that really allows a players individual style to shine through. Unrestricted to 'classes', players level up and can diversify in any element they wish... gunplay, swordplay, slo-mo... by placing skillpoints you can improve bullet-time duration, durability, special skills such as bullet reflection and even force-wave katana slash capability.\n\nComparable to Raw Data, it has elements of Max Payne, Super-Hot, Bullet Train, Dishonored, Red Steel. Its unique aspect is the liberal application of bullet-time as a staple of gameplay. It can be triggered without cooldown, allowing you the player to adjust the high-speed pacing in the moment. This allows you enough time to 'design' your next combat moves and pull them off... leading to that ultimate feeling of VR badassery. This title delivers heavily on that! \n\nAnd the combat moves can be combined in many creative ways, with blink movement, ninja high-jumping and user-controlled slow motion in combination with firarm and melee attacks, roomscale bullet-dodging and katana deflect results in an intense cyber-ninja with enough skill you feel like you can truely command the action in a cinematic fasion.\n\nThe visuals are mid-tier, but the soundtrack and gameplay more than make up for it. RNG Epic Legendary style loot system common in RPGs is here, which keeps you hunting for that next weapon or upgrade. Character leveling slowly progresses the challenge difficulty, but brings new powers and capability.\n\nI expect to be playing this game for a long time because of the unique gameplay. I would reccomend to anyone who like intense action games and will be following the development of this game closely, with more videos to come on my channel.\n\nGood Job Swag.", "timestamp_created": 1483730881, "timestamp_updated": 1483730881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29067590": {"recommendationid": "29067590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194651307", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502476703}, "language": "english", "review": "played on GTX 1080 i7 6700\nroom scale 4mx4m\nHTC vive\n\nVR is finding its feet , and its feet are definately with a gun in one hand and a sword in another.

A lot of big improvements have been made in many areas, but most importantly of all they have fixed melee in a way where it is still strong and fun without ruining the rest of the game. You actually have to swing now, enemies actually block now, and that means it's no longer just mindlessly teleporting to victory with your sword pointed out in any random direction. Switching this to positive now as my primary complaints have all been addressed, excited to play more and see how it stands up with time. \n\nOLD REVIEW (negative):\nThis game is okay, it's almost really good. I like the movement, the jump mechanic, the menus, and a lot of the general ideas. It has one flaw but that one flaw is so huge it really kind of destroys the entire game for me: it's absurdly easy. I don't just mean it's not competitive or challenging, even on the hardest setting it seems impossible to ever die. \n\nI'm sure you could lose if you stood next to a couple enemies and refused to take out a weapon, but I can't imagine anyone with any experience in playing a VR game would ever die once on any mission unless it was intentional. That flaw makes the itemization completely irrelevant. It makes using any of the guns completely pointless. It means there is never any strategy or any skill involved in the gameplay at all. \n\nTo make it worse you don't really even need to hit anything with melee: you just point a controller out in a general direction and the monsters effectively kill themselves. Imagine having a lightsaber that instantly killed anything within a foot of it, so powerful you accidently killed people more often than you did intentionally. Now remove how fun that sounds and what you have left is the melee combat in this game.\n\nAt half the price I'd likely recommend it for all the things I do like about it, and I hope that at some point I can switch this review to positive because the game has potential, but until it becomes actually possible to lose a mission at least once on the hardest settings I just can't see any replay value beyond a couple hours of screwing around. If you at least had to swing the absurdly overpowered swords around it would at least be entertaining, but as it is you just kinda stand still and win by default.", "timestamp_created": 1483376789, "timestamp_updated": 1500521211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508723", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28938440": {"recommendationid": "28938440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017843875", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501925221}, "language": "english", "review": "It's basically just a tech demo at the moment, but the combat mechanics are rock solid and really fun.", "timestamp_created": 1483359911, "timestamp_updated": 1483359911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535063", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28938347": {"recommendationid": "28938347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149733807", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494612435}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my faviroute VR games with the vive, i havent played many wave shooter so take this with a grain of salt but this seems unique with the slow mo dives combined with the katana, if the katana wasnt in this game it would be mediocore, the only complaint i have is the small ammount of maps i think there is 3 or 4 not including tutorial map.", "timestamp_created": 1483359728, "timestamp_updated": 1483359728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535063", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28924869": {"recommendationid": "28924869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069656464", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496082257}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm usually terrible at leaving reviews for games, but this is a game I am really excited to see development on.

It is only teleportation, no Onward locomotion. But works fine. This might get patched in. There at the moment 3 different maps. Loot. Weapon modification. Exp level up system. Different difficulties. Gore, Splatter. Samurai Swords. Ninja style jumping and guns guns guns. From the moment on I started the game I was hooked. Stayed 2 hours in VR until my legs and arms hurt. Love to go back. Need to slice more Ninjas. Performance is great. Double swords. Dual gun wielding. More loot.\n\nEarly Access and the road ahead described by the developers look very promising.\n\nHappy that I can support them.

I'd recommend a visual highlighter once you reach 3 enemies left or similar.\n- Sometimes, the jump path isn't perfect, leading to clipping through objects, stairs and floors.\n- The mission rewards aren't given out automatically but locked in one of the chests around the level that opens upon completion. Please highlight those as well or at least make it known to the player that they might miss their loot.\n- I reached level 25, and there aren't a lot of guns as of now. I hope that will change in the near future. \n\nThe Ugly:\n- When guns collide with the other gun or with the environment, it might happen that they completely bug out and fly over the place, breaking the otherwise extremely well-executed immersion.\n\nDespite its flaws, it was definitely worth purchasing and I'm looking forward to whatever might come in 2017.", "timestamp_created": 1483242901, "timestamp_updated": 1483242901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535063", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28884772": {"recommendationid": "28884772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116090688", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515303001}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the closest I've ever come to being inside an over-the-top action film.

I squeeze the grip buttons while jumping, before jumping, before activating jump, etc, and I get it to fire maybe 10% of the time.\n\nKilling with the sword requires no force.  You just touch an enemy with it and they go down.  Vanishing Realms VR has instituted this kind of mechanic where the controller needs to move a certain distance before actually inflicting damage.\nI think the current mechanics can be improved via the same mechanic, as well as using the blink for momentum/force.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a fantastic game already that is only going to get better.

I can\u00b4t describe the feeling( maybe godlike awesomeness)( everything while fighting and shooting)\nThe 2nd is the best and the icing on the cake. You can now if you want go slightly down to trigger a slide after a jump. Do you know how it feels when you jump of a roof run on 2 different walls jump again to land on the street and slide past an enemy while killing him with the sword. And while you glide you turn arround and slide the last meters backwards. (no words....)\nYou have to try this game. Performance was good, so they must have fixed the issues.

Honestly, it might be the single best VR action game out to date! It's very simple: You are given a submachine gun, a sword, and a pistol, all of which can be dual wielded (there is also supposedly a rifle and shotgun, but they are nowhere to be found in my game).  [EDIT: I found them, it's just a little unclear at first how you're supposed to collect them as mission rewards.  Both of them are extremely fun and badass.]  You are then thrown into a map in which your only objective is to slaughter everything that moves.  Now I wouldn't *DARE* accuse this of being one of the many generic wave shooters on the vive.  This doesn't apply to that just because it's so...goshdarned GOOD!! \nSomething that blows my mind constantly about this game is to how many unique and seamlessly-blended gameplay mechanics there are.  There's a dishonored/overwatch-tracer-esque blinking movement system.  There's slow-motion.  There's a loot collection system where you can find many runes that affect your weapons' different stats. It nails first-person shooting.  The sword feels hefty and slashing people is gory and satisfying.  You can charge lasers to blast enemies.  You can use the swords to reflect bullets back at them.  \nThe one thing, however, that seriously sets this game apart from every other VR wave shooter, is just how smooth it runs.  The game is perfectly optimized.  It looks absolutely beautiful for a VR title, and constantly runs at a flawlessly 90 or so frames per second.  The jumping and blinking feel perfect.  The combat is absolutely ideal and surpasses all expectations, feeling exactly how you would want it to be.  \nThere's only one- one SINGLE FLAW I can think of, and it's the boss fights.  They're easy and tedious.  A single bullet stumbles the boss and then he just stands there taking all your hits.  However, this isn't a deal breaker at all as boss fights are a very minor part of the game anyway.\nThis is the one game on the Vive that I keep coming back to.  There is literally nothing like it.  If you can get any one game, this is definitely it.  \nI don't understand how this isn't shattering the VR box office.

I do like the way jumping is implemented and the bullet time leaps are extremely cool, but I seemed to have issues consistently pulling it off. I'm assuming there's some sort of colldown so you can't do it repeatedly, but I didn't notice any indicator when it was ready. If it doesn't have a CD, then I'm not sure what I was doing wrong. When it works, though? Definitely very cool. (edit: Have played again since and the bullet time seemed to work much more consistently)\n\nShooting feels solid and accurate, which is always a good thing. I haven't unlocked more than the first couple of weapons yet but they feel decently satisfying to use. There's at least some variety in mission types but for the most part it just comes down to killing x number of enemies. The maps are reasonably large and quite often when you're down to the last enemy in a wave/level you end up having to hop around hunting them down, which is mildly aggravating. \n\nHaving been reasonably critical, I'm still willing to give it a recommendation. It's not as polished as Raw Data, but it's also significantly cheaper then Raw Data, it's still in very early access and I don't think any of the issues it has are beyond fixing.

I'm kind of not happy that level 20 doesn't mean max stats, because it doesn't seem like there's any good reason to put in a level cap at all, except to limit replayability!\n\nThe game is very easy - even on the harder difficulties. If you're looking for a challenge, look elsewhere. EDIT: I've made a mistake here - I didn't realise the game had an overall difficulty setting, which I think I set to NORMAL on the very first time I played it. After setting this to HARD or MASTER, the game becomes satisfyingly tricky. The \"difficulty\" I was talking about earlier is the challenge level of the missions, which has a rating out of 10 - not the game difficulty. \nEDIT Sep 2017: This game has come a long, long way since this review, and the game's difficulty has been completely fixed. Expect a solid challenge which encourages ample use of bullet time \"acceleration\".\n\nThe reason you pick up this game is for the rule of cool. For the fun of jumping and firing your guns in bullet time, for taking double swords and slicing and dicing. I have to hope that later on in development, the swords require a bit of a swing before they kill - you can just teleport into bad guys with your sword out and they'll likely drop, and if they don't, a little bit of a wave will finish them off. For this reason, you can actually add a bit of challenge by using guns instead of the sword. I regularly used a gun in my right hand and a sword in the left to reflect any wayward bullets, which felt fantastic.\n\nReflecting bullets using the sword is kind of cool and requires a bit of a knack to do it.

But if you choose, mid-jump you can tap the teleport key again and get bullet time to adjust your course for some very ninja percision strikes. \n\nPros:\n-You get to leap through the air, and land on two enemies with a sword in each of their heads.\n-Good swordplay and gunplay, depth in both options.\n-When I first saw the controllers being portrayed as gloves I thought it was going to be weird, but while weilding weapons It felt far less floaty than other games.\n-Weapon upgrades, loot, item shops, skill points are all already in game, not some distant Early Access promise.\n-Feels rewarding for physically active play (as long as you don't put yourself through a bookshelf)\n-Mission system that is reminiscient of Payday 2's map selection.\n\nCons:\n- There are a lot of upgrades to melee weapons that increase the 'hitbox' of their block, extending it past the visible model. Which is ok when blocking enemy bullets, but confusing when it starts blocking your own bullets.\n- The blur from dashing starts to stress my eyes to where I prefer jumping more, maybe have an option for a tunnel vision style dash.\n- I get more woozy moments jumping around than I do from Windlands, I think because doesnt feel physics based but shoots you 'on a rail' based on the arc of movement.\n- Gun sights are hard to use and too bright for the dimmer atmosphere of the game to see past.\n- Holding two already charged sword attacks at once makes me feel like I'm holding a blender from the vibrations.\n- I could not make tea with the teaset in the dojo.", "timestamp_created": 1482600326, "timestamp_updated": 1482600326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535063", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28558505": {"recommendationid": "28558505", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976517583", "num_games_owned": 671, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498782067}, "language": "english", "review": "Blink, slice, jump, slice, blink, shooooot, doublejump, shoot in slomo while in midair-doublejump, smile, blink, sliiiiice.....happy i checked it out :)))\n...but you can also try to play stealthy, it\u00b4s up to you...\nAWESOME\nAnd don\u00b4t forget to search for all upgrade-boxes after clearing the stage^^\n\nGreat fun this game is, the fastest and simply the best splatter-action i had in VR till now.\n\nLooking forward for MORE ;)))\n", "timestamp_created": 1482494426, "timestamp_updated": 1482494426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28553792": {"recommendationid": "28553792", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968245554", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515045948}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite fun in its current state, but I'm interested to see what kind of stuff they add to it.

You wanna talk about feeling badass?? Once I figured out double jump...This game looks to be VERY promising if this is only early access as is. I see this game clearly getting in the way of some of my other great VR games for playtime. I feel like Snakeyes, Raiden and anyone else you can throw in there for the savagery I release upon my foes. The enemies have cool animations too. Like coming down with an overhead strike or blocking your bullets with their swords. And it looks really cool when they die in slow motion. Great music to get you into the zone as well. I have particular fun flying in on an enemy's exact spot and landing a nice sword strike. I even finished a match like this from the air and I could swear I even had a believable pose to match! Definitely feels satisfying. I kept wanting to reload more and more matches whether elimination or survival. Wasn't sure how this game was gonna pull off the jumping mechanics I had heard about but my god i was VERY pleasantly surprised by how smooth it functions. Unless you are EXTREMELY sensitive to motion sickness and or have a dislike for ninjas guns and stealth kills, i can't see you going wrong with this one.

It's an easy comparison to make, but this developer just hits the nail on the head when it comes to -really- reliving your childhood fantasies. Including the mall-ninja vibe. The only thing missing are chase sequences on Akira-esque motorcycles and katana's.\n\nTHE GOOD :\n[list]\n[*]Very decent graphics and art direction. Maybe not in everyone's alley but the game already has a lot of polish. The maps look great.\n[*]Straightforward UI. Nothing fancy but neatly designed. Switching weapons works surprisingly well.\n[*]On the fly (literally) slow motion. It gives you so much more 'artistic freedom' ;) Playing this in real time, all the time, would end up in a spazz-fest, ripped curtains and broken lamps included.\n[*]Focus on single player. There quite some VR shooters which appeal to me but most of them are multiplayer only, and have a steep learning curve. This game makes you feel bad ass in the first minute of play. \n[*]It feels like most of the core mechanics are there, and work well. This game is ripe for more content, so that's promising.\n[/list]\n\nTHE BAD\n[list]\n[*] Useless iron sights/dots. Resolution wise it would make sense to make the sights a bit bigger, wider and simpler. The triple red circle reddot on the pistolis just defeating it's own purpose.\n[*] More required momentum for the sword hits. I know this is hard to tackle, but there were multiple instance where enemies just walked into my blade and died. I guess it's just really sharp. \n[*] Choppy animations. Enemy movement feels to 'skatey', and transitions into attacks are very choppy. Needs more weight and momentum. Could make sword duels a bit more engaging. \n[*] A.I. : It isn't bad. But it could use some work, for variety sake. Make them dodge, roll into corners, duck, take cover, whatever. Right now they feel way too static. Also, just make them STOP walking sometimes. You know, just pause. Because they feel like a horde of magnets coming towards me.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1482430842, "timestamp_updated": 1482430842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

It's fun to have incentives through loot and leveling but I want to stress something extremely important to game devs out there. And that is this: STOP WASTING YOUR TIME MAKING WAVE SHOOTERS!! That's enough there is already enough.. just make games that are like any other good FPS game and put it in VR! That's what people want. DOOM 3 BFG and Half Life 2 are the best VR games I've ever played and they're not even technically VR games but they are games!  These VR games are not games they're just mindless boring experience with no incentive to keep going once we get the gist of it. Doom 3 and half life PROVE that conventional fps game build work very well in VR  with a few minor tweaks are incredibly fun in VR and also bring new life to the game they work extremely well and are very fun. Please devote your time to making games like this for VR instead of wave shooters or variations of wave shooters this is a horrible  VR trend that I hope dies out very soon.

You will feel like a badass ninja in this game. It has easy locomotion and advanced locomotion that has jumping attacks and movements. You can \"double jump\" also which is basically changing your landing spot while in mid air. You may feel a little queezy with the sprint as they have a fast effect when you use it but after playing for a while I adjusted to it. When you are in the action you are not really paying attention to the effects much unless stabbing someone after sprinting at them. I didn't know about this game before today. Glad I jumped on this. For the more hardcore players it has harder difficulties. So far there are 3 maps. Two game mode types. You can kill people while in movement which is cool. And also kill while you are jumping in the air. If you like instant action this is it. It is not hard for people to pick up. The graphics are pleasing too. Any issues I had are in discussions. None that make me want to refund it. I say buy this and try it out. Help give the devs some ideas as well as fixes and tweaks. This definately has a lot of potential with a \"new\" VR play style. Enjoy. \n\n\nI'll have video up soon:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Bn0X89PEHWQ", "timestamp_created": 1482345123, "timestamp_updated": 1482355151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476399", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28512414": {"recommendationid": "28512414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075402136", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491556523}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely interesting.

However, the movement in Sairento VR is so smooth, that I experienced literally NO motion sickness while playing the Tutorial, and first 2 missions; and trust me, I was taking FULL advantage of the movement system in this game.

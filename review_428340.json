But yes, I come to Hexels because they have all-in-one toolset from making grid-based pixel art asset/concept to animating them. Even that I use the cracked version 2.03 quite a long time ago before actually bought Hexels 3 on Steam (since trial time wasn't enough when I forgot to use it) just to make sure  it's getting better right now ( and indeed, it's ).\n\n:: Rating ::\nMy experience with Hexels 3 was quite good, although I haven't used much. \n\n:: Pros ::\n+ The toolset was very simple and easy to use.\n+ Kinda light-weight  and light-performance  on usage.\n\n+ Animation was pretty comfortable to use.\n\n+ GLOW : \nspecial feature to glow your pixel art like HDR.\n\n+ Flexible Brush setting and sizing the same to Photoshop.\n\n+ Selection / Scaling / Photoshop basic tool-like... are all included !\n\n+ Good Layer functionality : \nalike to photoshop, including blending mode.\n\n+ Many Grid Modes : \nSquare / Hex / Trixel .... this actually what made Hexel unique.\n\n:: Cons ::\n\n- BUG: \nI still see crashing on first saving ( if I move or change the UI )\n\n- COLOR PICKER :\nFor now, only 2 modes are included, which I don't like much.\nI expect a more useful color picker, like Photoshop's CMYK or a Hexagram of dimming color.\n\n- Not yet Flexible UI : \nas you can't really \"Dock\" Color panel to the left ( I'm left hander ! ) \nand main toolset UI bar is fixed to the left.\n\n-  A bit expensive at some regions : \n50$ ? are you kidding me ? \nAlso I bought during sale :)\n\n- STEAM ONLY : stick to Steam license and you can't link to use standalone.\n\n:: Verdict ::\nI recommend this great tool to any indie artists, \nwho is struggling with Photoshop complicated Timeline \nor just want a compact too specially made for pixel art !\n\n* P/S to developers : \nI really hope you guys improve features and stable performance in the future release :)", "timestamp_created": 1514581525, "timestamp_updated": 1514581846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38833046": {"recommendationid": "38833046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400579517", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515443050}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u7528", "timestamp_created": 1514579358, "timestamp_updated": 1514579358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38805014": {"recommendationid": "38805014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422034435", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514391061}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud53d\uc140\uc758 \ud3ed\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uae09\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0.\n\uc774 \ud234\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804\uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5c6\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4  \ud3ec\ud1a0\uc0f5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uc904\ub9cc  \uc548\ub2e4\uba74 \uae08\uc0c8 \uc4f8\ub9cc\ud55c \ud53d\uc140 \uc544\ud2b8\ub97c \ubf51\uc544\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.\n\ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uc138\uc774\ube0c \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc544\ubb34 \uacf3\uc5d0\ub098 \ubc30\uce58\ud588\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc598\ub124\uac00 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc77d\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc810 \uc815\ub3c4.\n\ud234\uc5d0 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ub4dc\ub808\uadf8\ud574\uc11c \ub123\uc73c\uba74 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc18c \ubc88\uac70\ub86d\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1514519359, "timestamp_updated": 1514519359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38785439": {"recommendationid": "38785439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041821586", "num_games_owned": 562, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514908739}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun program to use.

Si has trabajado con p\u00edxeles en el pasado, seguro que te suena el utilizar Illustrator para crear im\u00e1genes vectoriales e importarlas en Photoshop para texturizar, renderizar y a\u00f1adir glow. Y s\u00ed, puedes configurar Photoshop para trabajar con p\u00edxeles y realizar animaciones sencillas frame-by-frame, pero su cuadr\u00edcula es muy limitada y encima poco precisa tanto para dibujar con el rat\u00f3n como desde tableta. Al final es m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo trabajar con Illustrator creando figuras geom\u00e9tricamente compatibles con pixel-art, y luego darle ese estilo pixelado manualmente. Por \u00faltimo, b\u00fascate una buena suite para animar en 2D, lo suficientemente potente como para poder trabajar con escenas amplias, pero con una curva de aprendizaje \u00f3ptima y un precio medianamente decente...\n\nClaro que existen soluciones completas en el mercado, aunque las mejores est\u00e1n orientadas bien a animaci\u00f3n 2D tipo cartoon que tienes que adaptar a tu trabajo con p\u00edxeles, o si no a la creaci\u00f3n de sprites y animaciones para videojuegos limitando el tama\u00f1o de las escenas y en muchos casos las opciones de exportaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, vete sumando el precio de cada herramienta de software adicional que debes adquirir con su correspondiente tiempo de aprendizaje para conseguir manejarla con cierta solvencia. \n\nCon Marmoset Hexels llevo trabajando poco, pero no quer\u00eda pasar la oportunidad de recomendarla ampliamente viendo que es escasamente popular. Es extremadamente vers\u00e1til a la hora de trabajar con patrones preestablecidos e incluso creando los tuyos propios, tiene un sistema de animaci\u00f3n frame-by-frame bastante m\u00e1s potente que el de Photoshop, con algunas opciones avanzadas de renderizado, texturizado y glow. Interfaz no destructiva y un sistema de trabajo por capas y multiframe que resultar\u00e1 muy c\u00f3modo a quien venga de trabajar con software de Adobe.\n\nEn definitiva, es una EXTRAORDINARIA aunque muy espec\u00edfica herramienta. Es todo lo que necesitas para dise\u00f1ar y animar pixel-arts a un nivel casi profesional (solo echo de menos algunas opciones m\u00e1s avanzadas de texturizado y renderizado, a\u00fan as\u00ed se puede exportar a .psd y solucionarlo en Photoshop) agrupando una docena de excelentes ideas que antes ten\u00edamos que ir parcheando saltando de un programa a otro o haci\u00e9ndolo manualmente.\n\nSolo decir que da gusto trabajar con herramientas creadas por y para gente que se va a dedicar a utilizarlas. Se nota el mimo por el detalle en muchas de sus funciones, a destacar por ejemplo la enorme flexibilidad del sistema de cuadr\u00edcula y supercuadr\u00edcula que tiene, con varias funciones avanzadas que dejan en evidencia programas con presupuestos multimillonarios como PS.", "timestamp_created": 1495811441, "timestamp_updated": 1495811441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31889471": {"recommendationid": "31889471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022246511", "num_games_owned": 1859, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496694135}, "language": "german", "review": "Das erste Programm, dass mir Freude an der digitalen Bilderstellung macht, sonst bin ich eigentlich eher der Bleistiftvertreter!\n\n10/10 von mir :D \nLeicht zu bedienen und trotzdem grenzenlose Einsatzm\u00f6glichkeiten.", "timestamp_created": 1495395254, "timestamp_updated": 1495395254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31830207": {"recommendationid": "31830207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077624382", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489938521}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game", "timestamp_created": 1495145185, "timestamp_updated": 1495145185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.265163", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31800778": {"recommendationid": "31800778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264128255", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495723273}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting specialized art / animation program!

Thumbs up, even at it's full price. It's arguably more fun than Black Ink which I like (don't fully understand it, but I'm trying :P) and certainly more usable for certain styles, and for a lower price.\n\nI got it as part of a humble bundle (which I mainly bought for Spriter Pro, this was an added bonus), so I don't know if I'd have made the purchase at full price first off, but after having used it for a couple of hours (which you can do as part of their trial version) I already know I'll get loads of fun out of this program, and so if I'd gone the trial route I'd probably have bought it soon after anyway.\n\nAll I've done so far is made a couple of quick animated GIFs with the software, and I can see that it's really suited to that, as well as still pieces. Though I'm having loads of fun with the animation as it's the first ever art software I enjoy animating within. I'll get back to doing still pieces with it in the future and maybe re-review it then.\n\nI could see someone who spent long hours working with this be able to create insanely intricate scenes and animations. And there's no real learning curve for a beginner, even if I do come from a digital art background (I mainly use Krita and Black Ink), I could see it being a fun program for a non traditional artist to excell in (though I'd be interested to see what the traditional artist could make with it.)\n\nFor those of you who think it doesn't look versatile, it can do a lot more than you might think at first glance. In fact you can make pieces so smooth they don't look like they were even painted with hexels or trixels (the main painting mode). It also has a well developed pixel art mode. It also has a user customisable shape mode where you can make the most insane looking paintings known to mankind.\n\nAnimation is super easy. Compared to many tools with animation options (such as krita 3 which I love for still art but abhor for animation) the process of learning how to make somewhat decent animations is very fast. My first piece was a minecraft/fez style isometric block world with a working day night cycle, my second, a dragon breathing fire down onto a warrior, who backs up and raises their shield. Other than watching a couple of artists videos for inspiration the night before, I worked through zero tutorials.\n\nI use a pen monitor (Ugee 1910b) with it, though many awesome artists (including Mark Knight who I mention later) use just a mouse to draw their creations, which makes this program especially suited to a beginner digital artist who may not own or want to buy even a cheap drawing tablet.\n\nIf you want to see some awesome artworks made entirely in this software I reccomend you check out Mark Knight's Hexels youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/redcastle60187) and Tumblr page. He's the reason I decided to give it a go. He makes amazing art based on film and video game scenes, objects and characters.\n\nHope my review was somewhat helpful, and if you buy Hexels that you get as much enjoyment out of it the first few hours as I have :D", "timestamp_created": 1488054544, "timestamp_updated": 1488054544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30088399": {"recommendationid": "30088399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088653606", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506631638}, "language": "english", "review": "started up the latest update and my antivirus detected a Generic virus. is this normal because it's the very first virus warning ive had on this pc other than this alarming event ive been happy with the software and recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1487716202, "timestamp_updated": 1487716202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469925", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30070932": {"recommendationid": "30070932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124088178", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499261979}, "language": "english", "review": "iz pretty good, comrade", "timestamp_created": 1487645930, "timestamp_updated": 1487645930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30017094": {"recommendationid": "30017094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001856228", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514292594}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this program well worth the money for any computer artist.

Adding some constraint drawing mode can help a lot with this tool. Hexels looks like it can create awesome angled, isometric pixel art and it dose, but it just need that extra drawing tools / modifiers to help itself.\n\nHaving said all that, I am eager and hopeful for the future development of this tool and it just may be the Maya of 2D pixel art. It just need that 10% f extra \"ohh, cool\" factor when you actually use the tool.

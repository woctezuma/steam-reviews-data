WHAT THE ROCK FROM THE STEAMWORKSHOP IS COOKING!!! \n\nI have been playing wrestling games since the 90's. My absolute favorites were WCW VS NWO Revenge and WWF No Mercy. Those were the two games that really set a new standard for wrestling games with a simplistic approach that would keep both n00bs and veterans happy. Fire Pro Wrestling World is definitely not on the caliber of WWF No Mercy, but can still provide some serious fun for gamers of all skills. I will warn you, it took me a bit to get into this game. I didn't find the mechanics appealing at first, but once I got the drift of how the game operated I really started to enjoy the gaming experience.\n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] will either appeal to you or appall you. As I said I had a problem getting into it at first, but it wasn't until I understood the mechanics that I started appreciating the game. The mission mode in-game definitely helped me become familiar with the mechanics. Once you understand the mechanics, the game comes together quite nicely. Some of the game modes include exhibition, tournament, league, and battle royal. There are cage match and hardcore match options to add a little flavor to the game. If you do hit characters hard or frequent enough, they will start bleeding. Other game modes include barbed wire matches, tornado matches, and land-mine matches. My only major complaint is the hit box system. When you play the game for a while, you'll understand how it works. When you first start, you'll wonder why the heck it's so hard to hit another wrestler or lock-up in a grapple. Don't be surprised if you find yourself circling around an opponent for some time. Besides this, the game is pretty solid. I would recommend that devs consider fixing this issue in the future. It is possible to knock out the ref as well, but again, the way the hit boxes are set-up make it near impossible. This is especially true when you try to swing chairs or weapons in your opponent\u2019s direction. There are still times where my friend and I look like were fanning one another instead of wrestling. A concept some may or may not like is the grappling. Grappling happens automatically; when two wrestlers are in close proximity, they automatically lock-up. You get used to it, but it can drive you nuts sometimes when the opponent is always trying to stand next to you to grapple. \n\nThe [b]visuals [/b] themselves are decent. I won\u2019t say bad as there is attention to detail, but they definitely are not over-the-top amazing. I would say they are comparable to Super Nintendo graphics, plus or minus a few special effects that the SNES couldn\u2019t do. I think a little more could have been added to the visual realm in terms of damage on the wrestlers and damage around the ring. The [b]sounds[/b] are good \u2013 again nothing too amazing or really bad. The soundtrack can become repetitive after playing for a few hours. It would be nice to see (rather hear) some new tracks added to the list. There are no real promos where wrestlers talk, but there are certain moves in which wrestlers do make a sound. There is also no commentary in game (so don\u2019t expect the quality of commentary Jim Ross brings or the randomness of Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler). I should also mention the wrestler creation system is absolutely awesome. There is a lot of attention to detail from moves to stances. I am actually amazed at the amount of steam workshop content there is for this game. If you really love old school wrestlers, wrestlers from Japan or the current WWE line-up, you\u2019ll definitely find a character that suits your style. If you want to get a little whacky, characters like Bas Rutten, Mirko \u201cCro Cop\u201d Filipovic and even Cell from Dragon Ball Z are available. \n\nOverall, the game is pretty good for what it is. The price is quite steep in my opinion and I would highly recommend waiting for a sale. The game can become addicting quite quickly, but can really pee you off just as fast if you can\u2019t get your grapple timing right. I\u2019ve noticed online the slightest lag can definitely throw off your timing, so it\u2019s a matter of practice to predict the right time in player verse player matches. I hope future updates address online multiplayer issues. Online numbers are quite low, but more importantly when you do start playing with a friend, you can only play against them. There isn\u2019t really an option to play online against AI. The user interface is also a little confusing (maybe due to translations?) so sometimes it is a little difficult to get the exact match you want. Have fun Google-ing what some of it means!\n\nRATING : 7.45/10 \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1516321350, "timestamp_updated": 1516321369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39434789": {"recommendationid": "39434789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009553494", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1659, "last_played": 1516363893}, "language": "english", "review": "Wrestling gem", "timestamp_created": 1516277443, "timestamp_updated": 1516277443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39432251": {"recommendationid": "39432251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071453760", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1045, "last_played": 1516383789}, "language": "english", "review": "As a quick sidenote...I really love simming matches in wrestling games.

I'm not sure yet but it's definitely up there.\n\nI grew up playing the N64 classics like WCW vs. NWO, Wrestlemania 2000, and No Mercy. Until I bought FPWW, I was 100% certain that WWF No Mercy would always be the greatest wrestling game of all time. But after a few hours with FPWW, it's becoming clear that No Mercy may have some legitimate competition.\n\nA few caveats: FPWW doesn't have the polish of a licensed WWE title. There aren't any custscenes or voice overs or story mode. This game is just meat and potatoes wrestling. Furthermore, it's not an easy game to get into. The MASSIVE amount of customization options and move combinations is daunting at first. And the UI isn't exactly easy to use. It WILL take some time to warm up to it. But do yourself a favor and play the tutorial. Things will become clearer after a few missions.\n\nOnce you've warmed up a bit, go to the Steam Workshop and download some of your favorite wrestlers, rings, referees, etc. Then create wrestling stables for your favorite promotions. Now you're ready to recreate your favorite wrestling matches from yesteryear.\n\nAnd that's what's so great about this game. The huge number of options makes it possible to recreate just about every wrestler and every wrestling match that's ever happened throughout history. For me, there's not much better than Stone Cold vs. The Rock on Monday Night Raw, or Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker in a steel cage.\n\nThe controls are deceptively simple, and feature a grapple system that will feel familiar to any fan of the N64 games. The \"deceptive\" part comes in with just how many move combinations there are. At its heart, there are small, medium, and big attacks. But there are strikes, grapples, running attacks, ground attacks, top rope maneuvers, counters, double team moves you can do with your tag partner, etc. etc. If you can think of it, it's probably in this game.\n\nIf you are currently or have ever been a wrestling fan and you love a good wrestling game, FPWW will not dissapoint.", "timestamp_created": 1515300147, "timestamp_updated": 1515347873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39133086": {"recommendationid": "39133086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078843438", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2830, "last_played": 1515809882}, "language": "english", "review": "You can smash a girl in the face with a steel chair and not go to jail for assault on a female!", "timestamp_created": 1515277258, "timestamp_updated": 1515277258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39131654": {"recommendationid": "39131654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107805973", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 924, "last_played": 1515460537}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing", "timestamp_created": 1515273810, "timestamp_updated": 1515273810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39094730": {"recommendationid": "39094730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084795182", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 454, "last_played": 1516186706}, "language": "english", "review": "The most complete matches gameplay I've ever experienced, and I'm still a noob here.\nFull of created real wrestler and an easy editor to create them for yourself.\n\nYou won't find a lot of matches gimmick since it's based on japanese wrestling, and there are some different rules, but nothing hard to understand.\n\nSome game modes like career, gm or things like that are missing, but there are some mods (which I didn't tried already) and I'm hoping that they will add these features.", "timestamp_created": 1515181902, "timestamp_updated": 1515182001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39093692": {"recommendationid": "39093692", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982039628", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 571, "last_played": 1516302164}, "language": "english", "review": "BY GAH ALMIGHTY!

There has been an active creative community around this series of games from the earliest days of the Web.  Bringing that community to Steam is an excellent modern touch. I don't have to spend hours copying CAW instructions anymore, I can simply subscribe to entire collections of well-made edits.\n\nWhile I love having this series available again, there are some legitimate issues. [list]\n[*] The UI is fairly clunky and could use some serious work. The menus can be confusing, and navigation is unwieldy. Even as an experienced player I had to research tutorials to figure out how to access downloaded wrestlers and rings. \n[*] The standalone game lacks some standard features previous games in the series included, especially story mode. There are understandable reasons for this and it is coming as DLC, but it is still a net negative.\n[*] The game overall doesn't feel as refined as previous versions. \n[*] Controls are not as configurable as they should be. I primarily play this on a PC-powered arcade cabinet, but that is frustrated by the inability to remap some buttons.  It is also hindered because for some reason I can't switch between which controller I want to use.  This is an admittedly rare use-case but still frustrating.\n[*] The game play retains the classic Fire Pro feeling. This is a good thing. However, the series has not kept up with modern competitors. The developers have not added things like apron spots (moves onto apron or off of apron), weapon interaction, or table spots.

Wenn man sich \u00fcber Fire Pro schlau macht hei\u00dft es eigentlich immer, es w\u00e4re besser als alle anderen, spielerisch und vor allem von der KI her, die die Wrestler so agieren lassen soll, wie sie es auch in Wirklichkeit machen w\u00fcrden. Das hier der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Teil der Nutzer aber das Teil nur zum Simulieren von Matches verwendet sollte man vorher auch unbedingt wissen.\nIch habe mir diverse Wrestler mit Movesets und Logik heruntergeladen und diese gegeneinander antreten lassen. Die Matches sehen aber auch hier im Prinzip immer gleich aus. Am Anfang werden leichte Schl\u00e4ge, Tritte und W\u00fcrfe ausgeteilt, danach nimmt die Intensit\u00e4t zu, was schwerere/st\u00e4rkere Angriffe zur Folge hat und irgendwann dann das Matchende zur Folge hat. Ich schaue WWE, TNA und ganz selten mal ROH. Keines meiner bisher ca. 20 simulierten Matches \u00e4hnelte auch nur Ansatzweise einem Match, dass man so auch im TV sehen w\u00fcrde. W\u00e4hrends es bei den grossen Promotions Phasen gibt, in denen mal der eine, dann der andere Wrestler dominiert, wechselt bei Fire Pro diese Dominanz fast nach jedem Move. Es gibt also keine Phasen, in denen ein Wrestler 3-4 Minuten einsteckt, nur um dann mit einem Comeback doch noch den Sieg zu erringen. \u00dcber Fire Pro wird immer gesagt, die simulierten Matches w\u00e4ren realistischer als alles andere, ich kann dem ehrlich nicht zustimmen. Die Wrestler berechnen einfach aufgrund ihrer ihnen gegebene Logik, was sie in jeder Situation machen w\u00fcrden. Hier fehlt der Plan hinter dem Ganzen. Ein Wrestler denkt immer nur zwischen den Moves, hat aber kein langfristiges Ziel vor Auge. Ein Heel k\u00f6nnte nach dem dritten 2.9 Count auch einfach mal ausrasten und dann auf den Sieg pfeiffen, daf\u00fcr dem anderen aber zeigen, wo der Frosch die Locken hat. Was ich auch des \u00f6fteren gelesen habe, dass die Wrestler bei Fire Pro eine Geschichte ohne Worte erz\u00e4hlen. Das ist vielleicht Wunschdenken, aber nachdem nach jedem Move wieder offen ist, wer gerade die Oberhand hat, ist das mehr als \u00fcbertrieben. Festellen musste ich auch, dass egal ob ich einen Wrestler als Heel oder Babyface einsortierte, wird er fast immer ausgebuht.\nVersteht mich jetzt nicht falsch, die Matches sind trotzdem sehr sch\u00f6n anzusehen und man freut sich, wenn sein eigener Wrestler so agiert, wie man es vorausgesehen hat, aber es ist eben nicht das, was man vielleicht erwartet. Wenn man dann damit anf\u00e4ngt sich in dem Spiel, oder besser der Simulation, etwas aufzubauen, wie eine eigene Promotion, dann trifft man sehr schnell auf die Grenzen. L\u00e4sst sich der Ring noch sehr sch\u00f6n selbst gestalten, h\u00f6rt es bei der Arena schon wieder auf. Wieso kann ich nicht grundlegende Farben definieren oder auch die Bannerwerbung \u00e4ndern? Ich verstehe auch nicht, wieso ich beim Ring eigene Grafiken verwenden kann, aber nicht bei den Championg\u00fcrteln! Die Auswahl an Titeln ist echt l\u00e4cherlich und hat auch so gut wie keine Auswirkung auf das Spiel. Die Wrestler kommen grunds\u00e4tzlich ohne G\u00fcrtel zum Ring. Angeblich w\u00e4re das nicht anders machbar, aber wenn ich mir die Charaktererstellung anschaue, dann m\u00fcsste es nur einen weiteren \"versteckten\" Layer geben, wo eben der G\u00fcrtel beim Einmarsch sichtbar w\u00e4re, oder eben ein komplettes neues Attire nur f\u00fcr die Einm\u00e4rsche. Also von wegen w\u00e4re nicht m\u00f6glich ist mir hier einfach zu l\u00e4cherlich. Bei den Titeln muss man auch vorher festlegen, bei welcher Matchart sie gewonnen werden k\u00f6nnen, das ist ja auch absolut realit\u00e4tsfremd und jeder Booker w\u00fcrde wahrscheinlich hier seinem Albtraum gegen\u00fcberstehen. Eine Entscheidung, die ich einfach nicht nachvollziehen kann.\nDie Matcharten sind sage ich mal in den 80er/90er Jahren h\u00e4ngen geblieben. Es gibt die normalen Matches, K\u00e4fig Matches und dann wird es leider schon wieder absurd mit Landmine Deathmatches  z.B. laut ingame Beschreibung liegen Mienen \u00fcberall rum, tats\u00e4chlich sind ausserhalb des Rings und in den Ringecken Tische mit Stacheldraht. Battle Royal gesellt sich auch zu den Matches, leider auf 8 Teilnehmer beschr\u00e4nkt. Wer also einen 30 Mann Royal Rumble simulieren will bekommt hier gleich zwei Probleme. Neben dem schon erw\u00e4hnten Limit von 8 Teilnehmern (in einer Liga kann ich doch auch mehr Wrestler ausw\u00e4hlen!!!) kommt noch dazu, dass die Teilnehmer sich lieber pinnen als rauswerfen, da man den Pin nicht deaktivieren kann und somit immer beides zul\u00e4ssig ist.\nAls Wrestling Fan macht es mir einerseits Spa\u00df, Matches zu simulieren, allerdings m\u00f6chte ich dann andererseits auch mehr. Ich will die Wrestler auch Promos machen lassen, Interviews f\u00fchren, Storylines und Fehden erm\u00f6glichen. Als reiner Simulator f\u00fcr Standardmatches ist Fire Pro ganz lustig, aber dadurch, dass das ganze Drumherum einfach fehlt, bzw. sehr fragw\u00fcrdig umgesetzt (Titel/G\u00fcrtel) wurde kann es auch nicht mehr sein, obwohl so viel Potenzial vorhanden ist. Auf der einen Seite sagt Fire Pro \"mach was du willst!\" und auf der anderen \"nee, das System daf\u00fcr h\u00e4tten wir zwar, aber nein das darfst du nicht!\".\n\nGerne wird Fire Pro auch immer in einem Atemzug mit WWE 2KXX genannt und was es doch alles besser macht. Sollte ich Bock auf eine eigene Promotion haben, dann kann ich bei den 2K Spielen um einiges mehr anstellen. Ich kann Arenen, Ringe, G\u00fcrtel und was wei\u00df ich nicht alles erstellen. Ich kann Zwischensequenzen arrangieren, die Leute miteinander Fehden lassen. Ich kann Tag Teams entstehen und auch wieder zerbrechen lassen, wie ich will. Das Ganze dann noch in einer Promotion mit eigener Historie (Win/Losses/Titel) f\u00fchren. \"Ja, aber die Matches bei Fire Pro sind viel besser, wegen Logik und so!\" Das mag sein, aber die obligatorischen Fehlgriffe und Tritte/Schl\u00e4ge ins Leere gibt es da genauso.\nDies ist mein erstes Fire Pro, ich bereue den Kauf nicht, es ist ja auch nicht sonderlich teuer, aber ganz ehrlich, hier fehlt so vieles und alles wirkt un\u00fcberlegt. W\u00e4re das ein Early Access Ok, aber so doch nicht.\n\nFazit: Ordentliche Simulation, dank der Community mit denkbar jedem Wrestler den es jemals gab, langfristige Unterhaltung aber aufgrund der Limitierungen nicht gegeben, es sei denn man simuliert die selben wenigen Matchtypen immer und immer wieder. Spielen braucht man das Teil nicht, es gibt keinen Story- oder Karrieremodus. Wer also auf Matchvielfalt verzichten kann und wirklich nur Matches durchsimulieren will, der ist hier gut aufgehoben. Jeder der etwas mehr will muss sich gedulden, bis die DLCs das ganze vielleicht in etwas Brauchbares verwandeln.

A lot.\n\nFor a while I was putting off writing this, as for hte most part I played Fire Pro Wrestling the same way most others here did: As a simulator. I downloaded a bunch of real life guys, made a dumb little tournament, and then ran my own promtion. And for a while, it was fun; Kevin Owens and Rick Rude had a halatious matchup. But I realized that this way, I was simply playing a 20 buck fantasy booker, and I wanted to try playing it on my own. So I made a character and went through the tutorials, and here's what I learned.\n\nThe gamedoes not play like any other wrestling game I've tried; lockups are automatic and the natural state. While strikes are possible, I've never seen one done well. As such, pretty much everything is a lockup. Even things like chops and punches are done in lockups. It seems that the best way to win a lockup is just pure speed; press one of the buttons and a direction as fast as possible and you get it done. The general idea is to follow the flow of an All Japan style match; smaller moves like takeovers and headlocks leading into your big flashy moves near the end. While this works in theory, I've also done entire matches without using the small moves, going exclusively for big stuff. There isn't too much of a penalty for it anyway. \n\nCharacter creation is the star of the show. While the main combat engine is fun, it's shocking just how well someone with a good sense of faces can turn even the admitatedly low definition characters adn sprites into something awesome. And the creator is \"fun\" in the sense that there are lots of parts to use and it's in theory easy to use them. It's a layer based sectional system; you work on one arm, then the other arm, and all of them are seperate parts rather than one cohesive body. Color seems to be an issue; I'd love a way to simply apply one base color and pattern across a body so I don't have to get the exact same color code eveyr time, but it's otherwise cool. \n\nThe real big problme is navigating all this. The menu looks and feels like a game from the PS2; the background image is just a static ring and the way they are navigated just looks ugly, especially in tournament setups. I've also been having trouble connecting to opponents online and getting rid of characters from the workshop; even after unsubscribing they are still there, taking up space and making the game load slower.", "timestamp_created": 1514315040, "timestamp_updated": 1514315040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38699582": {"recommendationid": "38699582", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998527528", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514299719}, "language": "english", "review": "this game might be okay for some people... and i really liked the idea of the high amount of customization but... the mechanics are just too twitchy for my tastes.", "timestamp_created": 1514300085, "timestamp_updated": 1514300085, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38688914": {"recommendationid": "38688914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045728566", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "last_played": 1516174307}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely fantastic wrestling game.

MachineHead\n\n- Bush\n\nFire Pro Wrestling World to put it succinctly is 'Better than the rest.'\n\nThe Fire Pro Wrestling series found its beginning back in 1989, the brainchild of Japanese programmer Masato Masuda who had already made waves in the video game industry programming the critical and commercial success 'Pro Wrestling' on the Nintendo Entertainment System. A much beloved title for oldschool gamers and wrestling fans alike.\n\nWhen Fire Pro Wrestling made its debut on the market, no one would have any idea of the significance the series would have over an entire genre of games and yet remain completely niche and almost unknown to all but the most dedicated western audiences.\nIn truth, Fire Pro Wrestling is the father of modern wrestling games, innovating and refining many of the features we see in the games today.\n\nTo fully grasp the impact the Fire Pro Wrestling series has had over the wrestling game genre, we have to look at how two completely different cultures view Professional Wrestling in its entirety. While Pro Wrestling in the West has relied heavily on pageantry and characters to get over; Japanese wrestling is viewed as a legitimate sport, covered by the press and sports media. The ring drama does not unfold over a microphone or through awkward skits, but rather in-ring storytelling and match psychology.\n\nThis is where the fundamental difference between Western and Japanese developers have differed over the years in the wrestling game content they produce.\nWestern wrestling games have always relied heavily upon licenses and a particular brand to sell units. It never really mattered if the games were actually any good. Button mashing an opponents lifebar into oblivion while manipulating the cardboard cut out likeness of a real superstar has been the bread and butter staple of western wrestling games for decades. We loved it, and we continued to buy each installment of each licensed game, but ultimately were left with shallow gameplay and a complete lack of in-ring drama from developers who either didn't care or didn't understand pro wrestling, and some would argue, still don't.\n\nThen along came the Fire Pro series. Through its early installments it began to build upon certain gameplay fundamentals. Unlicensed and unbranded, the series crammed the rosters with the likenesses of real wrestler and real promotions and focused solely on developing gameplay as the foundation the series would build upon through each installment.\n\nGameplay and customization is unequivocally the flame that has sustained the Fire Pro series from 1989 to 2017.\nGiving players the tools not to beat a lifebar out of an opponent and slap on a guarunteed pinfall, but to actually tell their own stories with their own characters through their own preferred style of grappling.\n\nThe Fire Pro series was the first series to personalize its rosters with their own statistical parameters, utilize a customizable logic system and incorporate what we now consider basic features in a wrestling game such as stamina, fatigue and limb damage. Now Spike-Chunsoft have given the fans a new toybox to create in, and plan to throw in plenty of additional features as time progresses. With additional logo and ring editors entire promotions will rise and fall within the community and thousands of real and fictional wrestlers, grapplers and even MMA fighters will thrive and compete.\n\nOne of the staples of the Fire Pro series has been its minimalist presentation. The 2d graphics, simple introductions and focus on in ring action over amateur theatrics; while not necessarily appealing to the younger gamers of today, still remain colorful and beautifully hand animated. Many long time fans of the series also believe the 2d base allows for far more creative freedom in the editing process as well.\n\nAnd creative freedom is what Fire Pro is all about. Molding your own unique vision, limited only by your imagination and not the lame narrative of some stooge writer. Fire Pro has a soul and is developed as a labor of love for fans, by fans, and is not just the annual mediocre churnout of a corporate brand.\n\nThe series isn't for everyone, but does boast an insanely hardcore following that even includes some of the wrestlers whose Fire Pro counterparts have appeared throughout the storied series. Some people are perfectly content with the offerings of the licensed brands; but those who love the Fire Pro series love it a lot and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to Tomoyuki Matsumoto, Tomozou Kantaku and all the developers at Spike-Chunsoft who have made this labor of love a reality at long last. With a PS4 console release on the way, it is safe to say many of us will be running across eachother on both platforms.\n\nMy Personal Fire Pro Wrestling history includes:\n\nFire Pro Wrestling G\nFire Pro Wrestlng D\nFire Pro Wrestling Z\nFire Pro Wrestling Returns (Japanese Edition)\nFire Pro Wrestling Returns (Agetec Edition)\nFire Pro Wrestling World (PC)\n\nand eventually,\n\nFire Pro Wrestling World (PS4)", "timestamp_created": 1513739449, "timestamp_updated": 1513741568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507513", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38444027": {"recommendationid": "38444027", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999994294", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515018740}, "language": "english", "review": "Been keeping an eye on this game since it came out and finally pushed myself to purchase it and i've been hooked.

It accomplishes a rare trick- it's fast and easy to get started in, yet it's also a better wrestling sim than the WWE games have ever managed, somehow capturing the feel of a scripted sport in an open format. Matches go back and forth and have dramatic reversals which leave the crowd gasping, different wrestlers play differently thanks to variable AI, and you can feel tension building. It's honestly fun to just watch the AI go at it, and setting up your own federation and seeing who wins in dream matches is a joy. \n\nCustomization is, given the simplicity of the graphics, kind of entirely absurd. Playing with the various layers of attires can create some brilliant combinations, it's easy to import your own .wav entrance themes, and monkeying with movesets and AI can get you just about any concept you can envision. \n\nPresentation wise it could still use a little finessing- the Mission Mode is really essential to learning how to play the game yourself, and there's a lot the game itself could explain instead of leaving to the manual. The graphics do occasionally show the odd bit of clipping (which is weird for 2-D) though nothing that obstructs gameplay. And to be sure there are a few things the game can't do yet- ladder matches, table matches, and huge 30-man royal rumbles and the like. \n\nBut overall, in terms of capturing the wrestling experience, this does better than anything I've ever seen.

I was told about the game and told that it was comparable to \"WWF No Mercy\" for the Nintendo 64.  While that is probably the best way to describe it to someone, it's so much more than that.\n\nThe game is just very smooth, the grappling feels totally worse than No Mercy until you get used to it and realize they made the small change for a reason.  The matches really feel like real wrestling matches, the game encourages it by allowing the build up moves to work more often in the beginning and you have to work you way up your finisher.  No more body slam over and over and spam taunt until your opponent gets up then fininsher, rinse repeat that you see so much in No Mercy.  \n\nThe AI is really cool as well,  I've seen matches with characters based on wrestlers from WWE that were shockingly close to something you would actually see them do.\n\nThe shining moment in this game is the customization of the wrestlers, ring apron and arena as well as referees.  You can find almost anyone (or anything) in the workshop and some of the detail put into these wrestlers is insane.

(Kein Import n\u00f6tig)\nSomit sollte man sich einfach drauf einlassen. (nicht vom \u00e4u\u00dferen Look abschrecken lassen, es bietet so viel mehr!)\n\nWie schon immer bietet Fire Pro eine unz\u00e4hlige Menge an Erstellm\u00f6glichkeiten (Matchvariationen, Wrestler, Moveset, Entrance, Referee, Arena, Belts, Ligen / Teams)\n\nDank Workshop ist es nun auch m\u00f6glich Wrestler, Arenen Texturen, Referees etc. mit 1 Klick ins Spiel zu integrieren. Und das solange bis der Speicher der Festplatte voll ist! Da dies nur wenige kb klein sind, ist es m\u00f6glich nahezu unbegrenzt alles runterzuladen. Egal ob WWE, ECW, WCW, ROH, Japan, Lucha .... Selbst Serien, Film Figuren etc f\u00fcr alle ist etwas dabei, da die Community sehr stark ist & viele Leute auch der FPR \u00c4ra zu FPWW wechselten & den ganzen sich anschlossen. Mittlerweile gibt es so viele gute Creator, die einfach alles perfekt nachbauen. \nJEDER Wrestler kann bis zu 4 Attires im Spiel haben (auch das ist neu)\n\nSelbst die Logik ist bei JEDEM Wrestler sehr genau einstellbar. Wie reagiert Wrestler X auf den Move, wie schlau er ist etc. auch bei dem Gegner ist dies wirksam!\nEntrance ist mit eigenen mp3 import auch gegeben, somit wirkt das ganze noch stimmiger. (Entrance edit wird wohl noch ausgebaut, auch n\u00f6tig, da es ein wenig limitiert ist)\n- Movesets sind auch bis auf das kleinste gut einstellbar und dank dem Umfang ist es fast unm\u00f6glich Moves nicht zu finden, die es nicht im Spiel gibt. (Zudem werden kostenlos auch mehr nachgeliefert via Patches)\n\nArena Edit etc ist super. Ring, belt Edit ist noch stark limitiert, dies wird noch ausgebaut und sollte auch. Da diese bisher nur nach no-product aussieht. Aber immerhin gibt es eine M\u00f6glichkeit, zudem eine Option f\u00fcr die Zukunft.\n\nKI / Matchablauf\nDie KI ist wie gesagt extrem schlau! \nMan kann Matches simulieren (CPU vs CPU), diese machen allein beim zuschauen Spa\u00df! Das schafft sonst auch keins! Auch im Match reagieren und agieren die Wrestler stets gut oder deren selbst eingestellte KI entsprechend.\nSomit spielt sich auch JEDES Match komplett anders, mir machen allein die singles Matches so viel Spa\u00df, da diese immer wieder neue Aktionen, Highlights und Herangehensweise erfordern oder bieten. \nSo kann man auch ein Gegner dominieren, im re-match aber komplett ablosen. Da es nie nach dem gleichen Schema abl\u00e4uft.\nInsgesamt gibt es 10 Stufen an Schwierigkeitsgraden des Gegners. Hier agieren sie einfach noch schlauer, je h\u00f6her man das Level stellt. Es gibt kein \"schwerer = sinnloses bzw unrealistisches kontern wie z.b. in den WWE Spielen.\nAuch im Match k\u00f6nnte man theoretisch gleich einen finishing Move ansetzen, da man jeder Zeit wie auch \"in echt\" alles ansetzen k\u00f6nnte. Meistens ist der Gegner noch zu fit. Man muss eine Kette mit low-mid-strong moves aufbauen. Das macht es sehr taktischer und anspruchsvoller \n\nMatcharten:\nEs ist m\u00f6glich alles zu kombinieren. Von normalen, zu TT, Cage, Royal Rumble, Deathmatches (auch dies ist m\u00f6glich, barbed wire (ropes), lighttubes, etc sind auch m\u00f6glich. Im Men\u00fc sieht es nach wenig Matcharten aus, allerdings gibt es im Folgemen\u00fc eine Option bei der man alles variieren & kombinieren kann. Z.b. Steht nirgendwo das man ein Triple Threat Match hat, dies kann man dennoch einstellen. Oder 8 Man Tags (offline bis zu 8 Spieler!) mit Elimination + barbed wire etc.) Es gibt unbegrenzt M\u00f6glichkeiten und hoffentlich auch noch mehr, so das alles abgedeckt wird. Die wichtigsten sowie, Deathmatches, und viele mehr sind abgedeckt. Tuniermodus ala King of the Ring etc auch enthalten.\nSelbst ein MMA Modus gibt es!! In einen Wrestlingspiel!! oder auch Shootfight Matches usw.\n\nStoryMode? / GM Mode?\nEs gibt aktuell nicht wie in FPR einen Story Mode, sondern einen Aufgaben Modus in dem Man 50 unterschiedliche Aufgaben machen muss um auch Moves etc freizuschalten.\nDies bietet Spa\u00df, teils sind sie knackig schwer, aber dennoch sehr kurzweilig. Der Hauptteil aktuell liegt auf Exhibition und Online Mode (4 Spielern gleichzeitig aktuell!)\nDemn\u00e4chst folgt aber eine Art GM Mode so kann man sich da als Big Boss austoben und vergleichlich wie in WWE Spielen sein Wrestlinguniversum pflegen. \n\nAnimationen / Grafik / Technik:\nWie gesagt gibt es dank der 2D / 2.5D Sprites eine extrem gro\u00dfe Anzahl an Moves und verdammt gut aussehende Konter!\nEs ist nahezum\u00f6glich aus fast jeder Lage zu kontern und gekontert zu werden, diese sind auch meistens eine Augenweide.\n- Blut ist auch verdammt gut in Szene gesetzt! \n- Soundtrack FPW typisch und noch besser als FPR.\n\nZur Grafik hat sich seit FPR logischerweise sehr viel getan, es ist immer noch der zeitlose 2D Stil, von dem man sich nicht abschrecken lassen sollte, es wirkt alles noch sch\u00e4rfer, die Modelle wirken noch besser und grafisch ist es dank 1920 x 1080+ eine sehr gute Aufl\u00f6sung. Auch die Frauen Edits, haben sich seit dem letzten sehr gut ver\u00e4ndert und wirken nun auch wie ein guter Teil des Spiels und nicht wie ein Bonus, die aber nie wirklich zuerkennen sind. Gerade bei nachgebauten Wrestlerinnen.\n\nBevor man tausende von Wrestlern / Chars. runterl\u00e4dt w\u00fcrde ich empfehlen die Cache zu aktivieren, somit l\u00e4uft es bei der Auswahl noch fl\u00fcssiger und es l\u00e4dt im Spiel alles besser nach, incl. l\u00e4uft das Spiel noch sauberer. Cache nach vielen Download aktivieren kann beim ersten Start etwas Zeit beanspruchen.\n\nFAZIT:\nEs ist zeitlos und wenn es st\u00e4ndig mit Updates versorgt wird, brauch man die evtl die n\u00e4chsten 10 Jahre oder noch mehr kein anderes Wrestlingspiel mehr.\nEs gibt noch viele Punke, die Spike verbessern kann und auch wird. Da die Community seeehr stark mit eingebunden wird, lesen die Devs. auch \u00f6fters mal in den Foren, da sie genau wissen wie gut es l\u00e4uft oder auch seit FPR regelrecht explodiert vor Edits, Ideen & treue Fans die das gerne unterst\u00fctzen, da sie merken das Spike einfach \u00fcber Jahre ein unglaublich gutes Produkt bietet. (F\u00fcr langfristige Sicht)\nMir pers\u00f6nlich fehlen auch noch so kleine Dinge oder auch \"gr\u00f6\u00dfere\" trotz Japan Stil, w\u00fcrde ich auch gern westliche Matcharten ala Tables oder Ladder Varianten sehen. Vllt auch mal Backstage brawls und nicht \"nur auf Rampe etc. oder Kleine optimier Dinge, die noch nicht perfekt sind.\nDennoch ist es mit dem aktuellen Stand ein hochwertiges Spiel, was dem Preis absolut gerecht wird!\nIch bin NIE Vollpreis K\u00e4ufer gerade im AAA Bereich, au\u00dfer bei Indietiteln die es verdient haben. Und als Day 1 K\u00e4ufer f\u00fcr 19.99\u20ac war es JEDEN Cent wert.\nDa es das Gr\u00fcst von FPR stets und st\u00e4ndig verbessert und in vielen Dingen \u00fcberholt hat und sich st\u00e4ndig extrem von Update zu Update verbessert. Spike bringt immer als nur Bugfixes in den Patches mitsich und st\u00e4ndig wird wie gesagt auch sehr schnell auf die Community reagiert.\n+ guter Mod support\nAn alle die sich unschl\u00fcssig sind:\nWagt den Schritt, gerade jetzt im Sale (13.39\u20ac) ist eine gute Investition, wenn ihr auf der Suche nach geilen Wrestling / Fighting Spielen seid!\nDie Grafik ist nicht massentauglich, dennoch ist der Kern pures gold, Das Gameplay! + Edit M\u00f6glichkeiten.\nAlso \u00fcberwindet euch, ich habe evtl. jetzt einiges vergessen, aber ich beantworte gerne Fragen hier unter dem Review, wenn ich etwas vergessen habe. Da dies bei so viel tollen echt mal unter geht. (Incl. Zeichenbegrenzung. :D)\n\nDANKE an Spike, die es endlich auch auf PC gebracht haben! <3", "timestamp_created": 1513634204, "timestamp_updated": 1513638631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38406732": {"recommendationid": "38406732", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982611515", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 18907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1515761975}, "language": "english", "review": "Most likely the best wrestling game ever made.\n\nThis game is a rare case where the journey through Early Access was just as great as the final result.", "timestamp_created": 1513628260, "timestamp_updated": 1513628260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38405991": {"recommendationid": "38405991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049718587", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 464, "last_played": 1516366126}, "language": "english", "review": "What's there to say about the fire pro series that hasn't already been said, It's one of the longest and best running wrestling series ( in my opition ) of all time.

Other than that, I would say that this is a serious contender for the best wrestling game on steam.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1513136896, "timestamp_updated": 1513136896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38261538": {"recommendationid": "38261538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101011233", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509193748}, "language": "koreana", "review": "0.1 \uc2dc\uac04 '\uac1c\ub178\uc7bc'\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubb50\uc8e0? \u314b\u314b \n\ub808\uc2ac\ub9c1 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2dc\ub294\ubd84\uc774\uba74 \uc5c4\uccad \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2e4 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\uc804 \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud558\uace0\uc694. \n\ub2e8\uc9c0 \ud0a4 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc880 \ub354 \uc790\uc138\ud55c \ud29c\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5bc\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub410\uc73c\uba74 \uc88b\uc558\uc744 \uac83 \uac19\ub124\uc694. \n\ub610 \ud55c\uae00\ud654\ub3c4 \ub410\uc73c\uba74 \uc88b\uaca0\uace0\uc694. \n\uc544\ubb34\ud2bc, \ubcf4\uae30\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \ub808\uc2ac\ub9c1 \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\ub3c4 \uc5c4\uccad \ub9ce\uace0 \ud654\ub824\ud558\uace0 \uaf64 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc798 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uac83 \uac19\uc544\uc694. \uc804 \uc608\uc804 roh \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uba70 \naj\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc2a4, \ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ud788\uc5b4\ub85c, \ud638\ubbf8\uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc \ub4f1\ub4f1 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uba70 \uadf8 \ucee8\uc149\uc73c\ub85c \n\ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4~", "timestamp_created": 1513099926, "timestamp_updated": 1513099926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38247808": {"recommendationid": "38247808", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989676026", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514594663}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, by far, the best wrestling game on the market right now.

When I first played it, I was not disappointed. The Fire Pro series has a long and storied history, but the fraction of American releases is only the tip of the iceberg so to speak. If you\u2019re familiar with the series, you\u2019ll probably know exactly what to expect. It picks up right where the last game left off. It adds a bunch of new features with more on the way. The added Steam Workshop feature is a godsend for downloading CAWs if you\u2019re familiar with the pains of the older techniques for Fire Pro Returns. For those of you who\u2019ve never played a Fire Pro game, it\u2019s vastly different from your average 2k wrestling game. The most startling difference is the use of sprites for the wrestlers instead of 3d models, but this limitation turns out to be very helpful in the creation of convincing real life wrestlers. The controls are a bit hard to wrap your head around at first, but they get easier once you learn how to time your attacks. I recommend looking at a guide if you have trouble understanding the grapple system. The customization is where the game really shines. You can find pretty much any wrestler you could imagine on the Steam Workshop.  A vast amount of CAW parts allows for near endless amounts of potential creations. There are also a large variety of moves that can allow for various wrestlers\u2019 move sets to be accurately represented. You can also name finishers, which is a feature I sorely miss from the WWE SvR series. The ability to tweak logic allows for wrestlers to play out nearly exactly like their real life counterparts. This makes the game a wonderful simulator for wrestling matches. The customization for rings also allows for a decent chunk of real life wrestling shows to be accurately represented. The only thing lacking customization as of right now are the title belts, which are the same models from over a decade ago. (Hopefully this gets changed during development as it\u2019s still early access.) There are also a variety of different match types that allow for some really fun moments. From exploding barbwire deathmatches, to MMA cage fights, there is a lot of variety in the match types. You can have up to 8-man matches. (No 30-man royal rumble matches as of right now) The only match types you\u2019ll really miss are WWE style matches like Hell in a Cell or ladder matches. This is due to the game being heavily Japanese Puroresu oriented. While the game has modes like tournaments and leagues, right now it is missing a proper GM style mode and career mode, both of which were in previous games. I have hopes that this will get added later as it\u2019s still in early access. There\u2019s also an online mode that is pretty fun, but I haven\u2019t played much of it.\n\nHere's a list of the pros and cons for me.\n\nPros:\nLoads and loads of customization\nSprite based characters (Either a pro or con depending on your tastes)\nFun gameplay (Especially the deathmatches!)\nExtremely accurate simulation\nLots of variety in match types (MMA, boxing, etc.)\nSteam Workshop implementation is great\nClosest thing we\u2019ll ever get to a new NJPW/AJPW game\n\nCons:\nSprite based characters (Either a pro or con depending on your tastes)\nControl scheme is a little difficult to learn (It\u2019s easy once you get the hang of it though)\nNo WWE style special matches\nNo career or GM mode (At this point in early access)\n\nFire Pro Wrestling World is a game that I love, and I\u2019d thoroughly recommend it if you like: old school wrestling games, simulating matches, Japanese Puroresu, and/or four-way exploding barbwire deathmatches between Duke Nukem, Kurt Cobain, Danny Devito, and Hatsune Miku.", "timestamp_created": 1511634445, "timestamp_updated": 1511634445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37539616": {"recommendationid": "37539616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128677955", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "last_played": 1516192682}, "language": "english", "review": "With the power of workshop.

Wrestling Brock Lesnar feels completely different from wrestling Psycosis -- as it should. \n\nAbove all else, Fire Pro Wrestling World is a joy to play.

I grew up loving wrestling, like all of us I'm sure. My cousin and I played a TON of WWF Royal Rumble and RAW on snes. We had a whiteboard we bought and laminated wrestlers that we moved around to make cards, and show champs etc. It was impressive considering I was like 7. Well some time passed, and in 1996 he graduated from high school and joined the Navy. We stayed in touch, and talked about wrestling a lot. He got stationed in Japan and started telling me about this game called Fire Pro Wrestling. So the legend was growing in my head, and as an idiot kid I wasn't too sure how to find things online yet. I used webcrawler and finally found Gamefaqs. Saw the SNES stuff, and begged my mom to buy it for me. Never happened.\n\n1997 for my birthday, all I wanted was a Japanese Saturn and Six Man Scramble. Well this didn't happen either. So all this time I am still corresponding with my cousin. He's telling me all about 6MS in letters, and I am just beyond jealous. I get Warzone and Nitro, but the itch is there. Revenge, and World Tour are helping ease me out of the wanting Fire Pro so bad. \n\nFast forward to 1999. I read online, probably Gamefaqs, that a new Fire Pro is coming out for playstation. So I knew my cousin was coming home soon, so I just waited for him to talk to him about it. He comes home and I ask him how I get a jp playstation. He introduces me to modchips, and even shows me the action replay method that some people on his base use. So it's set, I am getting this game no matter what I have to do. I am 12 at this point, and living in the middle of nowhere deep south I score a job that summer on a farm. My mom gave my cousin money for the game when he goes back to Japan, and to just ship it to us whenever it comes out. So I know I have a few months before if shows up. I work my ass off all summer to get a Playstation, and I actually had enough saved up by end of July to get the dreamcast at launch. Somewhere end of June I buy my Playstation with Tekken 3, Silent Hill, an Action Replay, and Harvest Moon (and maybe NBA Live 98 for real cheap, can't remember.)\n\nAnyway the game comes somewhere around mid to end July and I have no IDEA what I am doing. I get on gamefaqs, start printing stuff. Reading all of it through, start to kind of understand, but I am still confused. I made some edits, THEY WERE AWFUL, and mostly just played the game. I should go back to that game and try it again.\n\nWhen D came out, I was older and wiser. Ready to tackle it from every angle. I was a lurker on FPC, never posted until R came out. Followed all the breakthroughs JB was making, and had 6 VMUs and knew what I was doing. I had a blast, introduced my best friend to the series with D. We had been wrestling buddies since 6th grade, and if you remember on the FPC person pack Adam and Lee as The Wacky Deli that's us. And we just went from there. He's the best KOC player I know. He's into the strong style, and I am more into the Dragon Gate lucharesu style. Good friendship, and we still play anytime we get together, which is super hard considering we live in different states. \n\nThis continued with Fire Pro R, and with World it is no different.  This is the game I always dreamed of when I was playing 20 years ago.  This is the series I love, but with a family and a full time job it makes playing a little harder.  I play when I can, and I still enjoy every minute of this game.  I look forward to playing this game when it is out of early access, for a full review of the 1.0 of the game, but for now enjoy the ride!\n", "timestamp_created": 1510939008, "timestamp_updated": 1510939008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36557609": {"recommendationid": "36557609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028194200", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1516370684}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily the best wrestling game ever made.

Zumindest sind mir keine bekannt oder aufgefallen, obwohl das Spiel bisher nur im Early-Access ist. Sollte eines Tages noch ein Karriere, Story Designer oder gar GM-Mode nachgereicht werden, w\u00e4re das einfach nur fantastisch und w\u00fcrde das Spiel noch besser machen. \n\nObwohl das Spiel nur in 2d Dargestellt wird, ist  es selbst in der heutigen Zeit sehr sch\u00f6n anzusehen. \n\nDie Auswahlm\u00f6glichkeiten der Wrestler sind gigantisch und es lassen sich problemlos Wrestler aus dem Workshop installieren. So kann man sich ein riesen Roster aus WWF/E, WCW, TNA-Wrestlern, MMA, Boxern usw. kreieren.\nMittlerweile ist auch die M\u00f6glichkeit dazugekommen seinen Ring mit echten Logos zu gestalten. So kann man in echten Ringen aus allen m\u00f6glichen Wrestling, Boxen oder MMA Ringen ein Match austragen.\n\nHier die Pros:\n+ freigestaltbares Roster \n+ sehr guter und starker Workshop\n+ sehr guter Editor (Wrestler, Schiri, Ring lassen sich editieren)\n+ eigenes und realistisches Verhalten der einzelnen K\u00e4mpfer\n+ Wrestling + MMA + Boxen im einem Spiel\n+ sch\u00f6ne Grafik\n+ guter Sound\n+ Ring l\u00e4sst sich mittlerweile frei bearbeiten\n+ echte Wrestlingthemes lassen sich bei eigenen K\u00e4mpfern hinzuf\u00fcgen\n+ intelligente K.I in 10 Schwierigkeitsstufen\n\nContras:\n- bisher gibt es keine M\u00f6glichkeit K\u00e4mpfer aus dem Workshop eine  Theme zuordnen, wenn nicht vorgegeben.\n- bisher keine Laddermatches und Tablematches und kein Royal Rumble\n- bisher noch kein Karriere. Story Designer oder GM Mode\n\n\nNeutral: \n+- teilweise anfangs frustierende Steuerung... ...welche aber nach einer Zeit doch leicht von der Hand geht.\n\nFazit: Was soll ich sagen? Es ist wirklich sch\u00f6n zu sehen das es noch Entwickler gibt die es mit ihrem Spiel ernst meinen. Die Entwickler von FPW World zeigen dies. Die M\u00f6glichkeiten unbegrenzt Wrestler aus allm\u00f6glichen Ligen der Welt in ein Spiel zu bekommen ist einfach fantastisch. Ist zwar f\u00fcr FPW-Fans nichts neues, aber Neulingen wie mir in dieser Reihe ist dass ganz einfach eine fantastische Funktion, vorallem durch den Steamworkshop sehr gut gel\u00f6st.",

pro would comme out after they shot themself in the foot by creating the Fire Pro for the XBOX...seriously i taught that because of this game they died BUT NO!\n\nGood and New Things\nBlood on the floor\nNew CAW option with lot of option and lot more layers\nFixed the rotation of a CAW while creating it, you can rotate each part of you CAW to see the patern etc\nUnlockables trough mission mode\nImport logo to use on the Ring (Mat,Apron,Corner pads, post)\nand for the most part The Workshop (publishing / downloading Wrestler ring ref etc)\nMatch type has not changed from FPW Return\nExhibition/ League/ Tournament/Battle Royale\nNormal match,/ SWA match / S-1 Match / Gruesom Fighting / Barbewire death match / Landmine Death Match/ Cage Match (normale cage escape to win of pin submission you can put weapon in the cage.\nBelt has not changed from Return same lame option and like in Return the belt are useless, i taught that they would do something about this it is 2017...annyway it is a early acces and i am hoping for the best.\nI did not see any new move but FPW move list is so huge that i can't remember them all.\nThe 3 or 4 move that are not possible are still there ( kikinuki buster is one i think) i wash hoping that they removed it\nViper taunt still there but don't know if it control you arm like in return\nNo cpu logic probleme (like in return)\nCut play is still bad you can get beat up by two wrestler why your partner is looking at the show not helping you.... \nWrestler still refuse to fight you on the Spike Dome Ramp (not a big probleme but i always liked this ramp since i know ECW) Second (coach) can attack and throw you weapon, this option was really broken in Returns.\nSo the gameplay is the same and for the controle it is the same thing but there fixed the pin to one button instead of using it as a move\n", "timestamp_created": 1510082805, "timestamp_updated": 1510082805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

I read about the enthusiasm the fans have for this game and as an ex-wrestling nut (I'm slowly getting back into it now via NJPW and the independent circuit) I had to give it a go. \n\nI give the game a thumbs up because I am an 'old school' wrestling fan and can appreciate the mechanics and uniqueness of the game. People who find aesthetics to be important may be turned off by this game; graphically this game is not based on realism but on some sort of nostalgic, squared circle, fantasy escapism; graphically it hasn't really changed in years. Also, the timing based system gives each match an element of unpredictability which I like ( the last WWE 2K game I played, 2K13,  was too easy and I won whenever I wanted. Perhaps WWE 2K games are more difficult now but winning got boring (even though I would complain if I lost!)). \n\nPersonally, I find FPW to be Pro Evolution Soccer to WWE's FIFA. The fact you can edit the wrestler's tendencies means they can act like their real world counterpart would do, and this makes each wrestler feel like an individual. This is evident as it is very common for players to create 'edits' (or 'CAWs' in WWE2K speak), and watch the PC sim the matches rather than play the matches yourself. When I played WWE 2K, the moves each wrestler had was different but the mindset/ tendencies/ mentality was the same. Much like Pro Evo's Player ID (where every player plays like he would in real life) versus FIFA's dominance with licenses where every team would 'look' like they do in real life, but actually when you play FIFA, every AI controlled team 'plays' exactly the same. Tough to say style over substance as the WWE 2K games can offer things (real WWE roster, Universe mode etc) that FPW doesn't. As a result, FPW suits a person who can get lost in their own imagination and create story lines in their heads, as well as enjoy the community element as you will rely on strangers to create your desired roster for you (or you can create edits yourself).\n\nPlease note, FPW is in early access and I can safely say that the monthly updates are great as Spike actually listen to what's being said on the threads/ forums and make adjustments accordingly. They understand that the people who are playing FPW now are, by and large, the same people who were playing FP before, and this makes loyal fans even more loyal. Also, as it is a PC game, mods and all sorts are making their way into the game to make the experience even more immersive. \n\nIf pure aesthetic glitz and glamour is your thing (FIFA's licenses and presentation, for example) is your thing then you may not be convinced by FPW, but if you want a fighting game mechanic that is truly unique, and you consider yourself a long time wrestling fan (I say 'long time' as I assume younger players won't get their heads around the graphics/ mechanics/ easy DIY roster building) and have never played this game before, then I suggest you by it now before the price goes up. Personally, I think the game will get better as time goes on (at the time of writing they have just released another patch with new arenas) and FPW should be considered a rite of passage for any gaming wrestling fan.", "timestamp_created": 1507048245, "timestamp_updated": 1507113304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35433845": {"recommendationid": "35433845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116231604", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513543057}, "language": "english", "review": "Unlike every other wrestling game I ever played (just about all of them), I can actually have fun just watching matches in FPW.

Fire Pro Wrestling World is the latest installment of the beloved Japanese pro wrestling series which also marks its first appearance on the PC. Old school fans will remember fumbling through complicated menus and memorizing a handful of Hiragana letters in order to play. Not anymore! This groundbreaking grappler has never been more accessible and the addition of the Steam Workshop means it\u2019s never been easier to fight your wildest dreams to the death.\n\nThe formula hasn\u2019t changed much, but it didn\u2019t have to. Take your surprisingly-detailed 2D combatant into the 3D squared circle and wreak havoc. A new tutorial mode exists to make things easier on rookies, but everything is as straight-forward as ever. Only a jabroni would even consider button mashing. Fire Pro has always been about perfectly timing your moves and balancing your stamina en route to a flawless victory. Tag teams, steel cages, barbed wire, battles royal, landmines, kickboxing, MMA rules, or just plain old fashioned pro wrestling are just a few of the options available to you. Outside of the fighting, Fire Pro has always been about customization. Design your own refs, rings, belts, movesets, and, of course, wrestlers, with an easy-to-use editor featuring an impossible number of combinations. It\u2019s the only wrestling game you\u2019ll ever need and arguably the only one that ever needed to be made.

Fire Pro Wrestling World iterates on past titles, adding a slew of new match types, moves, customization options, easy modding, and online multiplayer for the first time ever. \n\nUnlike other wrestling games which operate on stamina and special move gauges, Fire Pro allows its players complete freedom in how a wrestling match is played out. On the one hand, it boasts solid striking and a deep pacing system where early on small moves soften the opponent up for big moves. This makes matches feel tight and competitive, while still feeling like a pro-wrestling match (as opposed to a fighting game). On the other, players are also free to allow their wrestler to take big moves early, to heighten the drama or create a squash match. Also available are MMA (both ring and octagon), boxing, K1, and deathmatches (both barbed wire and explosive), tournaments, and league play. \n\nThanks to Steam Workshop integration, you don't have to dive into the somewhat-tedious character creator, and your active rosters can be as varied as you wish. At the time of writing, my personal subsribtion count sits at almost 750 wrestlers-- spanning many eras and promotions of actual pro-wrestling, to TV, anime, games, books, and movies. If you've ever wanted to see Trump get a fork jammed in his forehead by an angry Homer Simpson, for example, you can absolutely get that done in this game. Factions, stables, promotions, and the like are easy to set up and transfer wrestlers into. You can even set whether a particular group is loved or jeered by the crowds.\n\nAlso exciting is the devs' embrace of the modding community. Many mod-packs exist (some even stickied on the steam discussion board by the developers), allowing for basic things like ring textures all the way to rule changes or completely new match types (inferno deathmatch! explosive balloon deathmatch! K1 rules!). Mods are exceedingly simple to apply, as well. \n\nI've yet to play any online matches, so I'll not comment on the netcode other than to say I haven't seen many complaints about it. I will mention that the game supports at least four local players for all your tag-team and fatal four-way needs, and also allows for a mix of player-controlled and AI wrestlers to participate together. \n\nAll in all, Fire Pro Wrestling World understands what pro-wrestling is about: freedom of expression. From the minutae of holding a button to sell a slam long enough for your opponent to climb a turnbuckle and make themselves famous, to the much broader strokes of deciding who you want in your game, in what promotion, in what ring, in what match type, for what belt, FPWW has it all.", "timestamp_created": 1504087559, "timestamp_updated": 1504087559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514286", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34595386": {"recommendationid": "34595386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158473712", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1515292848}, "language": "english", "review": "Legit the only thing I don't like about this game is how often CPUs try to pin and do submissions right on the ropes, it gets annoying when a simple pull to the middle would be fine.

You walk around until you knock into each other, at which point the wrestlers will grapple. As soon as the animation finishes, that's when you want to hit your attack buttons. First person to register an attack wins the grapple and gets the move. You have to start with your small grapple moves first!

If you're the type of person that wonders what would happen if New Jack teamed up with Baron Von Raschke to take on Bobby Eaton and Fandango in a barbed wire death match, then this is the game for you. It's exciting to think that it is still only Early Access; I would love to see some kind of career mode in the future.

Die Fire Pro Serie ist seit dem Jahr 1989 fest in der japanischen Spielekultur verankert, und freut sich ebenfalls \u00e4u\u00dferste Beliebtheit bei den Fans aus den nordamerikanischen L\u00e4ndern und auch in Europa. Doch was macht Fire Pro denn wirklich so besonders?\n\nDas [b] Modding![/b]  Die Community der Fire Pro Spiele (dazu geh\u00f6rig auch die Spin Offs \u00e1 la King of Colosseum) ist wirklich gro\u00df, sehr akribisch am arbeiten und \u00fcberaus freundlich. Es gibt allerlei Arten von Wrestlern zu finden, Ringe, Championship G\u00fcrtel und und und. Bei diesem Spiel, also Fire Pro Wrestling World, findet man im Steam Workshop nun weitaus mehr als 10000 Edits zum runterladen. Custom Rings, Belts werden noch in Folge reingepatcht (das Spiel ist im EA). Man hat wirklich so viele M\u00f6glichkeiten im Editierbereich, dass man einen Jushin Thunder Liger genauso echt aussehen lassen kann, wie Hulk Hogan oder sogar fiktive Charaktere wie Akuma von Street Fighter. Zudem hat der Workshop die l\u00e4stigen \"Packs\" abgeschafft und mit dem \"Kollektion\" Button, kann man auch die komplette ECW aus den 90er Jahren runterladen mit paar Klicks.\n\nEbenfalls ein gro\u00dfes Plus ist die [b] Simulation[/b] . Kein Wrestling Spiel l\u00e4sst zwei CPUs so realistisch gegeneinander k\u00e4mpfen wie diese, daf\u00fcr ist im Editier Bereich die Logic \"schuld\". Erfahrene Fire Pro Spieler wissen ganz genau wie man einen Charakter realistisch nach baut, sodass man das Gef\u00fchl hat man schaut wirklich ein echtes Wrestlingmatch. Es gibt Menschen, inklusive mir, die noch nie (!) ein einziges Match selber gespielt haben, und ich bin bspw. seit 2005 \"dabei\".\n\nWenn man selber spielen will, dann muss man Mumm haben. Das Ding ist nicht einfach zu spielen, es ist nach dem typisch japanischen Stil gerichtet mit den Grapple Buttons. Jede Taste hat seinen Hintergrund, wenn man vor einem Gegner steht dann ist man im Front Grapple Mode. Stehst du hinter einem? Back Grapple, usw. Es ist kein Button smashing angesagt, sondern Timing ist das A und O. Seid auf jeden Fall geduldig!\n\nDie Grafik ist in 2D gehalten, was vielleicht direkt viele abschrecken wird im Jahre 2017, aber es ist eben das klassische Fire Pro, welches sich gegen die 3D Version King of Colosseum durchgesetzt hat. \n\n[b] Kurzum:[b]  Fire Pro ist was f\u00fcr Wrestling und MMA Fans, welche es gerne realistisch und anspruchsvoll m\u00f6gen. Der Editierbereich ist unfassbar riesig, mit dem Patch von heute sind sogar MP3 Entrance Themes erlaubt, welche man seinen Charakteren zuschustern kann.

Fire Pro Wrestling is a franchise that got it right and kept getting it right all the way to now. Its not even a question. The 2K series is good for visuals but if you want the blood and guts, scientific, technical, and just has the stuff look no further than this. Its a wrestling fan's wrestling game. I can't even begin to start listing the reasons but i'll provide as much as my attention span will let me. \n\nThe workshop here on Steam basically makes this game a must have. The cream of the crop in wrestling fans know this franchise. They know the wrestlers of past and present. They lived it as kids. Many of them grew up to become software engineers and ners o plenty. They create the best content any workshop game has ever had. The amount of wrestlers people have made for this game is ongoing. Forever. And Ever. It will never stop. If you think its just a cosmetic feature think again.\n\nThis game plays the \"mentality\" of the wrestlers. From their skill set to the moves they'll use while under AI control. Its like magic. For the wrestling veterans think Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboats arm drags. The ones he'd hit two or three in a row to frustrate his opponent. This guy @Senator Phillip's made a content pack of wrestlers that include \"The Dragon\" and while watching a match with none other than Ric Flair, he hit a three piece of those and it took me back to watching those two go at it many a time on TBS. In game they'll give you a 20 minute classic just like the old days. Their matches were never under a 95% match rating and they were splitting the wins like the old days.\n\nFlair gives you the \"woooooo\" during his figure fours. The person doing the making of this create a wrestler NAILED the entire thing. Like a symphony of wrestling. I encourage you to see his work.\n\nIf you want the stars of yesteryear battling with today's guys. Get this game.\n\nThe Rock vs Steamboat\nAJ Styles vs. Flying Bryan Pillman\nHHH vs. Barry Windham\nStone Cold Steve Austin vs. Brock Lesnar\n\nGet the game. Watch the Matches.

We got great wrestling experiences unlike the ones we get today from 2K studios. The wrestling games that 2k makes every year improve few things, and are lacking in features compared to the games from when we were kids. But if there was one game from that old period that stood out from the rest, it was Fire Pro Wrestling Returns (the sequel to the game \u201cFire Pro Wrestling\u201d). It wasn't like any other game, it had old school 2D graphics, customization for nearly everything, and it had a fantastic grapple system, in short, the game was a masterpiece. The series began in Japan during the late 80\u2019s, and none of the games from the series were sold outside of Japan until 2005. Sadly, this was the last Fire Pro game to be developed for another 10 years. But after waiting for so long, fans of the Fire Pro series are getting the sequel they\u2019ve always wanted.\n\nWell, here it is, Fire Pro Wrestling Word, let\u2019s talk about the customizability. The game is just as customizable as its previous installments, if not better. With the ability to create and edit wrestlers as well as referees, players are sure to love this game, though It is lacking in the amount of clothes you can put on a wrestler. you can create as many wrestlers as you want, as long as you have the space for it. You can also change the settings of matches with things like background music, DQ, count out, etc. The devs have also revealed on Twitter that they are going to allow you to upload custom music to use as wrestler entrance themes, as well as background music. One issue I had with the game was how complicated creating a custom wrestler was. You have to download them from the workshop, and then you have to go to create new wrestler/model wrestler to set them up to a promotion and team. This confused me as I spent multiple hours downloading wrestlers off the workshop only to not no where they were, I had to use google to figure it out.\n\nThe grappling in this game is alot different than most wrestling games. The wrestlers grapple by walking into each other, then an animation plays of them locking up, where you need to go through a sort of quick time event in order to do a move. It takes a few hours to get used to it but when you do, It works great. Another Flaw I have is that in order to hit your opponent you have to be a precise distance away from them or it won\u2019t connect.\n\nI must say for an early access game, it\u2019s pretty clean, I have only discovered one real bug. Sometimes when a computer opponent has a weapon, their player model will start to turn in different directions really fast, which always make me dizzy whenever I see it. Overall this is a very high recommend for fans of the wrestling genre. I can\u2019t wait for them to finish it, this could end up being the greatest wrestling game of all time, only time will tell. Finally, I give this game a 7/5 in true Dave Meltzer fashion due to its great customization, unique gameplay, and an affordable price.", "timestamp_created": 1501870613, "timestamp_updated":

The workshop already has so many entries of different wrestlers from a variety of different promotions and eras to make those who are interested in simulating fantasy matches are going to get a good amount of mileage out of this game. I personally find the simplified 2-D graphics to be very charming as well as having sweet animations for most of the moves, and the sound effects during matches are good at making you feel that big moves have impact. The gameplay is the same solid, responsive, timing-based fare that every most Fire-Pro Wrestling games have and still feels mostly good despite having some move animations having ambiguous timing to connect. The game's mision mode is a great way for new players to get acquainted with it's first tutorial missions and have some pretty challenging missions for more experienced players. The only real negatives from them are that the missions involvng you taking the role as a manager really only relies on your A.I. partner being any good that match and that missions involving getting match ratings of 80% or better really only requires drawing out the match longer than you would like. I would've prefered match ratings to have been gone entirely in my opinion.

Auch f\u00fcr Nicht-Wrestlingfans interessant, da die Fire Pro-Reihe auf einzigartige Weise klassisches Arcade-Fighting mit kreativer T\u00fcftelei verbindet.\n\nDie Early Access-Version ist reichhaltig ausgestattet: umfangreiche Spielmodi vom klassischen 1 gegen 1 Wrestling-Match bishin zu MMA-Cagefighting, Massenpr\u00fcgeleien mit bis zu 8 K\u00e4mpfern gleichzeitig oder explosivem Stacheldraht-Gemetzel ist alles geboten. Online spielen funktioniert bereits recht gut und der Edit-Modus, in dem man seinen eigenen K\u00e4mpfer erstellt bietet fast unbegrenzte M\u00f6glichkeiten. Die mitgelieferte Auswahl an K\u00e4mpfern ist zwar etwas d\u00fcnn, jedoch schafft der Workshop hier Abhilfe: hier wurden bereits mehrere Tausend Wrestler und andere unm\u00f6gliche Figuren von Super Mario bis hin zu Nemesis aus Resident Evil hochgeladen. Per Mausklick holt man sich diese ins Spiel und kann so wohl so ziemlich jeden Kampf veranstalten, den das Herz begehrt.\n\nFire Pro verbindet, so wie jedes gute Retro-Spiel, Einfachheit und Herausforderung. Steuerung und Gameplay sind einerseits intuitiv und simpel gehalten - ein Knopf f\u00fcr schwache Attacken, einen f\u00fcr mittlere, einen f\u00fcr starke, einen zum Laufen, einen zum Pin und einen zum Ruhen - mehr braucht man eigentlich nicht. Andererseits will das Spielen erlernt werden - die K\u00e4mpfe basieren auf Timing und Positionierung. Daher hat Fire Pro etwas, das nicht mehr viele Spiele mitbringen: eine Lernkurve. So tut sich mancher Anf\u00e4nger schwer, \u00fcberhaupt mal einen Move durchzubringen - sp\u00e4ter jedoch wird er spielend komplizierte Attacken aus dem Stand landen. Dieser Effekt des pers\u00f6nlichen Fortschritts ist etwas besonderes. Der \"Mission Mode\" - 50  Einzelmissionen mit bestimmten Aufgaben inklusive Tutorial bietet eine sehr gute Einstiegshilfe f\u00fcr den Fire Pro-Neuling. Das \"Match Rating\" System, welches die vom Spieler abgelieferten K\u00e4mpfe nach Spannung etc. bewertet bietet zus\u00e4tzliche Motivation, mit dem Gegner einen Top-Kampf aufs Parkett zu legen.\n\nDas Herzst\u00fcck des Spiels ist wohl der Edit-Modus. Hier k\u00f6nnen eigene K\u00e4mpfer, Kampfringe, Schiedsrichter oder G\u00fcrtel erstellt werden. Wer im eigenen Wrestling- oder Fighting-Universum bis ins Detail Regie f\u00fchren m\u00f6chte, ist hier an der richtigen Adresse. Dank der simpel gehaltenen \"Bauteile\" gelingen einem leicht vorzeigbare Kreationen, wobei sich endlose Variationsm\u00f6glichkeiten ergeben. T\u00fcftler k\u00f6nnen sich hier voll ausleben: beispielsweise l\u00e4sst sich das Verhalten eines K\u00e4mpfers in unterschiedlichen Situationen durch simples Ver\u00e4ndern einiger Prozentwerte \"programmieren\". Es ist schon etwas besonderes, das Verhalten eines K\u00e4mpfers zu programmieren und anschlie\u00dfendem im CPU vs. CPU-Test das Resultat zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Dieser experimentelle/forschende Aspekt ist eine ganz besondere Eigenheit dieses Spiels und f\u00fcr Simulations-Freunde ein Traum. Wer es lieber etwas einfacher hat, kann auch einfach einen der vorgefertigten K\u00e4mpfer als Vorlage kopieren.\n\nDer Online-Modus funktioniert recht gut, die Bugs die wenige Tage nach Release noch vorhanden waren wurden bereits gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils beseitigt. Bemerkenswert ist hier, dass man einerseits entscheiden kann, ob man mit seinem Online-Gegner ein gutes Match zeigen will (\"Pro Wrestling\") oder man sich in klassischer Fighting Game Manier auf Sieg oder Niederlage bekriegt. Au\u00dferdem gibt es auch ahier die M\u00f6glichkeit, einfach nur Zuschauer zu sein.\n\nDer Support von den Entwicklern ist einfach fabelhaft: 2 Wochen nach Release gab es bereits zwei Patches in denen so gut wie alle Bugs beseitigt wurden und sogar noch neue Spielfeatures hinzukamen. Davon k\u00f6nnten sich so manche gr\u00f6\u00dfere Firmen wirklich eine Scheibe  abschneiden.\n\nZusammenfassend l\u00e4sst sich sagen, dass Fire Pro World f\u00fcr ein Early Access-Spiel bereits sehr weit ist und mit den Verbesserungen und zus\u00e4tzlichen Features die im Laufe der n\u00e4chsten Wochen noch hinzukommen werden wird wohl ein absolutes High End-Spiel am Ende dabei herauskommen.

Anyway this one pissed me off on multiple levels in just an hour so I doubt I'll be able to find much joy in giving it more time.

Sono tornato a provare quel senso di libert\u00e0 e di immaginazione scatenata che avevo da bambino, potendo creare la mia federazione, con pressappoco qualsiasi wrestler che io voglia. Ed \u00e8 qui che FPW riesce dove i giochi WWE no. Da una parte un editor incredibile e apparentemente senza limiti, e dall'altra parte un'esperienza sul ring che pu\u00f2 sembrare proibitiva e poco user-friendly per i neofiti, ma una volta capito il funzionamento, riesce a dare tantissime soddisfazioni ogni volta che si mette a segno una mossa. Gli incontri sembrano proprio come quelli veri, il feeling di ogni match ti fa sentire coinvolto! Ogni scelta va ponderata bene: Bisogna tentare una mossa rischiosa nelle fasi iniziali per cercare di avvantaggiarsi? Oppure combattere in modo ragionato e conservativo? Non c'\u00e8 quel senso di \"script\" e di \"finto\" che pu\u00f2 magari dare un WWE 2K, ma in ogni momento senti il pieno controllo sul tuo lottatore e sulle dinamiche dell'incontro. Il gioco \u00e8 ancora in accesso anticipato, quindi non \u00e8 esente da bug e problemi tecnici, ma le patch sono frequenti e Spike Chunsoft si sta impegnando per limare al meglio il proprio titolo. Spero che le mie parole vi abbiano quanto meno messo curiosit\u00e0 su questa saga che ho tanto amato e che gioco dalla versione FPWR su PS2; certamente non sar\u00f2 espertissimo ma da quando l'ho toccata con mano la prima volta, mi ci sono innamorato.

The customization options in the game were practically ENDLESS and you could literally create anyone you could think of, whether it'd be a wrestler, an actor or a comic books character. It was a really great game.\n\nNow I've bought Fire Pro World in Early Access and I do understand that it's still in development and it will receive options like logos editor and custom music for entrances  (something that couldn't be included in Returns), but it really lacks as a sequel especially since it is 2017 right now, so well over 8yrs since Returns was released, and it didn't fix some of the really annoying stuff that was in the series for a while now. It is also missing new features unfortunately, as well as any graphical options, but I will get to those in a moment.\n\n1st:\nThe most annoying thing in the series ever since I can remember: STRIKING MECHANICS!\nThe hitboxes are absolutely AWFUL. I fully understand that the devs do want to keep the \"soul\" of the series and not get on the fans bad side by introducing seriously drastic changes to its formula, but this needs to be fixed. I don't want the strikes to be super easy to do, but currently they are nearly impossible to connect unless the opponent is groggy/dazed, whatever you call it ;P.\n\nYou need to be PERFECTLY lined up with your opponent or you'll miss all your standing, running or weapon strikes. This is even more annoying since the environments are made in 3D and character models are sprites. If you're a mere half a milimetre above or below your opponent, again, you'll miss. Running strikes/grapples are impossible to do unless the opponent is groggy or you Irish Whip 'em and run to the opposite ropes.\nThe hitboxes for the strike game during a match are really in a serious need of an improvement. I didn't think I'll ever say it, but we've got 2017, and the hitboxes in this are worse than in really old beat 'em ups like Double Dragon, Streets of Rage etc.\n\n\n2nd:\nSo far, the game seems to be a straight-up PC port of Fire Pro Wrestling Returns. Is it a really, REALLY bad thing? Nope, since Returns was a great game, but it's defnitely not a good thing either.\nThe game lacks features. Sure, it has the match types, customization options and the completely original and unique vibe of the Fire Pro series but that's not really enough anymore I'm afraid.\n\nWhy there's no new match types in this installment? How about a Tables match with some added table mechanics? Breaking tables in a Fire Pro game? THAT WOULD BE AWESOME O_O! Something like Hell in a Cell where we could climb and fight on the top of the said cage? More weapon moves, like weapon grapples? Why even add the announcer tables this time around if we can't even climb up on them :/?\nThis really isn't satisfying enough given that I've waited over 8yrs for a new Fire Pro game, just to get what I consider a port of Fire Pro Returns with new moves added to it.\n\n\n3rd:\nThe graphical options. Now again, I'm fully aware that the game is in Early Access, but it lacks ANY video options at all. It only has a switch between \"Full Screen\" and \"WIndowed\" modes. Whether you choose one or another, the game is stuck in a resolution of 1280x720 which is 720p, My native resolution is 1920x1080 and the only way to have the game to run in this resolution is to change the game registry entries :x.\n\nMenus fonts are really blurry, washed out and seem to be low-res. I was able to somewhat fix it with a 3rd party app called SweetFX/ReShade, but it simply makes them sharper, which helps a little but since they're in low-res and blurry to start with, it's not an amazing sort of improvement unfortunately. Not even having an option to change the resolution is a joke nowadays. Bad one at that. Two patches for the game were already released, but none of them added this option...\n\nThere's also no any textures options or at least some sort of filters that would make the game and the character models look better, as opposed to the current mediocre pastel-like look. Models look like the developers would use some sort of a brush feature of a picture editing program like Photoshop on them to make them look higher quality than in Returns. The result is rather, well, ok-ish at best. Returms models also had this technique used on them, but models in World seem to have a good 3 times as much of this effect applied to them.\n\nThis is just my 2 cents about the current state of the game. I'll update it somewhere down the road after a few months when the game gets significantly more patches and maybe some new match types, features etc. although I'm rather sceptical when it comes to new match types.\n\n\nI'll still play the game in its current state as I simply love this series :), but this won't make me feel less disappointed with it feeling like a simple PC port of Fire Pro Wrestling Returns, with the only changes being added announcer tables which you can't even interact with, new moves, custom music option coming \"in the future\" and Steam Workshop support which, in the end, isn't even an actual in-game feature.\n\nI can recommend this only to somebody who liked and still likes Returns a lot and doesn't mind playing the same thing again but on PC this time around.", "timestamp_created": 1500755176, "timestamp_updated": 1500755742, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33728950": {"recommendationid": "33728950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248903514", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 355, "last_played": 1516058543}, "language": "english", "review": "You should notice how most of the reviews on the first page have over 30 hours into the game.

As a long time fan of the Fire Pro Wrestling series, I think this game has a lot of potential and is a dream come true for many fans. Just one week in there are already thousands of wrestler edits on the steam workshop--a testament to the power of the creation tools. If you're already familiar with FPR gameplay on PS2/PS3 you'll feel right at home in FPWW. Nothing significant has changed in regard to controls & gameplay, but if it's not broke it doesn't need to be fixed. There are a few new gameplay mechanics such as the fighting spirit feature where two wrestlers slug it out for a few seconds, but most of the game's real improvements are built around the strong creation features and integrated steam workshop support.  There are a handful of new animations/moves that have been added since FPR; many are moves from the modern day WWE and Indy scene. While the additions are not as numerous as I had assumed they'd be given the 12 year gap since the last Fire Pro game, I am hopeful that we'll continue to see new moves added to the game as development continues.\n\nSure there are a few bugs/glitches but this IS early access so that's to be expected.

Complete your review adventure with over 500 more words for only $29.99!\" \n\n\nI've loved wrestling games since Title Match Pro Wrestling for the Atari. So many good ones, especially in the late 90's, have come and gone. Unfortunately, the last few years have been pretty unimpressive overall, excepting the fancy graphics and presentations (commentary will never be great - but it can at least be ok at times). \n\nSo here's Fire Pro Wrestling World on Steam for $20.\n\nI won't go over what others have said. Great controls, limitless customization, etc. You've heard that. I want to sum Fire Pro up slightly differently.\n\n1. You won't be buying another version next year for $59.99 (not including DLC!)\n2. They won't be shutting the online servers off when the new one comes out, or the year after if you're lucky.\n3. You won't be having to figure out new and/or tweaked controls in 2018, because a AAA wrestling game doesn't have the money or creativity to have it figured out after 17 years.\n4. \"Why can't I do that?\" Is uttered FAR less frequently in Fire Pro.\n5. \"Holy &#%! I can do that?\" Is uttered FAR more frequently in Fire Pro.\n6. Bull Nakano (translation - best edit/CAW community in the world)\n7. LOGIC\n8. The \"YES OH YES!\" moments of wrestling games are back.\n\nThis list will grow. I don't review games for this very reason. My opinion can change \"later\" for most games, and the list of reasons always grows, either for good or bad. But I've spent 14 hours with this version of Fire Pro and I can say with absolute certainty that any minor issues (and they exist - but are just that - minor) are nothing more than a blink. The fun I have had with this game is true, old-school fun at it's best.\n\nThe last thing I will say is this - take your time, learn the controls, do the missions. Fire Pro demands you learn patience, timing, and observation. Also, you will get no health bars, because you don't need nor deserve one. You get to focus on the action, and you will be SO thankful for this. Wrestling games are always more fun when you're not constantly having to watch what basically amounts to a giant cheat meter at the top of the screen.\n\n\nI could go on and on. I want to. But it's pointless to just go over what many others have more than sufficiently discussed here already. They will tell you what makes Fire Pro such an amazing game in great detail. I'm just here to tell you that they are absolutely right. \n\n$20.", "timestamp_created": 1500575206, "timestamp_updated": 1500598081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0,

The 2D sprites are more defined and sharper than ever. The classic Fire Pro Wrestling soundtrack has had an overhaul and I expect more classics to be added in the development stage too.\n\n It's quite hard to grasp that this is only an early access title because of how mind-blowing it is. It has the largest customization options of any wrestling game to date. The classic timing based gameplay is here and it's easier than ever for new audiences to pick up and master thanks to the Mission Mode in the game which clearly explains the controls and how to perform the basics. \n\nWhat's more is, the two newest features in this game happen to be the best parts. The Steam workshop allows anyone to upload any wrestler and download them instantly, so if you're like me and lazy, you can have pretty much any wrestler you want on the in-game roster without having to go and create them yourself. The other new addition is the online play which can be challenging and incredibly fun too, coming from someone who never plays online anything.\n\nIn conclusion, this is everything the Fire Pro Wrestling games were built up to be, it's still amazing, the whole community loves it and for good reason. It's been 10 years since the American release of Fire Pro Wrestling Returns and I'm so happy to see that people are still passionate enough for these games to be made.

If it doesn't exist, you can be sure someone is working on making it exist. The editor is incredibly robust and allows for an accurate simulation to the actual real life wrestlers.\n\nAs it's early access, the game is a bit rough around the edges in terms of some content, such as no story mode being available and some menus might feel stiff to navigate. There are currently few rings to select and while planned there currently is no way to add in custom BGM for your wrestler intros. \n\nThat being said, this is absolutely worth the asking price for just the sheer amount of possible wrestling matchups you can simulate, from historical wrestling matches to fictional what if matches like Spider Man vs The Undertaker. \n\nI'm new to the FPW series but have played some WWE and other wrestling games in the past, and the wrestling feels fast paced and dependent on reaction time than button mashing for the most part. The game heavily relies on successful grapples and wearing down your opponent before you can pull off the finishers and bigger moves. This can be seen as formulaic, as most matches run the same course where you start with low moves, move up to medium and end with finishers and big moves, but the game still manages to be fun while going through this loop. The AI can also be pretty tough with the reaction times needed to succeed in a grapple, but you can also cheese the game with the same moves over and over. Though obviously you're meant to play it out as if it were a wrestling match. \n\nI haven't tried much online mode except for a few cpu vs cpu sim modes. People actually do watch cpus fight it out online, which might seem a bit odd at first as to why such a mode exists where you just watch the AI fight with other people online, but the amount of pride people have for their creations and their logic makes it so it's actually interesting to see how the AI fares in a battle of edits. It ends up making sense why this is a mode. I hear the online functionality outside of this could use more work, as in the delay and lag makes matches unfun. As this is early access, I'll remain hopeful in this regard. If nothing else, the sim modes definitely worked well. There's a prematch lobby where you can chat with other users before the match. At least at a basic level, the online component is decent.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely say this is worth your time if you're into wrestling games, especially since the game can only improve if they continue to update it with more features. The game honestly is worth it just for the sheer amount of edits available for pretty much any character you can imagine.

My other previous exposure to this series was on a portable handheld, Game Boy Advance. I write this review as also a fan of the Old School Wrestling games dating back to the Sega Genesis/Snes Era if we really want to count. -I also played them on the NES- (WWF Royal Rumble/WWF RAW, Saturday Night Slammasters,) To the 3d Era: (WCW/NWO Revenge N64, Smackdown Know Your Role/WWF Warzone (PS1) To Smackdown Here Comes The Pain through the Smackdown VS Raw Ps2/Xbox Days. \n\nI may have purchased just one of the WW2k titles. It's quite the same old same old in my humble opinion. I may have bought WW2k16 for my younger brother in a selfish attempt also to see of the series has evolved. To my dismay it hadn't. \n\nI am also a die-hard fan of MDickies WRESTLING REVOLUTION. One of the better wrestling games out there in my humble opinion despite it's archaic look and feel. The randomness included in that game alongside the possibility of major injury and even death in it's booking mode makes it completely different from the rest of the market that I've explained previously...\n\nWhy would I tell you all of this?\n\nBecause Fire Pro Wrestling World is unlike any of those other games as well. It is as a wrestling game, as what New Japan is to a WWE Fan. You're probably going to be stepping into a brand new world if this is your first time venturing into the Fire Pro series.\n\nIf you're a veteran and you're on the fence, you've been here before and done that before. This is basically already Fire Pro Wrestling returns  in a package with \"updated graphics\" (for those of you who are graphic whores and aren't already turned off by the 16bit-look) and Infinite Roster Space for you to mess around with the Steam Workshop to fill. It has been very easy for me to fill up separate rosters on this game from WCW, WWF/WWE, Lucha Underground, AAA, NJPW, and...ahem...TNA. \n\nYou can also create inifinte custom wrestlers. They have added more \"layers\" to make customization so precice that you can make anyone from John Cena to Antonio Onoki. What I'm trying to say is you'll be able to create any amount of custom wrestlers you may have had in your head, set up their computer A.I. (it can get pretty complicated if you WANT IT TO, otherwise you can just leave the A.I. logic default) and start having them go for titles in no time.\n\nFire Pro Wrestling world is a sandbox that is begging you to come play in it. From the get go you will need to:\n\nCreate your own championships: (Can be done in a flash, although Workshop Downloads would be nice}\nCreate your rings: {Again, the option to be able to download rings via the workshop would be nice)\nCreate your separate promtions and fill up their rosters.\n\nOnce you've done this, you can step into the tutorial. (JUST DO THE DAMN TUTORIAL) and then step into the ring.\n\nOnce in the ring you will find:\n\nA very deep yet accessible timing-based-strike-and-grapple-system. (You will not succeed button mashing)\nA surprising amount of depth that is possible with the matches. You will be vaulting over the ropes, getting into strong-style fighting spirit slug-fests, and powerslamming from top-rope counters in no time.\n\nup to 4v4 matches so far, with Tornado Tag & Traditional Tag Variants. Countdown Battle Royals (Royal Rumbles) Hardcore matches, Barbed Wire Matches, Lumberjack, Cage Matches, MMA Style, submission matches the list goes on....\n\nBlood is in this game. Also there is a chance for a random \"critical\" which can knock y'arse out instantly if you get caught. It's random, you have no control in it and it doesn't happen often. It's awesome to see an RKO outta nowhere \" Crit\" Jake The Snake Roberts for the 1-2-3. \n\nAnywho this review has been long enough so support this game if you're the least bit interested. It's a great one to keep up to date with current superstars as well as blasts from the past. If you're wanting an \"easy\" wrestling game I will go on ahead and warn you now. Button mashers also need not apply here. It simply will not work. There is an Online Function but as of this review it's 1v1 only with promises to update. I don't trust wrestling games online so it doesn't matter.\n\nMy only con is that there is no \"Booking\" mode like there is for MDickies Wrestling Revolution. But that is also being harsh because Wrestling Revolution is a totally different game. But I would love for the capability of random injuries and/or deaths to occur in Fire Pro Wrestling....that would be lovely...\n\nI felt compelled to write this review after:\n\nMaking a 4v4 traditional tag match between Bullet Club: Bad Luck Fale, Toma Tonga, Tanga Roa & Yujiro Takahashi [v] Los Ingobernables de Japon: Ticking Time Bomb, Tatsuya Nieto, Bushi & Sanada. (Should tell you what kind of wrestling fan I am)\n\nIn this match I saw:\nMe as Bushi get tossed to the outside so both Tongans & Takahashi could take pot shots at me to the 11 count before the rest of L.I.J would come and help me.\n\nPerfectly timed taunts from Bad Luck Fale and Takahashi after they powerbombed the hell of me and put me in an impressive double-team sequence. \n\nNieto run off the ropes, stop in the middle of the ring, and taunt when his opponent (Takahashi) was outside the ring. It was a shame it wasn't his laying down \"tranquilo\" taunt but you get the point.\n\nSee blood stain the ring after weapons got involved.\n\nAnd when I lost after a well-timed powerslam counter in that same match. Computer Level was on 7/9.\n\n\n\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1500433369, "timestamp_updated": 1500433369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33642881": {"recommendationid": "33642881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404301597", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 324, "last_played": 1515907420}, "language": "english", "review": "Its Fire Pro.

Simple things like the ability to move designs around or allowing certain things being on only one arm or leg would go a long way.\n- A few notable omissions in moves. I know every move is never going to make the cut but some being missing feels pretty glaring. Hopefully will be added eventually with the main game, DLC, or just slowly trickled out through patches.\n- Priority moves would be even better if you could attempt to chain two moves together that weren't relegated to the second one being a ground type move.\n- Game play wise I think rope breaks are a bit too sensitive, and strikes are not sensitive enough. I know eventually I will probably \"get\" striking so I will rarely miss but I don't think it needs to be so particular. I presume this is a hold out from the series so this will be labelled as blasphemy.\n\nWhile it's not the arcade-esque experience some people prefer in their wrestling games I think Fire Pro is nearly essential to at least try if you are a wrestling fan. \n", "timestamp_created": 1500388778, "timestamp_updated": 1500388778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33630018": {"recommendationid": "33630018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133843946", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511427985}, "language": "english", "review": "Freight Train beat Conor McGregor \n10/10 best fucking game\nedit:\nFreight Train has not lost my championship after 100 defenses GG", "timestamp_created": 1500384347, "timestamp_updated": 1511415272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33628518": {"recommendationid": "33628518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121767373", "num_games_owned": 3016, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 4534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511439071}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been a week since release.

Special thanks to FPW Director Tomoyuki Matsumoto for Fire Pro Wrestling G, which succeeded where Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny failed. The Fire Pro Wrestling series (at least starting in FPG with unlockable women parts) is the only video game series that made good use of my own original characters and made me proud of actually having some sort of imagination.\n\nVery Special thanks to community manager Dave K., I created this account solely to own this game day one, and he told me that my previous work seemed doable. Every character from my Fire Pro Returns save made it into the new experience, and a lot of new surprises were pulled off in this game as well.\n\nSpecial thanks to the team at Spike-Chunsoft for keeping all the assets from Fire Pro Wrestling Returns Edit Mode and all of the new moves and features that came with each update. I wish you all luck post-Early Access.\n\nMost of this review takes the wrestlers of the Magi Wrestling Federation into account, but I'll talk about the Mission Mode first. This mode reminded me of Fire Pro G's Edit Ranking in terms of variety, and taught me different ways to work a match for higher evaluation, since that also returns from the portable games. Some missions even made me do things I never did before, like controlling a second at ringside and landing the cage dive move. Each mission is played as some of the original wrestlers Spike-Chunsoft designed for the game. These characters were used to market goods for the game, so Spike-Chunsoft shouldn't forget about them for future installments.\n\nA run-in slide was added, which is easy to use and you no longer crash if pressing the run button near the ring apron. The Exchange Blow is funny to watch, especially because you see it at least twice each match with different results each time. I don't know if they belong in an SWA Rules Match and Gruesome Fighting, though, but it's one of the best additions. The new rope escape is also fun to watch in sims. Seeing the characters of Magi crawling to the ropes for dear life is something I wanted in a Fire Pro game for a very long time. The more worn down, the further they slide, and I always crack up when I see them slide as if it will save their lives, especially in Lumberjack Deathmatches were rope breaks are turned off. OKITE YABURI! is also a fun addition, especially if a wrestler's finisher isn't a front grapple, as you'll never know what you're going to steal, and adds an element of surprise, especially seeing a wrestler using a move he or she wouldn't normally use.\n\nThe heart of the game, the Edit mode, is the best yet. There are no gradients, and I used them for only a couple of Edit Wrestlers, but I did a couple of things to get around that, one of which are the layers. You get 9 on each part and that allowed me to come up with a lot of varied ring gear variations for the characters. The appearance section of a character is where I spend the most time on, as I want to be done with all four attires before moving on to the Skill section, but with four costumes per Edit, and those 9 layers for each part, this was instant buy, I have played a bunch of games with character customization before and I can tell you that only Fire Pro did it better for me, really. The Moveset section is also the best the series got now as you get a list of moves for each category and looking for the one you want is a snap. Some moves have been renamed due to lack of unlicensed real wrestler likenesses, so if you don't have a copy of FPR nearby, then you need to memorize the animations of whatever move you're looking for.\n\nWhen this game came out in Early Access, it was very complete, and many things were added eventually. For Early Access, the content was nearly identical to FPR in such a way that I thought I didn't need anything else, they even bought S-1 Rules Match back. The only thing it's missing is Elimination Match, but I think the new load times won't allow it. Even then, you can make Exhibition matches featuring single, tag, 6 or 8-man scramble, handicap matches, tournaments, leagues, bunch of match types, battle royals (endless battle royal is my favorite mode of all) and with the match configuration, you can create a bunch of different match types. Customization is the name of the game in Fire Pro everywhere, and this game delivered a lot of it in Early Access that it's no wonder why it left it so quickly. Some updates even cleaned up the engine. Hooking your opponent into the post can be done diagonally now.\n\nEach update added to this game. Custom music allows you to have matches to any music you can think of, I mostly use Fire Pro music to get it right. Pretty hilarious watching some of the Magi wrestlers in a CPU vs. CPU match to Fire Pro Wrestling: Iron Slam '96 music. They even added a ring editor that doesn't require you to learn Photoshop, just import an image from your PC in the right size and not only insert it in the mat, but also on the apron and the corner posts as well. And speaking of which, there's the Workshop.\n\nWithout the Workshop, this game would be very difficult to recommend, as it's essentially a Do-it-yourself game, but not anymore. If you need a template, or a wrestler from a previous game, or pretty much anything else you can think of, the Workshop has a lot of wrestlers published from various authors within the Fire Pro community and other players who bought the game just to show their love of the game. There are even templates with logic already made by user DJKM, so you don't need to have a Bachelor's degree to enjoy a sim. Just subscribe, transfer your edit, and enjoy.\n\nOnline play has been added to this game as well, but the Edit mode and its new features were the main selling points for me. I've never enjoyed playing games online, and my internet connection isn't good for that (and after hurricane Maria, it will be worst for many years now).\n\nI've both simmed and played the game, clocking over thousand hours of it. It plays like the others I've played. Things such as hit detection and lack of 40-person battle royals do not phase me. I sim more overall because only Fire Pro does CPU vs. CPU right. I have plenty of other games on Steam, but the PC I'm running right now will not allow me to have them all, and this account, given its name, was created primarily for this game. It's pretty clear that everything else will remain in its shadow from here on, and if there's one thing this game did, is to get me off of 3D games indefinitely.\n\nSo, to end this rather long (but complete) review, I'm not a Fire Pro veteran, and I'm not an edit master (I just find a wrestler model, make a childlike/cute wrestler out of it, then tweak skills, parameters, moves and logic, if required) but I love this product. If there is something Fire Pro Wrestling G, Fire Pro Wrestling A, Fire Pro Returns and now, Fire Pro Wrestling WORLD have shown me, is that it is the only video game franchise with customization that has showcased my characters done right. From their appearances to their moves, only Fire Pro did it correctly.\n\nWithout fearing the change of time, we will continue to push and move forward.

A fanbase that will constanlty provide content for YEARS TO COME. Every wrestler EVER. Developers that give a damn, and that really really listen. They lurk, and they tell you they're lurking. Bears. 2D graphics.\n\nCONS: Learning curve. Overwhelming options for customization. Online is pretty buggy at the moment. No logo options yet. 2D graphics.\n\n\nWhile this is the most bare bones Fire Pro (it is Early Access, after all), don't let that stop you. Start the game with roughly thirty wrestlers? No, thanks, you say, until you go to the Workshop. \n\nThis game has only been out for a couple of weeks and there are about 4,000 edits available to download. This is a glimpse at what this fanbase is capable of.\n\nThere's a history lesson about this game out there, but I won't go into it. Google to see how long it's been going. If you're new to this game, here's FPWW in brief: create real or fictional wrestlers, feds, belts, and more. Have the CPU sim matches for you (this can be amazing if the Logic is well-done), or control them yourselves. Seem too difficult, can't get the timing down? Drop the skill level until you get the hang of it. Too easy? Raise it to 9, have yourself an epic, thirty minute match. \n\nI reccomend Tornado Tag with a friend, couch co-op style. Have a CRITICAL, or steal your opponent's move.\n\nThere's a whole series of Bear wrestlers, if you're into that. I mean the animal, but yeah, Wuvable Oaf fans will be pleased as well.\n\nIf you're expecting No Mercy-style gameplay, I'm not sure if this is akin to that. It's a different animal. If you're a fan of match pacing and storytelling, then this game is for you. Start small, work your way up. Think Omega vs. Okada, or Cena vs. AJ. The matches will surprise you, and near the end you'll be mashing buttons like you did back in the day, before quick-time moments happened.\n", "timestamp_created": 1500297678, "timestamp_updated": 1500297678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33607383": {"recommendationid": "33607383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404189888", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 29734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1515759104}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3088\u3046\u3084\u304f\u624b\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u304b\u306a\u308a\u7d4c\u3061\u307e\u3059\u304c\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u306e\u52aa\u529b\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9\u306e\u518d\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3044\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306f\u3068\u306b\u304b\u304f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u51fa\u6765\u3066\u3046\u308c\u3057\u3044\u3002\u60aa\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u304b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306f\u4f1a\u5834\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u3068\u304b\u5730\u65b9\u306e\u4f53\u80b2\u9928\u3068\u304b\u307b\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1500296414, "timestamp_updated": 1500296414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33605226": {"recommendationid": "33605226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025082797", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 79383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514956463}, "language": "english", "review": "I have spent an enormous amount of time just downloading wrestlers and assigning them to their respective feds.

Their focus is completely away from gameplay at this point. They didn't even address the striking system, which is a common complaint, and dismissed legitimate A.I. concerns in a very 'git gud' kind of way. A common theme in their responses to the other basic feature requests from amongst the community (e.g., logo editor, color gradients, title belts, asymmetrical costume design, title belts during entrances) amounted to 'limitations of the existing engine' and 'not enough money in the budget.'\n\nLooks like we're getting some form of a GM mode, MP3 support, and a UI redesign so..... yay? \n\n----------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThere's a lot to love about this game for long-time fans and newcomers to the series. However, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game to a wide audience of wrestling game fans, as other games offer a better overall experience. \n\nMost of the enjoyment one will get out of this game will be from watching CPU-controlled matches amongst your meticulously crafted custom characters. I can get behind this concept of watching -- rather than playing -- the game so long as the viewing experience is enjoyable. However, the viewing experience is hit-or-miss for me. I enjoy the art style, move animations, and crazy match types, but realistic character behavior is an absolute must if I am going to be primarily watching the game play itself. Sadly, the realism factor is lacking in fundamental ways.\n\nFirst, the in-ring action feels too much like an arcade game mish-mash of Greco Roman wrestling and professional wrestling. Most moves start with two characters dancing around in a circle for 1-2 seconds before performing a cartoony-looking collar-and-elbow tie-up (grapple). From this point, various suplexes, powerbombs, and signature moves can be performed. Beyond the repetitiveness of watching this goofy sequence frequently play out, this mechanic is unnatural for any sort of -- what should realistically  be -- a striking-type move (superkicks, enziguris, jabbing combinations, etc.). \n\nAs an aside, front-facing grappling moves are about 90% of the gameplay, mixed with a small pinch of Irish Whip moves and a smaller dash of everything else. The  CPU will rarely go for moves not initated by any sort of grapple, such as: running moves, apron moves, turnbuckle moves, or aerial moves. This severely hurts the enjoyment of watching these matches play out.\n\nThe striking system (kicks, punches, and weapon swings) is atrocious all around due to tiny hitboxes that require pixel-perfect spacing and alignment of the characters prior to initiating a strike. It's infuriating -- and frankly inexcusable -- to see strikes completely miss because the characters are too close or not aligned in a perfect horizontal plane. Generally speaking, rhe characters are constantly moving if they are upright so pixel-perfect spacing and alignment is difficult and makes striking an utterly useless game mechanic. Standing strikes may land once in evey twelve attempts. Strikes are quite common in real professional wrestling matches, so the broken striking mechanic detracts from the viewing experience.\n\nThe CPU will rarely initiate a straight pinfall attempt. There are often points in a match when a pinfall attempt would be realistic/logical (after finishers, big moves, weapon strikes, etc.), but the CPU will consistently stand next to a downed opponent until the opponent eventually stands back up. If it wasn't for other win conditions such as knock-outs, submissions, and rollup manuevers (e.g., small package), matches may go on indefinitely. A significant amount of the enjoyment, drama, pacing, and storytelling of real professional wrestling matches stems from pinfall attempts.\n\nAlmost all of my viewing enjoyment has been from listening to an entertaining streamer/YouTuber commentate during matches rather than watching the arcade-like action unfold on-screen. The viewing experience should be able to shine on its own, which it could if the A.I. behaved realistically.\n\nWith all of that stated, I prefer PLAYING matches in wrestling games rather than watching one play out. There is some enjoyment to be had in playing this game, for sure, but having player-controlled matches feels like a secondary priority to the overall experience this game offers.", "timestamp_created": 1500263017, "timestamp_updated": 1501136146, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33599521": {"recommendationid": "33599521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403722474", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1516235317}, "language": "japanese", "review": "test", "timestamp_created": 1500261728, "timestamp_updated": 1500261728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33599202": {"recommendationid": "33599202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042205435", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513924394}, "language": "english", "review": "Duke Nuken vs Jesus in a landmine deathmatch... nuff said", "timestamp_created": 1500260158, "timestamp_updated": 1500260158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33599192": {"recommendationid": "33599192", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996780748", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506127954}, "language": "english", "review": "The wrestling game fans have been waiting for since No Mercy.

I started reading about Fire Pro back in 1996/1997, and my first Fire Pro game was 6men Scramble on the Sega Saturn.\n\nTo this day, I still play 6ms.\n\nFPW (Fire ProWrestling World) is still in early access as of this review, so people who pick this up expecting the full game and all features *WILL* be disappointed.\n\nBeginners are brought through a tutorial mode, which is great as Fire Pro originally came out around the time of \"button masher\" wrestling games (think \"WWF SuperStars\" in the arcade).  Fire Pro is all about timing, and that timing needs to be learned and practiced.\n\nFire Pro, in general, goes against the idea that all modern wrestling games need to be using 3D models.  Instead, it focuses on delivering silky smooth animation for moves, and an incredibly deep creation mode.  The results are often a mix of \"eh\" to \"wow, that's amazing!\"  If your idea of a good game rests solely on 3D graphics models, you'll probably want to skip this one.  If you can get past that idea however, you'll find a deep, rich, and rewarding experieince.\n\nThere are inherit limitations to this style of creation mode.  The game limits you to as many heads as it has, and you're tasked with finding a head to match up best with who (or what) you want to create.  Almost everything else can be created or worked around, and the creativity and imaginations of the Editors (guys who create Fire Pro Wrestler \"Edits\") can be mindblowing.  Of course, you will find Edits (community created wrestlers), both fantastic and fantastically bad, for sorts of \"Real\" wrestlers.  Want Stone Cold Steve Austin?  You'll find several.  Sting?  Yep.  AJ Styles?  He's in the workshop.  And while I'm a wrestling fan, particularly of the mid-late 80's through around june of 2000, the fantasy aspect is really where it's at for me.  \n\nI'm a big fan of the Fighting Game Simulator \"MUGEN\", so much so that I work on a port for the original Xbox, \"NXMUGEN\".  MUGEN allows you to import assets from various 2D fighting games and simulate different systems, rules and environments.  You can literally cross old school Mortal Kombat with Street Fighter III characters and fight against Tom Hanks.  Fire Pro has been the closest the wrestling video game world has to MUGEN.  To me, one of Fire Pro's best features is the ability to create just about anyone For FPW alone, I've seen:\n\nSamas Aran (of \"Metroid\")\nRyu, Ken, Blanka, Sagat, Akuma/Gouki, Dan, and others (of \"Street Fighter\")\nOptimus Prime\nLink (of Zelda)\nMario as a Ref (from Punch Out)\nLittle Mac, King Hippo, Piston Honda, and others (from \"Punch Out\")\nMaui (as envisioned by Disney in \"Moana\")\nStarman (from the Nintendo game \"Pro Wrestling\")\nCharacters from Rick and Morty, the Simpsons, Family Guy\nJim Sterling (the guy who does the YouTube channel \"The Jimquisition\")\n\n\nLast night, I showed this game to a friend by having a 3 on 3 match.  Street Fighter characters Ryu, Dan, and Zangief vs \"Sega Saturn Champion\" Segata Sanshiro, Maui \"The Demigod of the Wind and Sea\", and \"The Prolific Painter\" Bob Ross.  Satan was the ref.\n\nLet that sink in for a moment.  \n\nWe didn't even control the wrestlers ourselves for that match....we just watched what the CPU logic for each wrestler did, and even had a hand at commentating the match.  Once the match was over, the system rates the match on various (and currently somewhat unknown) criteria.\n\nAnd really, I think that is where Fire Pro shines as a series, and where FPW already shows its brightness:  You can utilize this game in a multitude of ways and still have fun.  \n\n\n\nSo, I'm gushing positivity on the game.  Now for some negatives.  Keep in mind, this is still early access, so things may change.  I expect many of these issues will be fixed as the community reports issues back to the developers, and there are a lot of items in this list that i'd say are more feature requests than anything else:\n\n1. The UI still needs a little improvement.  Some UI controls are just not very intuitive, and there is an overwhelming amount of Red in the menu systems.\n\n2. While your wrestler can have dozens of moves, the amount of front facing grapples a wrestler can have feels limited/dated.  With complex button schemes on modern controllers, i feel like it wouldn't take much more than a single button, used as a modifier, to at least double the amount of front grapples a wrestler could have.  THis doesn't take away from the fun of the game, but it would be nice to see.\n\n3. There are certain types of matches that probably can't happen in this game, such as Ladder or table matches.\n\n4. Marial Arts style characters still seem like more of an afterthought.  Movelists for strikers do not vary much, and it seems imposible to get a more \"pure\" martial artist build.  It is a wrestling game after all, but one of the first Edits i try to get is Bruce Lee, and I've always wanted to put him up against a Donnie Yen character.\n\n5. Despite being incredibly deep, the create-a-wrestler mode still suffers from limitations with regards to the amount of heads in the game.  It would be awesome if we could create our own heads, or even import heads into the game by means of a jpg.\n\n6. Imported wrestler lists have no means of filtering or organization.\n\n7. No \"create-a-move\" mode yet.  Hoping this happens eventually, but would settle for downloadable moves.\n\nAlmost all my \"negative\" points are really more of a feature request, so you should see that this game is quite awesome.\n\nOverall, this is a great start to what has to be one of the most anticipated and celebrated wrestling game series ever put out, and i'm happy with what i've got so far.", "timestamp_created": 1500226681, "timestamp_updated": 1500226681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533022", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33589247": {"recommendationid": "33589247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006255628", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500223809}, "language": "english", "review": "Really wanted this game to be something awesome, I am big fan of wrestling games.

Tutorial covers like 1/6 of what you can do in the game. Not even a striking intro. I totally get its Early Access and I hope the developers address these issues, but for now I cant reccomend paying the $ for this. Fun, but just clumsy currently sharpen up the gameplay a bit.

After spending hours with this game and dedicated time to learning the game's \"complex simplicities\", I can say that this is probably one of the best purchases I've made this year. I have fallen in love with this game and I now understand why this series gets the praise that it does. Even in its current early access state, this game delivers a pretty solid experience. The thing that stands out most is the in-depth \"creative tools\", which allow for some pretty true to life counterparts of your favorite wrestlers. You can even fine tune a wrestlers logic to dictate how he or she performs when controlled by the CPU which is amazing. If creation is not your thing but you want to play with some of your favorite grapplers then you can hit up the Workshop, which is filled with beautiful creations from the Steam community. There are very talented CAW makers that do all the heavy lifting for you, all you have to do is skim through and pick your favorite wrestlers (complete with movesets, attires, and logic already configured) and download them into your game. \n\n\nThe in-ring gameplay does have a moderate learning curve, as grappling is timing based and takes a bit of practice to get use to. But when I finally got the timing and flow of things I've never felt more in \"control\" of a match since the days of WWF No Mercy. I really like how your entire arsenal of moves are available to you from the start of the match. No building momentum or wearing opponents down first. If you want you can attempt to hit your finisher from the second the bell sounds, although it wouldn't be a good idea as there is an extremely high chance that you'll be countered if you do. The game \"encourages\" you (but not forces) you to start with light grapples and work your way up to the big moves as the match progresses. But as I said you can attempt to hit bigger moves early on, especially against another human controlled player. It makes things fun and unpredictable which is a breath of fresh air.

This game is missing many essential features/options such as but not limited to an HUD.  Also the menus for creating a character are messy and not intuitive.  Hit detection and connecting with certain moves in matches is an absolute Nitemare.  Bare bones atm. I personally do not care for the current state of Online play with this game either. Will update and flesh my review out a bit more as I play more, but as of right now I am a bit underwhelmed and let down by this game.\n\nA few positives- Works well with a controller.  I have used My P$4 controller thus far, plan to use an XB controller, but we all know XB controllers will always do well so shouldn't be an issue there.  A lot of customization!  16 bit graphics!  Despite it's many flaws and missing essentials, you can tell this game is being built as a labor of love, but it still has a very long way to go.  Sound is also done well. Runs well on my PC, no issues thus far. \n\nI don't hate it, I do like it, but it has a long way to go before I could ever love it.  If you can have some patience and you want a wrestling game that could offer years of replayability, an extensive player creation community,  a fun 16bit style arcade gameplay/simulator-like creation tools, and hopefully a strong and solid multiplayer game then this is worth 20.00.

As someone who has been playing video games for a LONG time, this is one of the very few games where I would argue that the tutorial mode is CRITICAL to your enjoyment of the game. Don't skip it. This is NOT in the vein of any of the AKI games (e.g. walk up, hit A + plus direction then another direction, move). This is a timing based grapple system. I have not figured out everything yet, but it does lower the barrier for new people to enjoy the game. Even then.... be patient with it. Your patience will be rewarded. And I cannot wait to get my hands dirty with the Edit mode. Considering that I have put 20+ hours into customizing the WWE 2k16 games, I suspect I will need to do similar things here. Though thankfully, this is integrated into workshop. This means that much like the current gen WWE 2k games, you will be able to download characters. And there are some folks who put a tremendous amount of time and effort into getting the CPU logic (which as I understand it, can imitate a wrestler's logic very well.) I cannot wait to explore more of this!

From booting the game, I noticed a few things that stood out to me. When I dove into a few matches, I started to see what this is: Fire Pro Wrestling Returns: The PC Port.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I love Fire Pro Wrestling Returns and that is by no means an insult to this game. After downloading a few CAWs and installing them from the clunky promotion/stable system, I was having a blast. I think the appeal in Fire Pro is that you can play anyone from any time. In no other game can you play Sting vs. Grado or Kota Ibushi vs. Triple H. I like playing matches with characters from the same era but from different companies, a sort of \"dream match from the time period\".\n\nMy first gripe: The editing system is less versatile than Fire Pro Wrestling Returns. Diving into ring edit, I was immediately disappointed. There is no more logo maker or colour grid. Instead, you pick the different parts of the ring and choose from a row of preset colours. That's it. I don't know if the developers are planning on expanding the different systems but as this product is now for sale to consumers, I feel it's fair to review it as is. And as is, the ring edit feature is completely lacking compared to previous iterations of the game.\n\nMy second gripe: The way CAWs are imported from the workshop. I love the idea of just installing a character but the current way of doing it is a contrived mess. You have to make a company, make a stable in that company (for example, Heels and Faces) and then place a wrestler in that stable. Bearing in mind, it takes about 5 button presses to add a wrestler and there is currently NO WAY to bulk edit them. That means if I download a companies roster, for example, I would have to press 5 buttons for each wrestler. With an average roster of about 50 people, that's about 250 button presses. Bearing in mind that any wrestlers downloaded will automatically populate a list that doesn't automatically move them up in the list. Which means you have to scroll A LOT if you bulk download wrestlers. This is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nMy third gripe: It's 2017. Where's the options menu?\n\nMy fourth gripe:  From gameplay of about 20-30 minutes it became immediately apparent that this is almost the exact same game as Fire Pro Wrestling Returns but with a very slight graphics bump. Now I don't mind this as much as some more casual gamers might as I actually quite like the Fire Pro gameplay, it's annoying that a game I bought in 2017 has the same animations as a game I purchased in 2007. It would have been nice if they had included new animations and maybe made striking a bit more useful. If I am incorrect on this then let me know, but it appears that the gameplay and the animations for the most part are exactly the same.\n\nNow, all of the above aside, this is still a game that you should pick up if you are a wrestling fan that is looking for a game that is harder than the WWE 2k series that emulates Puro Resu style. The game has a practically infinite amount of customisation despite it being slimmed down from previous iterations. You can play anyone from any period and even though the Steam Workshop intergration needs some work, it's the best way to get characters that a Fire Pro game has ever done. Just bear in mind that this is a Japanese game at it's core, and some gameplay features might seem strange to someone who has never played this style of wrestling game before.\n\nIf you have played or still own a Fire Pro game, I recommend you hold off for now.

Also thanks to the graphic style you have a lot of creative possibilities. There are nearly a thousand different heads and faces in here, plus the same amount of masks and facepaint. You could create a thousand edits and none would look alike.\nThe biggest pro of the whole series is the cpu logic and the gameplay.

There are a variety of match types from normal, cage matches to gruesome fighting, land mine death matches etc.\n\nEven though this game is in early access it still had the fundamental mechanics there and the wrestler edit seems to be the most robust and indepth I've ever seen, where you can even program the cpu logic for it where it will act how the wrestler would in real life.\n\nPeople might be turned off because theres a lack of licenced wrestlers to start off with... by having the stock wrestlers being inspired by real life counterparts. Or no major promotion being slapped on the title of the game or it isnt in 3d.\n\nBut the edit mode and workshop is where the game comes to life where you can create, upload and download custom wrestlers with the limit being your imagination.\n\n(Well there has been several thousand custom wrestlers already uploaded to the workshop since the game hit early access!)\n\nI would very recommend it as the developers have been listing to ideas how to improve the game and the final product will be better for it come its actual release.\n\nBut detractors will be missing out if they dont want to give it a try.\n\nI tried more of the Tutorial Missions, some of them seemed to be tricky... Where I'm sure they could have programmed a demonstration to show newer players about the timing, because I know some of them could end up being fustrating if you havent got the timing just right or if you managed to get it and you suddenly lose it.\n\nBut the developers have been keen to listen to suggestions and rolled out a couple of updates to try and fix issues and already started adding some features in.\n\nSome features I wouldn't mind seeing in the future maybe a kings road mode or some sort of story driven mode where your a wrestler or a booker/promotion etc.\n\nI'm guessing make strikes a bit easier to land on opponents, and  an easier way to import collections of wrestlers etc from the workshop into a promotion/stable and maybe online leagues etc....\n\nBut I'm guessing this point is for the community can we get more promotions that arent all americentric?\n\nLong Live Fire Pro Wrestling! - TigerMacZ", "timestamp_created": 1500033468, "timestamp_updated": 1500909826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33533944": {"recommendationid": "33533944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003338439", "num_games_owned": 907, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1515281060}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Why invest money anually with WWE 2K games?\n\nGet this, check the community creations and play forever.", "timestamp_created": 1500031738, "timestamp_updated": 1500031738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33532422": {"recommendationid": "33532422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128828263", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500294235}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, I can't wait to see what other features and match types you will add to the full game.\nbut here is my request: please add an option where you can quit a match during it, offline and online.\nthanks in advance. :)", "timestamp_created": 1500025592, "timestamp_updated": 1500025592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33531192": {"recommendationid": "33531192", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964057543", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514374067}, "language": "german", "review": "Finally it is back and in english.

When playing as the same character for an extended amount of time, boredom takes a lot longer to set in compared to the 2k games.\n\nThe depth of wrester customization is really great. The move setups are simple enough to not have to make 1000 different combos but also more complex than just a couple of moves. There will be a day when I run out of character appearance combinations, but it's a long ways off.\n\nThe ladies are finally not too weak to compete with the men, praise the lord.\n\nMulti-men matches are fun again, with fully interchangable sides up to 4v4, and with managers/seconds easily added to either side. Have ridiculous handicap matches or just make tag-team encounters from the same menu as singles matches.\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\nOnce you have the grapple timing down, your opponents don't really stand a chance, because you win every main chance they have to get their moves in.\n\nThe gimmick matches are, in my eyes, honestly kinda atrocious. There's no opportunity to take cool moments into your own hands and set up a table or ladder spot or anything. The gimmicks usually end up getting in the way, like barbed-wire/light-tube tables blocking all corner and diving moves or barbed wire ropes stopping you getting in your rebound moves and limiting your run-up space. Stick to normal matches for fun.\n\nSome moves have split-second hit windows that are hard to get down. The superman punch is kinda lousy for this especially since the window looks longer than it is, but it's mostly a nitpick as most other moves have slightly longer windows that you can get down after a couple of tries. But good luck hitting some moves first try, and others good luck hitting them at all.\n\n\n[h1]Recommendations (aka Cons if they never get addressed):[/h1]\n\nI know that the wrestler visual customization depth is amazing, but a few more unique options for decals and such would make them stand out even more. I'm not asking for a lot more, but right now we have a couple of dots.\n\nI don't need in-depth entrance customization, but I'd like enough to give me a reason to watch the entrances. They're short enough that I don't need a bathrooom break mid-entrance (cough cough WWE 2k) and with just a couple more options I think they could be great little additions to character depth.\n\nTitles are currently 6 options for strap, 6 options for plates. Like the entrances, I'm not asking for a lot, just enough to make them worth investing interest in.\n\nSome things have color options and some have a full-fledged color picker. If there's a reason you can't pick colors for everything, I understand, but free choice of color is a little addition that goes a long way to removing the feeling of restriction.\n\n\n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\nFPWW is a wrestling game, not a sports entertainment game. And that's great, I honestly like it and will keep coming back with new ideas for wrestlers or to play online. But as it stands when I want to inject at least a little bit of sports entertainment to give context to the wrestling, it isn't available. I hope that since the game is early access that they are planning or open to considering opening up some of those kinds of customization. A full-on management mode a la Universe Mode isn't needed, but for the people who would be hoping to run one themselves with the available settings, as it stands it gets hard to even make your own cohesive brand before you can even consider setting up a card.\n\nI'd definitely recommend the game to fans of wrestling. It's a third the cost of new WWE 2k games and gives generally as much catharsis; if I ever get the craving for an actual gimmick match I can just boot up an older 2k game so it's freed me from the new ones. The wrestling is very fun and even the repetitiveness you have to really think about before you notice it.\n\nMy problems with the game can be summed up with this:\nI can customize the ref all the way down to the speed of their counting, but I can't change the color of the lights (read screen filter) during an entrance.\n\n8.5/10, could easily be a 9/10 or 9.5/10 in the future depending on if these problems are addressed.", "timestamp_created": 1500016990, "timestamp_updated": 1500563588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33528699": {"recommendationid": "33528699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003961978", "num_games_owned": 1314, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 3493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513700335}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is easily the most fun I've ever had with a character creation system.

(MST3Claye where are you now?)\n\nBeing in North America, and not well-off, it was difficult to get Fire Pro Wrestling G when it was released for Playstation (PSX) in Japan in 1999.  I had a friend on IRC send me a burnt copy through the mail, and I tried to use (the wrong version of) Pro Action Replay but only got it to work once for a few minutes before it only decided to freeze my console any other time I would attempt to boot it.\n\nMy affinity for wrestling and associated video games dwindled as i grew into adulthood, but one day in 2010, I randomly visited a Pawn Shop in Montreal, QC and happened to find a copy of Fire Pro Wrestling Returns for Ps2, which I didn't even know existed at this point.  So I picked it up for $9.99 and fell back in love with Fire Pro.  Even until I heard the announcement about Fire Pro Wrestling World, I would still sometimes boot up the old ps2 and play FPR for a bit.  Only recently did I decide to emulate it on my PC and use the mass amounts of perfect CAWs out there.\n\nAnd now here we are.  Alas, the everlasting dream has come to pass.  There exists, a proper PC version of a Fire Pro Wrestling game.  And it really is a Fire Pro game, to the core.  The look, the feel, the music, menus, customization options, etc.  It's actually here!!!\n\nObviously, the game will be tough to digest for newer/younger gamers out there who have never heard of Fire Pro games, but hopefully this game is good enough to spark a new movement (because we desparately need some good CAW makers).\n\nCongratulations to the Spike Chunsoft.

In my opinion, that's fair, because the 2K series does a lot of things right for a wrestling game.

I'd like to download more than just wrestlers.\n- Resolution options. I prefer having my games in windowed mode, but as far as I could tell, there was no way to increase the window size in-game.\n\nThings to work on:\n- More music variety (if we can add our own music, that'd be great for entrances.)\n- Hack and slash to connect more often. Punches are difficult to land.\n- More championship customization variety. RGB colors, more designs.

I had never played a Fire Pro game before and after being pressured into it by my friends, I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I have annoying friends.\n\nFirst off, I want to mention that this game should work on any lower-end PC made within the last 5 years. I have Intel HD graphics and Intel Pentium G630 (super low-end stuff). [I also have 8GB of RAM] and I can play 8 Man matches with no issues.\n\nAnyway, the actual gameplay is addictive. If you've played a Fire Pro game before, then you know generally what to expect in gameplay. Little things like the strike exchange function, performing combinations, and having LANDMINE DEATHMATCHES really make for a fun experience that I don't want to put down.\n\nLast but not least, the customization options are crazy and are sure to only expand as the final game is released. There are premade options for hundreds of real-life wrestlers (WWE, TNA, NJPW, etc.) from different time periods. You can make basically whoever you want. You can even play as a bear. Customizable options for rosters, ringside areas, and title belts that will only get better with further Steam Workshop contributions and game updates leave there to be amazing replay value in the future.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1499981546, "timestamp_updated": 1499981546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33512487": {"recommendationid": "33512487", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970409841", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504196923}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play the hell out of these kind of games on the NES and SNES back in the day.

I stuck with it through the Dreamcast, PSX, and PS2 incarnations, including the English and Japanese versions of the Gameboy Advance games.  \n\nI even bought the horrible XBOX 360 one - don't worry, these guys had nothing to do with that one.  It doesn't count.  Forget it existed.\n\nI've been playing this series for almost 20 years, and am a loyal customer that buys everything as soon as it comes out - I had to get my hands on a new Firepro every time it dropped.\n\nWhat sucks is, it's been 12 years since the last one came out (I'm going by the Japanese release date, because I imported that one too).  So I've been playing that one for 12 years, thinking we're never getting a new Firepro again.\n\nNOW WE HAVE ONE.  Yeah, it's an early access title and there's still a little work to be done here or there, but this is everything I wanted from a new Firepro game, and more.  The overhaul of Wrestler Edit and the addition of layers has really let you make some revolutionary stuff.\n\nMission mode is pretty fun.  I'm at around mission 25 or so, and completing it unlocks moves and edit points.  These are useful moves you're going to want in your game, too.\n\nYeah, there's a learning curve for new people.  There was for me 20 years ago, but I was able to pick this up right away and start dropping mofos on their heads.  Once you learn to play, you're gonna have a great time.  Patience is key.  You'll get it, don't worry.\n\nIf you're new to the series, your biggest obstacle to enjoyment is learning to play the game.  Mine was figuring out how to get it from Japan, getting it to run on my US console, and navigating a game completely in Japanese.  You're being handed everything!

The greatest wrestling series of all time, has come to Steam!\n\nFire Pro Wrestling World is a dream come true. I've been a fan of the series ever since I found out I could play SNES roms on my computer way back in the day... I accidentally discovered Fire Pro and I've been hooked ever since. I don't know if it was the charm of the old school 2d sprites, or the fact that the wrestling was pretty deep. Tons of moves, and the possibilities of creating tons of my favorite wrestlers. It was just addicting.\n\nWith Fire Pro World, all the features we've come to love have returned, and more. Currently the game is still in early access, but it's very playable in it's current stage, and the community is posting thousands of workshop creations making this one of the greatest Fire Pro games ever released... And the full version isn't even out yet!\n\nSo what are we working with in early access. We have standard offline modes with all the match modes from Fire Pro history minus one. So that means, normal matches, tag matches, cage matches, barbed-wire exploding death matches, landmine matches, an MMA style cage... It's pretty nuts. There is a mission mode that serves as an in game tutorial. Honestly my only complaint comes from the mission mode. I find the tutorials helpful, but they've locked away attribute points and some moves for your created wrestlers... I think this is a dumb move since the last game pretty much came with everything unlocked. I guess the devs want to try to encourage people to play the game instead of just simming matches. Yes, one thing that is very big in the Fire Pro community is just sitting back and watching the action. Part of process for creating a wrestler is that you can actually design the wrestler's AI behavior, or as it's refereed to in the game, \"Logic\". This makes the game even more deep, as you can create wrestlers and have them perform matches anyway you like. You can make MMA style fighters, crusierwieght / luchadore styles, heavyweight hitters, hardcore icons, and mat submission specialist. The list goes on.\n\nI haven't spent anytime online as of yet. I've read the online experience isn't the best at the moment, but remember... Still in early access, these things will be improved upon in the future.\n\nThe Steam Workshop support is live and works like a charm. I've downloaded over 60 wrestlers from real life, but I've also seen some wild fantasy / video game characters. Fire Pro has one of the best communities for custom content. I can't wait to see more. The game has only been out for two days yet their are thousands of things ready to be downloaded.\n\nGoing back to the customization, you can create more than just wrestlers. You can edit promotions, edit rings, edit title belts. The sky is the limit here. If you are big into E-feds, this is a perfect game to sim matches in. Create your custom wrestlers and promotions and start throwing ppvs onto youtube. Dream big, because with Fire Pro you aren't going to find many limits.\n\nSo overall if I had to attach a rating to this review, it would be a 7/10. Mostly giving it 7 because it's still in early access, and there are a few bugs here or there that will need to be fixed before I can rate higher. Still, I'm confident that the game will only get better with time. I will update this when the full release comes out. Thanks for reading, and please...

This is as much a simulation game as it is a multiplayer fighting type game. You can create your own wrestling promotion with custom belts, wrestlers, etc. and the Workshop is full of faithful recreation of wrestlers past and present, plus tons of fantast creations, and it will only get bigger. Just about any match type or ruleset is represented, and The graphics aren't the most cutting edge, but even without hyper realistic 3D graphics the game is pretty, smooth, and you can make very strong likenesses of modern wrestlers. This is the kind of game where even if you don't play it, you can easily enjoy making dream matches of various wrestlers and other characters and seeing how they fare in various match types. \n\nSome shortcomings personally are that while the controls are great and smooth once you get used to them, certain things aren't really intuitive or explained in any way, even with the tutorial. For instance, nowhere does the game tell you how to pick up weapons when inside the ring, or how to properly throw your opponent over the top rope in a Battle Royale. Once you learn these minor intricacies everything feels very smooth, but I wish they were more adequately explained. Another issue I've personally experienced is that weapons such as chairs, bats, and kendo sticks feel like they have very spotty hit detection. Swings that look like they would hit aren't hitting, which can be irritating when you just want to smack someone with a steel chair. \n\nThe game is in early access, but doesn't feel particularly unfinished. Though I hope there is a very long support cycle, the game as it is doesn't feel particularly barebones or overly buggy to the point of unplayability.

It also makes me glad that I never played this game growing up, because it's all new to me. There is a slight learning curve, but it basically boils down to \"Timing is 50% of the game\". It's a Japanese game, and a lot of Japanese games kind of force you to play a game calmly, be Zen when  you play. \n\nFire Pro isn't WWE 2k, and it's not even necessarily for every wrestling fan. The appeal of this game comes a lot in part because of the customization, and the fact that the community workshop means you will have every wrestler you've ever wanted in your life, even those guys from the 70's that I've never heard of. I'm not a wrestling fan now, but I admit I have kept up with it for the most part (Mostly from sites like reddit) with what's been going on. So I am excited to download all the classic and modern wrestlers that I like. \n\nThe game itself has graphics out of the PS2 early PS3 era, however it is like playing one of those games remastered. I personally like the graphics, but a lot of that is probably because of my age. They may certainly not be for everyone. I imagine only the most hardcore tweens and teens are going to enjoy this kind of game. \n\nThe actual matches are fluid, and you can't help but smile when you first start doing moves to people. Everything connects nicely and almost has a mini cinematic feel to the moves. I still haven't even got as far as signature moves, because in my Mission (the tutorial) I assume I'm having an early access issue, because I am doing exactly what I am told but it is not registering it. That's not a big deal. This is early access. If you can't deal with stuff like that, add this to your wishlist and pay more money when it comes out later.. for some reason. \n\nThis game is certainly not for everyone, that's for sure, but what game is? Any of the hate that will come to this game will only come from people who have at least a small interest in wrestling, because waht person who's never seen wrestling is going to buy this game?

I feel like I can get a fair challenge and if I lose its because I'm not focused not because the games buggy. So as far as the in ring mechanics are concerned A+. The editing which I understand is the catalyst of the fire pro series. This being my first time playing I'm a little in awe of how much editing you can actually do. For sure have the indepth stuff for the community who can take advantage of that and make amazing wrestlers for me to use, they are all wonderful. That being said it would be nice if there was another option to make it somewhat easier to edit things. Not a big deal just a nice sorta welcome for newcomers. Love that you can change your match types and have 8 men in the ring at once! would it be possible for another match to be included. I know the Royal Rumble is a WWE type of deal but could  there be HUGE battle royals with new intervals once an elimination happens sort of like an endurance deal. One thing I would really like is when you create your own title, you're only able to have I think 10 letters and then you cant create anymore. I wanted it to say SWA Canadian but it got cut off around SWA Canad... and please please allow the champions to come down to the ring with their titles (maybe i just haven't found out how to do it yet) ability to put in custom music would be appriciated. oh and when you create a title it says \"normal\" well i would like to defend my title in a cage match and it wont show up. Hopefully there can be an option to make a title open to all match types etc ? as far as the wrestling is concerned again, dont change a thing its perfect and fluent. it would be awesome if there was some kinda way we could create an actual show and maybe have some kind of story lines we could use or something to that nature ie if you create a wrestler he could be approached by another wrestler to form a tag team. or someone comes to the ring before the match and trash talks you. sort of like a choose your own adventure. Again loving the game, having a wonderful time trying to invent new ways to just hammer people.

No more following those old GameFAQs-styled guides; getting a solid AJ Styles, Kurt Angle, Andre the Giant, WHOEVER you want is as simple as clicking that little plus button on the Steam workshop! For curious new players - if you're a wrestling fan and you want a wholesome, realistic experience in the squared circle, then look no further. Nobody will deny that Fire Pro has a slight learning curve once you first get into your first couple matches, but the key factor is learning the timing and not mashing all the buttons. Once you get the hang of that, you'll be addicted. And if you're a superfan of the sport, you're going to find yourself going through your own simulations of shows and creating your own worlds. The animations are all spot on. The graphics are retro, but awesome in their own way. The movesets and CPU logic systems are some of the most detailed I've seen in any game. Of course this gets my recommendation!\n\nUs veterans have seen previous FPW games and how they work, and not much has changed in regards to the gameplay other than the back and forth striking mechanic. Here are things I hope that they improve coming out of the Early Access:\n- More default wrestlers and organizations like in the older games\n- Custom music files for entrances, match background, menus, etc.\n- Attire system fixed\n- Online play fixed\n- Logo maker\n- More arenas\n- More modes\n\nI know some of these things have been addressed and are going to be done before the game has its full final release.

This isn't just a pro wrestling game. This game is also a MMA game as well that even comes with an octogon ring along with MMA type damages and moves.

Go check out the latest FPS or something, you'll be much happier.\n\n2: If you do like pro wrestling but playing games like WWE 2Kxx leave you with a warm feeling of satisfaction, then go play that, FPWW is not for you.\n\n3: If you've ever purchased a modern day 16-bit Retro sprite based game (Steam is boiling over with them, so I know you have) and yet it doesn't make sense to you that a developer could market a game with \"dated\" graphics to wrestling fans, FPWW is not for you.\n\n4: If however, you fell in love with professional wrestling anywhere between the years 1909 and 2017, and wish you had a way to wittness impossible dream matches, relive the territories in their prime, See all the matches WCW failed to give us when the NWO was comprised of the entire roster, experience the history of the WWE from Samartino to Hulkamania to Attitude to (God forbid) the looming Roman Empire, well pick your Era. Fire Pro is a wrestling Delorean fitted with a flux capacitor and the plutonium tank is topped off, ready to take you anywhere in wrestling history you want to go. FPWW is as good as the hype, but you must fall into this category if you are going to appreciate it.\n\nNote: $19.99 is a steal, all you have to do is hit the download button and click play. If you're new to FPW you'll never know how good you have it right now. Many people (including myself) expressing excitement about this game paid top dollar to purchase previous installments as imports not to mention having to monkey with their consoles to make them able to play the imported game, and then once they finally got it working...all the menus were in Japanese. I have several hundred dollars tied up in FPWD and FPWR alone, not to mention time and effort importing the many excellent Edits the community has created over the years. Now  instead of juggling memory cards and usb drives with Edit (CAW) limits, we have steam workshop and the entire free space on the HDD for storage.

But was it worth the wait?\n\n\nBackground:\n\nThis iconic series got it's start in 1989 and was a huge hit in japan, finding a home on the super famicom, ps2, gameboy advance, and other popular consoles.  While most wrestling games were heading in the direction of 3d gameplay with licensed characters, career modes, and true to life entrances, Fire Pro was something different.  Using 2d sprites and a robust character editor, Fire Pro was often thought of as more Simulator than game, with people often running entire EFEDS off the software.  The easy to use customizing features allowed virtually any wrestling superstar or character to be added to the games.  This was important, as the developer (HUMAN early on, then SPIKE) did not have the rights to use actual wrestlers.  Instead they put characters with similar looks and movesets in and let the fans do the rest.  Another popular customizable feature was the AI behavioral logic, which allowed you to make an ai controlled character behave the way their real life counterpart would.   The games gained cult status over the years in america by fans wanting something a bit different than the usual yukes/jakks wrestling games that would appear every couple of years.  On July 10th, 2017, Fire Pro wrestling world became the first release in the series released exclusively for pc, with a ps4 version planned for the near future.\n\n\n\nGraphics:  \n\nNobody has ever purchased a fire pro game because of the modern graphics and stunning visual effects, but the 2d sprites are well done with smooth animation.  Explosions and blood effects look better on the new version but very little has actually changed from the original style, they just look bigger and a bit more detailed.  Best looking fire pro game to date, which shouldn't surprise anyone, given the hardware it's running on.  That said, if you are primarily interested in graphics, wwe 2k17 is available for purchase fairly cheaply due to 2k18 being announced for release soon.  \n\n\n\nSound:  \n\nThis is fire pro's weak spot throughout the series and FPWW is no different. The japanese rock themes are well done and fit well, but the character vocalizations are just unpleasant at times.  When performing certain moves, the characters grunt in a very artificial way repeatedly, the referee will also repeatedly ask give up? give up? give up?  give up?  during submission matches.  I get it's audio on the same tech level of the video, but while they used the limited visual capabilities to fullest extent, you feel like very little effort was put in to improve the audio experience.  The 3 counts sound good if that helps lol.  No custom music or themes for characters yet, but there's always hope for that to be added in later.  Including a sound editor using wav or mp3 for the sound events in-game would have been an amazing add here.\n\nGameplay:  \n\nThe gameplay is timing based with some button mashing thrown in.  The grapple moves involve waiting for the wrestlers to lock up and pressing a button/direction at the instant they make contact.  This doesn't appeal to some but it really does work well, providing a fair and equal way of battling.  The button mashing comes into play during kickouts and submission escapes, and isn't overdone.  Tests of strength are resolved by repeatedly pressing back and forth on your directional controls.  If I had a complaint here, it is that some striking moves require a very specific angle and distance to connect.  You will miss many dropkicks that you feel made perfect contact.  Sometimes moves delivered from the top rope connect right on the guy yet it registers a miss.  These occurances happen often enough to be irritating, but not so often as to ruin the experience.  Hitting those moves becomes much more satisfying when done perfectly.  \n\n\n\nPlay options:\n\nMore coming after the early access period.  For now, standard match types for fire pro, including 8 man battle royals, 8 man tags, MMA type matches, cages, barbed wire with c4 explosives, exploding ring deathmatchs, there's some good stuff here.  Run leagues, run tournaments, the level of customization here is really nice and should keep simmers busy for a long time.\n\n\n\nOnline:  \n\nMatches at the moment are hit or miss.  Connecting is a problem, staying connected is a problem, lag is a problem.  This may be a drawback of early access to be improved on later.  This is the first online version of the game so some bugs are to be expected. \n\n \n\nPresentation:  \n\nThis is another thing that might just be a personal nag.  The game was originally japanese.  There's going to be some translation issues.  But It doesn't feel like it would have been very difficult for an english speaking employee to change some of the wording to a more north american friendly version.  Exploding rings are referred to as landmines.  MMA contests are called Gruesome Fighting.  The instructions in mission mode are often misleading because of eliminations in battle royals and such being labelled disqualifications.  And a further note on mission mode, often the controls for what you need to do to perform the required action are left unclear.  There is also no digital manual or instruction to find information on how to tag, perform cage jumps, and other items.  These are things that I'd like to see improved in future versions, but in game changes to the language is unlikely, although a manual will likely be created at some point to assist new players.\n\n\n\nFun Factor:  \n\nThis is such a love it or hate it game.  If you are only playing verses the cpu, you will learn the game quickly and squash everyone you face.  This will get dull.   If online becomes more stable, it may be worth getting for that.  But the sort of people this game will appeal to are the people who will download or make wrestlers from the past, present, or their own imaginations.  Make their behavior as true to life as possible, and put them in cpu controlled matches to see what happens.  If that seems fun to you, there is no greater wrestling sim in the world and you need to drop that 20 bucks right now.  If you just want an arcade wrestling game, go get 2k.  It's much better for what you want.  \n\nI apologize for not giving a very good review on the actual creation suite.  I've never been very good at CAW editing so I tend to grab from other people's uploads.  I have made one guy and the process was very detailed.  I was overwhelmed.  Those who enjoy the stuff will love it. \n\n\n\nMy score 8/10.   It does what it was expected and does it fairly well with a few collision problems.  Online issues and translation stuff are the down side  for me.

How does it fare atm? Let's find out.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* The sounds are a massive improvement over Returns by a country mile, and even without the comparisons, hold their own quite well. (The main menu and match results themes are really catchy, for one, and the critical sound is heart stopping, in a good way)\n\n* Strike exchanges! These really are a great addition to the series, and even I can't help but say, \"Yeah! Ooh!\" during a really epic one.\n\n* Full tutorial mode. This is great for those who could never get into Fire Pro, and also helps to sharpen up many a veteran.\n\n* Blood on the mat. Kinda minor compared to the rest, but a worthwhile addition.\n\n* New moves added, with more to likely come\n\n* UNLIMITED EDIT SLOTS. (well at least as much as your hard drive can hold) Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the first wrestling game to pull off such a feat.\n\n* Match results are back! (Not as deep as the GBA games, but there's room for improvement)\n\n* The new 9 layered system is great, and I think it's heavily slept on.\n\n* The new visuals look great, and strike a balance between modern and retro. Games like these are long successors of the 16 bit era.\n\n* Various issues seem to be fixed, like Returns's RNG bug, the breathing/spirit bug, and superior camera work being added to matches involving seconds to point out a few.\n\nThe Not So Good:\n\n* The game has quite a few bugs, like keyboard users being unable to preview sounds, and extreme menu lag (which is thankfully being addressed by the devs). That being said it is Early Access, so these can be ironed out over time.\n\n* Mission 30 will likely drive you nuts if you're inexperienced to begin with, because the cage match escape AI has not been improved since R, and shaking the cage (unless you're the CPU, bleh) is useless.\n\nThoughts:\n\nDespite a few (admittedly annoying) bugs (remember, Early Access), this game is already looking like an improvement over Returns in almost every area, and can definitely be considered a great successor, as well as a great standalone game on its own two feet.

But it's finally here, for everyone and now with Steam Workshop!\n\nEven in it's early form it's incredibly fun, the character customization is vast and honestly at times overwhelming, but that's a good thing in my mind. The moves feel like they have a weight to them when they hit, and although it took a bit of time getting used to the controls, once you do master them you'll be unstoppable!\n\nIf you'd like to see how it performs graphically, I have recorded a video I think could get the point across to how it plays or looks. Definitely recommend this to wrestling fans, and maybe some non wrestling fans.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2syZ21Cgix8", "timestamp_created": 1499869067, "timestamp_updated": 1499869067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33478761": {"recommendationid": "33478761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062137022", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 67525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6116, "last_played": 1516409326}, "language": "english", "review": "Fire Pro for PC! It's early access, but it's got all the bells and whistles of a full-fledged FP game. There's kinks here and there, as evident in the transparent bug list, but otherwise, it's all gorgeous.  \n\nI'm a Fire Pro enthusiast who only ever ran sim (AI vs AI) matches, and so far this is looking amazing. The QoL improvements in the Edit menus alone are HUGE timesavers. That said, the original, unadressable limitations with the AI still remain (proper use of diving and straight-to-pin moves AWAY from the ropes for example), as they are faithfully recreated in the new engine. Time will tell if we'll see these addressed, but as of now I can still live with it. I mean, I already have all these years prior. \n\nSoon I'll be recreating my original rosters and tweaking their AI's ad nauseum, then pitting then against each other for the sake of my entertainment. \n\nGood times!", "timestamp_created": 1499863813, "timestamp_updated": 1499863813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33478475": {"recommendationid": "33478475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084953203", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 755, "last_played": 1516367115}, "language": "english", "review": "The best way I like to describe Fire Pro and what type of wrestling game it is to people that don't know about it,  is to call it a game where you create wrestling robots from scratch and watch them play or play as them.  As well as editing the enviornment around them (rings, belts, logos,refs,managers) \n\nFire Pro Wrestling is a wrestling Sim that always has a fun wrestler edit, Programmable AI logic that is far beyond and has always been way ahead of any other game in the series. Fire Pro World is a major upgrade to an already great game. \n\nIf you've never played it, it can feel a bit strange since the ring is setup on an angle and throwing people into the ropes is strange at first.  But if you're looking for a wrestling sim, you'll get used to it real quick. You'll begin to understand the appeal once you got into the edit mode, piece together whatever wrestler , real or imagined,  that you want.   When you get your custom wrestling robots in the ring and you're having a great match then all of a sudden a pinfall happens and your opponent kicks out at 2.9, the crowd yells in excitement ,you'll begin to see the drama in the matches that everyone loves. \n\nThere is no limit to how many community made wrestlers you can download, It's based on your harddrive space and the wrestler files sizes are .007 KBs.\n\n There are so many possibilities of wrestlers to design with 1000s of moves and more being made as we speak, 1000s of parts that you piece together like hair, masks,faces,outfits,ect. More parts are being made as well.\n\nThis Early Access version is more then solid as far as completed content.  There's always room to add DLC add-ons but as far as the core of the game goes, this is more then enough to satisfy.  It is early access so some content is very limited, mostly ring creating options/importing logos, importing Mp3s for entrance themes, belt edit is limited.\n\nIn 1 and a half days of the release, the workshop roster of items made by the community has over 900 characters,wrestlers,refs,ect.  You can pretty much find everyone from known superstars to retro wrestlers and indy wrestlers.\n\nThe last Fire Pro wrestling game, Fire Pro Returns on ps2 lasted me over 10 years of playing.  For $19.99 on a PC version that allows updates and instant downloads of custom edits,  you just can't beat that.  If you're not really a wrestling fan and only like the show,the glam and the pretty people in wrestling, then this may not really be for you. If you're into a wrestling sims,if you  like e-feds for wrestling and love creating wrestlers , programming them and either watching them play against another cpu opponent or playing yourself, then this game is worth getting. \n\n\nOne of my favorite features is adding voice grunts and screams to your moves when creating your moveset. You can program your guy to yell out a grunt when he or she lifts their opponent or to yell out something at the crowd by adding a voice to your taunts. \n\n\n\nLittle details like that are what makes fire pro the best kind of game for just diving in and creating whoever you want, or if you look into the workshop, you can just download your favorite wrestlers from  WWE,ROH,CZW,NJPW,AJPW,Dragon Gate,TNA,ECW,WCW ect ect \n\nFighting in an exploding ,electrified barbed wire rope match with Terry Funk vs Cactus Jackvs Sabu Vs Hayabusa is just legendary and insanely bloody. \n\nIf this sounds like something you're into, then you're going to love it.It will last you 100s of hours without fail. So far, it has the best replay value of any game I've played because there are always new moves , items,parts,costumes and wrestlers coming out. \n", "timestamp_created": 1499862872, "timestamp_updated": 1499862872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33478313": {"recommendationid": "33478313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007062502", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515104052}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this game.

A bunch. The mechanics of how to play might take you a little bit to learn, it's timing not button mashing, but be patient.

This is a timing based game, so may be tough for some if they are used to button mashing. Fortunately, there is a tutorial \"Mission Mode\" that helps teach you the timing so you can pull off the moves.\n\nYes, graphics are 2D, and Fire Pro is best that way. The sprites are charming without being overly cartoonish.\n\nThere is once again an extremely robust \"Edit\" mode, which is Fire Pro's version of Create-A-Wrestler. I have not had the chance to play with this mode much yet, but the Edits already available on the Steam Workshop are very varied and impressive. As of this morning, there are already over 1000 Edit Wrestlers submitted. You can make any wrestler who has ever existed with this game.\n\nWith an Early Access price of $20, this game is a steal.

I've played a lot of Fire Pro Wrestling Returns, and some of the older games, including imports. It never seemed like there would be a new game, especially when after Returns, all we heard about was an Xbox Live Arcade game where it's just avatars in an arcade style wrestling game. Also, a few jerks on the internet starting rumors with no proof, giving our hopes up. But this is the real deal. It is early access, but what is out is very polished, like the wrestling and fighting is just as good as Returns. It's just early, so it'll be some time before they get stuff like logo and ring creation, which will be amazing, since Returns on PS2 was so in depth that people made the actual WWE logo and rings, I don't even know how that worked. What we have is great so far, on the first night, there were over 250 workshop creations ranging from legends of Japan, WWE superstars, a few MMA fighters, video game characters, The Simpsons oddly enough, and so much more. So far I have a lot of custom characters downloaded, and a lot are 100%, mostly because fans used AI logic settings and apperances from Returns to re-create them for the new game. There are a lot of work in progress creations on the workshop. It's the workshop that will be the main reason to get this game, the default roster are just generic people, and I haven't seen any based on real people yet. To get the game now, you'll want to check that workshop page and get everyone you're a fan of. I've had a lot of fun so far, like having exploding barbwire death matches and putting wrestlers into MMA rules cage fights. There is a little bit of a learning curve going from playing Returns years ago, similar interface and menus, but I've heard character creation is much more simple and user friendly. The game play, it's classic Fire Pro Wrestling with some new tweaks like a random chance for strikes to have a back and forth sequence. The main thing is that the best features are the same, and it seems like the early access is more about community feedback, things they can tweak, add to the game, see how global online play is through testing, and steadily get more player creation tools in the game. So far, it feels very polished, like it's never froze on me, and the only glitch I can think of was a wrestler got really Jacob's Ladder twitchy for a moment, but nothing that affected the match any.", "timestamp_created": 1499859433, "timestamp_updated": 1499859433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33476545": {"recommendationid": "33476545", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995702208", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500124938}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the Fire Pro games.

Like many others, I never thought our great Fire Pro community would ever see another Fire Pro game. So for a long time we'd keep ourselves occupied with King of Colosseum (also by Spike) and/or Fire Pro Wrestling Returns. I'd follow message boards for the latest and greatest edits and saves for those games. Imagine our delight when World was announced! \n\nWith a short amount of time I've had so far with Fire Pro World, it can easily be said that it's absolutely amazing. It's fantastic and the Fire Pro community is happy. We always talk about the \"good old days\" of importing our favorite Fire Pro or King of Colosseum etc, but now is just as amazing a time as it was then because there's so much more to offer now with Steam Workshop. \n\nAnywho.... When you fire up this game you immediately noticed sharper graphics and vibrant colors, all clear as crystal and it looks wonderful. If you download the game and complain about graphics, you need to step back and reevauate everything. This is the charm os Fire Pro. We don't need fancy, realistic graphics. \n\nGameplay... Again the timing based system is top notch, it may be slightly easier than previous Fire Pro games but it's still amazing. Custimization is once again at the forefront and is everything you'd want from a wrestling game. Because Fire Pro has one of the best communities out there for a video game, Fire Pro World will last a lifetime, just like previous Fire Pro games. The developers love the series and it shows.

Tutorial is forced with bad instructions\n\nThe fact that you cannot choose specific tutorials and instead must complete them in order, is already cringe-worthy. The fact that it does not tell you how many times you must complete an action before it is considered \"successful\" is also cringe-worthy.\n\n2. Core combat is terribly executed\n\nSo when you attack, it attacks in the direction you input the command. When you run, you run parallel to the ring. Very confusing and I'm often running in a completely opposite direction then what I wanted. That's already a game breaker for me. You have to be a specific range to hit medium and heavy punches but light punches seem to have generous range. That's a 2nd game breaker for me. You must line up your angle and lane position pixel perfect in order to land medium, heavy, or running attacks. That's a 3rd game breaker for me. You lose stamina so fast, the deceptively fast clock doesn't help. That's a 4th game breaker.\n\nBasically, this game does everything horrible wrong that a competitor that's releasing soon does right.\n\n3. Some game modes are simulation only\n\nWhen I did exhibition, it was not immediately obvious that I had to manually select 1P.\nWhen I tried tournament mode afterwards, I could not set any contestant to 1P.\n\nThat's a 5th game breaker for me.\n\n4. Game only visually works in windows mode\n\nIt is like the game is programmed to only show a black screen in full screen mode for me. I had to set launch mode to window in game properties That's a 6th game breaker for me.\n\n5. No signatures or finishers\n\nThat I can see at least. Adds a bit of flair in an otherwise average game.\n\nSorry, I don't hate this game. It royally frustrates me with how anti-user it seems to be. I did not enjoy the 1 match I was able to play.

Not as flashy as the 2k games, but the customization coupled with the more skill based timing and exhaution system makes it a more enjoyable exprience.\n\nI haven't cared about wrestling in years, but this game is pretty fantastic so far. I played a couple of the FPW games years ago on the PS2, but I've always wanted a game like it on PC. That day never came...until now.\n\nSeriously, $20 is a steal for how much you can get out of this game. It's somewhat lacking in content atm, but it's Early Access and you can download a potentially unlimited roster of wrestlers from the workshop. The FPW fanbase is pretty dedicated, so expect tons of content.

Right now this game is great, if the devs continue to support and expand it it could be the greatest wrestling game of all time.

Fire Pro Wrestling World follows a wholly separate lineage, and it really works well. The symmetric, timing based grappling is exciting throughout the match, though it does take some getting used to if you are used to any other wrestling games' controls (the AKI games, the 2K games, the Smackdown lines, etc). There is a single player \"Mission Mode\" that serves to introduce you to the basics gradually  and give you time to practice. \n\nThe translation is awkward in places, mostly it is fine but some Mission titles are misleading.

It's incredibly hard, but amazing.\n\nOverall, this is a FIGHTING game, even though it is advertized as a wrestling game.\nThere is boxing, mma, wrestling (match, cage, deathmatch).\n\nThe style is very different than the average wrestling game as well. WWE games consist of spamming buttons to get to a finisher. You don't feel like a badass, but you can win a lot more often. In this game, however, it's a timing based style. It's VERY fun, just that it takes about an hour to get used to. Play the tutorial (the beginning of mission mode), and you'll be set. \n\nCombat is very fluid, going from one move to another without glitches or bugs, as WWE games are known for.\n\nNow to the character creation, oh man. You can create just about ANYONE you want, from WWE to NJWP, to TNA, to UFC, your own ideas. Your creation can be made just about EXACTLY as you want to, and with match settings, and creating belts, characters (with every move customizeable), rings, and even REFFEREES (Red Shoes fans cheer), there's something for everyone. And with Steam Workshop support, it's amazing what you can find.\n\nPros:\n- Fluid Combat\n- More than just wrestling\n- Fun mechanics, 8 player fights\n- Creator\n\nCons:\n-Online mode is currently being fixed, as sometimes it breaks.\n-Repetative music, not really a problem for me.\n-Not many options in the options menu.\n-No real create-an entrance. \n-No downloadable entrance music, just certain songs for entrances. \n\nOverall - Fun game, if you like fighting games of any kind, I'd recomend this one to you. And with early access still in effect, we'll be getting more content soon!\n\nCurrently (As of 7/11/17) - 9.5/10\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499811465, "timestamp_updated": 1499811465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33466635": {"recommendationid": "33466635", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995555473", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1515949737}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Fluid, consise animations and arcade-style gameplay keeps matches exciting.  There's so much to edit and customize that this game would get a recommendation even if all you could do is simulate AI matches.  Luckily that's not an issue, as the game is loads of fun to play.\n\nA few things that warrant fixes as of Early Access Version 0.9001:\n\n-Wrestlers escape the cage too quickly in cage matches.  Computers can and will win in under 2 minutes if you give them 8-10 seconds to escape.  Climbing should be slower, and more importantly, the transition from inside to outside the cage should be considerably slower.  Maybe there should be a transition state where wrestlers sit atop the cage before being able to climb down the other side.  \n\n-Wrestlers should stay down longer after losing via pinfall or submission.  As it stands, wrestlers generally get up right away after losing, which isn't realistic on 10+ minute matches.\n\n-A.I. characters in free-for-all, last man standing style matches will frequently break up pins and submissions on their opponents.  This would make sense in \"first pinfall wins\" matches, but in Royal Rumble-style matches they have no reason not to let their opponents pin each other.  It can make for some goofy matches wherein 2+ wrestlers stop beating the crap out of one another to break up a pin on one of their opponents.\n\n-While standing on the ring apron, it's seemingly impossible to hit or grapple someone who is in the ring.\n\n-While playing as a manager/valet, the camera does not pan out enough to be able to see your player character.", "timestamp_created": 1499808402, "timestamp_updated": 1500071301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502327", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33465631": {"recommendationid": "33465631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034324493", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1516317663}, "language": "english", "review": "You have Rainmaker , Destino and One Winged Angel , what do you want more?

It is a legit effort to make the best Fire Pro Wrestling game since 1989, and it draws on decades of development. The project is being headed by somebody who loves playing this game. That has really shown through during the early access. The team is passionate, and engaged with the community.\n\nThe gameplay is based on timing, and engine is deep. Every match gets a crowd rating, and you have to be entertaining as well as effective to get a 100% rated match. The fundamentals of the game haven't changed since the 90's, and I say that because it's solid like a classic 90s console game. They've just refined and expanded almost everything over the years. As somebody who has been actively playing the game since 2001 my opinion is that the early access has already made this the greatest version of the game I've seen.\n\nIt offers numerous modes, including MMA, pro wrestling, shoot fighting, and boxing. The CAW mode is limitless, with an encyclopedic move set, detailed stats/ai settings, and a really cool cosmetic editor. A community of fans who have been creating wrestlers/fighters for decades have made well over 10,000 workshop submissions.  There aren't many wrestlers, MMA guys, shoot fighters, boxers, kickboxers, cartoon characters, musicians, super heroes, action heroes, celebrities, and historical figures that aren't already made and ready to rumble.  \n\nThis review is pretty enthusiastic, but that's how behind this project I am.

more then so be it) to re-review, but for now it's got a few issues that stop me recommending it (wish Steam would add a middle ground option instead of the Yes/No because I feel the No is too harsh).\n\n[b]Lets start with the good;[/b]\n\n\n* It runs smooth as butter.\n\n* The game itself has excellent 'Pick up and Play' capability.\n\n* The visual style is 'old/classic' but carries a great Arcade Charm.\n\n* Controls seem intuitive on Controller.\n\n* Wrestler Customisation (and Workshop compatibility by proxy) is incredible. The moveset customiser is light years ahead of anything anyone else has made.\n\n* AI vs AI matches are genuinely fun to watch and setup.\n\n* The total number of moves and the style of the wrestlers are outstanding.\n\n\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n\n* Strikes do not connect well. This is partly due to the angle of the camera mixed with the style of the sprites and ring design. Not sure how much this will improve, but even the AI in exhibition matches miss each other all the time.\n\n* The lack of a 'Story Maker' or Feud system means that you're not able to add any meaningful weight to what you want to do. And the lack of a Card Builder for a series of shows that build to a PPV makes it feel a little hollow.\n\n* The Belt Customisation is very lacking. Not sure if they plan to add Workshop support and allow full customisation here, but so far it's quite poor when compared to the ability to add to the belts. A lot of the front plates don't fit any of the straps at all.\n\n* The Menu for adding Stables/Promotions is far too basic, and doesn't offer enough customisation for you to give it your own twist/design style.\n\n* The method for adding Wrestlers to a promotion is a little fiddly/not clear.\n\n* Online only supporting 4 players is a little disappointing. Having more in a lobby would be better so people can build match cards with larger groups and have people in and out.

The multiplayer is fantastic. The CAW is as always, the games core strength. The timing based grapple system which rewards attentive players remains unchanged. The tutorial is good and will give new players some idea. \n\nAll that positive stuff said there is still alot of work to do! Many things that should be in are not in yet, I feel there definitely needs to be a Kings Road style story mode as in older games, and some of the menu systems and even the training mode (which is supposed to help new players) can be very confusing. As long as Spike/Chunsoft sticks to their guns and continue to work on this game until its final release, it will be the wrestling game to end all wrestling games. \n\nFinal word, the community for this game is legendary.

But this is the real deal, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. This series has been around since before dinosaurs walked the Earth and it's still one of the greatest game series ever. You think you've enjoyed creating your own characters? Think again. This game features one of the most in-depth creation features in any game, period. You not only get to create giant turquoise bears with anime girl faces, and make that bear the strongest (or weakest) character in the game, you also get to manipulate that character's CPU logic so that it constantly rubs its butt in its opponent's face.\n\nOne aspect that might turn people off to this game, though, is the fact that it's not necessarily action-oriented. The game has action, but you can't just mash buttons and constantly punch-kick your opponent to a bloody pulp. The game requires more finesse and psychology, much like an actual pro wrestling match, so in that sense it's a simulation. That doesn't mean the action isn't great, however, as the more you dig into each match you are able to pull off more moves, so if you get tired of rubbing your butt in someone's face you can smash them over the head with light tubes and hammers as the ring around you literally explodes from C-4 planted around the ring. Good fun for the whole family. In any case, the game gives these occurrences an extra sense of purpose than they would have had, becoming more than just a silly joke that's fun for about five seconds. It's actually engaging.\n\nEven MMA fans can enjoy this game, actually, considering you can also fight in an octagon with custom MMA rules and even customize MMA fighters with some actually decent accuracy. The whole \"match psychology\" aspect in pro wrestling still applies, but I'll definitely take that over other MMA games I've played where I roundhouse kick my opponent in the head thirty times and they still don't bat an eye. At least it can lead to almost guaranteed excitement in an MMA match. There's a joke there somewhere.\n\nOh, last thing. I should revert back to the creating stuff features because you can create more than wrestlers. You can create virtually everything: stables, the ring, the belts, the refs, entire companies! You can build your own company and even book it. You can finally book everyone's favorite wrestler, Dirt Bike Kid, to be What Culture Pro Wrestling World Champion! \"The boyhood dream has come true!\" Can't create commentators, because there's no commentary, but would you rather have no commentary, or the commentators WWE has today? Hell, that's all I should've said in the first place, now that I think about it. \"There are no WWE commentators, buy this game!\" You also can't emulate backstage politics, so you can't run a Wrestlers' Court and can't make your wrestlers be bullied backstage by JBL. But that means you CAN make Triple H work Tuesdays whether he wants to or not, and he can't back-talk you from jobbing him out constantly.\n\nBut no, seriously, buy this game. It's (currently) twenty bucks. That sounds like a lot, but it's one of the best games on all of Steam and so it's actually a steal, such a steal you'll have to worry about Repo Man repossessing the game from you for ripping the developers off so hard. It's practically extortion. Instead, though, I will thank the developers for their sheer benevolence for keeping in mind that most people are not made of money. If people were made of money they wouldn't be sentient anyway, but whatever, what's important is the difference between, \"Let's see, Fire Pro Wrestling or food?\" and \"Wow, I can afford both now, thanks developers!\" And no, this game won't make you a huge nerd like me, making obscure wrestling references. But you can have a giant turquoise bear with an anime girl face rub its butt in Triple H's face in a barb-wire C-4 exploding death match with Repo Man as the special guest referee in a What Culture Pro Wrestling ring for the TNA Australian Heavyweight Championship without any WWE commentary.

I got my ass kicked in both. I still haven't completely gotten the timings down, and the game is pretty difficult. But that's okay, because the game is so enjoyable it makes you want to learn how to play it. The game makes you want to master it. That being said, however, even if I were to never touch the controls for an actual match again, I'd still get amazing satisfaction out of this game. Since I haven't fully gotten the gameplay mechanics down yet, I won't mention anything for that. What I will talk about is the amazing experience to be had in the other departments.\n\n[h1] Customization: [/h1]\nThis is where Fire-Pro excels in. For Create-A-Wrestlers, you can literally customize everything. Full movesets, accurate attires and faces, even AI logic for the character in simulated matches. There's so many customization options and it's incredible. I can only imagine what the possibilities of a supported mod community could bring to this game as well. The only thing the customizationcould use is custom logos, which I'd imagine mods could bring to the table sometime in the future. Assuming of course, that it isn't an outright Developer supported feature added later.  You can also create your own referee, and change his logic for fast counts or slow counts, or make the most neutral referee ever. Plus, the refs have all the same attire and face options as the created wrestlers do. So, with that many face and customization options, you can make them look as whacky or professional as you want too.  There's also a create-a-ring mode which isn't super in-depth like the others, but it doesn't need to be. They have pretty much every ring style you can hope for in the ring-editor. You can customize the turnbuckle style, the pattern of the mat, and the ring post and ring rope colors. You can create full promotions, with factions for all your charcters. You can even create your own titles, however the options here are very, very limited at the moment.\n\n[h1] Workshop Support: [/h1]\nDoes all that customization sound too hard to you? Well that's perfectly okay too. With the Steam workshop support, you can download all the characters your heart desires. Whether it be famous TV show characters, or the most popular wrestlers of past and present, there are already hundreds and hundreds of options avaiable to download right now. You can also download created referee's from the workshop, and everybody's favorite referee Red Shoes is already made and ready to be downloaded. Fire Pro is a game series known for it's amazing creators. Fire Pro Wrestling Returns (A 10 year old game) STILL has community support to this day. I don't see that being different here with Fire Pro Wrestling World either. This is a game that will have plenty of longevity, and the workshop will only help with that.\n\n[h1] Simulation: [/h1]\nThis is the area most of my early play-time has been spent in. I was able to do a full 16-Man Tournament to determine my IWGP Heavyweight Champion on my New Japan promotion in-game. I didn't even play a single match in it. I simulated the entire thing. I have never had as enjoyable of an experience just watching something as I have here. The sim aspect of Fire-Pro is truly something special, especially with the creators getting the logic down so well so far. I watched Shibata deliver nine headbutts in a row to Marty Scurll to win the match, which left both of them bleeding. I watched Kenny Omega deliver a One-Winged Angel to Hiromu, which Hiromu kicked out of at 2.9 and set-up a Time Bomb for the win. The simulations the game can deliver are a fantastic experience. You can straight up never touch the controls in an actual match and enjoy playing the game from a managerial aspect if you wanted too. If you've ever played the WWE 2k games, you almost never want to sim a match in your Universe because its boring to sit there and watch. That is not the case in Fire Pro. I have and can continue to spend multiple hours just watching matches I set-up play out. The CPU AI and Logic system can truly make for some amazing matches, and I was truly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. I always heard the simulated matches in Fire Pro could be incredible, but I never expected them to be this damn good. Seriously, even if you never plan on actually \"playing\" the game, the 20 dollars for the sim experience alone is well spent. \n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]\nThis might be the best 20 dollars I have ever spent on a video game. As a massive wrestling fan like most people I assume buying this are, the game does everything right. I don't like using a \"Perfect\" label on things really, especially for a game with more features still to come, but this game is damn near perfect. The combat is actually fun and it doesn't feel like a massive guessing game against the AI, the match types are amazing, and the simulation experience is a joy to watch. Overall, I'd say this game is well worth your money, and I very much look forward to sinking countless hours into it.", "timestamp_created": 1499759488, "timestamp_updated": 1499764450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33450207": {"recommendationid": "33450207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006140987", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506749256}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly amazing to see Fire Pro make a return in 2017.

Now onto the gameplay.\n\nIf you are familar with Fire Pro wrestling games and adore them like I do get it.\n\nHowever if you are coming from something else like the WWE 2K series then please read the rest of this review.\nFire Pro Wrestling games grew to popularity due to its in-depth wrestling system. Due to this depth, the game is much more difficult than WWE games. For Instance, grappling is done by timing your button press too late you fail, too early you fail, press a button more than once you fail. This game is not forgiving but once you get the hang of it becomes a rewarding experience. This cannot be stated more, this is a simulation wrestling game so basic wrestling concepts apply here. If you go out of the gates trying to hit heavy moves like a wrestlers finisher you will always be reversed. This game is in-depth. If all of the above has turned you off then I can't recommend this game for you. However if you decide that you want to put in the time to learn the system you should also understand that this game does not have any licsensing with any pro wrestling companies so there are no real wrestlers in the default roster. However Fire Pro Wrestling has an amazing robust creation suite for wrestlers, that even allows for you to edit the cpu behavior of your wrestler. To add on to this if you are not a creative person or dedicated enough to create a wrestler you want(like me) then you can hit up the workshop in which users upload their created wrestlers and created referees(Look at it right now to see if a wrestler you want has been created). Finally this game is in Early Access, so there are alot of features that are missing or that are barebones such as mission mode. However, the devs are super responsive to the community and are already taking notes on complants and wanted features. Currently the only modes are Mission(Tutorial with added objectives), Exhibtion, League, Tournament, Battle Royale, and Online. If you feel that are not enough things to do, then I would recommend you wait for the game to come out of early access and see if it appeals to you later with the final version released.", "timestamp_created": 1499747633, "timestamp_updated": 1499786146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547461", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33447588": {"recommendationid": "33447588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056151930", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501451551}, "language": "english", "review": "So far this game is awesome, especially with the workshop.

As it stands, the community has already begun uploading a plethora of 'real world' wrestlers to the Workshop, allowing for a fully customizable experience for those who gripe the initial roster is too smal.\n\nThe game harkens back to the 2-Dish days of old, and as the days go on, I'm sure the game itself will improve.

Huge wrestling fans will probably love it. If you're already a Fire Pro fan you already know you want this so I won't have to sell you on it. This review is intended for everyone else. \n\n[b]Q: But I already have WWE 2k, why get this when the graphics look 20 years old?[/b]\n\nA: Customization and gameplay. \n\nFPW only comes with a couple dozen fictional characters but that's where the Steam workshop support comes in. You're going to be able to download any of the big-name wrestlers (and lots of lesser-known ones) from all kinds of different promotions. If you come from WWE 2k you're probably thinking that's not a huge selling point because you know that even the best created wrestlers in WWE 2k usually look they they don't fit in perfectly compared to the wrestlers already in the game. That's not the case with Fire Pro. The best created wrestlers look just as good and fit in just as well as the wrestlers already in the game. With a fanbase as dedicated as Fire Pro's, in theory you can end up with a roster of 1000 wrestlers that mostly look and play really well (there's no limit to the amount of wrestlers you can download). Then throw a bunch of them in some mega league and see what happens. \n\nThen there's the actual wrestling which may feel like a gigantic breath of fresh air compared to the stale, joyless gameplay found in the WWE 2k series. The basic jist of it is that you have to start out small with minor strikes and whatnot and work your way up before you can start doing your big moves like powerbombs and piledrivers. If you try doing one of your biggest moves early on it probably won't be successful and your opponent will counter it. It's even fun to watch cpu vs cpu matches because every move feels [i]right[/i]. \n\nI didn't mean for this review to just bash 2k left and right but in many ways this game is the anti-WWE 2k. 2k has all kinds of bells and whistles, career modes, universe modes, etc. Fire Pro doesn't have that, it's very straightforward. You can play some mission modes but the bulk of your gameplay will be in exhibition, tournament, or league (think G1 climax) matches. So if you want to get a game for the actual gameplay, get this. If you want to get a game with career modes, this in all honesty might not be for you.

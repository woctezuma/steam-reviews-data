It\u2019s well worth every dollar for the voice acting alone, to be honest. \n\nGraphics range from average to well done. More development is given to the story + world building, and the repetitive nature of routes its predecessor suffered from is near non-existent in this one. Each route in the game deals with a different issue depending on selected beau, lending to its routes\u2019 uniqueness. While certain routes may leave more to be desired, most are well balanced between story and character. \n\nHOWEVER, warning that if you have played the first game and have favourites, your beau may not shine through in this game, because certain routes did not do the characters justice (in my opinion, at least *cough[spoiler]Damien[/spoiler]cough*) OR is not character focused ([spoiler] Erik's route [/spoiler]).\n\nPros:\n\n+ Voice acting still on point. All very distinct and well done, even the [spoiler]wives\u2019[/spoiler] ! Just as good as the first game\u2019s, if not even better. 10/10 would buy the game just for it.\n+ OST was brilliant. Fit the atmosphere greatly, and brought forth the story to a whole other level. Loved the new tracks, and was fun listening to the old tracks again.\n+ Very different routes, personalised to hell and back. A major improvement from the first game - this time, the only repetitiveness was in the general routes/situations, but that was to be expected. Because of this, replayability was heightened greatly, which made for a much more immersive experience.\n+ Additional one CG for each route as compared to the previous game. (I\u2019ve done some math, the number of CG + sprite art done for both games is roughly equal, so kudos to the artist !)\n+ The way every side character\u2019s story came together to form one cohesive plot and tell a single story laid out in the background [spoiler](aka Diana\u2019s assassination and its reasoning and her eccentric behaviour)[/spoiler] was also really neat. The additional scenes/stories with the new characters (Saero, Fae, Rabbit, Shadow, Sergeant) also added to the enjoyment. [spoiler]Even the \u2018muses\u2019 and Diana\u2019s meta explanation for her backstory and actions was really cool, clearing up the numerous misunderstandings within the story.[/spoiler]\n\n\nCons:\n\n- All art was good, namely CG, sprites, background and additional. However, the sprites didn\u2019t have any outfit changes from the first game, which i thought was an odd choice, both artistically and story wise. For the first few hours i played, every time a boy popped up I couldn\u2019t help thinking \u2018its been two years and they couldn\u2019t afford a new outfit??\u2019. I have to admit this is more of a pet peeve, but its still an odd artistic choice I don\u2019t understand why was made.\n- Another odd thing about art I\u2019ve seen other reviewers mention so I know I\u2019m not the only one: why was Damien the babyfaced brother even though it\u2019s been stated multiple times that Matthew held this role? He looked a lot younger and less mature as compared to the first game - im assuming that its to emphasise on his role as the youngest, but it was a little hard to get used to, especially considering his mature behaviour.\n- Some scene changes would happen abruptly, which lead to disjointed scene transitions - to the point where at certain times, you could tell when the personalised route ended and we would go back to the general descriptive/route. They felt too sudden, and tended to be a little jarring at certain times. Oddest ones were after a bad or good end was reached, where the jump to [spoiler]K\u2019s epilogue[/spoiler] didn\u2019t really transit well. \n- Certain exposition/lore being revealed in the epilogue was...a boring story telling technique in my opinion? I would have loved to learn about the lore through the route itself, instead of K throwing it in my face at the very end. [spoiler](Namely Saero\u2019s heritage and was being/becoming the Lord of Dragons entailed)[/spoiler]\n- LATIN. I liked the touches of Latin for spells and Angel-speak, but I kinda wish that a translation could have been provided below the actual text. This was the worst during [spoiler]James\u2019[/spoiler] route, in which I felt like I was missing huge chunks of the game/story just by being unable to properly decipher what the angels were saying. It was also kind of annoying to have to go Google for the actual text. I felt that it was detrimental to the story if your audience can\u2019t even understand a major part of it.\n- Certain bad ends would get a good buildup followed by lengthy descriptions, while others would start and end abruptly. This unfair distribution in lines made me raise an eyebrow, to be honest.\n- Diana\u2019s route was abysmally short compared to the boys, who had at least twice the content of her route (for reference, it would take me ~1-1.5hrs to reach an ending with the boys, but Diana\u2019s only took ~45min-1hr).\n\n7.8/10 - I wanted more Diana :(((", "timestamp_created": 1515256765, "timestamp_updated": 1515256765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39075094": {"recommendationid": "39075094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799266308", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 197, "last_played": 1515369966}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing!\ni'm completely obsessed with this game!", "timestamp_created": 1515134861, "timestamp_updated": 1515134861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38966882": {"recommendationid": "38966882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385974221", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514885253}, "language": "english", "review": "Good succeeding game.", "timestamp_created": 1514885116, "timestamp_updated": 1514885116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38863717": {"recommendationid": "38863717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312970220", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514825884}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing its so good i recommend buying and playing", "timestamp_created": 1514646644, "timestamp_updated": 1514646644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38769830": {"recommendationid": "38769830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120511464", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514441801}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished Diana's route and that is the only one i played so far.  So my review will be about what i think of it SO FAR.  I will be straight to the point and explain after;\n\n1-perfect balance between story telling (advancing) and description of event or environment.  (see below for more info point #1)\n\n2-not enough images for scene lenght.  (see more below)\n\n3-sex description start wonderful and...fall short.  (see more below)\n\nconclusion; I LOVE THIS VN ANYWAY!  Why?  Because it was holding my interrest wonderfully!  yes even with it flaws, it still stand its ground well.  I can't wait to play the other routes!!!\n\n1- Contrairy to some people here in the review, I loved the writhing and think it is perfect balance between description and story telling.  I know some people love to read a full description of the single piece of dust laying around in a room but honestly TOO MANY VN get on my big nerve endlesly writing about how this plate of sushi is such a delight...bla, bla, bla...for nothing to add to the actual story.  So BIG THUMBS UP for writing in my point of view, again perfect balance!\n\n2- There is definitely not enough images while describing a full and lenghtly scene.  Some effort could have been done in that department.  But, the price tag would have gone with it i guess (look at other VN that offer only one route for 35 box...) so sometimes, you need to use your own imagination for a scene that is well describe but not shown.  For some people will little imagination available, it could be a big turn off.\n\n3- The description of the 'soft sex scene' was great but it fall short.  Was the sex scene removed, i don't know...  I don't ask for anything hard core but, for a Succubi, i thought Diana would have been more ...'eager' than this.  I don't understand because the support story is so wonderful for this kind of 'sexual energy' thing!?...  fall short here but that is only my point of view.  i guess this is a question of personal taste as well.\n\nDo i recommend it?

Just like the first game, this one has a mixture of things I liked and disliked. Usually, I do pros and cons sections, but I feel like it might get a bit complicated if I use that arrangement. \n\nWhile I didn't hate the artwork or anything in this, I did prefer the artwork of the first game a bit more. I think the guys looked prettier before.\n\nThe writing quality remained the same, which is a bit disappointing, but oh well. Some people have no desire to improve their writing skills. It isn't bad writing, but it could definitely be better.\n\nIn relation to the writing, I felt that the romantic scenes were \"hit and miss,\" like last time. Sometimes, the scenes would elicit romantic feelings and other times I'd be bored. \n\nOnce again, Damien and Diana's story paths were the most interesting to me. However, Diana's path was much shorter than the others and I felt kinda cheated because of that, since she's the only female romance option.\n\nI felt that the other brothers' wives/girlfriends were mostly pointless. They're merely inserted into the story for ... extra CGs? Only one of them has a role in the story, and that's only during one story path. Otherwise, these characters aren't developed at all and any scenes with them felt boring/uninteresting.  \n\nI really liked that one of the endings involves polyamory! It's such a rare find in media.\n\nI was disappointed in the lack of people of color. It's a fictional world, so there really isn't an excuse for why there weren't any black or at least darker skinned characters. The brothers of the story are all HALF siblings, meaning that one (or more) of their mothers could've been a woman of color. They didn't need to be all white.\n\nThere were some typos, but I didn't come across any scripting errors. \n\nOverall, it was definitely worth my time and I did enjoy it.

The first \"Seduce Me\" is a cute, shallow visual novel for young girls with nice music, unimpressive (or flat out ugly, depending on your view) art, and weak storytelling. \n\nI bought \"Seduce Me 2\" after following the developer's social media, eagerly hoping this one would be better than the first. From everything I saw, it seemed like it would be! I paid the full $15 for it, aaaaaaaaaand...\n\n...I kinda wish I hadn't. Don't get me wrong, this is better than the first, but the prequel didn't set a high standard. The voice acting is good, as usual, and I appreciate hard effort behind the whole team. That being said, there is very little gameplay for $15, and the storylines get repetitive after a while. This is fine if you want a visual novel with fantastical elements, adventure and good music, but the writing could use a lot of work. I kept finding typos and repetitive sentences and imagery. \n\nA lot of the pictures were very underwhelming, too. For example, Diana's battle scene plays out and all you see is a lazy drawing of Diana's back, with her wings obscuring the armies and enemy. I couldn't help but think, \"That's all you could come up with? I understand it if you have a small budget, but couldn't you have made a more visually engaging artwork? How about Diana flying into the sky with the Demon Lord in the background? And later on, her snake is described-- why is there no image of the snake?\"\n\nAlthough this is a visual novel, the visuals are disappointingly lacking.\n\nAnother aspect I didn't like was the strong personality of the main character that took me out of the story multiple times. At one point in Erik's route, Mika (your self-insert) expressed disgust at the idea of having children. That would be fine if this weren't a self-insert game, but if you give me the option to erase her name and put in whatever I want, I'm going to assume she's a blank canvas I can project myself on to. I remember cocking my eyebrow then and thinking, \"Interesting. I didn't remember having that viewpoint before, but it's good to know I do.\"\n\nIn short, \"Seduce Me 2\" is an okay game with a team of great people behind it, but the content is shallow, tiresome and disappointingly sparse for its $15 price tag.

The art style is a little different from last time so some of the characters' looks I'm conflicted by--some look really good with the new art style and some are a little... meh. But I understand that the artist evolved and liked the designs better.\n   The main thing that bothered me, was that Sam's story seems far more evolved than the others. I've only completed Sam's and Eric's (my favorite from the first) and started both Matthew and James' stories and I can tell that so far in the one's that I've done, most worked and flushed out is Sam's route. That's great and all, and like I said we have our favorites, but I feel as though when the makers do this, it really kind of gyps players who have other favorites. What I mean is that one shouldn't be far more developed than others.\n   Also, the wives were kind of random and didn't really do anything for the story except make it kind of awkward to play as everyone's wife a different time. That may just be me though.\n   Other than that, it's good. I really like how each character has a different conflict going on while facing the Demon Lord. Even with a few of the repeating scenes in every story--I understand. I've written and coded for a game that was super simple to code and changing every story route to be completely unique is... ugh and also inconvenient.

Unlike the past game, this one has a much longer, connected story and every story is very different despite following the same basic plotline. And this time, you have the opportunity to pursue a romantic plotline that has nothing to do with you or your chosen incubus- that is, a matchmaking plot of sorts. As of this writing, I have completed three of the plotlines- James, Sam, and Erik, and all three are quite different, despite the same skeleton being there. A vast improvement indeed over the last game, where only certain cutscenes changed, rather than the story as a whole.\n\nThe art improved, and there's a lot more still art than before. Also, as a small note, the way the artist draws eyes is very pretty to look at, especially Sam's in the final still art for his plotline.\n\nBecause of the fact that every story is unique, I found myself enjoying the game a lot more than the previous one (but I really liked the previous one- good and simple intro to the otome genre). This one was a bit more complicated and even had a few options where you were forced to choose between two things you might not want to do, which I consider actually a positive. I am sorely disappointed that I found the matchmaking subplot my first run through, because I now feel compelled to do it every time I play, which means watching the same cutscenes over and over (but that's my choice, not a real complaint). To be fair, this does always seem to alter the ending of the game a little bit to reference their romance, and thus, their romance plot always ends up a little different each time, but as I have never not pursued this subplot, I haven't seen the endings without it.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints is the inclusion of wife characters for the brothers whose story you don't follow. It's not that I think they should have been unmarried, just that they completely lack purpose and anything they do could simply have been done by one of the brothers or Naomi and Suzu. They also lack presence, being barely around except in crowd scenes. I ask myself every time I start a new story why they're there, and I've yet to find my answer. The most any of them did was Carrie's purpose in James's storyline, but I feel what she did could have easily been done by either Damien or Erik, or by the player deciding to go out and getting hailed by a fortune teller. Their lack of purpose drives me absolutely nuts in the game, especially when everyone else has more story to them. I mean, granted, the inclusion of the brothers sans your incubus seems a little pointless, but there's at least a logical reason behind it. Not so much on the wives front, none of whom ever really get a proper introduction. Erik's story tries to justify their presence, but it feels less an explanation and more a handwave. I also think a problem I have is that they're wives, not fiancees or girlfriends, despite the fact that it's only been a 2-year gap (where the girls had not been in the prior game) and Matthew especially was against getting married originally. Seems odd, since it took the player so long to get married.

I don't often write game reviews, but credit where credit is due: the attention to detail in this game is massive.

It's not an incredibly lengthy game (especially if you turn off sound and read like the wind), but so rewarding - each path is worth playing for the diversity of the primary plot, and there are diverse subplots with support characters also to be enjoyed. \n\nWhat you can expect: a visual novel with a number of turns and twists with better replay value through additional, very different storylines than I have ever encountered in the genre. Voice acting is quite compelling (I listened through a couple of storylines) and the soundtrack contributes substantially to the mood. \n\nIf you haven't played the first game, you should, exploring at least each of the demon paths. Knowing the backstory will contribute a lot to your understanding the scenarios presented here.\n\nAdult content caution: Seduce Me 2 has a lot more sexuality than Seduce Me, but the jump is from PG or maybe PG-13 (in film levels) to a soft R.

You get to choose whose path you're on from the get-go which makes sense being a direct sequel. There are no paths for Naomi, Suzu, or Andrew, but it entirely makes sense that if you didn't end up with a demon you would not have been part of this story.\n\nEach demon's story is very unique making each playthrough entirely different. There are multiple good and bad endings for each path, with other inbetween side stories with the various trainers. It makes sense to me that the wives of the incubi came with them to demon world -- they are strong women to be married to demons to begin with, they aren't about to let them go to demon world alone, whether the boys like it or not! The Skip option is very useful for trying to work through all the endings and collect the various achievements.\n\nOne thing I disliked was the art style changed from the first game. Although the scenery and storyline images were still well done while keeping it simple, the boys visually changed. Although Matthew, Erik, and James didn't change all that much, there is a huge difference for Damien and Sam... and being two of my absolute favorite characters they felt different just by looking at them.

I played the first because it was free and fell in love with it though it did get tedious to get achievments and I skipped through most everything. That being said, I was skeptical about purchasing this game because I would think to myself, \"what if I play one story and end up skipping 3/4 just to click the correct things for the others?\". Boy was I wrong. Every characters story is unique and intriguing with some new extras so no single playthtough has to be remotely the same. The bad ending are pretty cool even(No spoils but Searos and Matthews bad ends are sick) and written well. I loved the writing of the sequel much better and the game certainly lasts longer. I beat the first Seduce Me in about a day and a half(with work etc in between plays) but have been playing the sequel for two days now and still have to do James' and Eriks stories along with figuring out what achievments are left to find after. I'm just so in love with this game and feel so much more connected to the all of the characters vs the first where I really mainly liked only James' and Sams stories. \n\nDownsides though I would have to say are dialouge in some places just seems off or overly cheesy while in other areas it's emotional and deep and can ruin the flow of the game. Another I would have the say is the character art itself. In the sequel I was hoping to see a larger abundance of facial expressions or poses(or even the drawn artwork). When a character is hurt or falling. .whatever all the character does is continue standing and just uses one of the five faces they have. That in itself could totally ruin a serious moment because it looks silly, these aren't major issues though.\n\nSo overall this game is definitely worth the buy.

It really added to the atmosphere, OH and the MUSIC! The music for the lewd scenes were so intoxicating.

Besides the whole (SPOILERS AHEAD) a Demon World day is 5 hours in Human World time. But if the incubi were in the Human realm for 2 years and Diana had been waging war and such for 10 years in Demon World time, 5 hours Human World time doesn't make sense. Nevermind that actually, I did that math just now. It's a little over a year but then again, they said \"about 2 years\". \nAnyways, my ONLY problem with this game/visual novel was the art style. The first game was so good looking and much more detailed in character design. But this one, looks like it was a quick sketh and they said f**k it. Honestly, I wouldn't even care if they used the character designs from the last game. The art quality in that game was definetly worth $10, this one should have been the art style for a FREE game. \nOverall, the game was a blast to play.

The game is intense and full of choices and endings, the music is as cool as in the first one, and the art is a lot better (it's actually really nice!).

He\u2019s my favorite character, I love his cute personality, and his VA is excellent. The bad ending surprised me a lot [spoiler](and kinda creeped me out, but I liked?? Haha)[/spoiler], and the good ending was cute. Sam\u2019s route was another surprise, I\u2019m not really a fan of \u201cbrute\u201d characters, but the writing was good and I could feel that he really cared about the MC. The art style was good (I\u2019m not so picky about that tho), BGM was great. But\u2026 Let me talk about the things that bothered me.\n\n[b]*** SPOILERS ***[/b]\n\n[spoiler][b]The wives & absence of Naomi and Suzu[/b]: I absolutely adore Naomi and Suzu. Their routes on the first game were ok, but I love them more as friends of MC. It saddens me that you can\u2019t interact more with them, besides talking on the phone. And suddenly there\u2019s the wives? I honestly felt happy that the other boys (besides the one you\u2019re dating) got married, but I think it was totally unnecessary to make them a part of the story, and interact with the MC. And\u2026 get sucked into the Demon World together with their husbands. I can understand about the boys, but the wives? They don\u2019t do ANYTHING. They show up once in a while and that\u2019s it. That was kind of a let down, and I really don\u2019t think that the boys would risk the life of their beloved wives on war field. There might be an explanation for that, but sorry, I don\u2019t buy it. ._.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler][b]Erik\u2019s route was all about Diana[/b]: Ok, Erik isn\u2019t my favorite guy in the game. I\u2019m not a fan of the playboy type, but I still care about this character. But honestly, his route was all about Diana\u2019s sister. I couldn\u2019t feel a proper interaction between him and the MC. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I think that kinda ruined what could have been a good route\u2026[/spoiler]\n\nDespite my complains, it was great to play this VN. I loved the fact that each route is unique, the new characters (except the wives lol), the multiple possible endings, and the fact that every choice matters. I really like this developer, and I wish them the best of luck on their next releases!\n\n7/10, because Matthew is love, Matthew is life.", "timestamp_created": 1471451315, "timestamp_updated": 1471451315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705753", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24931497": {"recommendationid": "24931497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092468330", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470995313}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed Seduce Me the Otome or are interested in the continuation of the story, the sequel is a must have. There was much that was improved in this game that I feel the content is worth the full price. The creator does occasionally put her games on sale for half-off, so it'd be absolutely worth it to pick it up by then.\n\nThere are 2 alternating stories while the demon war takes place: the MC's involvement in the war and your love interest's conflict. There are 1-2 good endings for each route and a few bad endings. Like the first game, there is a hidden password attached to some of the endings that unlock a bonus. The bonus provides an interesting twist and also (out of context)[spoiler]clarifies the canon story (Sam's route)[/spoiler].\n\n+ A+ for voice acting. All of the cast did a phenomenal job. The bloopers were hilarious and well worth the effort to unlock.\n+ Music has greatly improved. A few tracks from the first game do return, but there are some beautiful piano pieces that make me want to buy the OST. The ending theme song is especially lovely.\n+ A majority of complaints from SM1 were repetitive scenes and choices. There is a greater effort in route variation. The choices give you a stronger sense of the MC's (or the player's) personality. The most repetitive scenes would be in the demo portion of the game, but there are plenty of choices added that make it worth re-playing through these scenes as you go through each route.\n+ Writing has improved from the first game, but still feels a little stiff at times (during spoken dialogue and long explanations). I loved that there were more scenes where the MC was reflecting on her decisions and thinking about the weight of her situation- which I felt was absent from the first game. There were scenes where I felt tension, expecting a bad ending around the corner. There were scenes where I felt angry at certain characters; scenes where I felt depressed about the choices I had to make, but supportive towards the affected character. The creator did a great job in giving me more of an emotional attachment to the characters than in SM1.\n+ The game provides a tutorial for Ren'Py shortcuts, covers content warnings, and goes so far as to offer brief explanations about the first game's story and route summaries. It was a very thoughtful addition that I appreciated having (served as a great refresher).\n\n+/- The romance is already established since this game covers the MC's marriage. I felt the first game was more on the tame side, not being too smutty. Here, there are more intimate scenes added (3 per route with 1 exception) that takes it a step further while still being written in a tasteful manner. The sex scenes are still completely optional.\n\n- Very minor typos. Again, some of the spoken dialogue came off as lengthy (such as explanations).\n- Art still suffers anatomy and posing issues in sprites and CGs. The first game made them look older CG-wise. Here, they appear much younger. Some may be bothered with the new art, but I preferred the new style.\n- The MC comes off as a Mary Sue during the war portion of the story. [spoiler]The way she quickly adapts her trainer's powers was not believable, especially given she learned so quickly in just a few days. The fact that the MC has inherit demon powers (which Diana took in the first game) coming back to the point she can suddenly master other demon's powers, was not addressed very well.[/spoiler]\n- There were a few scenes where it seemed like there should have been sprites on-screen, but there weren't. I also found it a little strange that the boys were mostly shirtless for the majority of their routes.\n\n- The wives issue, which are \"the kickstarter backer-rewarded characters that are not canon\".\n\nMany people are mixed on the wives. Some are supportive of the idea (as it should be a logical outcome), while others tend to react negatively toward them. I can't think of any otome game where the other love interests moved on and hooked up with someone else while playing through a route.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, the wives feel shoehorned in and out of place. They are all inexplicably non-human and are already married before the start of the game (which is a 2 year time skip from the ending of SM1).\n\nThere are no scenes to establish their backstories. They just exist and have \"off-screen\" bonded with each other like a family. Outside of Sam's wife in James' route [i](who wouldn't exist anyways because Sam is the canon route)[/i], they don't add any support or value to the story besides their random interjections.\n\nPersonally, I disliked the scenes where you eavesdrop in on them with their spouse. It felt like you could have swapped the MC into those scenes and it would not have made a difference. This made me feel like the MC was not important to the incubus' story at all.\n\nENDING TIP [i](could be a spoiler if you want to play blind)[/i]:\nThe war portion is a standalone story that does not directly impact the love interest's route. The outcome of the war is an addition to the endings, but the choices you make towards the good/bad endings are entirely dependent on how you treat your love interest.\n\nAchievements are doable without a guide, but require a bit of trial and error. I wanted to point this out because some of the choices are vague in their outcome. You could pick one wrong option and be locked out of the good ending.", "timestamp_created": 1471257893, "timestamp_updated": 1471943806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581761", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24924085": {"recommendationid": "24924085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152096623", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476650408}, "language": "english", "review": "Seduce Me 2 is far superior to the first installment of the series.

My only complaint is that the outcome of the war is not linked to the best ending of some routes.

It pretty much pulled me further into visual novels of all types and I think it helped pull a lot more interest into the otome gaming business. I consider it a must-have in your Steam library.\n\nThis time, I still really like it, but I warn that it is different.\n\nOnce again, hands down, the voice acting really nailed it. Some of the actors really upped their skills and interpretations on the characters since SM1, while everyone of them made the story that much more. Mr. Ethan Nakashima, the voice of Matthew, really stood out, and even if you aren't a Matthew fan, check out the route, if only just to hear him, though that route's end has been the most entertaining, so go through for that, too.\n\nMichaela's writing did not disappoint either, with intricate storylines, tons of MC choices and consequences, and *those* scenes being different for each of the characters and IMO is better than SM1. As stated, the story itself is different. You're not romancing one of the boys, that's what SM1 covered, now you're supporting them as a continuation of your relationship with the character. For the full experience, I agree with the other reviewers, play the free SM1 route of the character and then follow directly through with the SM2 route.\n\nI have to warn, the writing is a little rough compared to the first. I think the timeline was way too tight for the amount of work and creative heart and soul the team poured into this game. The first was well edited and the writing tighened up quite nicely when it hit steam and I saw it and I can't help but feel if Ms. Laws had an extra three to six months to wrap everything up with a good polish and edit, it would have really helped with the typos and grammar that can be so jarring to some readers. Don't quote me on the numbers, but I believe she put out like 250K words of story in like 6 months. Insane when she's also programing the game. So complain if you want on the typos, but I can't help but be impressed at her dedication to getting this game out for us on time.\n\nOnce again I really enjoyed the music. One point, concerning what may have been an oboe and piano, actually had me pause in the middle of the game to stop, listen, and enjoy the entire song before continuing, which is a feat in itself, focused reader that I am. The soundtrack definitely has a place in my collection, right next to the first one.\n\nI know the wives are a point of contention. They are a little weird, but Michaela is also not one to go 100% traditional in things, and frankly it was a good marketing tactic for the kickstarter. Others are doing similar though maybe not as obvious in their games. Literally a flash, bang, right in your face. Hah, Michaela does have style. I'm interested to actually find their little hidden paragraphs but TBH, I don't care that much to go through and really dig for them. If I stumble on them, cool. The other boys moved on, it happens after 2 years, and its pretty easy to ignore the 8 sentences of dialog they have, anyway.\n\nAs for the the story itself, a bit of spoiler. [spoiler]I am intrigued that Michaela appears to have a bit of how 2 years with each boy affects the MCs personality. My other and I are going through it together and had to cringingly admit, James appears to turn her into a lazy mooch who has him handle everything, perfect CEO trophy wife material. Erik enables her into full-out Tsundere spoiled and cruel, and Matthew does make her into a mom. Kudos on the subtlety! or maybe not so subtle in Erik's route. You have the ability to make decisions that aren't those personalities, but if they rub you the wrong way, it can be a little tough to read. \n\nAnd Matthew's ending... We will be laughing over our interpretation for days, both of us imaging a psycho squirellette hoping out of a box and the two immediately \"making friends\" on the dining room table while Matthew and Mika try to have a romantic moment at the end of the route. And it has since become a running joke of a cameo in the background occasionally in the other routes including a little batman and wonder woman costume somewhere along the way. The amount of laughter over that alone is worth the $10. Thanks SM2 team!

What else can be said? This game is absolutely fantastic in every way. The voice acting is phenomenal. I can certainly hear the improvement compared to the first game. The art style is especially beautiful. The characters seem a bit less detailed when compared to the character models in the first game, but the art style is so amazing on it's own that it creates more than an exception. The modified and newly developed music is so lyrical. It warms my heart. Not to mention, considering how much time and effort the developers put into this game, (restless nights, countless corrections to minor issues, cranium and skeletal injuries) I'd say the game turned out especially fantastic. There are too many highlights to recognize with this game, but these were some of the basics. Thank you very much for reading!

I played Seduce Me The Otome on a lark because it was free, and I wanted to see what a free visual novel had to offer.  I was not disappointed and became slightly obessed with getting all of the achievements.  I was thoroughly surprised that the sequel was already out, and since I enjoyed the first so much, I was happy to plunk down 10 bucks to play the second.  I highly recommend playing through the first game, which is again free, so it won't cost you anything but time.  You don't have to, but you get more background into the characters than what K gives you in the beginning.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and it is a fine successor to the first.  Character development is very solid.  All of the boys have their own distinct personalities that are fairly consistent with the first game.  You also meet other interesting characters, like your trainers and Diana's personal guard Saero, who all have their own motivations, if you care to find out about them.  The voice acting is done very well, and I was very surprised to see a character from the first game come back and say \"You missed me, bitch?\"  I found myself saying \"Yes.  Yes, I missed you tons.\"\n\nThe story lines are good as well.  It makes sense as to why you are in the demon world and what you have to do to get back to the human world, if you so choose.  The story lines could've been a little longer, especially Diana's.  I was able to knock her arc out and get all the achievements associated with it in about three hours.  It's important to note that what you say or don't say actually matters in this game.  Unlike the first game, which was incredibly formulaic and predictable in getting its endings, you have to pay attention to your paramour and his personality.  I am leaving Diana out of this one because in her arc, you aren't paying attention to her.  You're paying to Saero, who is a fantastic character and is easily my favorite new character.  I wish there was more of him in this game.\n\nOnto the not-so-great stuff.  The art design for the game, on a whole, is better, except when it comes to the boys.  Some of their default poses are so unnatural looking.  It's like a few of their joints are at odd angles.  Also, Damien's character model was the most drastically changed.  While he is the youngest of the five, in the first game, he didn't look or act like the youngest.  That was reserved for Matthew, and I understood it because of their personalities.  Now, Damien definitely looks the youngest and sometimes acts like it too.  No bueno.  Finally, the wives.  As a whole, I like the fact that the boys that you don't romance move on and find love.  That's awesome, but with the exception of Carrie (Sam's wife) in James's arc, they have nothing to do, and it really pisses me off.  I want to know about these ladies!  I want to know about Irene's fashion sense, Noryn's cat leggings, and Iridessa, who looks to be of Native American descent.  I still have a bit of the game to play, farming achievements and such, but if over 20 hours hasn't revealed anything yet, I doubt another 10 will.\n\nDespite all of that being said, this game is worth your money.  Doubly so if you've played the first game.  The good endings are satisfying, the bad ones are heartbreaking, and the voice acting is superb.

If you haven't played Seduce Me The Otome yet, I highly recommend doing so before playing this (and it's still free!). It's not a necessity since you can skim the story at the beginning but it gives you a better feel for the characters. \n\nI was a little worried after having loved the first game. How could this ever live up to the expectations I then had for the game? But boy was I wrong. I had nothing to worry about at all having fallen in love with the Demon Wars.\n\nHeh... I thought some of the sadder endings in the first game got me a little in the feels [spoiler] letting the boys go and losing memories of them was quite sad, okay?\t[/spoiler] but this one was a serious suckerpunch. I don't mean that to sound like a bad thing at all! The story was so well written and I found myself so immersed in the storyline and each of the characters that playing through the worst of endings had me genuinly tearing up. On the other hand achieving the best of endings had me right in the fluffy feels with loud 'awws' and a fluttering heart from the happies. \n\nTo clarify there are 6 stories and for the most part they are very different though do expect to repeat a little bit of the same text (yay for skip!) however most of them are for the most part unique with only the bare minimum being repeated. This game has multiple endings depending on the way you play and more than just one bad and one good. \n\nI see some complaints about how the art changed and I can't obviously deny that. The art style did change and though my preferance will always be to the first, I ended up falling in love with the style of this game too. The voice acting was spot on once again in suiting each character perfectly (I hate it when voices just don't fit a face)  and the dialogue and story very well written.\n\nIt's easy to see how much love, time and effort went into making this game and I have enjoyed every second I've spent lost in the story.

That didn't really come across in this game until the very end, [spoiler]when she was killing imps left and right and didn't even flinch.  You'd think that since Diana cried and broke down at the end of her battle, Mika might show some sort of emotion, too.[/spoiler]\n\nAside from that, this was a pretty solid visual novel. You can tell Michaela Laws put a lot of thought into this, even just by looking at the tiny details of the world she's created.

First things first, if you want a good voice-acted visual novel with awsome artwork, then THIS is the game. Seduce Me 2 is a direct sequel to the first game (which is free if y'all wanna take a look). In short, you play as a human girl that is about to be married to one of five incubi brothers (or a beautiful succubus princess ;D). Unfortunately, things don't go as planned and you get dragged into a Demon War that you maaaaay or may not have had a hand in...\n\nStory: Mmmm THIS is where games are a deal breaker for me, as I love reading and writing stories. SM2 is beautifully written and each path you choose is unique in its own way, which is a definite improvement from the first game. The choices your MC make are relatively open most of the time, and my favorite part about this is you don't HAVE to have sexy time with your demon to get a good ending. The SM team is very big on proper consent with your partner. You don't HAVE to sleep with someone just because they're a sex demon or etc. Not only that, but there are so many different endings you can get, to the point where sometimes it can get frustrating. For me, the hardest was Erik since I kept dying, haha. But it's really satisfying when you see every single secret and ending the game has to offer since you really have to work for your results. \n\nCharacters: You definitely see the character development throughout the game, and it was even more apparent if you also played the first game. Like damn, that's my other weakness in stories (I'm so proud of my green sinnamon roll). I was also very surprised with how all the new characters interacted with each other. Usually you'll have minor characters that are there simply for decoration or for a bit of extra dialogue. In SM2, each side characters has a story of their own and further expands the world of the Abyssal Plains. You'll spend a long while revealing secrets, such as who Diana's guard is, or why Sergeant's horn is broken, etc.\n\nSound/Music: YES! I loooove the music, so good job Christopher Escalante. Also to Jonah Scott too for sound design. It was a huge improvement from the first game and I found myself crying and laughing many times while playing. I'll admit that sometimes the music will suddenly shift in an awkward place, but it's not too distracting. \n\nArtwork: Not going to lie, when I first saw the changed art style, I had my reservations. BUT the more I played, the more it grew on me and I actually found myself loving it. The CGs are really well drawn/colored and the backgrounds are GORGEOUS. They really help paint the image of the Abyssal Plains while I play. The only complaint I have are some of the characters' arms are in awkward positions (especially noticeable when in demon form). Nothing huge and I can't fault the artist since it's better than having everyone in the exact same pose.\n\nBugs/errors: As with all games, we'll have our share of bugs and errors. Luckily I haven't had anything game breaking happen to me so far, but occassionally you'll get a strangely placed character when skipping a few lines.

The question is, was its sequel successful in seducing me? \n\nIn my opinion, after playing through three different routes, I find that this is a fantastic stand-alone game, as well as a great sequel, worth the complete full price - and i'll tell you why! (Ahoy, mild spoilers ahead! Won't spoil any end-game things though!)\n\n+ Story is infinitely better than the first. It has a more cohesive, fleshed-out plot rather than being all over the place like in the first. This sequel knows its beginning, middle and end and displays great pacing which makes the game feel wrapped up well at the end. It embraces the \"Demon\" storyline as a main factor in this game, rather than having it as a side aspect to speed up the relationship process. The story is insanely different in each route (I have played Sam's, Matthew's and James' stories, all vastly different and enjoyable). There is PLENTY of choice, and the story itself is really just so much fun to experience, with both love and war being the main topic. I have had so much fun playing this game.\n+ Art. The Art was a mixed bag, but I will talk about what I liked first because my thoughts on the art are mostly positive. It has greatly improved since the first game, and with this improvement the characters have changed slightly. I really loved this change - mostly. Matthew looked good. Sam, James and Diana look absolutely awesome. The backgrounds were lovely and I thought the game as a whole was easy on the eyes. There is better art in other VN's, but the art in these two games has a lot of personality imo. \n+ Voice acting is better than ever. Every voice actor, yet again, did an amazing job. I was sort of hoping that \"Mika\" would have a proper voice this time around, but to no avail. Anyway, waiting on that blooper reel, Michaela. Pls. Need more Jonah and green apples in my life. \n+ Replayability. I mentioned in the story section that there are plenty of choices, and there really are. Each story is so amazingly different, I found out so many different things in three different playthroughs, and I'm still not bored of the game. I still have plenty of achievements to unlock. The first game got incredibly repetitive. This one, while in some parts does still repeat, is not even on the same level of repetition. \n+ Those sex scenes doe. This game is like 80% fanfiction lemony smut goodness and it's just great. Love it. It's even better that you're granted the choice to avoid them completely - not that I'm going to do that ever - but you know, that's great for people who don't like that sort of stuff \n+ Characterization. The guys in their routes really shined once more, really grew throughout the story, showcasing their relatibility and flaws. The side characters were very interesting too when you selected their training, especially Saero. However, Diana is the character that truly shines in this sequel. She tugs at your heart strings and makes you feel the feels without even starting her route. If you hated her in the first game, you'll love her in this one.\n+  Music is on point. That piano? Christopher Escalante you are the man. I'm not a person that focuses on music, but every time that piano came on I would just sit and listen to it in a dreamy state. Action/fight music is also amazing and gets you so pumped up. Overall, the music was never annoying, repetitive or too loud. \n\n- Art - While I overall enjoyed the art, I had a couple problems. Erik's face was drawn well but his physique looked unnaturally thin, though this didn't bother me too much. What bothered me the most was Damien. Suddenly shorter and looking really nothing like what he is meant to, each time he popped up I got annoyed. His body looks weird. He looks 5 years younger than he did in the first. I assume this happened because he is in fact the youngest and they were trying to re-establish this but isn't Matthew meant to be the babyface? These changes made him feel like a different character. I suppose the same could be said with Sam, but I thought his change was for the better and was a vast improvement in comparison to Damien's. \n- The Wives. Okay, I've got to say it. I have no idea if this is true or not, but did some fans win a competition to have their OC's inserted into the game? Because this is exactly what it feels like. For majority of these wives, it feels like they were created by a 12-year-old on DeviantArt. They aren't explained properly. It's not realistic to think all the guys would be married in a mere two years. They have no substantial impact on any plot or dialogue. They are there, purely and simply for one reason: fanservice. The only wives I liked are Irene (Erik's wife) and Carrie (Sam's wife). The rest are painfully hipster and \"unique\", looking like they haven't started high school yet. Their addition was forced and broke immersion. \n- No art for MC. This game felt like it was trying to completely get rid of \"Mika\" Andersons' pre-established appearance from the first game. In three playthroughs I saw the back of her head once. I just didn't understand this. We know what she looks like, why not draw her instead of drawing one of the boy's from a provocative perspective? (Update: She is drawn in Erik's route, so apologies for this one. I think she could have been drawn more though)\n- There's bugs. Incorrect text from different playthroughs. I got some achievements that I shouldn't have got. Not a huge deal, I understand the game was rushed out. \n\nTL;DR: Overall, I enjoyed this story a lot more than the original. It was more entertaining and well structured than the first, definitely worth $10. It's 80% lemon. You get to fight things. There's lots of nipples for the whole family to enjoy. \n\n8.5/10 - It seduced me again.", "timestamp_created": 1464448198, "timestamp_updated": 1464503453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653420", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23250209": {"recommendationid": "23250209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049413457", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465937748}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything hurts, this game, my soul.

(the answer to this last question is no)\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nthey are true to their personalities from the first game, but new things are learned about all of them. the things the characters must toil through in the game only help them grow as people/demons/demoness'. they are all very likable and enjoyable as characters, although once in awhile they say something really cliche that makes you want to throw up, but that actually makes them feel even more like real people.\n\nSEXY STUFF\n\nwhile I love the story of this game, and it kept me on the edge of my seat at times, to be honest I'm a huge pervy weeaboo. a fangirl with a thirst for this kind of shit. it's really hard to be in this situation, because there's very few otome games out there that offer anything ACTUALLY sexual with the male characters. I mean, I'm pansexual so I have a lot of other choices of the bishojo variety. but to see a game like this with actual sexual content makes a single steamy tear flow down my nerd face. if this category is the most exciting thing to you, PLEASE PLAY SAM'S ROUTE *heavy breathing*\n\nI would also like to mention as a side note that you don't have to actually participate in anything sexual to get the good endings, if that's not your thing, because like the narrator says \"consent is important!\" :)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nwhile it does sometimes fall into the common tropes and predictabilities of most dating sims, it's still a really good game with round(ish) characters and the experience is only enhanced if you are a fan of the prequel. also, you know in the first game I could never really get over how their eyes were like an inch higher then they should've been but I think the animation is A LOT better in this one, so you know there's that too.

There was so much more detail and depth compared to the first game and the stories were unique to each individual character. The soundtrack is just so beautiful and enhances the experience immensely; Christopher Escalante did a truly wonderful job on it. I have played through all of the routes and, while I enjoyed some more than others, I thought that they were all exceptionally done. \n\nMy favourite routes were definitely Erik's and Sam\u2019s while my least favourite was Damien's. Damien's route was still well done, but personally I found his story to be a little too redundant. Additionally, I found Diana's route to be too short and thought her story should have been expanded and delved into a little more. I also really did not like the 'wives'. They had absolutely no significance to the story and were seemingly only there to spout a few throw away lines every now and then. I'm not against the other boys being married, but I feel a mention would have been sufficient. \n\nThere were quite a few grammatical errors and a few instances where the spoken dialogue did not match with the written dialogue. It did not detract from my enjoyment of the game though so I was able to overlook them for the most part. What did bother me a bit were some of the endings. The dialogue for some of the endings are not accurate when it comes to the fate of certain characters. Hopefully this will be rectified in an update at some point in time.\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this game. I really liked the first Seduce Me game but I would venture to say that I love Seduce Me 2.

Ok but fangirling aside, I am in love with this visual novel (so far) as much as I am with the first game. The writing is impeccable and really well done (and seriously one of the best written visual novels in my opinion). And I have to also say the voice acting is great, especially K who cracks me up with her humor. I know I am not too far into my playthrough, but I will update as I go along. (And truthfully, I dont need lots of play time to know that I already love this game.) I have started with Diana's route, because hey who doesnt like bewbs (hey I am a woman who can appreciate both the men and women) ;) Which makes me wish they continued the protagonist's romances with her friends, Suzu and Naomi, and had routes for them as well. \n\n^^^EDITED: I just finished Diana's route and I have to say it was great...however it was incredibly SHORT (in my opinion) at least compared to the first game. So would i still recommend this game, heck yes but just be aware that it is short as it took me no time at all to get through one route. HOWEVER after completing Sam's route I want to say that his route is much longer than Diana's (which is a bit disappointing that her story wasnt as fully fleshed out as the brother's route).  MATTHEW's Route: At the end of the story, Diana had died, but when K did her little epilogue monologue somehow Diana was now alive?

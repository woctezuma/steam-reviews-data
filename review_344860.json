Sounds like a sweet deal... but is it? Let's find out.\n\n\n[u]The Good:[/u]\n\nTaking a long hard look at Crystal Story 2 and reviewing the content that it provides, it\u2019s surprising to see what is presented here.\n\nConsider the following: A good length for story with post game content as well, an easy to follow battle setup with a level up system familiar to Final Fantasy X, a variety of mini-games & side-quests provided and finally, if Crystal Story 2 wasn\u2019t enough, you can also find the original game, Crystal Story, packaged as well for those that are curious.\n\nAnd all this is provided for only $3. If this isn\u2019t a done deal, then I don\u2019t know what will talk you into buying a game.\n\n\n[u]The Bad:[/u]\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, Crystal Story 2 has a level up system that is familiar to the one used in Final Fantasy X, which is setup as a sphere grid. Here, you have the grids setup in a linear path and broken up in different classes for variety. where you spend the experience gained to enhance your stats and learn new skills.\n\nWhile this is setup neatly and easy to follow, it\u2019s also guilty in making the game easy. On one hand, you could blame that on the abundance of experience that you can receive through both the main story and completing side-quests. On the other hand, because a few classes strengthen a specific area, it makes it easy for the player to choose which class to focus on for the specific character.\n\n\n[u]The Ugly:[/u]\n\nAt times, Crystal Story suffers from a few audio issues. It\u2019s not an issue that can be fixed by adjusting in the options, because it\u2019s in relation to the specific audio files, where some clips sound louder than others.\n\n\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear in the Good section, the low value to this game is half the reason why I recommend this game. The other half would be the fact that this is a decent game. If you have change available and are looking for a good game, give Crystal Story 2 a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1515990490, "timestamp_updated": 1516071334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39251144": {"recommendationid": "39251144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188696537", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485663695}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1515660850, "timestamp_updated": 1515660850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38578603": {"recommendationid": "38578603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302233876", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 234, "last_played": 1516367643}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\n\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07\u0e41\u0e21\u0e49\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e14\u0e32\u0e07\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e25\u0e49\u0e32\u0e22\u0e46\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e25\u0e49\u0e32\u0e22\u0e46\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21 \u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e30\u0e14\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e46\u0e44\u0e1b \n\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e21\u0e35\u0e41\u0e04\u0e48\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e48\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e15\u0e23\u0e07\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e27\u0e15\u0e35 monster \u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e1e class\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23\u0e17\u0e33\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e19\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\n\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e21\u0e35\u0e17\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e15\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32 \u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 card ,craft item ,battle arena ,tetris  \u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\n\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e46\u0e01\u0e47\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a ^^", "timestamp_created": 1514036628, "timestamp_updated": 1514036628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38531385": {"recommendationid": "38531385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084548608", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514918613}, "language": "english", "review": "My first time playing a RPG game and I like this game soo match.. i'am about to unlock all achivment", "timestamp_created": 1513948210, "timestamp_updated": 1513948210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38389569": {"recommendationid": "38389569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070768933", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515288834}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was very fun, my favorite RPG on steam for sure, well worth the $3 it was", "timestamp_created": 1513556223, "timestamp_updated": 1513556223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38366343": {"recommendationid": "38366343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417014281", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512601014}, "language": "english", "review": "I find the game pretty cool.

So ignore my steam hours.\n\n\nThe take on the speed mechanic was a big one. I like the fact that it wasn't just a basic number to decide who moves first. The intervals in which your character can perform actions I find works out better than having it affixed to something like dodge rate/Your character's ability to attack multiple times on their turn. Really this was one of the sticking points that kept me playing the flash version. Child of Light is the only game I have played since that has used a refined version of this same speed system.\n\nThe option to use the numpad rather than a standard mouse/keyboard was another big thing. There's nothing wrong with the standard mouse/keyboard set-up, But I find as progress farther into the game (Especially my old craptop with a touch pad that won't function if you're using the keyboard at the same time) it's more efficient to utilize the key bindings for all of your actions. You still need to use your mouse for trivial things like sorting your inventory/Equipping gear on characters/etc, But overall you can get away with the numpad for just about everything.\n\nThen there are the completely random minigames thrown all over the place. They are rather basic, But they add some sort of charm to the game. I've never found them to be repetitive, They're short enough to be satisfying without overstaying their welcome.\n\nThe only thing I dislike about this game is the fact that the enemy bestiary is rather lacking. Enemy resistances to spell damage/effects doesn't seem to be specified, And actually finding the information on the enemy is somewhat hidden and you would need to scour across most of the entries to find the one you're looking for.\n\nOverall the actual combat/Story progression is about what you'd expect.I did end up buying this during the Summer Sale, But I would have paid full price.

It didn't exactly look professionally made too but I really wanted to give it a try. \n\nAt first I was a little bit disappointed because the battles weren't really hard at the beginning. It stayed that way for a long time - like until the fourth chapter or so - but it gets a little bit harder in the end. That and a lot of other possibilities during the game fully compensate for the fact that the battle system lacks depth. The developer made an attempt in implementing a crafting system, fighter classes and skills that weren't all bad too. \n\nThere are minigames like snowboarding, fishing, some kind of tower defense, a match-3 game, a card game and so on and so forth. Mostly the minigames fit into the game or are just a nice feature. The only thing being a little bit out of place was the pet you got and that you could dress with stuff you got with successfully fullfilling your quests. [spoiler] I laughed out loud when I first used the pet in a fight and it just burried my foes.[/spoiler]\n\nThe story isn't really fleshed out too. You can't really think about something, there aren't that many emotions, the characters won't grow on you and it's really not that memorable. The background music was getting on my nervers after a while too.\n\nThe art was mediocre but I liked it.

Gek\u00e4mpft wird in einem Rundenbasierenden SideviewKampfsystem mit ATB (Active Time Battle) Leiste. Also kein Statisches Rundenkampfsystem mit fester Zugreihenfolge. Un\u00fcblich aber bereits bekannt ist, dass es keine LevelUPs gibt. Man erlangt nach jedem Kampf Skillpunkte, die man in einen der 6 verschiedenen (recht geradlinig aufgebauten) Klassenb\u00e4ume investiert, die hier und da die Wahl zwischen zwei Upgradeoptionen lassen, die aber eher in der Masse als f\u00fcr sich einen Unterschied machen.\n\nEine weitere personalisierungsm\u00f6glichkeit der bis zu vier Helden besteht im Ausr\u00fcsten unterschiedlichem Equipments. Jedem Helden stehen eine Vielzahl an Waffen zur Verf\u00fcgung, die unterschiedliche Attribute erh\u00f6hen oder andere Boni wie Lebensraub mit sich bringen. Leider bekommt man erst eher sp\u00e4t im Spiel wirklich die M\u00f6glichkeit, sich wirklich zu entscheiden, da diese Waffen entweder gecraftet oder gefunden werden m\u00fcssen.\n\nStichwort Crafting. Das Craftingsystem im Spiel ist zwar vom Aufbau her einfach aber von der Umsetzung her eher umst\u00e4ndlich gehalten, da man viele f\u00fcr bestimmte Items n\u00f6tige Zutaten eher sp\u00e4t bekommt oder sich erfarmen muss, was in anbetracht des Schwierigkeitsgrades der K\u00e4mpfe im Spiel eher unmotivierend ist, Eine M\u00f6glichkeit, einige sp\u00e4ter zu kaufen gibt es zwar, aber nur die allgemeinen, die man wirklich in gro\u00dfer Zahl braucht. Alles in allem wird das System erst vergleichsweise Sp\u00e4t im Spiel wirklich bedeutsam.\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad der K\u00e4mpfe ist bis zum Lategame extrem niedrig. Viele Gegner und sogar Bosse kommen bisweilen nichteinmal zum Zug, bevor sie besiegt sind. Erst die letzten Bosse der Story, die meisten der [X]-Versionen der optionalen Bosse und die speziell f\u00fcrs Endgame vorgesehenen optionalen Bosse kann man wirklich auch als Bosse betrachten, einige sind sogar stark Genug, um die Gruppe ohne ordentliches Equipment auf einen Schlag zu besiegen. Hier ist dann massives Grinding und Ausskillen aller Klassenb\u00e4ume bei jedem Charakter gefragt sowie das Upgraden aller Ausr\u00fcstungsteile aufs Maximum. Das sind allerdings nur die Optionalen Bosse. Die Handlung l\u00e4sst sich recht einfach durchspielen.\n\nEin gro\u00dfes Manko sind die Dungeons, die einfach nur eint\u00f6nig und leer wirken.\n\n[b]Grafik, Soundtrack[/b]\nIch habe keine Ahnung, was einige Reviewer gegen die Grafik haben. Die Grafik ist minimalistisch und Cartoonhaft, allerdings passt dies recht gut zum Spiel, da es sich insgesammt wenig ernst nimmt.\n\nDer Soundtrack ist gut gelungen.\n\n[b]Zusammenfassung[/b]\nPro:\n[list]\n    [*]Nette Grafik, passend zur Stimmung im Spiel\n    [*]Guter Soundtrack\n    [*]Gegen Ende fordernde Bosse\n    [*]Minigames\n[/list]\n\nKontra:\n[list]\n    [*]Eint\u00f6nige, teils zu lange Dungeons\n    [*]Das Craftingsystem h\u00e4tte besser umgesetzt sein k\u00f6nnen\n[/list]\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\nAlles in Allem erfindet Crystall Story II das Rad nicht neu, ist aber trotz einiger Sch\u00f6nheitsfehler ein solides (wenn auch gro\u00dfteils zu leichtes) RPG f\u00fcr zwischendurch. Wer eine tiefe, ernsthafte Story mit Komplexen Charakteren sucht, wird hier allerdings entt\u00e4uscht. Wer jedoch einfach nur mal etwas zocken m\u00f6chte oder erste Erfahrungen, im JRPG Genre sammeln will, der kann hier ruhig zugreifen.", "timestamp_created": 1485113258, "timestamp_updated": 1485113258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28769724": {"recommendationid": "28769724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068628661", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514233861}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Eu acompanhei o desenvolvimento desse jogo no kongregate e estou contente por ele ter sido lan\u00e7ado na Steam", "timestamp_created": 1482965985, "timestamp_updated": 1482965985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28326975": {"recommendationid": "28326975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060991548", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481630071}, "language": "english", "review": "Going through a minetrack on the edges of the desert, sand worms and medusas all around\nI walk through the slightly random dungeon with my team, decked out with custom skills that I chose myself after sorting out gear and sending the item levels up with scrap I collected off the corpses of my enemies.\n\nMy team is currently a dragon who is a tank slayer hybrid, a thief who I'm pretty sure was supposed to be a trickster, that I reclassed into a healer instead.

It uses a turn-based battle system where the player battles using 1-4 characters against a number of enemies. In the game, the player completes quests as they travel through locations, accessible through a world map, with randomly generated layouts. As the player makes their way through locations they unlock more locations and side-quests. The game follows the adventure of D, a dragon who is sent to stop the evil witch Rita from releasing the Dargons into the world. Along the way, D gains several allies including Lina, Mari, and Kaz who help him to complete his quest.\" ( \"Crystal Story II: War of the Shattered Sky | Wikia.\" Crystal Story II Wiki, crystal-story-ii.wikia.com/wiki/Crystal_Story_II:_War_of_the_Shattered_Sky.

A bejewled-esque zombie killing event, and your overly-complicated lockpicking game.\n6: Good music for an indie game.\n7: Insanely reasonable price, especially since the game gives nearly 95+ hours of gameplay (or I must really suck at it)\n9: You can play the game entirely with your keyboard if you have no mouse\n\nCons.\n1: A low price for such a good game almost makes me feel like I'm stealing it.\n2: A crapload of grinding is required for before Rita.\n3: You'll spend so much time trying to have the cutest slime pet.\n4: In the end you have to spend a F***load of gold to buy weapons to turn to scrap to upgrade your endgame gear.\n5: AGI stat based combat turns.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this game is amazing, and worth way more than $2.99 american.\n\nLink to Crystal Story on Kongregate http://www.kongregate.com/games/lan14n/crystal-story?acomplete=crystal+story\nLink to the Creator's website http://emmanuelsalvacruz.com/   (he's working on a new game, I'd suggest checking it out)\n\nWith love, Xerrif & Wolf Striker\n", "timestamp_created": 1478749159, "timestamp_updated": 1478749159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26316808": {"recommendationid": "26316808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043809494", "num_games_owned": 990, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477220579}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 RPG \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0435, \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e.\n\n\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b:\n- \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0435\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 RPG Maker, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b (\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e-\u0431\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e), \u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c\n- \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u041d\u0435 \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043b \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c\n- \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0431\u043e\u044e. \u041b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f -

Parody on A+ titles, in almost everything - graphics, which looks like MS Paint crosbreeded with RPG Maker, clich\u00e9 story... But, and the word but should be written with BIG letters, this game surpasses many of today's A+ titles in gameplay and content. Bold statement? Definitely!\nLittle explanation for those who doubt. At first, it's the leveling system. Instead of EXP, you get skillpoints (SP), and you use them for upgrading your characters in the way you like. Next is crafting system - it works. You can make items, and most importantly, level them and thus increase their statistics. Simple, and throughout story progress more and more important. Last, but not least, are the minigames. Here is something, in which Crystal Story II surpasses most of the games published these days. Tower defense? Check. Card game? Check. Fishing simulator? Hell yes! Oh, and some snowboard racing done in retro style. All these minigames offers more enjoyment than games, which are constantly spamming my EXPLORE que. And are part of indie RPG, bought for almost nothing.\nConclusion - pleasant surpise for few bucks. Creators of this game,  thank you.

In all honesty I didn't think I'd ever play it very much if at all, but I wasn't going to use that amount of money for anything else. So to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I started to play is an understatement. The gameplay itself is fine, although not spectacular. It uses a combat style similar to games like Child of Light, where a bar on the side of the screen builds to your party's actions as well as the enemy's, making it possible to time stuns perfectly for heals. Overall it's not super difficult but you will need to be careful still, as a few bosses surprised me, but at no point did I feel the need to grind or like the enemies were overpowered, more so some being a bit too weak but nothing bad. The leveling system is similar to the FFXIII games, where you use points earned from battle to upgrade your character's stats and learn skills, giving you options for your branches after completing each one, meaning you can make any of your characters into anything you wish. The battle arena is a nice way to get these points easily as well as quite a bit of gold and useful items. The Achemy and Forging add even more depth to a surprisingly refined game for the price. The card game is enjoyable but simple, providing a distraction if you want a break from the battling. The lockpicking of chests is a nice little minigame, the Zombie Defense minigames are nice too. The fishing is also a good addition. Overall there is plenty to do, and if you get bored of the minigames or main quests you can accept quests from the Taverns for more gold, items, experience and new areas to explore. I seriously recommend this game to any RPG fan or anyone who'd like to try an RPG that isn't Triple A or mainstream, I got it for 1$ in a bundle and to be honest I'd have payed more for it having played it now.

You pick one of (trying to remember the number...) ~6 classes, which each gives different stat bonuses & moves, depending on the character in question. Once you complete the path of ~25 'nodes' you can pick another class to continue on. After completing 2 classes, you then pick from the original group again, except the classes are now Rank 2, and have new stat & skill rewards for the tree.\nAlso, every fifth or so node will give you the choice between 1 of 2 rewards, so you can actually vastly change your party as time goes on - I had one character receiving only Attack & HP boosts to the best of my ability, leaving a slow and powerful guy who's next to impossible to kill; I also made 2 characters focus on All-hitting attacks with high speed, so they can continually barrage the enemies with solid amounts of damage. The 4th character I focused on a range of magic abilities, so that powerful healing and damage could be carried out against more physically-oriented enemies.\n\n\nEnemies roam about on the field map, the standard 'don't want to battle, don't make contact' system; dungeons are broken into squares, with all the enemies per square acting as one unit - you make contact, you fight all the enemies on the screen as one. There's room to exploit this to find certain enemies for items, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\nStory-wise it's pretty standard, 'Save the world from a thing, slowly learn more about it' - it nicely frames the gameplay, and has some nice characters; nothing exceptional, but it all tends to work within the game's desired atmosphere. I've only finished one chapter, so it could develop far more than I've seen. I should add that the chapter end wasn't too hard-hitting or notable - indeed, I only noticed because of the achievement popping up!\n\n\nI'm not sure if it would get worse, but it has a few issues regarding simple grinding to break the flow of combat - once you unlock the battle arena you are immediately treated to a fight against several groups of weak enemies that yield a large amount of skill points, crafting parts and money in one go (enough to power through multiple nodes early on); there is no restriction to the number of times you can do this, so with each character having a Hit-All move, this can be quickly rushed through several times, granting far more rewards than it deserves to...were you patient enough this could probably see a person reaching end-game strength within a couple of hours, potentially. Obviously this isn't that bad, just don't do it - or do it,if that's your bag. Some people would probably call this a bonus feature.\n\n\nGraphically it is what it is, nothing really goes against the visual style you see. Some breaks and odd parts in various dungeons, but really nothing bad enough to warrant discrediting the game for it.\n\n\nWaffle waffle etc etc. It will at most be a few \u00a3s, and it's definitely worth it if the above sounds acceptable to you - I got it for 99p in a sale, definitely glad I gave it a shot; for me, it rivals a few chart J-RPGs I've bought in the past.

Ohh. So long as you're not planning to 100% it, you won't need to touch it more than once, but if you are, then prepare for a headache.\n-Debuffs only have a 25% chance of activating on bosses, and yes, that is annoying enough to get its own bullet when most of the enemies that you actually need debuffs for are bosses\n\nFinal Rating: Guys, it's $3 and I've logged 40 hours in the past two weeks.

After each battle you gain SP to spend into class trees which you can choose for each character. (for D i mainly stick with getting the most attack power possible, Lina for as much speed as possible, Mari in elementalist and healer, and Kaz with any classes with buff all spells.)\n\nweapons all have pretty similar stats but have different bonuses. A scythe i like getting for Kaz is the one that extends buff duration. you get 3 armor slots which are pretty much like accesory slots from final fantasy 13. instead of getting new equipment every town, you upgrade the equipment you have with scrap metal and gems. there are some armor peices that can be combined to have the effects of all of the original armor but in one slot. you can make a talisman that gives a 20% chance to resist all status ailments but to get that you need to upgrade 5 different status resistant rings like a slep ring to lvl 6 and have a rare gem to make it. you can make googles that raise your max hp and mp by combining breastplate 3 lvl 11 and trinket 3 lvl 11. all the things you can do with equipment in this game really interested me.\n\n+ humor is pretty good\n\nthere are references galore in this game. there was a joker reference from batman in one of the side quests at dustop and a reference from final fantasy 6 in one of Lina's lines when you talk to her in the first tavern. that were just some of the many references. there is just funny lines in the game if you aren't one for references as well.\n\n+ the game is just a fun time\n\nyea the main plot is that the world is ending but is sure doesn't feel like it with how many side mini-games and side quests there are. you can do whatever you want and that is the point of the game. like fishing? there is a game for it. like trading card games? there is one. like endurance battles? there is an arena where you can fight waves of foes you fought before and boss runs for side bosses you've fought. like puzzle games like bejeweld? there are defence side missions. there is so much to do especailly for a 3 dollar game.\n\n- graphics aren't the best\n\nto be expected\n\noverall i'd say it's worth your time and 3 dollars.", "timestamp_created": 1450924024, "timestamp_updated": 1450924024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19873501": {"recommendationid": "19873501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044953582", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451214958}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, WOW!\n\nThis game caught me off-guard; I didnt expect to see something so... well-made and polished.

Few games can say they have the level of depth and complexity that this one has.

Good soundtrack and this game has a level of humor that is honestly on point and never trully feels out of place or delivered at the wrong time.

Oh my god I am fully erect, and an RPG I love to death no less. I played for about six hours straight before forgetting about the game as it was on NEWGROUNDS, who the hell goes on newgrounds anymore?\n\nCrystal Story II is a final fantasy like RPG created by lan14n on newgrounds with help from a few other people, it got very popular rather quickly, and so Lan14n decided \"I could greenlight this on steam and make a bit of money off of this, that'd be very cool\" and now it's on steam for three dollars. Is it worth it? Yes.\n\nIf you want to know if you should buy the game play the newgrounds version for a bit, then decide if you'd pay to play this amazing game. I personally bought it because I love Crystal Story and I want to support it anyway I can. Please make a Crystal Story III PLEASE!\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple, it's what you would expect from an RPG. You walk around and do quests and such and sometimes you fight enemies. The combat is also, again, rather simple. You can either attack with your equiped weapon, use a special attack, use an item, or skip your current character's turn. Once you reach a certain level you can change your class, the classes you can change to are the same for each character, they are Slayer, Thief, Elementalist, Guardian, Healer, and Trickster. I will not go over what they do as I have not really experimented with it yet, even in my newgrounds playthrough. But that reminds me. There is also a \"skill tree\" I put quotes on it as it's not really a skill tree it just contains a bunch of stat boosts that you gain through SP which you get from killing enemies. Once you finish your first skill tree you can then change your class to one of the classes I mentioned before which will have its own skill tree which you need to finish before you can change classes again. \n\nCHARACTER TIME!\nThe main playable characters are: D, Lina, Mari, and Kaz.

It was amazing when I played it on newgrounds and it's even better now. Crystal Story 2 is the kind of game which you might consider \"casual fan\" before realising you've invested hours upon hours of playing it and trying to get everything. It's the type of game that beats all odds and exceeds your expectations.\n\n\n Story: ++++\n\nThe story of Crystal Story 2 isn't anything really unique. You've probably seen it before. Unlikely hero in a strange world finds a party of friends, travels the world and beats the ultimate evil. However, the developer acknowledges this and instead of trying to glorify it, he has fun with it, plays with various cliches and over-used tropes and ends up creating a very entertaining, fun story which...miraculously...even manages to surprise you at various points in the game. I won't give anything away but get ready to laugh, cry and go \"Awww\" in the most unique \"cliche\" story you will ever experience.\n\n\n Characters: ++++\n\nNot much can be said about the characters. They're your usual teen party that saves the world from the evil demon. You have the spiky haired, half-dragon protagonist, the over-excited rogue/thief, the broody emo and the over-emotional teenage girl. Throughout the game, you'll meet other characters as well, some of which were in the original crystal story as well. If you play that first, they're fun to run into and talk to, albeit, somewhat weak in combat.\nAlthough each of the main characters fills a specific anime trope, they all have debt and never feel hollow or uninteresting. Each time you stop in a town, you get to speak with them in the inn and explore their personalities a little more.\nThe game takes itself seriously but not TOO seriously. The characters perfectly reflect this.\n\nHowever, their team dynamic is the real focus here. These characters would be decent at best if solo. But seeing their interactions together is what makes this party so interesting. You can see they developr real relationships and have fun together. Their relationship is better developed than that of many high-budget JRPG parties out there.\n\nThere's also a robot side-kick you unlock after reaching Crystalia, the capital of the world. However, he never leaves Crystalia so he's as good as gone after you leave the place. His purpose is to tell jokes and change the character names. The jokes are puns. Hear at your own risk.\n\n\n Gameplay: +++++\n\nThe gameplay is rather typical. Turn based combat, various classes to pick for your characters, explorable environments and a variety of mini-games to play through-out the game. And yet, as simple as that might seem, it actually becomes rather complex and fun once you unlock your second class.\nThe characters get stronger as you play by acquiring SP (skill points) through combat and then spending them. This replaces the typical level system with a much better and way more fun class system. Each class has 5 levels and each level has a pre-set amount of stat spheres you can unlock with SP to make each character stronger. When you reach the final stat sphere, you unlock a secondary level 1 class. This repeats until you max out 2 level 5 classes where you can choose a 3rd level 1 class. This however happens either very late into the game or with a lot of farming so you won't ever be overpowered unless you are ready to grind.\n\nIn addition to the main quests, the game offers a variety of side-quests and mini-games as well. You can collect trading cards in the world and then play a rather addictive card-game at an inn. You can look for loot in fishing ponds. You can do bounty hunts before and after the games final boss. You can participate in various arena battles and get stronger. Or you can just shit back and enjoy the music from the inn's jukebox. There's no rush. The game makes it obvious it wants you to have fun and decide for yourself how you want to progress and when.\n\n*(Note: For any fans of the thief class, you should know that stealing in this game is also very rewarding. Some could argue it's actually essential to unlock everything but you can go through the game without worrying about it.)\n\n\n Customization: +++++\n\nThe game has a very rich customization system.\nYou have a weapon slot and 3 armor slots (which are practically for both armor and accessories). You unlock the armor slots as the game progresses.\nWhile this is straight-forward enough, the real focus of this system is actually in the upgrade system of your equipment. You can upgrade literary everything.\nAll items have levels and stages. Most start at stage 1, level 1. You upgrade their levels using money and scrap metal (which you can either buy, steal or find by killing enemies). Then, you'll be prompted to upgrade their stage using a crystal. So now you have an item stage 2, level 1 and you can upgrade it further.\nThis system is flawlessly designed.  Your items will never feel useless or weak because you can always upgrade them.\n\nIn addition to this, there's also an in-depth crafting system. What this means is that you can use your loot to create even better loot. Essentially, you'll be using it to craft your starting gear into stronger gear. So instead of using 2 slots, one for an MP trinket and another for an HP trinket, you'll combine them into 1 item and free 1 slot.\nOther than equipment, you can also craft items such as potions, elixirs and bombs. This process, however, becomes almost mechanical after a while since you'll never run out of the ingredients required for these items.\n\n\n World: +++++\n\nThe world is actually surprisingly large and rich considering the price of the game. You have a variety of towns, dungeons, secret locations etc. and you'll never feel like they're repeating themselves. There's also a lot of end-game dungeons which are practically the climax of the game. Even more so than the final boss. And, of course, there's an extra chapter after the main storyline ends which adds even more to an already surprisingly large game. I honestly can't believe how rich and well-made this RPG is.\nThe overworld is also well designed and feels nostalgic to old school RPGs.\n\nOne thing you might consider a drawback is that the towns feel practically the same. A hand-drawn background of whichever city you're in and a menu with which you can access the inn, the shop etc.\nOnce you reach Crystalia, the inn is replaced by a palace but that's about it.\nThe real difference between them is that later towns have more items available in the stores. However, after a point you won't actually care about that. Eventually you'll return to Crystalia every time since it's the only town that has your robot sidekick in it as well as scrap metal for sale. The arena and the card battles are all the same throughout all towns. The only reason to return to older towns would be to complete the bounty hunts and after that, you'll not be seeing them again.\n\nNot much else can be said about the world. It's vast, it's fun to explore, it feels great to be in it.\n\n\n Soundtrack: +++++\n\nThe soundtrack fits this game perfectly. It has everything. It's reminiscent of the bit era of music but it goes beyond that.\nEach area has a unique track to go with it both in the exploration and in the combat segments. This means that you'll never get bored, hearing the same track over and over again.\nThere's also specific themes that are made solely for the story segments.\n\nIn addition to all this, you can also use the jukebox present in every inn and listen to whichever track you wish (only requirment is that you've progressed far enough in the story).\n\nHonestly, this is the type of effort I wasn't even expecting from a game of this price. The music is practically a selling point in and of itself.\n\n\n Achievements: +++\n\n\nNothing noteworthy here. The achievements aren't anything I looked forward to earning.

Not a masterpiece in any sense of the word, as the story is mainly just for giggles and give you a flimsy reason to play, but the characters are charming enough, and the inclusion of the first game means there is a lot of content to be had.\n\nOf course, the game wouldn't be worth playing through the content, but CSII is a sublime distillation of RPGs and their battle system. There is always decent difficulty, but the challenges posed against you are always fair, and fair warning is almost always given when you may be going in over your head. You can blow through the main campaign rather quickly, but the real attraction here is the sidequests and the variety of boss monsters you get to face. There is a lot of wonderful loot, and the upgrade trees available through leveling are pure freedom, as you can more or less make each character into whatever strange hybrid of classes you like. This is the first RPG in a long time where I actually looked forward to battles, which is an admitted rarity these days.\n\nIf you aren't feeling a classic battle however, there are a handful of well-thought out minigames that break up the potential monotany. All are optional, but they provide a charming time and show just how much love the developer has for this game. There's a charming couple takes on match 3 gameplay just because, and there's a surprisingly thought out card game that you can check out whenever you want. Neither are perfect, but the card game in particular is deceptively intellegent in its execution, but simple enough to pick up. Honestly, if it was to ever be fleshed out more, it could make a decent standalone, though a bit threadbare at the moment. \n\nCrystal Story II is definitely a love letter. Flawed, fun, and evidence of a work of passion, its sense of humor and immense amount of content only began to wear on me around the 50 hour mark, and is a game I plan on finishing to completion somewhere down the road.

"english", "review": "If you're anything like me, you had a couple of dollars doing nothing in your Steam account and saw this game pop up either on a sale or just in a general search.\n\nSo, the question is... is it worth it?\n\nCrystal Story 2 is a classic-style JRPG about four unlikely heroes that save the... okay, it's not the most original story in the world. But the story unfolds in an entertaining, often humorous way, using cliches seemingly by design. This is evidenced by numerous references to other JRPGs of the past like Final Fantasy Mystic Quest and Breath of Fire. Ultimately, it wears the cliche hat proudly and doesn't try to be anything more.\n\nIf you're worried about missing something from the first game, never fear. The game comes complete with the first game included!\n\nThe gameplay style of Crystal Story is standard dungeon-crawling fair, either clicking your destination on the screen or WASDing your way around. Encounters are seen on screen and can be avoided a la Earthbound and Chrono Trigger, which is always a welcome addition. In addition to the main storyline, there are also numerous sidequests, often involving chasing down and taking out a boss monster. \n\nBattles are very fluid and fast-paced in this game. The way it plays out is familiar to anyone who's played a Super NES RPG. On the left side of the screen, you see a meter with every participant on it, rising to the top. Once someone's icon  reaches the top of the meter, they may perform an action. Again, pretty straightforward.\n\nOne of the ways this game excels is the level of character customization. While Crystal Story 1 features a mostly linear leveling system dedicated to investing points into learning new skills, Crystal Story 2's character growth system is almost bafflingly expansive. as you progress, you choose one of six class specializations, which opens up an experience tree. For each step on the tree, you invest an increasing number of experience points (or SP, in this game). These tiles can either be a set stat increase, a new ability, or a choice stat increase, in which you can choose which one of two stats to increase. \n\nThis seems complicated, but it truly isn't. The level up system in the game is incredibly intuitive and allows a ton of customization as you make your numbers go up in general. One minor complaint I have about the system, however, is that maybe it's a little TOO precise. Often it feels like more trouble than it's worth opening up the level up screen in the menu and distributing points. It's a slow and often flow-breaking process.\n\nThe game also boasts mini games such as a Pipe Dreams style lock-picking game, fishing, and a simple puzzle game which is nonetheless fun in and of itself. Even if the puzzle game in question basically comes free on most smart phones these days. \n\nAs for the music? It's fantastic. The tunes are incredibly memorable and really capture the mood of each scene. Even the simple opening title music has a way of sticking in your head sometimes. \n\nThere's not much to say about the graphics. They're fairly simple in a hand-drawn, anime sort of style. Storylines unfold via stillframe cutscenes which won't light the world on fire. That said, the simple style of the graphics makes it incredibly easy to tell where and what everything is at a glance, making the visuals intuitive and easy on the eyes.\n\nThe main storyline of both games are relatively short, but they both have a lot of post-game content to keep you amused.\n\nUltimately, it boils down to this: did I get 3 dollars worth of entertainment out of this?

A well written story. \nSo far I've been playing (just finished chapter 3, so maybe I'm still at the beginning), the story can be summed in \"There is a portal opening to Dargons's world, and the main characther dragon, must stop them\".\nOf course, most rpgs story can be summed like this, evil monsters are killing everybody and you, the hero must save everyone. The difference in a good rpg is that every character has a story behind, just like us, he seems real, and blend perfectly with his world. And while playing, he should evolve.\nHere there is nothing like that. Just some random character, no feelings, or psychology, the world too couldn't be faker, but worst of all, the dialogues between characters. they seems written by an 8 years old child.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1425052180, "timestamp_updated": 1425052180, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14675122": {"recommendationid": "14675122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170070521", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442696761}, "language": "english", "review": "this is an easy playable an challinge game i realy enjoied it", "timestamp_created": 1425042600, "timestamp_updated": 1425042600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14668920": {"recommendationid": "14668920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127041505", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425258638}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't play RPGs very often but this game is too good!\n\nPros:\nGood soundtrack\nGreat graphics\nDynamic class/upgrade system\nGood battle system (similar to pokemon but way better)\nDifferent modes and side quests\nHigh replay value\nLong storymode\nUnique Item system\nCheap cost :)\n\nCons:\nEnemies run at you when they see you and start a battle (As annoying as pokemon)\nSounds are a little glitchy (won't play sometimes)\n\nAs you see, the Pros are much more abundant than the Cons.\nEven if you don't like RPG's buy this game!!!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1424995256, "timestamp_updated": 1424995256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14643784": {"recommendationid": "14643784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161118967", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433426832}, "language": "english", "review": "You can kill zombies by playing bejeweled.", "timestamp_created": 1424845995, "timestamp_updated": 1424845995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14616812": {"recommendationid": "14616812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043220302", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462016344}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to admit I got a lot more out of this than I expected.

Wait...why are you telling me to steal from every single monster we come across until it's wearing nothing but a loincloth?!\" \n\"Practice makes perfect.\"\nStill has trouble stealing, even from sleeping enemies.\n\ntl;dr\nAnyways, this game is pretty simple for an RPG. It's a turn-based battle system where you can choose between attacking with your weapon, using skills, items, and delaying your turn. \nWhen you defeat enemies you get SP and most often items/gold, too. You use this SP to buy permanent stat bonuses for your character from their class \"line.\" It's not a branching tree with different skills to choose or anything like that, it's a simple line with occasionally a choice between one stat boost or another and some skills down the line. Once you finish the first class line  you can choose one of the other 6 class lines for \"Level 1.\" So if you were in the Slayer I line you'd get to choose to start Thief, Trickster, Elementalist, Healer, or Guardian I line. After your second line you go up to the 2nd class line so you'd have a choice between Slayer, Guardian, Healer, Elementalist, Trickster, or Thief II. Rinse and repeat. Keep in mind that you're not likely going to have access to the previous skills of any class for a character if you bypass it. So you might want to choose your classes based on which skills that class will get, but you don't get definitions of the skills until you're committed down that class line. \nDon't worry terribly much about stats, because those can be balanced with wearing certain equipment that you can upgrade with Scrap Metal and gems you come across. Scrap metal can be found in battle, stolen from some enemies, or later on purchased in a shop. \n\nThere's more to the game, but I don't want this review to be too long so in short there's a lot to this simple game.

Just a small tip for something I had a problem with when I started.\n\nPros\n-Low cost\n-Decent story, albeit very light hearted (I found it funny in places)\n-Good battle system\n-I encountered no bugs I can think of\n-Large multitude of mini-games for the length of the game\n-Offers post-game content\n-Colorful graphics\n-You get a pet slime!\n\nCons\n-The story could have been longer (but I\u00b4m biased about games being short).\n-Some things like upgrading are not explained, and it is key to the game, especially later on.\n-Post-game requires repetitive grinding.\n-Pet was useless in battle, as were some of the charge up moves (not scaled well here at all).\n\nThis game is fun, and worth the low price.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1424355281, "timestamp_updated": 1424355281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14540302": {"recommendationid": "14540302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052919417", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424305731}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f jRPG \u0441 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e\u0439. \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e, \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u044f \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b =) \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0436 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f 5\u0439 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044b, \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442 =)", "timestamp_created": 1424330550, "timestamp_updated": 1424330550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14540024": {"recommendationid": "14540024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136072592", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456321030}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00d3timo jogo, divertido, envolvente, simples e modesto adorei, recomento a todos.", "timestamp_created": 1424328058, "timestamp_updated": 1424328058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14532059": {"recommendationid": "14532059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179606443", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454797603}, "language": "english", "review": "Originally was nervous since I had never heard of this game before, but I absolutely LOVE IT!

If you do no like Final Fantasy, or others in this genre, then this game is not for you. The game runs smoothly, and the glitches are small, such as dismantling a talisman giving an amethyst instead of a sapphire. The story is present, and not horrible, but able to be skipped. It has a few easter eggs buried in here for those who look, but other than that the story is a basic JRPG one, saving the world from ancient disaster, all that kind of stuff. Playing the original browser game is uneeded to understand the story, although they do make some jokes for those who've played it.\n\nCombat is good, with higher level enemies and bosses needing a fair amount of planning to defeat. Most fights aside from the bosses are able to be avoided, and grinding is not needed until the post-game, if you play your cards right. Plus the battle arena makes grinding coming down to mostly skill. The boss fights are somewhat sub-par to FF standards, but the final boss meets this just fine. For the price, it gives a few hours of enjoyment, plenty of side quest bosses, plus a very challenging post game that really pushes you. \n\nIn terms of tips, the battle area x is great for gaining levels and items post game, plus the stat boost items when using dice. Never use alchemy for equipment other than weapons because you can find those as drops, and use the alchemy deconstruction on the start and last stat boost equipment to rack up as much scrap needed to upgrade weapons as possible. Pray to RNJesus for dice and other rare gear early on, Hold off from buying items in bulk until you get the 25% discount in the water temple, get only what you need until then. The locked blue chests contain rare cards, and the key is hidden in the final level, so don't stress yourself looking how to open it. Save rare items like elixer brews and rocket burst bombs for the final boss fight. Don't be afraid to have a charactor take a different class for a level, as gaining important skills, like buffs, is important since every charactor learns different spells from the same class. Debuffs can fail, and its best to use one with a speedy charactor who can cast them in rapidly to hope one lands on the boss (speedy thief is best for this).

It has a skill tree that is very much so comparable to that of Final Fantasy X's but I find it to have more options. The story is fantastic, but you can play Crystal Story II online on various websites, so why pay 2.99$ for it? Well, stated by the creator himself, giving reason to why this is worth the money though you can play it elsewhere for free; [quote=Lan] It has two major updates: the \"Deluxe Version\" and the \"Sword of the Fallen Dragon\" update. \n\n\n\"Sword of the Fallen Dragon\"\nNew chapter (Chapter 6) \u2013 Sword of the Fallen Dragon: A new threat has risen. Join the party once again as they investigate the strange mysteries that are happening on the Northern Orc Village.\nNew side quests -The Curious Thief: A pesky thief has been stealing items from the neighboring towns. The party is hired to catch the thief and return the items that were stolen.\nCard Battle: Collect cards and challenge foes to a Card Duel in an all new minigame.\nBattle Arena: Monsters line up to challenge your party in battle. Defeat them to earn prizes.\nPet Gifts: Your pet now goes on its own adventure while you are away and will occasionally give you its spare items. Remember to visit it while in town.\n\n\"Deluxe Version\"\n5 New areas and bosses \u2013 Five optional new areas and super bosses appear after you've beaten the game to put your party to the ultimate test.\nExpanded Armory \u2013 Rare armors can now be crafted, and equipment can be dismantled for components.\nExclusive Items \u2013 Discover secret items exclusive to the deluxe version throughout the game.\nBetter Sprites and Audio quality\nIncreased save slots and improved saving\n\nAlso steam features like achievements, cloud saves, trading cards, and no ads.[/quote]\n\nSo there are many reasons to buy it as is, plus it comes with the first game as an added bonus. Another good reason to pay the 2.99$ is to support the creator of an amazing game and all of his hard work.\nIf you care about graphics, then this isn't the game for you because it's graphics are minimalistic and sort of Anime-esque.

The intro combines Ys 2 and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Apparently Rita Repulsa has become a J-RPG villain, and it's up to D!ck the dragon to stop her. Along the way, D!ck is joined by Loops the thief, Fu Mario the sheriff, and Razzle the demon. Before you ask, yes I named these characters myself.  Over the course of six chapters, friends are made, monsters are slaughtered, and heroes...heroes...um...heroes do heroic deeds. \n\nCrystal Story II was conceptualized, designed, programmed,  written, and drawn by one person. He probably also made sandwiches and mixed drinks for the composer and voice-actors. I respect this dude's hustle; the game isn't bad at all either. A lot of what makes CS2 work is in its charm. It'd be easy for me to write up a huge list of J-RPGs and just say \"Play all these instead\", but CS2 has something special going for it. It's that certain nebulous quality that frustrates reviewers like myself; the kind who think \"If this game has this, this, and this, but none of that, then it is awesome.\" \n\nExploration is handled in a very banal manner. The first five chapters stick to genre conventions. There are dungeons, towns, and more dungeons, and the plot is the mortar that holds these bricks together (or was that vice-versa? Analogies are weird). Unfortunately, there's no real exploration to be done. When you reach a new town, you won't find anyone to talk to (unless they're plot-relevant). The dungeons? They're semi-random and divided into several rooms. The layout changes, but treasures stay the same. It's all very bland and dull but here is why I find it appealing: They're short! We all know what to expect when we enter a dungeon: monsters, treasure, and progress. I look at it like this, CS2 strips out the filter so I can focus on what matters. There's no wandering, no interruptions, no \"we should camp here for the night\" after walking two blocks. Bing bang boom there it is, fight the dungeon boss, and move on. I'll save the epic 3000 floor dungeons for another time.\n\nThe battle-system is comparable to Grandia. Never played it? Shame on you. Here's the gist of it: Ally and enemy alike are displayed on a time-line, their turn is next when their icon reaches the top. Simple attacks or item usage causes characters to fall maybe 1/3 of the way down the line, while powerful spells can knock them to the bottom. Status effects such as sleep or stun will keep them from moving up. Early on you'll gain a real appreciation for a high speed stat, because you'll be taking multiple turns for every one the monsters get. Also, by piling on status effects you can keep monsters from acting. For most of the game, this probably won't amount to much. However, expect lots of post-game bosses that'll wreck you for 90-120% of your party's HP if you let them get a turn. For the most part, battles stick to JRPG standards: Regular encounters are a cakewalk, story-bosses expect you to pay a little attention, optional fights demand that you know what you're doing.\n\nLeveling up is similar to FF13. There are multiple classes, each with their own abilities and stat-bonuses. Eventually all four characters will learn every ability, and you decide on who nukes and heals, who buffs & nerfs, and who stabs & slices. You'll want to specialize to get the most out of every turn. Also you can accumulate a ton of scrap to strengthen your favorite weapons and accessories. The system is basic, but well-done. \n\nUnlike far too many RPGs, Crystal Story II doesn't have a thousand flowery names for every item, spell, and monster you come across. A Healing Potion isn't called a Diffluebo, the Skeletons aren't Sticzis, and you don't cast Firagrammo, you cast Fire II. There are some out there who might cry foul at this, and make up some junk like \"names = world-building\". There is a time and a place for all of that, and you'll find neither in this game. This is something that I'm thankful for. It makes for an easier game to just pick up and play, since I don't have to quickscan a FAQ just to remind myself of which healing spell is which.\n\nAs the store page will tell you, CS2 has a handful of minigames:\n-Match three \n-Tower defense\n-Card game\n-Snowboarding\n-Hacking (?!?)\n\nThey're not astonishing in quality, and you'll find better versions in other games (possibly even other JRPGs), but they're amusing diversions. I never fussed with Plants Vs Zombies or any similar game, so learning and subsequently completing the tower defense mini-game was pretty entertaining. I could do without the snowboarding though, blech.\n\nHonestly, I'm shocked that I enjoyed Crystal Story 2 as much as I did. I was so quick to write it off at any moment, but a crapton of those moments came together to form 20+ hours. It doesn't hit the highs of other JRPGs, but it also doesn't have any of the lows. While I didn't get 3 hours of tremendous 1080P CGI cutscenes featuring D!ck the Dragon, I also didn't have to put up with 15+ hours of tortuous nonsense because some guy with spectacular hair and a goofy sword decided to take the scenic route. Aside from one short incident, everyone in your party are bros to the end. There's no shouting matches, and Fu Mario doesn't run away while crying \"WHY IS RITA SO MEEEEEAAAAANNNNN?!?\"\n\nIf you want a quaint little adventure this is a safe purchase.\nIf you love grinding (and who doesn't?!) this is a very safe purchase.\n\nI wasn't sure what I was looking for when I got this game, but I guess everything worked out. \nYMMV\n\nHoly smokes I never even noticed. The first Crystal Story is included as well. I'll have to give it a go sometime.\n\n\nBTW: What's wrong with saying D!ck? Is it so wrong to be named D!ck? What if I wanted to review Mary Poppins on Steam? I imagine that'd be pretty hard if I can't talk about D!ck Van Dyke.", "timestamp_created": 1423624571, "timestamp_updated": 1423685438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808114", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14424848": {"recommendationid": "14424848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059110622", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423336203}, "language": "english", "review": "+ classic battle mechanics\n+ simple and old school mechanics\n+ good character design\n- static monsters\n- No controller support\n- A little more art in the menus and options might have been good\nI actually recommend this game for those who like classic RPG or JRPG.", "timestamp_created": 1423607599, "timestamp_updated": 1423607599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14420566": {"recommendationid": "14420566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068744364", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423879589}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome RPG", "timestamp_created": 1423590479, "timestamp_updated": 1423590479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14416100": {"recommendationid": "14416100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053249951", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462013298}, "language": "french", "review": "Alors que dire de Crystal Story II ?!\n\n[u]Les points positifs[/u]\n- Une histoire plut\u00f4t sympa et accrocheuse ainsi qu'une pointe d'humour nous donne envie de suivre cette aventure.

The story is light and fairly predictable, but keeps your interest with quirky characters that do a good job both paying homage to and flipping cliche conventions. While not the most well-rounded around, the main cast is generally likable (Especially Lina, she's adorable and spunky without being overbearing or annoying) and the NPC's form an oddball cast that--while not terribly memorable--serve the purpose of keeping you entertained. \n\nThis is very much a game intended to appeal only to fans of the genre looking for a quick, light revisit to the old JRPG glory days. In that, it delivers wonderfully. Fans of old-school Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest and the like will find all of this wonderfully familiar, and should have absolutely no trouble jumping right in. For some, the 'been there, done that' aspect of it might be a turn off, but for me, it was exactly what I was looking for. A fun, accessible turn-based battle system, and a slightly unconventional level up system (you apply your points directly to learning skills or gaining ability points, rather than it happening automatically, with new paths unlocking once each is complete--it's basically a stripped down version of Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid), combined with the ability to both improve your equipment, and forge new adds much needed depth, and gives the game a spot on balance between easily accessible and customizable. \n\nIt's not breaking any new ground, but it's not really aiming to.

The art is well drawn, the animation is decent and the gameplay is great. \n\nTurn based combat can be quite the sticky thing, do it wrong and you have a boring game that's annoying to play. Do it right and you've got players enthralled and eager to beat the next boss. Crystal Story II has managed that amazingly well. Speed intergrates smoothly into the play and there's a handy bar to the left displaying when each character has his/her turn.\n\nThe weakest part of the game so far has been the story. It seems to be the old tired and true \"return the crystals\" routine, although admittedly I am (as of wrting this) only two hours into the game and not entirely sure if that is the main goal here. The plot isn't forced down your throat either, it's their enough to give you a drive in the game and the characters so far are genuinly interesting. It's a nice touch to be able to name them yourself too.\n\nIf you like RPG based games, or just want a fun way to spend some time, definitely try this out.", "timestamp_created": 1423352983, "timestamp_updated": 1423352983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14371597": {"recommendationid": "14371597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091120475", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425828381}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought it for 15% off so thats a bonus.\n\nI don't usually play RPGs, infact I haven't played one in a long time, but I was bored and bought this and its been fun.

Altogether, that's what the game boils down to.\n\nPlay it, however, and you'll find an intriguing battle system with four fully customizable characters and a plethora of equipment to buy and spells to learn.\n\nThe story really isn't anything groundbreaking, but come on, it was orignally a made-for-free flash game. For that standard, the story is far from awful and will actually keep you curious for a good bit.\n\nAccompanying the battle system is an INCREDIBLE soundtrack that seriously blew me away, even on the flash websites. Seriously, this guy needs a medal for his sound design, and you can listen to the whole OST in game once you hear each song once in game.\n\nThere is also voice acting (some, most of the game is told in text), which, while in my opinion quite good in battle, lacks a little professonalism in some of the cutscenes.\n\nWith a wealth of bonus content and games, the original crystal story (so you can see how much the author improved, that's honestly the only reason to play it), and a great package, seriously, jtus get this game and support guys like this.

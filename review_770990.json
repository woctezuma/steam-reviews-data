The sounds, the atmosphere, it was all nailed perfectly.\n\nThe attention to detail is truly something else, and I legitimately wish I could re-experience that moment again. This is something any fan of Blade Runner should check out. Bravo Mr. Lengele, bravo.

It's OK for what it is and it recreates some of the atmosphere, but there are a number of glaring issues with the demo:\n- The grain filter needs serious toning down\n- The DoF option needs serious toning down and improving (people's vision really isn't THAT bad ;) ) and needs to be more accurate in terms of focus points. It takes away from the realism rather than adding to it by making hidden surfaces trigger it.\n- The rendering jerks and stutters; most likely due to using oversized textures\n- The one interactable object in the apartment (a media station) makes the demo crash the moment interaction is attempted. Please fix!\n- As some other people intimately familiar with BladeRunner have remarked: if an accurate recreation was attempted, then it failed. If this was just meant to be a tech demo, then great!\n- It's a single apartment and some surrounding environment of the city and building. Despite this limited environment, it's a Gigabyte download -- that seems rather excessive.\n\nEven though this is free, and clearly a lot of work has gone in it to gather all the media and designing the environment, in its current state I have to give it a thumbs down.

To say that this is anything short of a fanboy's dream come true does no favors for BR9732. \n\nThis experience (because I don't feel comfortable calling it a game,) is pretty awesome. You start out in the elevator of Deckard's apartment, and you can walk through the hallway to his front door. Once inside you are free to do as you wish, such as interact with various items in his apartment, or explore the bulk of it.\n\nThis is an unfinished build in the developer's own admission, and at some parts it is obvious-- there is no unicorn origami in the hallway floor left by Gaff (depending on which cut of the film you watch,) there are placeholder items such as magazines and cans of Axe deodorant body spray. In other sequences it feels flawless and finite, such as the sample of music Rachael performed at the piano for Deckard while he dreamt.\n\nI am not one to nitpick, but being such a die-hard fan of Blade Runner does make it a bit difficult to oversee some of the flaws, as they remove the player's immersion factor significantly. Another absentee is one of the film's most famous elements-- Sean Young in her breakthrough performance as the Nexus 7 replicant, Rachael. I have followed the developer's blog for quite some time, and I have seen the renders of Rachael. They're quite impressive, so here's hoping she debuts in a future build of this. \n\nMy biggest complaint was the lack of interactivity within the apartment, though by the developer's own admission, it seems like object interaction will be included at a future date. It felt like a slightly guided tour of Deckard's apartment.\n\nWith those shortcomings aside, it becomes easy to point out the areas in which BR9732 succeeds. First of all, recreating Deckard's apartment in 1:1 scale digitally is no short task. If you spend more than a few minutes on the internet, you will find that resources on the original Blade Runner are incredibly difficult to come across. Some of the best ways to gain information on the film's production are through out-of-print hardcovers and the anniversary Blu-Ray discs. Considering these factors, it is mind-blowing the level of detail the developer was able to conjure from seemingly thin air, crafting a near-perfect replica of an iconic movie set.\n\nAnother area I'd like to commend is the sound design. From the ambient noise, to the music on the balcony, to the authentic sound effects in every room, it is clear that no expense was spared in recreating the apartment. \n\nThe biggest thing that impressed me was standing in front of Deckard's balcony, glass of Johnnie Walker on the ledge, with Vangelis' \"Blade Runner Blues\" playing on a loop. You assimilate the depression, desperation, and bleak curiosity of the broken detective and it feels like a noir film.\n\nAll in all, this could use some polish, but represents an incredible fan creation and landmark digital media from a franchise not known for being prolific.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515546648, "timestamp_updated": 1515546648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519296", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39220702": {"recommendationid": "39220702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090118360", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "last_played": 1515543349}, "language": "english", "review": "works with the oculus rift.", "timestamp_created": 1515546568, "timestamp_updated": 1515546568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39220120": {"recommendationid": "39220120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066061894", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1515543579}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent work!

Aber es waren doch 20 Minuten, in denen ich etwas gesehen habe. Es ist zwar kein richtiges Spiel, aber man kann sich ein paar Minuten, besonders als Fan, oder jemand der zumindest mal nichts zu tun hat mal anschauen. Warum man das vielleicht tun kann oder vielleicht auch sollte? Es hat sich ein wenig gelohnt und es ist kostenlos. Es ist nichts berauschendes, aber der Sound mit Headset ist wirklich extrem gut. Ein wenig Zeit zum Tr\u00e4umen...\n\n[b]Pro:[/b]\n+ kostenlos\n+ Sound ist mit Sourround echt wunderbar\n+ Blade Runner feeling\n+ man braucht keine VR Brille, um sich alles anzuschauen\n+ relativ fl\u00fcssig...\n\n[b]Contra:[/b]\n- doch sehr miese FPS f\u00fcr die Hardware die ich einsetze\n- Framerate auf konstanten 30fps (schwankt ab und zu auf 60-70 nach oben)\n- Grafik allgemein ist nichts super neues\n- nur ganz wenige Aktionen, die man t\u00e4tigen kann\n- viel zu kurz, habe zumindest mehr erwartet\n- und ganz ehrlich, warum kein Spiegelbild oder das man F\u00fc\u00dfe oder so sehen kann\n\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\nNetter Zeitvertreib und das war es auch schon. Auch wenn ich viele negative Punkte aufgeschrieben habe, gebe ich wie bei allen kostenlosen Spielen, Tech Demos und so weiter (die jetzt nicht internes bezahlen und so weiter haben - Ihr wisst wovon ich rede!) immer eine positive Bewertung. Es hat zwar keinen weiteren Sinn, aber der Entwickler hat sich m\u00fche gegeben. Dem einen gef\u00e4llt es mehr, dem anderem weniger. Es kostet nichts, es f\u00fchrt einen in die Vergangenheit, Blade Runner!, was will man f\u00fcr ein wenig Zeit, die Ihr sowieso f\u00fcr teilweise andere Dinge sinnloser verstreichen lasst, ohne etwas Geld zu investieren, erwarten.

This title has no substance whatsoever.  It has all the makings of something interesting--music by Vangelis, the Blade Runner cityscape, a neo-noir atmosphere.  But there is literally [b]nothing[/b] to do.  And to make matters worse, it teases you with meaningless interactivity (e.g. you can pick up drinking glasses or even a gun) but you can't do anything with them.  And even holding them requires you keep pressing the side button on the Vive wand controller.  \n\nSome might argue I am being too harsh--after all, this is a demo, not a game.  That's true, but it's still a boring demo.  The developers could have made other choices--a large number of demos do have some type of game mechanic.  They give you a flashlight and a gun--why not have you search the apartment for some files?  The developers also might have chosen a Walking Simulator mechanic providing some type of narrative or context.  Nope--you're just in an apartment.  \n\nThere is a lot of graphical attention to detail.  Of course the developers have ample material from the film(s) from which to lift.  I don't deny that this title looks good in VR.  The cityscape is especially well rendered.

Obviously, there are some legal issues here and the dev took some chances to bring us this experience and I can appreciate all that.  I even like Blade Runner, although, by reading the reviews, I'm not a diehard fan or a fanboy.  \n\nHowever, when I rate games I always ask myself is this game fun for me?  And would I recommend this game to certain friends or family (especially kids who might have different things that appeal to them)?  In this case, the answer is no to just about anyone.  In fact, I think the only people who would enjoy this experience are Blade Runner fanboys.\n\nIt's a nice environment.  It has lots of details in it.  Definitely, standing in the rain and watching the city go by has its momentary appeal.  But that's not enough to recommend the game.  There's almost no interaction in this game or experience.  Nothing happens.  You can get the piano to play a quick tune.  You can get the Esper machine to play a quick video.  You can open and close blinds.  You can pick up whisky bottles and glasses.  \n\nBut you can't pour it.  You can't drink it.  You can't even pick up the lit cigarettes.  The mirrors don't work.  You can only open one door.  By open I mean teleport in the apartment after grabbing the handle.  You can't grab most objects.  Even those you can, the physics are all wrong.  You teleport around, certain places are out of bounds.\n\nEven the rain doesn't look right.  The traffic doesn't look right.  Are those cars?  That cop car just loops.  Everything is a loop outside.  A very short loop.  You can grab and fire a gun.  But nothing happens.  I shot at the cop.  Nothing.  \n\nNothing is this game.  Nothing is this experience.  All fan service.  I appreciate what the developer did.  It's a labor of love.  But if your'e not a diehard fan, it's not worth the download.  I can't recommend this game other than to Blade Runner fanboys.\n\nRating 4/10", "timestamp_created": 1515373901, "timestamp_updated": 1515373967, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.247257", "comment_count": "18", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39169279": {"recommendationid": "39169279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086709488", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 1515373517}, "language": "english", "review": "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...", "timestamp_created": 1515373895, "timestamp_updated": 1515373895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 141, "votes_funny": 62, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848741", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39169167": {"recommendationid": "39169167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318780883", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1515373358}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful atmosphere and amazing balcony.", "timestamp_created": 1515373564, "timestamp_updated": 1515373564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472468", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39168623": {"recommendationid": "39168623", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988487699", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1515354098}, "language": "english", "review": "The balcony was amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1515371762, "timestamp_updated": 1515371762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506410", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39168579": {"recommendationid": "39168579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061228187", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1515371009}, "language": "english", "review": "Few years back I wanted to model Deckard's appartment to learn 3D modelling.

I think it is not fair to call it a \"Walking Simulator\", because it is more like a \"VR experience\". It features a truly unique set of original sounds, effects, music and props that will make you amazed at how much effort and love has been put to this virtual experience. From the illumination to the rain over the streets, you can feel the dark, noir atmosphere that was featured on 1982's cult movie.\n\nYou want to check your ESPER machine to review an overlooked crive scene? Just turn it on and hear the original dialogue.\nMaybe you are in the mood for shooting with your official LAPD 2019 Blaster. Just take it and pull the trigger to release some steam!\nDamn, you can really (and I mean, REALLY) play the piano on Deckards apartament, as every single key features its own sound.\nOr my favourite part, you can just walk to the balcony and watch a true, living representation of LA as it was pictured in the movie, complete with japanese ads and flying cop cars.\n\nEverything for the absurd price of... zero pennies, because it is completely free.\n\nIf you are a diehard fan of the movie, you will absolutely love this. Give it a shot and enjoy a well deserved day off from hunting down those Nexus 6 Replicants.\n\nP.S: If the author reads this, you totally should make a version of this jewel as a SteamVR Home environment.

The ambience really shines with the \u201cVolumetric Lights\u201d enabled.\n\nTip: Once in VR mode, before using the gun to start the experience, hit ESC right away and configure the settings from your monitor to adjust fidelity in VR before proceeding otherwise you will start in the \u201cFantastic\u201d graphite mode and likely really low frame rates. Enable \u201cVolumetric Lightning\u201d for a better experience.\n\nNotes: As of writing, \u201cDept of Field\u201d seems to cause major blur in VR mode and visual artefacts in 3D mode and should likely be disabled if you experience these symptoms.\n\nAlso noticed that the game doesn't always keep the settings and if launching VR mode after the game is started the settings need to be readjusted so doing so before using the gun to start the experience is recommended.\n\n\nExperienced on: Oculus Rift with Touch on Windows 10 64-bit using Intel i7-960 paired with 12GB RAM and a pair of 780 GTX (only one enabled by default in this game) in a 2.1 x 2.0 M (about 7 x 7 foot) room setup. \n\nOn this older system I was able to use 1920X1080 resolution in the \u201cFastest\u201d mode without hiccups and the fidelity in the \u201cFastest\u201d mode is still good.\n\n\nTo the DEV: Other than minor visual glitches (scaling is sightly off \u2013 the size of the coffee machine in particular was weird) the walking mechanics caught me off-guard when I started walking thought the bed. As a side note I am also not sure how the walking animation is triggered.\n\nAlso noticed that the sound of the gun was really loud which is expected but did not depend on where it was placed in the environment. The volumetric Lightning also did not seem to change when closing the blinds of the windows.\n\nP.S.

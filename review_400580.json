If you want a game that constantly keeps you on your toes and is a good challenge, you'll get it. This game kicks my butt every time I play it, but it's fun enough that I keep coming back.\n\nThe cases aren't bad and are done pretty well. The cases repeat, but there are so many variations, you'll never know who the culprit(if there even is one) is until you investigate. Although some cases have very little time to solve them, if you don't get a lead almost immediently, you'll never have enough time and you lose points. Although, that is rare. One issue that I had was the cases come so rapid-fire that's near impossible to solve them all unless the RNG is gracious.\n\nI don't know if it's just me, but the characters were \"meh\" to me. I honestly had a hard time caring about any of them and felt like they detracted from what's important. Whether you got to know them or not, it usually didn't seem to matter too much in terms of the plot. I think the developer couldn't decide whether to make a dating sim or detective game, so it's both shoved tother. I have to admit, I skipped most of the text in the game because I just didn't care about it. I didn't really feel like my choices mattered and didn't care to get to know the girls, so I would just tune out.\n\nThe boss is hard. It took me about 5 tries to get to the boss, a 6th to beat it. Overall, it was pretty fun. It'd give it a 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1516080616, "timestamp_updated": 1516080759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39379900": {"recommendationid": "39379900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993404712", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1333, "last_played": 1516067508}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, sooo - honest review time.\n\nThis game overall is good for an experience. \n\nPoint form:\n\nUser Interface: 4/10. I will touch on this further later.\nMusic: 4/10. It's not bad, but it is really simple looping music. \nCharacters: 7/10. I liked -most- of the characters in this game. I'll touch on this later too.\nArtwork: 5/10. Okay this needs elaboration too, so again it's below..\nStory: 8/10. For the most part the story is good and makes sense. There are a few loop holes even after doing every single option in all paths, but that happens in most games.\n\nIn depth:\n\nAlright first off the negatives, let's get these out of the way.\n\nFirst and foremost the thing I found MOST annoying in this game was the inability to save per day. This was annoying because as a completionist of otome games, I not only had to make several game files but there are other reasons this is annoying too. [spoiler]I had to do it all TWICE with a second set of artwork, too! As I didn't know that was a thing until much later.[/spoiler]\n\nSecond most annoying to me is regarding the final boss. [spoiler] Miss Talmage has seriously too much health for such a simplistic game mechanic. Not only can you not double up your minions at the end (so you really only need one) but this mechanic makes it pointless to do anything but level up a single character. Since aforementioned you cannot save whenever you like, and I wanted to make sure I had all CG's I had to defeat Talmage at least 15 times due to mistakes and missing cutscenes along the way.. In fact this got to be so annoying that for the final few paths I straight up looked up how to cheat stats. It didn't help the ding-noise as you counter-attack her though, so I turned off my speakers, held down control at the boss fight and clicked the same thing a thousand of times... It was seriously that annoying..[/spoiler]\n\nThird thing was that I did not like that besides paying a ton of attention, you could not find the traitor just by how they were acting. You do get an option later on that lets you pick the traitor if you choose to - but, the first playthrough the only reason I found out who the traitor was (Althea in my case) was that I'd intended to go down her path first. Like I said, I do like MOST of the characters in this.\n\nFourth point is another spoiler. [spoiler] Mallory is heterosexual. Great, then why is she in this game? Look, I'm sure most of us that like girls have played with a girl who is bicurious and turns out to be straight, but the fact of the matter is... Most lesbians don't like straight girls. They might find em cute to look at, but it's such a turnoff since you can't tempt a unicorn forever. I hated her path. It was necessary in order to easily get the secret path as well - but I don't want to play a romantic visual novel where a character doesn't like something that the MC can't really change about herself. Just a pet peeve of mine. [/spoiler]\n\nFifth thing I need to mention is that you will need to complete this game with two sets of artwork for all of the achievements. If that wasn't the case, I wouldn't have bothered because I didn't like the art style at all. The cg's either, honestly speaking. Which brings me to the last topic/kind of ties in with it.\n\nLast negative I want to touch on is the artwork. I'm an artist... So I don't feel like my critique isn't fair in this case. You can change the art styles in the menu, but dear god, if you don't care about achievements, don't bother. I seriously don't know who was commissioned to do the artwork in this game, but I hope they weren't paid very much. The art is awful, seriously. The type of art that you would see in free-to-play games, bad.  The art style in the non-default set also looks like someone painted over pictures they grabbed from the internet, because none of the characters look the same when they're animated, also the proportions are seriously off. Uncanny valley. The only good thing I can say is that in the CG's Thais does look pretty, but I hated every other piece because of how bad the proportions were and lighting. There was no continuity to the style at all.\n\n-----\n\nOnto the good things?\n\nThis game will give you a solid two to four days of playthroughs if you don't skip through text, and you're an average speed reader. It's got a solid 8 endings. I say 8, but there are actually more like 10 if you include the failure endings. There is no credits screen either, so that's awesome due to how fast it is to see who did work in this game, if you care to. If you like card-type games, this game is probably going to appeal to you. \n\nThis game isn't quite a kinetic novel, but it also sort of is. What you do can only mildly influence the story. There are 3 events that are absolutely going to happen no matter what, unless you fail the game, so it's similar to a kinetic novel. If that's your thing, you might like this game a lot.\n\nI also liked the fact that there is a CG viewer, although now that I've completed the game I'll probably not play this for a very long time, I like that If I wanted to - I could go back and view the artwork from it. The art that is set to default is beautiful, and all of the cg's are quite nice in that set as well. So there's quite a bit of \"pretty girls\" in this. That was what motivated me to get it.\n\nOverall would I recommend this game? Yes. If it's on sale. It might be worth buying at full price for some, but for me - it's was not worth 20 dollars. 10-15 seems more fair, given the amount of content, and actual playability of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1516069824, "timestamp_updated": 1516070019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39340699": {"recommendationid": "39340699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261066527", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "last_played": 1515942275}, "language": "english", "review": "only just started and the first case i found item but dident have enough time to finish arresting people and falsy harrassed someone my reputatio nwent down fast lol.. game woulod be better if it was RNG every game but i love it its amazing", "timestamp_created": 1515942532, "timestamp_updated": 1515942532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38851537": {"recommendationid": "38851537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069330741", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514623078}, "language": "english", "review": "So I like this game a lot, but there is one thing that just ruins it for me...the difficulty.

The gampeplay and style is wonderufl, I just wanted more to go with. Like:\n\n-I would have loved to make my own conspiracies, to suit my own agendas.\n-I would have loved to use the Red Mask Society more fully. \n-I would have loved random events that threw a wrench in the works (ex: oh, the closet is locked- because that girl you harassed for no reason got really ticked at you, and jammed the door. Or because two students are making out in there.\n-I would have loved random supernatural of sci-fi occurences to pop up (like, the girl you sent into the steam tunnels developed faint powers. I always laughed imagining Thais harassing a student, only to find them unnaturally obedient. Or Vonne shadowing a student, but finding herself LITERALLY shadowing them. \n-I would have loved for the girls to change based on how you statted them. For Thais to appear more dominant, Rowan to appear more... Stealthy? Darker, more plain clothes. For Mallory to look more friendly, if possible (I also would have LOVED to see what happened if you made her more dominant. Haha). Not even big changes, just subtle things to say \"yup. This is me now.\"\n\n\nBut honestly? I love this game.

Each mini mission is a little mystery of it's own, which while they each follow a set formula that you eventually get used to after seeing the scenario enough times, still is interesting to see if you can solve the mystery in time and who's behind it. Each of your 5 minions has stats that help them stalk, intimidate, interview, and persuade students as to not cause trouble and reveal important secrets that might jeapordize the reputation of the school. You'll sometimes have to expell or suspend a student (which so far I don't see much of a difference in game), though you can try and use detention or persuasion, but sometimes even then a student simply won't listen, and you'll have to discipline them.\n\nThere's also a lot of mystery involving the 5 main characters, your minions, or fellow student council members under your leadership, and the school environment. The characters each have their own unique personalities, and one of them is randomly selected each game to be a traitor in your group. They each have their own motivations, and it's up to you to find out who's the one sabotaging the council's work, earn their trust, and deal with them how you see fit. But the story doesn't end there either, that's only the beginning of the rabbit hole, the plot goes far deeper, even I haven't fully unraveled the mystery yet, but I'm hoping to when I get a full playthough.\n\nThe game also has a custom mode where you can design your own 5 custom minions with randomized stats, change their looks, and play the basic investigations for up to 16 weeks. While this mode has no traitor, it's fun if you like challenging yourself to solve the common issues that plague the school with your own custom designed and named students.\n\nFor negatives, my only negative is that the rules aren't always 100% clear, it took me a while to realize the symbols on the left of an option were your stats, vs the one on the right which were theirs. For example, stalking isn't about having a higher stalking score, it's about having a stalking score higher than their perception, and part of questioning a student is about your perception against their stealth. This could have been made clearer with a tutorial, but after a little while you get used to it. You eventually start to get the hang of it.\n\nI'd definately recommend this game for any fans of visual novels, strategy games, or mystery games. If you're not sure, wait for it to go on steam sale, but I personally found it was high quality, full of replay value, and kept me on my toes every time I played. Worth every penny to me.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1498289601, "timestamp_updated": 1498289601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32007506": {"recommendationid": "32007506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001656726", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495925363}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't think Black Closet is a bad game. I mostly enjoyed my time with it. That said, I do find it has some pretty severe issues. It's similar to a a graphic novel in terms of length and writing quality, yet it's painfully short of good artwork. It's very short- which is good in that it doesn't overstay its welcome, bad in that I feel it doesn't quite justify its list price. It has a promise of replayability in its randomly-generated gameplay elements and different paths, but the game's core gameplay of handling cases becomes repetitive well before you even finish your first playthrough, killing all my interest in giving this a second playthrough- which begs the question of why even make randomly-generated cases in the first place.\n\nI don't regret playing this game; I think its positives outweight its negatives, and I had a good time overall. Its writing is pretty good. I just don't think it's worth the asking price; I'd be happier if I'd picked this up at 50% off.\n\nOh, and if you want to buy it for the Yuri elements? Don't.

BEAUTIFUL. \n\nHowever, fair warning, you can't have a romantic involvement with all the female characters in this game. I think that's fair to say, since it's the kind of game in which you would expect romance in all its routes but nah. It's impossible to get a romantic ending with many characters. Some might be straight, some might be too young for you. The point is that a good ending with one of the characters isn't necessarily a romantic ending.

Part visual novel, part strategy/management/detective game. It's that team management element that really helps Black Closet stand apart from the crowd, and it's quite enjoyable.\n\nIt is rather unforgiving though. I've played through it twice now, the first time I got a game over by having too low of a reputation after failing multiple events. The second time I found the option in the menu to change the difficulty down to \"Easy\", which helped immensely in my ability to actually progress through the full game. At the end however, I still ended up failing as I did not manage to complete a particularly difficult and crucial mission within the game's alloted timeframe.\n\nHowever I enjoyed the time playing and intend to go back and try again now that I have a better idea of the kinds of skills I will need to focus on for my \"minions\" aka student council members. That's arguably one of the strong and weak points of the game: lots of trial and error, and sometimes there are head-scratcher moments where things just work out differently than you had expected them to.\n\nThere is somewhat of a random element to the experience as well, ensuring that each playthrough is never quite the same as the others, though the randomness is only to a point because you will start to pick up repeating patterns after awhile in some cases.\n\nThe visuals and music are both well done, and like most of Hanako Games' releases, the presentation is top notch for this genre.\n\nIf you're looking for a VN with a bit of bite to it in the difficulty levels, or just one that has some unique gameplay elements to it, definitely give Black Closet a try.", "timestamp_created": 1487547107, "timestamp_updated": 1487547273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30026316": {"recommendationid": "30026316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052178797", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490340692}, "language": "english", "review": "In this game, you're the head of an anime-style absurdly powerful student council out to ensure no harm comes to your boarding school's good name, whether that be girls starting the place on fire or political riots on campus. You must rely on your five underlings to carry out your orders, but one is a traitor.\n\nWhat follows is an engaging game where you simultaneously must manage your minions effectively while looking for clues as to who the turncoat could be. Gameplay is randomized, but in a good way- you might get the same \"case\" (i.e. \"Somebody's starting a secret society\") twice in one playthrough, but the solution might be different (stalk and intimidate members into disbanding, discover a slave trading ring on campus, find out it was all a harmless prank). The girl who's the traitor is always different, too, meaning you can't just look it up in five seconds but must suss out clues from their performance in the field. It's a bit like being a police chief, except your most powerful tool for getting rid of miscreants is expelling them, not gunning them down. It grounds the experience a little. I kept being reminded of the distraous This Is The Police, which aimed big and fell flat on its face. This one keeps the scope smaller and more contained, letting it deliver a more focused experience. Make no mistake though, it's not as short as you might think- the game initially lulls you into thinking you just need to catch the traitor in a little over an in-game month, but there's much more to do and more petty criminals to apprehend.\n\nThere's a surprising amount of replayability, since the tratior can vary and every one of your loyal or disloyal minions has skeletons in her closet, and a few can be courted for some (TAME) girl-on-girl sweetness. Even beyond that, the game lets you set up custom campaigns with your own created minions after your first playthrough.\n\nIn conclusion, the mini-mysteries are engaging, the visual novel style interactions with your underlings are well-written, and you can beat the game (kind of) by seducing the final boss. This is a short, neat game I'd recommend for those who like managing limited resources and solving mysteries. There's a surprisingly meaty game here.

Overall, the game is decent if very repetitive by the last third of the game or so.  It's missing like... 4-5 more case types.  Also, I'd love to see more continuity between cases outside of the main storyline cases and maybe the ability to recruit more minions over the course of the year.\n\nThe tutorial could have been a little bit longer or certain mechanics explained a little better (Loyalty, for example, was something I never figured out on my first playthrough)... but with that said, getting over that learning curve seems to be intended for your first time through so... meh vOv\n\nThe Traitor section does not last long enough and gets resolved very quickly which kind of threw me when you look at the focus it gets in the game's blurb.  Also, it's a game over if you pick incorrectly, which is definitely a missed opportunity.

You run the student council at a prestigious all girls school. The store page labels it as a yuri dating sim, but so far I haven't seen much of that. What you should be paying attention to is the brilliant investigation mechanics. Each day of the week you assign each of your \"minions\" to do something, be it interrogate another student, investigate a location, search for an item, etc etc. These encounters play through much like a tabletop RPG or board game since they are all decided with a die roll and stat bonuses.\n\nAll of the cases are randomly generated. This includes the perpetrator and even the people in cases, meaning you'll never have the same case twice. On rare occasions, cases will even solve themselves, some might think this is kind of a dumb thing to have, but I like it. logically, a school can't have that many mysteries without some of them just being coincidences, and the game can get very tight with time even with these self solving cases\n\nThe plot was interesting with many paths to follow, but my favorite part so far has been the introduction of a traitor. One of your minions will occasionally fail on purpose and in general try to stop you, but you have no idea which minion this is and you are put on a clock to find them or risk losing the game entirely. \n\nAll in all, I found the game to be very well done, I'd highly recommend it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1486636846, "timestamp_updated": 1486636846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29787179": {"recommendationid": "29787179", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998827138", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479395736}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a mix of Adventure/Visual Novel with a board-game style detective game.

In this newest release, you take on the role of Elsa, the newly elected class president of St. Claudine's (a private girls' school), and it is your job to solve various cases presented by students and faculty. Otherwise, scandals could break out and ruin the school's reputation and/or the students' trust in you. Along the way, you learn that there is a traitor among your minions (one of five students who will help you to solve cases) whom you have to discover and either you can befriend them or expose them. \n\nOf course, there is more than simply solving cases and such. As there are five minions who will work for you, there are five paths that you can pursue. Three of these are romanceable while two are more friendship paths (although it's interesting to see what unfolds if you try to pursue romance with those paths). Although I enjoyed trying out all the paths, I preferred the friendship paths but this may be more of a personal preference than anything else.\n\nIn regards to the gameplay, I enjoyed it very much. I loved solving the various cases given and even when you may be given the same type of case, it may not be solved in the same way as a previous playthrough. Thinking through the cases and finding out the best and most efficient way to solve them is key to earning the best case grades and accompanying skill points with which you can use to train your minions to be better at certain skills, such as observation and stealth.\n\nThere are a total of 16 achievements that you can earn so there's definitely a lot of playability to be had in Black Closet. Also, there are two art sets (for both CGs and character sprites) so if there's one that you prefer over the other, you can choose to your heart's content. Even after you earn all the achievements and finish all the character paths, there is still replayability to be had. There is a customized mode where you can add in and/or design your own minions and determine their skill values and set the number of weeks within which you wish to solve cases. \n\nBlack Closet is such a wonderful game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Hanako Games or even if you're a fan of VNs and life sims. There are VN aspects in this game as well as the element of solving cases. It's a great game to have and I have to say that now I'm having difficulty determining if I like Black Closet or Long Live the Queen, as the latter was my favorite game before Black Closet's release. ^^", "timestamp_created": 1484983596, "timestamp_updated": 1484983596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29373585": {"recommendationid": "29373585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970563863", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486643162}, "language": "english", "review": "It's your final year at St. Claudine's and you're the president of the student council. For some reason this involves a lot of questioning, harassing students, being in charge of detaining, suspending or even as last resorts, expelling them and breaking into their rooms. Every few days you're assigned new cases which can be as simple as students losing stuff, to runaways, illegal moonshine stills, food poisoning, etc. \n\nTo help you in this you have a bunch of minions. Match their strengths to what's required out of the case. Some cases are more complicated than others, like you might need to uncover two test sheets in two different students' rooms, or interrogate 5 different suspects to assemble a picture of what actually went down then mediate between the offended parties. Sometimes you dont need to do a thing, but not resolving a case doesnt give you training points, and failing a case badly can be costly. With training points you can make people multitaskable, or you can push some minions into ludicrous skill zones, both of which are useful. Raiding the supply closet can help you with skill boosting equipment. Dont mind all those sedative syringes in the closet.\n\nAlso one of your minions is a dirty filthy traitor! It's up to you to examine their performance, like if they're failing simple tasks and their success rates are far below everyone else's. That's just one of the long term goals you're working towards. \n\nYou also have direct character interaction with your minions, building up their loyalty with outings and meetings. You may even romance one of them! Or remain platonically friends, no judgement here! There's very little minion to minion interaction for better or worse. This part of the game is where the VN heritage show through.\n\nAlso you can play with the game's original artwork but ahahahah why. The only thing that bugs me about the current artwork is Vonne's freaky side eye. Otherwise it's all pretty lovely and/or functional. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed it. I'm not entirely convinced the visual novel and the minion management parts of the game mesh together well, but it's still enjoyable mostly. It's RIDICULOUSLY HARD though even on easy, but it's probably because I chose to SMASH THE SYSTEM which is the hardest of all the routes.

I played 4 games for a total of 11 hours and bought it for $10.50.\n\nAll in all I'm happy that I got it, but it's one of those games where it's difficult to recommend to people unless it's their particular cup of tea.

I expected no different from this title, and as always, Hanako Games delivered. I'm happy to declare that [i]Black Closet[/i] is a wonderful combination of an investigation/source management game with a truck load of stories and intrigue attached to it! If this sounds like your cup of tea, you really shouldn't even wait for the rest of the review. Go for it! For ones who'd be a bit more skeptical and wish to take note of a long list of praises, you are welcome to keep reading.\n\nIt's the beginning of another school year in the highly prestigious all-girls academy of St. Claudine's. Daughters of the rich and the famous are taken in from a young age to be properly educated in all manner, to guarantee a position of power for their future here, and it is going to be your job to keep them in line for the rest of the year. We are to take the role of Elsa, a senior high-schooler and the president of the student council, with a seemingly bright future ahead of her. Sadly, that can change any minute now in St. Claudine's! It is going to be our trial to keep the girls of St. Claudine out of trouble, investigate a mystery or two, and while doing so chase some yuri romance path as flavor. Don't be deceived though; the scene of power starts early here, and any scheme could end with a ruthless execution if you are not careful!\n\nOkay, it is basically [i]CSI[/i] meets [i]Gossip Girl[/i] with a touch of [i]The Tudors[/i] out there, so it might be useful to describe some game mechanics up front. You'll be given five minions to run through cases with different skill sets. Each week, there will be random cases, varying from a student struggling to keep her grades up to investigating a gambling ring in the school premises. The game generates cases completely randomly based on some basic templates, yet no mystery resolves the same as before. You'll be expected to investigate these cases by inspecting the area, talking to parties involved or resorting to some unsavory harassment tactics to gather information. Nothing will be beneath you, since you'll never know who'd be an innocent victim or who'd be a bored scammer. Your minions possess 4 investigative stats - social, intimidation, stealth and perception. For each action, you'll be required to make skill checks - a total of the attaining minions\u2019 relevant skill, any item bonuses and the dice roll - opposing the required difficulty of the action, defined by all other relevant condition. Each resolved case will reward you with skill points, and each botched case will present... results. There are 2 other parameters that you should keep an eye on: school reputation and council karma. When they get low enough, you'll face real problems.\n\nAside its investigation gameplay and various short stories revolving around the cases, the setting itself is a rich melodrama. Each of your minions do possess a distinct personality with background, traumas, aspirations and struggles. They'll respond to you based on their characters and the way you've been treating them, and others around them. It is a challenging feat to keep everyone happy, when your own friends carry majestic egos themselves. Oh, and there will be a randomly picked traitor in your group in each gameplay too. So, good luck with each story path already. You'll be given the chance to befriend one of your minions a bit more closely than others in each gameplay, choosing her route to pursue her either as a close friend or a romantic interest. Combined with random case progression, this build presents you an incredible replay value.\n\nThe game comes with 2 different art styles - one sharp cornered, contrasting photo manipulation, one soft curved manga depiction - and both are simply gorgeous. As you play, you can acquire certain CGs in both art styles to complete a gallery containing depictions of possible important events. There is no voice acting, but the written narrative is so elegantly presented, you won't be actually missing any voice hanging around. Soundtrack is very simple and a bit repetitive, yet brilliantly fitting to atmosphere also. Oh, did I mention achievements yet? Yup, and some are a challenge to acquire, demanding multiple gameplays.\n\nNow my long list of praises is complete, please feel free to go ahead and purchase the game. Waiting a sale would help, yet it shouldn't be mandatory with this kind of quality in narrative, gameplay and replay value. You won't be disappointed if you've played anything from Hanako Games before hand.

Really god damn good actually.  \n\nThe best part of the game, in my opinion, are the characters (duh). They seem lifelike, have complex motivations, and their character develops in interesting ways. I really enjoyed learning about what makes them tick, and felt tempted to do their routes more than once. \n\nThe actual game-game, the cases mechanism, is\u2026 Good. I had a great time with it over the first 20 hours of playing, and only now it\u2019s slowly getting a bit repetitive. The system itself might seem challenging, but once you get the hang of it it\u2019s hilariously forgiving on normal difficulty. As long as you show restraint and send the right people, you should have no trouble solving most of the cases. It\u2019s just a shame the game shows everything it has to offer (game-wise) way before you do all the character routes.\n\nSo definitely a recommendation from me.

I was intrigued at the prospect of solving mysteries and finding a traitor sounded fun as well. It had promise, but I think it fell short.\n\nFirst and foremost, to quote a Dangerfield joke you \"don't get no respect!\" I felt more like a dungeon master with a shaky weekend group than the student council president. I understand the need to build personal relationships with these character since romance is a big thing. I also understand some characters being frivolous or self-absorbed, but due to the rather strange loyalty mechanic you spend more time appeasing your minions than getting their respect. You are a dating sim protagonist and it just so happens one of the romance options kind of, sort of, maybe wants you utterly destroyed.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, your options for resolving cases can be confusing. I've googled this issue and I know I'm not alone. You can have evidence of wrongdoing or know the issue, but still fail because you have no idea which button will solve the case. For instance, I investigated a clear-cut instance of a student being envious. When persuaded she just whined (success), harassed she admitted envy (success), and the game establishes early suspects will only offer what they wish to questioning. The only option left didn't make sense: Stalking. So I failed because there's no 'send to the school's counseler' option.  It also sadly doesn't help that the tutorial doesn't explain the uses of suspension, detention, or expulsion.\n\nThird, the random elements are nice for replayability, but it makes prioritizing nearly impossible. Any given case can resolve itself or be terribly important. This suits realism to some degree, but when you're managing multiple health bars, loyalties, and skills it can be a striking detriment. Did you waste time on an open window maintenance should have noticed and now someone is down a flight of stairs? Them's the breaks. This also links to my second point. I tracked down a girl in the city to an ice cream parlor, but instead of calling the local authorities when I lost her I was given another day to try again. I failed by only a few points, which is understandable, but no other choices? Try again or fail the case. I tried again AND failed the case.\n\nFinally, all these things came together to make this more of a frustrating experience than the joy Long Live the Queen has been. It was an admirable effort and the excitement of investigation is there, but the characters and resolutions are abrasive to folks like me.

I just constantly had issues with the logic, the general gameplay, and even the story fell flat. The first of many problems is that for the first part of the game when you need to spend time with your council members, all the cutscenes mean NOTHING. They will be the same cutscenes no matter who the traitor is so that bit of \"finding out who the traitor is\" is just lies. On top of that I actually thought the in-between cutscenes where you spoke to the teacher and other people was important....nope. No matter what choices you make, how you make them, and for what reason you make them, is completely irrelevant to the game. Also this whole \"finding out the traitor\" business is somewhat lied about too. They tell you in the beginning the EXACT way to find out who the traitor is. That is all good but when the 'middle' of that section of the game happens and you get the cutscene with the teacher asking you who you suspect at this point is very misleading(in my opinion). I knew for a fact based off the evidence I had seen who the traitor was but when I told the teacher she said I had ZERO EVIDENCE. Sadly this is only the first part of the game and for me it was extremely frustrating trying to cope with the crappy \"cases\" and trying to figure out what the purpose of the cutscenes were. The rest of the game afterward is 100% trial and error. You will NEVER be lucky enough to get through the entire game first time without some form of guide giving you tips or just flat out telling you what to do. Even when cases recycle(as they will because the students in this school are absolute devil children) they can't be solved with the same steps every time and there were MANY times where a case went cold, ended, and it turned out to be a scandal and I lost reputation and karma for it.....thanks game. Don't get me wrong either, I tried EVERYTHING the game gives you for options but it still doesn't progress at all leaving you with just a middle finger in your face. As mentioned previously: the game's story falls flat too. They seemed to try and make it edgey or something but it just comes off as...sorta desperate. It seemed like after the traitor incident they just kinda struggled to keep up good writing(what little there was). It just saddens me cause I felt like the idea had potential. Regardless of the artwork I still kinda pictured it in my head as you're the student council president at an anime school and you gotta solve the problems that come up....with ACTUAL problem solving...which was of course shattered the instant the game began :'c\n\nOverall my experience with this game was very frustrating just like it was with Long Live the Queen...and how fitting that it be people who took part in the making of that \"Little Girl Death Simulator\"    2/10", "timestamp_created": 1468047028, "timestamp_updated": 1468047028, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464852", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24141593": {"recommendationid": "24141593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003381569", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469486504}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely addictiing gameplay, with tactical portions (assigning skill heavy girls to specific tasks to not fail).\n\nYuri love (tasteful).\n\nHigh quality art and very nice sound.\n\nFrom the Devs who did \"A Lily Princess\" (which I also have).\n\nClever dialog not the usual tropes for a VN esq game.\n\nYou solve problems like (and I don't personally see this as  a problem) one of the girls is posing nude and sending out her pic.

I love the setting, I love the art, I love the characters, I love the writing...\n\nThis game is set in a high class boarding school for girls. The main character is the president of the student council, who delegates her council to complete covert missions to keep the students in check. The characters on the council are as trope-tastic as the setting, but the writing works really well for someone like me who loves these tropes. Here you will find the playgirl, the quiet one and the diva, amongst others. And yet I found myself interested in every single one of  these characters, even though they felt kind of familiar from the start. I think this might be because I really, really enjoy the tropes the characters have been based around, but the writing of the individual characters really is strong. I also suspect that the great visual design helped. Every last one has an interesting look that is distinguished from the rest of the cast.\n\nAnd the game has a few flaws.

In most games of this sort (if there were very many of this sort), you could safely bet anything that crosses your desk represents a time-bomb waiting to be defused.

Because it's set in England.\n\nBlack Closet is a game where you order your minions to stalk and harass schoolgirls, join cults and manipulate everyone around you. Think I'm exaggerating? I'm not.\n\nConduct investigations into various cases around an all-girls boarding school. Forged test results, secret societies and lesbian love affairs are just some of the cases that you may be assigned. Each case is randomly generated and can have a different outcome, making each playthrough a unique experience. There are aslo special cases that can result in a game over if you fail, so make sure your minions are properly trained.\n\nThe other side of this game is a basic dating sim. It doesn't have to be a romantic relationship, but you will get a choice of following one of your five minion's storylines early in the game. This part of the game remains the same, but characters will have different responses to your different dialog options. The only major things that these affect are mostly whether you end up in relationship with your chosen character. Otherwise, this whole segment doesn't have a huge impact on the game other than sometimes affecting the loyalty of your minions, which really only comes into play at the final part of the game.\n\nYou have the choice of five lovely ladies as your love interest.\n\nAlthea - The school floozy.\nThais - The prissy posh one. Well, posh-er. It's a private school, so you know.\nVonne - The token childhood friend character that is so devoted to you that it borders on creepy.\nMallory - The cute, bubbly one. I think she's American or something.\nRowan - The shut-in. You know, like the one that's in every anime ever?\n\nTheir stories develop the more intimate you get with them. Typically, the story arc wraps up when you acheive maximum romance. Your reward for this is a single picture of your own character and chosen love interest giving eachother a big ol' smooch. So, those of you who want to buy this game purely for that (and we all know that some people do) you have your work cut out for you.\n\nAt the end of the day, I reccomend this game. A nice blend of strategy and mystery, easy to get in to and a decent story. Plenty of replayability so you'll definitely get your money's worth, especially if you grab it in a sale.\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about the game, read a real review.

It's not a game I think EVERYONE will love, but if you're a fan of detective games with good plotlines, you will definitely be happy with it. It seems simple at first, but you'll quickly realize how difficult it is to keep all of your karma and reputation intact. The dating portion is pretty solid, taking on the feeling of a good visual novel style of game.\n\nThe case aspect, for me, is a bit difficult - not only realizing what needs to be done in some cases, but I also don't understand the case rating system. I've failed some and gotten a C, and solved one in two days (that could have ONLY been solved on day 1 by gambling that I'd interrogate 3 characters successfully) and gotten a D. I think that would be my biggest concern in gameplay, because otherwise, I'm digging the stats and D-20 system.\n\nThey've added tons of replayability, with different story paths for different choices, 5 romance options, case endings differentiating, and randomizing the traitor.

More girls you have, the less you need to take notes and memorize every possible case. You can also completely screw up the story and find yourself in a personal hell. Oh, did you put all the training points in Intimidation for this girl?

You are given a team of student countil members to help you maintain order and reputation at the school.\n\nThe first third of the game features your interaction with your board members and your attempt to discover the traitor amongst your team. Finding the traitor isn't necessarily difficult -- the traitor will tend to perform less adequately than your other team members. Otherwise, however, you get to interact with the team, and through this interaction you learn more about who they are. The characters themselves are relatively deep and well constructed; I think the art is a bonus in this regard, as it serves as another means of discerning how they act and what their personalities are.\n\nThroughout the game, you will be attempting to solve \"cases\", which are events that occur at the school. They represent typical happenings at a boarding school: vandalism, missing persons, etc. The overall breadth of possible random events is not very big -- you will face multiple repeats of past events. Luckily, the outcomes of the events change. For example, in my playthrough, I encountered the \"cheating\" event multiple times. One of the times, it turned out to be a cheating ring led by multiple girls; however, another time, it was merely a coincidence. Thus, you cannot assume the outcome of the events, even if you have played the event before. Nonetheless, you do fall into some patterns with the events -- for example, with a certain event, it eventually becomes obvious that it is more important to search for clues at key locations rather than interrogate the suspects. Nonetheless, it manages to stay entertaining throughout the play experience.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very interesting, with opprotunities to ponder statistics and strategies of handling the events. Rarely do you have only one event occuring at a time; thus, time management is a crucial aspect because each of your team members can only investigate one location or person at a time. Thus, there are some times when you may need to perform a cost benefit analysis to determine whether one event is more important to investigate than another, or if one event is a decoy that does not threaten the reputation of the school. Additionally, each of the student government councilors are better at certain actions over others, requiring specific thought as to who is best to assign for missions.\n\nThere are romance subplots in the game, and they are decently well executed. One complaint about the romance sub plots is that those dialogues will completely eclipse most other interraction with your team members, meaning that you lose the opportunity to learn more about your other council members. I assume this is to add to the replayability.\n\nSpeaking of replayability, I think there is significant room for replaying the game, as the events themselves are constantly changing. The traitor is also random, so you do not know who is sabotaging your investigations. Each playthrough will take a minimum of three or four hours, so it isn't a terribly long game, but the replayability is a factor working in its favor. The game itself is reasonably difficult as well, providing enough of a challenge to remain interesting.\n\nAs mentioned, the artwork is certainly aesthetically pleasing, as well as the music and sound effects.\n\nThe real quandary concerning this game is whether it is worth the price listed. I procured my copy for approximately $12. While that feels just a tad too high of a price for this game, I certainly do not regret the purchase, and I believe that developers who put forth the effort to create a quality product should be rewarded. If the price drops to $10 or less, this is absolutely a game I would recommend without question.\n\nIn closing, I do recommend this game in most aspects. The lack of a large pool of possible events is a little unfortunate, but otherwise I find it to be an engrossing game that features unexpected needs for strategic thought and statistical inference.

The one major negative for me was the fact that the gameplay doesn't at all build on itself/prepare you for the endgame challenges.  You get a tutorial on solving cases, and just as you're starting to feel like you've gotten the knack for those in your first playthrough, you're getting near the end of the game and finding that you lack the appropriate stats to handle the plot-advancing cases.

Black Closet is developed by Hanako Games, which you may know from another game of theirs, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/251990/]Long Live the Queen.[/url] Black Closet packs intense and tactical gameplay with great storytelling, and I have yet to see a balance like this in other games. A heads up though, you may enjoy this game differently if the game play, as described below, isn't really your thing. The game also isn't easy (but there are options for that!) so there is definitely a learning curve.\n\n[h1]Thoughts, game play wise:[/h1]\nIn Black Closet, you play as the student council president of a prestigious girls' boarding school. If solving mysteries and [strike]power[/strike] is your thing, this probably already sounds interesting. Naturally, you have a lot of obligations and work to do though. The game play aspect of the game focuses on solving mysteries - if you succeed, you maintain your position, but if you fail, there are consequences, often long lasting. The game is a lovely combination of stats raising, resource management, and you must use a good combination of your skills versus your \"enemies\". \n\nEach case is randomly generated - if you play the game long enough you can kind of figure out some approaches to solve the cases, but they will not be the exact same. I loved how this game kept me on my toes the entire time, and it was the greatest feeling whenever I was able to solve a case on my own (felt lucky, oftentimes). Like real life, sometimes you will have a large amount of work dumped on you, but often there's actual scandal or dark intrigue involved (hopefully unlike your real life job).\n\nOverall you will need to keep track of your \"minions'\", which in this game means other student council members under you, and their stats as well as their loyalty. You then send them on different missions, which often don't take just one turn to solve, as you will have to gradually unravel mysteries, and battle using stats and dice rolls. So you'll really need to think tactically as there are all sorts of constraints against you, making the game really exhilarating to play. By the way, you could die as student council prez. You could die a lot.\n\n[h1]Thoughts, story wise:[/h1]\nYes, there is very rich story in this game. Everything is a mystery that you have to unravel - the cases you solve are mini stories in themselves, but there is also lots of main story line, which is about the school, your minions, your past and present, and other secrets. There are character routes for each of your minions, with multiple endings for each. I've played two whole routes and some partial ones, and each one had me emotionally invested as well as hooked. Each girl has their own past, sometimes intertwined with yours/ Elsa's, and the writing is amazing. I was playing Vonne's route, and felt emotions that I rarely feel in real life... It's very rare that I see a game that has such good story but also mind blowing game play, so this combination definitely earned Black Closet a games of the year spot for me.\n\n[h1]Other things to know:[/h1]\nThe replayability is very high for this game - apart from trying to get each character route which takes many playthoughs, you can also start custom and random modes. You can amp up the difficulty, and choose to focus on just solving mysteries if you so wish. You can even upload custom character pictures! If you can think of something to do in this game, Hanako Games really got our backs for this title. The game ran flawlessly for me, and I didn't experience any performance issues at all.\n\n[h1]Ending remarks:[/h1]\nI highly recommend this game, for the game play as well as the story. I personally found nothing bad to say about it, which is quite rare.

Actually achieving that goal requires a successful term as president of your school's student council, and achieving that goal requires putting the lid on several potential scandals without damaging your own credibility too badly. Let me tell you, there are a [i]lot[/i] of potential scandals, and other forces at work may end up making your life more difficult. But first you need to identify and neutralize the traitor within your ranks...\n\nBlack Closet is about solving the mysteries in your school. A few times a week, one or two new cases will be brought before you, and it's up to you to get the bottom of them before they erupt into a scandal that could damage the school's reputation (maybe). Each of your minions has their own stats (which can be raised with point from successfully solved cases), and picking the right minion for the right job is critical to your success. Your targets have their own stats, and your minion can only get the right results if their stats are higher than their target's. Complicating this is chance itself - a twenty-sided die that adds a random number of points to each participant in a confrontation. Failed encounters during harsher actions like harassment or detention will make you look bad, as will targeting an innocent person. You have two bars measuring your success - School Reputation and Council Karma (measuring the student body's opinion of the council itself). Letting either fall to zero is a game over, as the higher-ups of your school will be all too happy to sacrifice you to save their own skins.\n\nThere's definitely replay value in Black Closet. The most obvious is the romance paths with each of your five minions (two of which have an a path and a b path), and it's only through these that you can completely unravel your minion's characters. Cases are randomly generated except for the big storyline ones (which can still have variations between them), and many cases start out similarly but have very different solutions. The traitor is also randomly chosen (though players who have beaten the game have the option of selecting the traitor herself), so targeting the same person in every playthrough will rarely work. And of course, if you just want to solve mysteries free of plot-involvement, there's a custom campaign mode that allows you to create your own minions and work on cases alone for a set number of weeks (though careful! That mode has its own special challenges).\n\nMusic and graphics set the mood (and please don't ignore art style 1 when it comes to CGs).The writing is solid, as it needs to be for a game like this and as it typically is for a Hanako Games product. Characters may seem like simple at first, but each have their own personalities and motivations which become clear in their own routes (and makes how any of your minions could be the traitor feel natural). And of course not everything's serious - sometimes humor is found where one least expects it.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1446045757, "timestamp_updated": 1446045757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18600535": {"recommendationid": "18600535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009802063", "num_games_owned": 2527, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 1584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445737986}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

A TON of replayability. Intriguing charachters, interesting scenarios. Easy gameplay/controls. Addicting game. 4.5/5 \nWorth the $20\n\nThe \"Meat & Potatoes\" Review:\n\nThe game play is superb. What can I say? Great graphics, solid sounds, comfortable and addicting gameplay. Very much like running the mafia....except at an all girls school! You have minions, traitors, harassing, interrogating and more. An absolutely fantastic detective/mystery type game with solid elements of Simulators, Strategy Games and even RPGs present. Fans of Long Live The Queen will enjoy this game quite a bit. There really isn't much to tell you about this game short of \"it's actually worth the full price!\" This has certainly been one of the best games I have played over the last 6 months. Games like this are precisely why I enjoy PC gaming more than console gaming. Almost a truly perfect game, just falls somewhat short as I can concept running a little thin after, oh, 40-60 hours of gameplay or so. That is NOT bad at all. This gamer hesitates greatly to give out a 5 to ANY game, this one falls JUST short.

Having to make your way through a school year and make defining choices each day is hardly a new concept, especially after playing Persona 4. Leveling up character stats to pass random RNG skill checks is a pretty staple mechanic. Having multiple story paths dependant on choices, and throwing in a random mystery traitor into the mix... a lot of VNs do the same thing.\n\nYet it all molds together to make a pretty original and exciting premise. And the replay value exists because of how well the random aspect of the game is handled. You solve cases by uysing your characters to question/ investigate/ harrass/ stalk and persuade the matter to a conclusion, which in turn saves your school and council reputation. As the game progresses you encounter situations requiring more out of your characters 4 skills, and that is where you must plan ahead so as to not lose the game by crashing on the caseload you receive.\n\nIt is true that there probably needed to be a lot more variety to cases. Meta knowledge of the game could probably make it a bit trivial toward the end. And the random traitor aspect needed to have more variables to make it more tricky and defining.\n\nOtherwise, this is a solid niche experience, that really should be as popular as LLtQ.", "timestamp_created": 1445170529, "timestamp_updated": 1445170529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18463815": {"recommendationid": "18463815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182521258", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445045738}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is toothsome.

(I am lousy at games and appreciate this feature.)\n\nThere are multitudes of tiny details that go differently even in playthroughs that seem similar.

I'm still a little leary about recommending it at it's regular price point but it's not a rip-off or totally unwarrented either.\n\nThere's a lot more reviews doing a lot better at the overall picture so I'll emphasize the main thrust of the game: time management and mystery solving.  The nice thing about the game is that they're actual mysteries, it's not always suspect X or the same solution every time.  You have to use logical deduction and the skills of your minions to solve the cases. This can be a challenge when you include the possibility of a traitor, cases that literally aren't worth your effort, and a real crunch in the time available to you.  Solve a case quickly and well and you'll get some precious skill points to improve your minions skills.  Fail and you can face a nasty hit to your 'life points' (school reputation and council karma in this game) loss of minions... or nothing at all since some cases are essentially red herrings.\n\nThe story is... better then average but that's not saying much.  It kept me interested in various characters and mildly intrigued but it's not worth getting the game for.  Still, I'm impressed by this relatively rare game focus and recommend fans of mysteries and logical deduction put it on their watch lists.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1444547210, "timestamp_updated": 1444547210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18407155": {"recommendationid": "18407155", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972361170", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474940459}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed Long Live The Queen, you'll enjoy this game. \n\nI haven't even come close to beating a run in it yet (Assuming a game lasts one school year I got about half way), but from what I've seen this is a solid game. While your investigation checks do use rng, It's mainly based on your stats. Those can only be raised by completing missions, and the amount of stat points you get are based on how effectively, and quickly, you complete a case. This, combined with multiple cases, and your 4 minions having a fatigue bar to manage, and the game is quite challenging, at least so far. \n\nLike Long Live the Queen you can fail a skill check (and in this game cases) without getting a game over, though you have to maintain your school reputation, as well as that of the student council, so the more quests you fail, or the more inappropriate actions you take, the sooner you're going to fail the game. \n\nI haven't fully figured out the optimal strategy yet, but the game is a lot of fun. The RNG element is also great, since it prevents this game from becoming the mindless walkthrough game some people thought Long Live The Queen was. \n\nAs far as cons for the game go, I don't have many. I think one of the cons I have is sometimes the RNG is brutal. To give an example, I got a case that should have been open and shut. A girl stole another girls watch, after saying she was interested in it. I searched her room and found evidence the girl had the watch, and she acted suspicious when questionsed about it. However I failed to get a skill check that passed by enough to actually pin the blame on her. This escalated to the point where she stole from 5 more girls, and tanked the school reputation so hard, that about a month later my game came to an end.\n\nAt the time of writing this I've only played about 3.5 hours, so I haven't seen if that type of quest difficulty is common, though the fact that level of rng can exist is a little annoying. \n\nBesides that unlucky rng though I have no real complaints about this game. \n\nWith multiple character routes, I believe you can get at least 20-30 hours of content from this game, possibly more if you fail a lot while learning the mechanics.

The randomly-generated cases work well with a surprising amount of variety in the possible outcomes, and the resource/time management aspects of creating tension and leading to interesting dilemmas regarding who should be sent where.\n\nThe story and dialogue gets a bit melodramatic at times, but it feels appropriate for a game about conflicts between high school girls at an all-female academy. I enjoyed the character development that I saw (I didn't complete everyone's story arcs), even though most of them start off as pretty standard archetypes. To me, at least, the constant stream of cases does a good job of alleviating a major issue with visual novels: every playthrough is unique! The standard \"pick these options to go down this path\" setup still exists, but the player isn't just fast-forwarding through the rest of the game during subsequent playthroughs.\n\nTo be honest, Black Closet is a tough sell at full price; it's a fascinating concept that's executed reasonably well, but it doesn't feel meaty or polished enough for $20.

Game of the year! \n\nBut in all seriousness, this game is very well written, complex, and immersive. Ive never played a game with a romance sim undertone, where you were a dominate female. Usually in a F/F romance setting your almost always submissive and loyal, almost to a fault... not this game. It puts you in the roll strong female lead that commands respect both on the job, and with her romance choices XD. It handles the somewhat taboo themes with extrodinaire taste, that is a real joy to watch unfold. Your not so domineering that your crushing your romance options spirit or mind, your simply being the master and commander, they swoon at the knees for.\n\nOh... and then there's the actual investigation/gameplay. Its pretty fun and engaging, it doesnt really get old like you might think it would, the random elements and the variety of options on how to solve the case, keeps it fresh\n\nOne little complaint is the difficulty. It can be unforgiving at times, even if you know what your doing, which the first time you play, you wont. The random hand of fate can turn into a fist and swing the entire game into a doomed scenerio, so save often... not that you CAN. You can only save at the end of each week, which is a real pain, when you have to go through scenes and even dates over and over again if your trying to tip toe over failing a crucial investigation. \n\nSpeaking of early on difficulty, there's a traitor in your team, and the way you deal with it requires you to A. Befriend them by going on outtings with them so they feel to guilty to betray the team. Or B. Figure out whose the one failing on purpose through trial and error (you'll have to do that anyways to find out who they are.) and then EXPEL them from the school, and thus expelling them from the game!  SO you'd have to finish the game with only 4 henchmen, not 5, each one bringing vital skill combinations to the table. This wouldnt be such an issue, if it wasnt for the fact you dont have enough outtings to fully befriend more then 2 people, so I recomend saving after the first week and if its impossible for you in other saves AFTER figuring out who the traitor is, going back and making sure you fully befriend them as well as your romance interest of choice. This is actually alot of work, so this game isnt just a tip toe through the toolips, it requires throught and planning.\n\nBUT those are just minor annoyances, that Im not sure if I would even want to change, but their there.

You solve cases/puzzles through various actions like a nice and friendly talk, or you just detain people until they break. Its just like your classical overthetop anime since you have almost as much pover as that girl from killakill.\nThe cases are randomly generated and actually quite hard to figure out sometimes.

It starts of with the information given at the start which is pertty much not more than I have given until now. No mechaniks, no Stats, basically nothing gets properly explained, which leads to a lot of trail and error at the beginning. Also the VN part could be a little more informative before, since even though this is a Lesbian Romance game you cannot romance everyone. Two of the girls are actually underaged and therfore not openly romancable, since the image of the school wouldnt allow it to begin with, which is a great touch of realism, but it needs to be said at the beginning. I started the game 2 times hoping to get my favorite girls and boom, you're to old after 2-4 hours, go fund yourself. Also one of the girls is only romancable if she was the traitor, and the chances for her to be one is actually lower since she is a pretty hard opponent.

It's hard even on easy when you don't know what to do when first playing. Definetly some good mysteries in it and gets engaging to play when you're in the mood strategizing and solving mysteries. Highly recommend it if you love your strategy games added with a bit of detective simulator type work. \n\nAlso forgot to mention...you can date anyone of your student council members...and yes there is some cute/sexy art with the two together if you play them out right. So enjoy ;)\n\n*Spoiler sorta*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst big mission they give you when starting the game is to find the spy in your group of \"minions\" and you can call them out on it when the time comes OR you can comfront them and try to change their ways (I didn't know this at all at first). It is extremely helpfull to have every single member of your student council with you but also not neccesary as I'm still progressing through the game.", "timestamp_created": 1442503236, "timestamp_updated": 1442503236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18071703": {"recommendationid": "18071703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032120166", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495039575}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game before the steam release so I've got a lot more play time than what's on record here. \n\nIn short; You're the president of the student council at a prestigious, girl's only, boarding school.

You play as student council president Elsa Jackson, who is tasked with quashing scandals and keeping up appearances in a sophisticated all-girls' high school. Also on the Council to assist you are your minions: popular flirt Althea, her stubborn and opinionated sister Tha\u00efs, naive newcomer Mallory, unusually competent Vice President Vonne, and antisocial Rowan.\n\nEach week, you receive a couple of cases and have to assign your minions to various tasks, such as questioning witnesses or searching crime scenes. The girls have different stats that will determine their success or failure when executing their assignments. In the background, you also have some overarcing plot cases to solve; one of your minions is a traitor, and you have a limited amount of time to figure out which girl it is and deal with her in one way or another. And then there are the outside enemies that your advisor, Miss Talmage, alludes to, such as a mysterious group called the Red Mask that seem to know lots of things they shouldn't, such as where you sleep.\n\nIt's a rather difficult game, difficult enough at times that you can tell it's made by the same developer as Long Live the Queen, but there are tricks to learn that make it easier, and the game also includes an easy mode (which was not included when I initially played waaaaay back in the pre-Steam days, but am happy to play with now). The mysteries are interesting, and your fellow council members are all well-developed. Elsa is somewhat unique in that you get to choose everything she says (from a visual novel list of options, of course), and what you pick will affect her characterization and what your minions think of you, especially if you're on a romance path.\n\nAnd the art and soundtrack are both beautiful. You actually get two art sets to choose from, the original art set and a new one that was added in later versions of the beta. Truthfully, I prefer the first one and am not sure why the second one gets all the focus in screenshots, but both have their merits. (And you have to earn CGs in both art sets, so you'll be seeing a lot of them either way.)\n\nUpon completing the game you unlock custom minion mode, which lets you create your own council and is rather fun to play around with. You also get the ability to choose who the aforementioned traitor is at the beginning of a normal game, which makes things easy for completionists.\n\nAll in all, another excellent Hanako Games title and well worth your money to pick up.", "timestamp_created": 1442461897, "timestamp_updated": 1442461897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18063911": {"recommendationid": "18063911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104326428", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444852377}, "language": "english", "review": "Black Closet is an intriguing game that piqued my interest because in addition to solving mini-mysteries throughout the week you have one major overall case to solve in order to figure out who is sabotaging your Senior year.

You can romance them to flesh out their full story line or just stay friends. \n\nThere's also a secret society and your college applications to worry about along with your love life.\n\nLike \"Long Live the Queen\", it did take me several play throughs before I successfully graduated and found out the saboteur.  There can be a lot of things to juggle at one time which can be overwhelming at first. And like LLTQ I was interested in the story line enough to want to replay to get all the CGs and achievements.\n\nThere are 2 art modes to choose between.  There are 3 difficulty levels.

While there are a set number of case types there are a large number of variations in the solutions to each case, so that you canplay an entire game without seeing a case variant repeat. Even once you've managed to learn all the different case variants there is no way to tell which variant youre dealing with until you begin investigating, making each case a race against the clock to solve it. \n\nThe cast is diverse and interesting and each route is different from the last. Each of the characters come with their own motivations and desires and the plots never fall into the predictable or cliche. There's hours of gameplay to be found in exploring all the different story paths. Once you've done that, there's also an unlockable freeplay mode where you can create a custom council of your very own and solve cases without the distractions of the plot.\n\nOverall, Hanako has delivered a solid and enjoyable game yet again and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys  tabletop inspired mechanics with a good story and enjoyable writing.", "timestamp_created": 1442433441, "timestamp_updated": 1442433441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39569586": {"recommendationid": "39569586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059341122", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 694, "last_played": 1516725005}, "language": "english", "review": "A must. \n\nDifficult, as any who played Long Live the Queen will be absolutely unsurprised to hear, and sometimes really frustrating, but in a good way.

Ending theme music is pretty good too.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nThe mechanic for drawing your gun before firing is neat.  Simple but effective.  This is the sort of good game design that really immerses you in a game's theme without you even really noticing it.  Also neat: that the game reminds you to put your gun away again after your opponent is dead.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nNothing, really.  With a game this small, there's really not a lot to critique.  You either like it or you don't, and I liked it.\n\nSome people have been putting up \"it's too short\" as a negative, but I'm not so sure about that one, myself.  The game is great just the way it is, but I suspect it would get boring [i]really fast[/i] if it were significantly longer (and had nothing else different.)  In other words, a longer game would also require more depth, both of story and of game mechanics, to keep things interesting.

What i liked from this is that it doesn't show the glory of winning in duels and being a feared shooter. As an example, in the story, the main charcter would tell about the townfolk heard of her would either want to buy drinks for her and tell story of her battles but also different folks would fear her becuase of her high skills in duels. Surpirisingly, the story is quite set grounded in the way of the real wild west even though it is inspired heavily of Spaghetti westerns as the character first duel with a man is becuase of something trvial such as gambling cards which happens quite a lot to the real historical west.The game also delves into topics of death, life and the interesting meaning from all of this. But sadly there are problems in the story, which firstly is the problem of the main charcter herself. Before i say this, i know the devs are intenional for not giving much focus on the person rather her expolits in duels and it affect her life. But the problem is that the story is told so brief with so little detail that it is hard to fully understand the emtional turmoil of the character and the player doesn't know much about her to begin with to the point that i forgot something basic as her name becuase the dialogue only say it only twice or three times in the entire game. While it is well written, the pacing of it is all over the place and feel incomplete rather than simple short and sweet.\n\nGameplay: The gamplay is a first person point and click in the most basic of terms. The game is broken up to stationy section where there only one control which is the mouse and the player can click to interact with the enviroment to only read information from this. But there is another mechanic that is all focused on is the shooting. The closest i can compare is arcade shooters such as Time Crisis and House of the Dead but you can only shoot once to kill the opponent. This can be used by simply moving the mouse down the screen to equip it. It simple, but effective and easy to understand for all people which is fine for me. For 4 of the 5 sections of the game is focued on the duels and the enamies throughout will test your refelxes similar to duels in Red Dead Redemption but without the dead eye. Sadly there are no ways to change the outcome of the duels as no matter where you shot on the enemy, he will die in on hit beside missing and dying. It's a shame as it could be cool to shoot the arm of a person to drop their weapon or talk them out of it. \n\nPresentation: The Game presentaion is set in pixel art and sound effects and music are in chip-tune clearly to be a throw-back to 16bit genertaion of the Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive/ Genesis. While i am assured some people would eb groaning at this becuase of the large amoult of saturation of this on steam for years. But i don't mind at this usually, as this actually in my opinion works well esspecially the well done music that add a tense but gritty atmosphere. \n\nConculsion: Dead Horizon has it's faults that in any other narative-focused game would be lethal but for this game, it doesn't dectract the experience too much as the main core theme are still able to be expressed and the simplisitic gameplay isn't bogged down on unnessary mechinics and design like other games. Being the game is free and can be beaten in a few minutes, i suggest you should at least try.", "timestamp_created": 1503782698, "timestamp_updated": 1503782698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34498264": {"recommendationid": "34498264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112841871", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503730360}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this.

While there is some gameplay here with you having to shoot multiple people in a quickdraw with your mouse and while that aspect of the gameplay is fun and done well, the writing is what makes Dead Horizon great. While Bonnie herself has no shown dialogue, the narration of her life helps to develop her and really draws you into the world of Dead Horizon and helps you sympathize her place in the world. \n\nWhile the gameplay is incredibly simple, gunning down anyone dumb enough to cross your way is really saitsfying as the shooting is accompanied by a great sound design and detailed animations of your opponents going down. You can even inspect various parts of each screen too if you want to see more of the excellent writing that the game offers. However, there's not much variety in the gameplay as all you do is just shoot people but that's not much of a fault at all considering how short the game is (like less than an hour).\n\nOverall, Dead Horizon is a really, really good short game and you really have no excuse not to play it since its free and all.

The writing was fun and engaging, and there was a good amount of replayability to find all the little things you might miss the first time through. I had different messages that appeared for some fights for example, and it's not possible to get all the dialogue messages in a few scenes in the first run through. The game can be completed in 10 minutes on a blind playthrough, but it's a great experience that I think is worth the time.\n\nPros:\n\n- Visuals are Stunning: This is a common thread with games and videos by 14 Hours Productions, and usually worth the admission alone. The amount of detail they put in every single frame, and the smooth animations are incredible. It really does make top AAA games jealous in that regard.\n\n- Audio is Superb: Every track fits the mood and atmosphere that's going on, and helps keep you immersed in the story the game is trying to convey. It's this unique chiptune style that you don't see very often anymore, and adds so much to an already fun experience. You know it's something to behold when people are purchasing the soundtrack for a free game.\n\n- Clever Writing: The entire game is written in a campfire story style that someone's telling of a woman who went from being a no-name, to an infamous killer. Even when you fail a stage, the dialogue doesn't break that. It's a small detail that I think deserves more praise.\n\n- Interesting Twist on Gameplay: While there's not a ton to it, it's an interesting take that you have to wait until the draw and you manually draw the gun and then aim and shoot, then reholster your gun. Normally on games that are quick draw you simply press the shoot button at the right time. But this one actually pulls you in as the fastest shot. It's extremely satisfying during subsequent playthroughs learning the ticks and getting better at the timing to see just how fast you can do it.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Length: Obviously a smaller complaint as it's a free game, but the story did leave me wanting more. As you can see from my playtime I replayed it through multiple times seeing if there was anything I was missing or if there was something more. Like if you fail or succeed in the final mission, or if you complete the credits a certain way. There wasn't, but as a testament to the writing for making me want more, it's a drawback that the game ends so quickly when you're so invested.\n\n- Couple Bugs: During my multiple playthroughs I'd find a few bugs. If you go back to the Main Menu during almost any section with music, the music stays and then the game just overlaps the rest of the soundtrack. You can stack it too. So like if you go to the Three Gunners, then return to the main menu, then get to the Bar Fight, return ot the main menu, main two I found were the start of the credits, and the Lawman if you fail and kill him before the dialogue box reappears.\n\nAnd that's about it as Cons go. And if that's all there is for problems, it's a testament to the quality of this game.\n\n\nOverall this is a fantastic addiction to the 14 Hours Production collection of works. I highly recommend you check out this game (it's Free!) and then other works from them. I've been a fan for 8 years it looks like, so it's fantastic to see that they're still releasing and producing quality content that you can't find anywhere else.", "timestamp_created": 1502906200, "timestamp_updated": 1502906200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34278251": {"recommendationid": "34278251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037799869", "num_games_owned": 1406, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502896848}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game takes me back to my days as a wild west gunslinger.

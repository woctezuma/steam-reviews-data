I can see why Call of Duty became so popular in its time, the feeling of teamwork is great and everything that goes with it.

Running through an open field as mortars bombard all around you killing your friends and allies enemy soldiers attempt to pick you off on a mounted gun or behind cover. Very good game even in 2018 4/5 a few negatives are there isn't a sprint option however it isn't really necessary for the type of environments you're in as you won't be advancing as quickly as in the more modern call of duty's, the mounted gunners can have pin point accuracy even if you move position while they cannot see you, grenades can bounce around ridiculously as if they're strapped with bouncy balls and the floor is ice, tanks can sometimes be in really awkward positions to flank around them and every now and then your comrades enjoy walking into walls.

Instead of contrived technothrillers and invincible patriots sprinting around with sci-fi technology, it gives us vulnerable soldiers taking part in the great and perilous historical undertaking of kicking Hitler's teeth in, and through the intensity of the fighting you participate in it shows that war is Hell in the process. It's a good experience as a result: like a war movie, but a humanizing one, not a jingoistic popcorn flick like later games in the series.\n\nThe old-school roots of its id Tech 3 engine are definitely visible - no wonder I thought some of the interface looked similar to Return to Castle Wolfenstein's. However, the gameplay is generally grounded in realism, with cover, leaning and suppressing fire being important for survival. That's not to mention you usually move through levels with squads of friendly soldiers, which at the very least means a little less enemy fire directed at you. Enemy soldiers have a smart and annoying propensity for hiding behind cover. The regenerating health seen in later CoD games is absent here, with a traditional HP system and health kits to heal with instead. This alone gives the game a good amount of challenge, and on higher difficulties can prove kind of frustrating, or at least that was my experience with Hardened difficulty.\n\n\nSee, there's a conflict between the ease with which you die on harder difficulties hammering home how brutal war is, and the fact that [i]not[/i] dying is required to continue with the game. This is, again, mainly because you have a traditional HP system, yet enemies you face almost always have hitscan weaponry that instantly damages you if they don't miss. It doesn't help that sometimes enemies will be in alert mode at times when they shouldn't or too soon, which means they zero in on your position and shoot the instant you so much as lean out of cover.\n\nThe characters you play are meant to give a grunt's POV of a brutal war where many, many soldiers die, but you yourself are expected to survive through it all. While I'm sure there were some soldiers lucky enough to survive like that in real life, given the combination of HP/hitscan damage mechanics you'll likely die a number of times during the game's harder moments, or at least the bits without many checkpoints. Reloading a save twelve or so times on a single segment slightly hurts the otherwise well-executed cinematic feel the game was going for, and makes it feel more...well, more game-y, despite how realistic it may be to die quickly, and despite the genuine tension harrowing in-game moments can generate.\n\nBeing unable to run and gun and having to play more carefully certainly augments the harrowing feel. The result though is that Call of Duty demands patience perhaps more than any other game in the series, which I suppose isn't a bad thing if you're patient. There were nevertheless times I found myself feeling more like I was playing a somewhat janky old-school game (to be fair Call of Duty [i]is[/i] old-school), and playing it as such, than experiencing a classic war movie in game form as the developers' intention no doubt was.\n\n\nStill, while there is somewhat of a mismatch between enemies' hitscan damage and the traditional HP system, it ultimately doesn't cripple the game. It's still a gripping and groundbreaking experience. If you approach Call of Duty as a partly old-school product - and let's be honest, either on a lower difficulty or with smart usage of quicksaving - it's a great game for shooter fans and WWII buffs alike.\n\nMultiplayer is surprisingly still a bit active. There's not many players considering the game's age but there are a number of servers, some with bots. The mechanical base is pretty solid; the essentials of what made it popular are there without any egregious stuff like killstreaks. It could be described as 'simcade', overall. Be prepared for some lag given the populated servers will probably be distant from you.

see the game that started one of the best selling video game franchises. The game is a lot different from newer titles, but is still a very good game. \n\nThe game is set in World War 2, and feels very much like one of the Medal of Honor games. The campaign is a narrative story that follows a cast of named characters across different theatres of war. The campaign is fun, and provides a good story. \n\nThe gameplay of the game is fun. The controls make sense, and the UI of the game is intuitive. The gunplay in the game is solid and feels realisitc. There is a good variety between all of the different weapons. Many of the weapons have multiple firing modes meaning that the selection of weapons feels even bigger. Additionally some weapons can be deployed or have other kind of special features to them which adds some very good complexity to the game. The heath system in the game is fair, and health packs are littiered fairly throughout levels. The difficulty of the game never felt too bad, and it can be changed if you desire a harder or easier game. \n\nThe graphics on the game do show their age, but there is no way to really avoid that the game is old. The game does look visially good it is just low quality (if that makes sense). The graphics ran smoothly on my old computer which is by no means powerful. Im sure that no matter what machine you have you will be able to run the game smoothly, and even at the higher graphics level. \n\nI did have some issue when I first installed the game where I was unable to play it due to crashes. As time went on I belive that there may have been some kind of fix becuase I no longer have this issue, and I can play the game without it crashing before loading. I think this may have had something to do with Windows 7, so it is worth looking out for. I was lucky one time when I was trying to play it back then where it loaded, and I played the whole game in one sitting just to be safe. As I said before I think this issue is fixed, so you should not worry about it affecting your game however it is just something to look out for. Now with the return system if you can't run the game you can just return it, and I am sure that there are plenty of guides and forum posts that can help you get your game working if it doesn't.\n\nI really love this game. The setting, campaign, and gameplay are all really great, and make for a great game. Even though I had some issues in the past with the game I still think that it is absolutly worth purchasing and playing.", "timestamp_created": 1517342209, "timestamp_updated": 1517342209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39696492": {"recommendationid": "39696492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045783578", "num_games_owned": 909, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514714690}, "language": "english", "review": "The game that started the modern day juggernaut is something you should experience for yourself.  It plays like an early 2000's shooter, but you can see alot fo the things that would later come to define the modern FPS genre, but with alot of hold-ons that keep the game super fun.  It has the best of both worlds you could say, it has set-piece moments that are amazing, but its not all so closely stringed together that its taking you out of the game constantly.  Each campaign also feels completely different from each other, emphasizing different size engagements and different tones.  Once you get to the Russian Campaign, it feels like a bucket of cold water being thrown on you.  SInce this game came out though, you've probably played alot of the same missions, most are direct ripoffs of movies, but its cool to see the first incarnations of them.

where it all started, a fantastic ww2 shooter. in this relatively short 7 hour campaign you will play as an ordinary american, british and soviet soldier in some of the key battles of world war 2. wide variety of locations, environment, types of combat (short range, long range, tank combat) makes the campaign really interesting and you never really get bored. some of my favorite missions are the eder dam, battleship tirpitz and stalingrad. in this game you will meet cpt. price for the first time in cod franchise, as well as learn a little bit of history.\nif you're looking for challenging campaign to beat - look no further. this can be extremely hard on veteran difficulty (if you're not using quick save all the time).\nthe only annoying thing about this game is absence of the mission select option after you've beaten the game.\n15 years later, multiplayer is still active and a lot of fun.\ni highly recommend this game if you're into fps games, especially if you need a little break

During this actioned packed Campaign, you will not only fight enjoy the Campaign and story line of the American Assault, but also the British and Soviet soldiers.  For a game that was released in 2003, Activision and Infinity Ward brought a lot of realism into the game. As you assault forward into and behind enemy lines while a relentless barrage of artillery fire and mortar rounds impacting around you, you will find yourself taking cover to overcome shellshock and regain awareness.\n\nThe American Campaign \n\n-\tBrings you and your fellow comrades into the invasion of Normandy. Lack of sleep and male nourished, you fight your way through towns and villages eliminating all German enemy forces, securing the areas, and continuing your venture into the depths of the Nazi Front. Following your success in Normandy, you make your way to Bastogne, Belgium. (9 Missions)\n\nThe British Campaign\n\n-\tWhile the American Forces are assaulting the western front, British soldiers are assaulting the eastern front partnered with 1 Canadian Division.  Starting their mission near Benouville, British troops capture and defend key bridges the Germany Forces are utilizing to transport tanks into the central and western Forward Line of Troops. Following their success, British elements are tasked to take out Planes and most importantly, a German Naval Vessel, the Tirpitz, near Norway. Nearing the conclusion of the mission, British forces are tasked to destroy German Rockets in Burgsteinfurt, Germany. (7 Missions)\n\nThe Soviet Campaign\n\n-\tThe first Soviet mission takes places during the Battle of Stalingrad.  You are unarmed and taking relentless machinegun and mortar fire. Once successfully ashore and the machinegun fire has been suppressed and eliminated, you find yourself flanking and neutralizing a German stronghold. During this campaign you are elected to take charge of a tank and maneuver throughout a Village, eliminated German Panzers. (10 Missions)\n\nIn conclusion this game was fantastic to play, everything from the realism of shellshock, ability to eliminate targets with a distant well sniper round, and assault bunkers conducting room clearing and hand to hand combat.  This game offers non-stop action-packed fighting to always keep you on your toes for 26 intense missions total and a variety of weapons. I would absolutely recommend this game for the simple fact or how engaged your will be at every moment.  The campaign does not take very long to beat but you will sure have fun playing it.  After checking the multiplayer servers, there is no-one who plays online.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514326281, "timestamp_updated": 1514326281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38713715": {"recommendationid": "38713715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084225488", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514274477}, "language": "english", "review": "awful just die", "timestamp_created": 1514325534, "timestamp_updated": 1514325534, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.126203", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38696482": {"recommendationid": "38696482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262104330", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517833278}, "language": "english", "review": "Old, Long, The perfect game for every fps games player!

Playing it on PC for the first time is wonderful. I didn't remember much about the game, so a lot of what I'm experiencing feels new, and nostalgia for this specific game isn't a factor, but nostalgia for this era of shooter design is.\n\nCall of Duty feels intimate in a way that most other shooters can't do. You get verbal and written briefings, some even through you character's diary. The briefing often includes clueing you in to the overall strategy of the Allies and your small yet significant place in that strategy. The battles you fight aren't the ones that make headlines, but are the backbone of the offensive. You capture small towns and estates, and defend key points like bridges. The battles are small but feel personal, especially because your teammates' names show up when you point at them and the name changes in color to reflect their health. When Call of Duty goes for a dramatic moment, it doesn't wrestle control away from you. Rather, it fades in some melancholy orchestral music to fit the moment.\n\nCall of Duty can play more run-and-gun or stop-and-pop depending on the difficulty level and the environment you're fighting in, with indoors being more of the former and outdoors being the latter. Weapons are still reasonably accurate even without aiming down the sights, which feels delightfully old-fashioned and is something that I dearly miss. Controls include leaning and going prone, both of which are useful in the game's indoor and outdoor battles. Sprinting is absent but that absensce isn't really noticable thanks to tight level design. Infinity Ward prefers to make a lot of short levels, something I prefer over a game with few long levels. My patience hasn't been tested by superfluous dialogue, cutscenes, or other ways to artificially inflate the length of game.\n\nQuite simply, Call of Duty is a marvel of old-fashioned game design, built on the foundations of some of the best shooters ever made, then given its own identity as a shooter that sits confidently on the line between realistic shooters like Red Orchestra and Rainbow Six, and run-and-gun shooters like Quake and Half Life.", "timestamp_created": 1513941962, "timestamp_updated": 1513941962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583155", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38380107": {"recommendationid": "38380107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417791917", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514103157}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Golden Oldie nog steeds goed\n", "timestamp_created": 1513526849, "timestamp_updated": 1513526849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38355345": {"recommendationid": "38355345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176231171", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518796489}, "language": "english", "review": "The campaign is the hardest, the graphics are the worst, the multiplayer is dead, no one played it when it first came out so nostalgia is out of the window, the audio gives you brain damage, voice acting is horrible, grenade indicators are non-existent, campaign is 2 1/2 hours max, AI are horrible, allies block doorways, guns aren't accurate, you can't snipe from long distances, first 2 russian missions don't even have guns, some missions are timed, no unique weapons, repetitive, no blood, \nno recoil, so unrealistic, no proper cutscenes, no cinematics.\ncall of duty 1 = 97 - metacritic\ncall of duty 4 = 86 - metacritic", "timestamp_created": 1513444402, "timestamp_updated": 1513444402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431788", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38348486": {"recommendationid": "38348486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102814376", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509715396}, "language": "english", "review": "It is like three little movie based on world war 2", "timestamp_created": 1513426080, "timestamp_updated": 1513426080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38302084": {"recommendationid": "38302084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018468455", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510715291}, "language": "english", "review": "Still a fun single player experience even by today's standards.

Weltkrieg spielt. Missionen sind glaubw\u00fcrdig inszeniert und lassen einen die Kampange aus verschieden Perspektiven der Allierten erleben. Dabei gibt es keine Skriptsequenzen, die das Gameplay unterbrechen. Die Action passiert BEIM Gamplay und ich habe immer die volle Kontrolle \u00fcber das, was ich im Spiel tue, ohne dass ich von einer Cutscene bewegt werde. Es gibt auch keine HP Regeneration, was das Gampeplay sehr taktisch macht; vorst\u00fcrmen und versuchen, alle abzuknallen, f\u00fchrt meistens zum sicheren Tod. Man muss also langsam vorgehen. Die HP k\u00f6nnen wir durch das Aufsammeln von Medi-Packs wieder auff\u00fcllen. Die Missionen spielen in unterschiedliche Gebieten und zu unterschiedlichen Jahreszeiten: So gibt es etwa eine Sniper Mission im Winter oder Schlachten in der Stadt. F\u00fcr Abwechslung ist also gesorgt. In einer Mission f\u00e4hrt man auch Panzer oder man ist Sch\u00fctze in einem Fahrenden Auto. Die Grafik ist heute nat\u00fcrlich veraltet, Animationen wirken etwas steif und Explosionen sehen auch nicht unbedingt realistisch aus. Die Grafik ist insgesamt aber immer noch ansehnlich. Allerdings ist das Gamplay hier nahezu perfekt und das ist wichtiger als Grafik.\n\nMein Fazit:\nSehr gut inszenierter Singleplayer, der das pure und realistisch inszenierte Gameplay eines zweiten Weltkriegsshooters in den Fokus r\u00fckt.

In single-player, you'll have a great time playing difficult missions first as an American GI, then a Brit, and finally as a Russian. Most players can finish the game in a day or two. The graphics are intense (for a game using the Quake 3 engine), the sound simply amazing; you'll think you're on a virtual battlefield.\nThe AI is quite good, which makes for better variety than most first-person shooter games. Also, the ability to be part of a squad adds depth to the game, as you're no longer killing 200 soldiers by yourself. I recommend playing on the most difficult setting, as that is a definite challenge and will enhance your enjoyment of the single-player missions (and teach you the virtues of patience).\n\nIn multi-player mode is where Call of Duty really shines. You can compete against a host of players in a deathmatch or on a team (such as Germans vs. British). I have been playing multi-player for a few weeks now... it still gets my heart pounding when an unseen sniper is trying to take you down, or when you meet an opponent face-to-face.\nMy kudos to the designers, this game is certainly a piece of art.\nPro:\n-amazing fast-paced action\n-realistic sounds\n-good AI\n-great multi-player mode\n-detailed maps\n\nCons:\n-lack of a map editor", "timestamp_created": 1508880020, "timestamp_updated": 1508880020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618171", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35965747": {"recommendationid": "35965747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051795452", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 812, "last_played": 1521727984}, "language": "english", "review": "Back when Call of Duty brand actually meant a good game.

cool for anyone who like a war game. The campaign is amazing! Multiplayer is good too. If you like history and a FPS then this game is perfect for you. All of the weapons are actual WWII weapons. There is a only a little bit of cussing and very little blood. The cussing in this game is not that bad of words either. So it is appropriate for kids. For parents out there wondering if you should let your child to play it but you don't know what age to let them play. I would recommend to start letting your kids play this at the age of 11 or 12. This is one of the more kid friendly Call of Duty games. Call of Duty 2 was good also. Call of Duty Modern warfare and above I would recommend for a 16 year old. With World at War probably a 17 year old. But that is off topic. The point is this is an Amazing game that I would definitely recommend buying. I would give this game a rating of 9/10 of of 10. For those of you thinking of spending 60 dollars on the new Call of Duty games don't. This game is way better and it is only 20 dollars. So for those of you who want to buy the game now, enjoy playing you will have a lot of fun.\n                     \n", "timestamp_created": 1508565381, "timestamp_updated": 1508565381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35876211": {"recommendationid": "35876211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354946747", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507662036}, "language": "turkish", "review": "FPSlerde can bar\u0131 olmas\u0131 tek oyunculuda bile can yak\u0131yormu\u015f en zorda denedim yok anam olmuyor\nBu arada indirime girdi\u011finde eklenti paketi ve 2.oyunla olan paketle alman\u0131z\u0131 \u00f6neriyorum :)", "timestamp_created": 1508542089, "timestamp_updated": 1508542089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35873735": {"recommendationid": "35873735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015907309", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501455389}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Por antiguo que es este juego, no me canso de jugarlo.", "timestamp_created": 1508533135, "timestamp_updated": 1508533135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35851040": {"recommendationid": "35851040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226240436", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507291029}, "language": "english", "review": "Second best Cod ever\n\nfor those of you who are partial to him, Jason Statham is in this", "timestamp_created": 1508453256, "timestamp_updated": 1508453256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35833928": {"recommendationid": "35833928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169722275", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507778632}, "language": "english", "review": "Before playing this, I had only played CoDs between World ar War to Advanced Warfare, and I was curious to see how Call of Duty first started out.  I had heard that \"it doesn't try to make you out as some kind of war hero,\" and that is somewhat true.  It definitely has some action sequences, and t one point you single-handedly take out a small base, but there definitely parts which have a clear message: real war isn't a game, it's brutal slaughter.  To me, there is one part where this really stands out: the beginning of the russian campaign.  I feel this part really shows that message well.  Basically, the original CoD was a fun game, and actually a breath of fresh air, compared to the newer shooters.  Part of this is the game is old, and I like playing old games like this and Half Life, but not everyone does.  However, if you can look past the dated visuals, and somewhat dated mechanics, Call of Duty classic is a fun game, and I recommend it be played, at least to see where Call of Duty came from, and how it has changed over the years.", "timestamp_created": 1508395055, "timestamp_updated": 1508395055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35822221": {"recommendationid": "35822221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435009578", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508964910}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No puedo abrirlo.

I have played other Call of Duty games before this one before but decided to go ahead and buy the original, to really see where it all started. I have to say that this game holds up well, at least the campaign does. I can't speak for the multiplayer for I haven't played it. The soundtrack was great, the gameplay is pretty smooth, the characters and the voice acting is good for its time. I mean sure the character models are a bit boxy, the graphics aren't great by today's standards, and you are pretty limited in terms of weapons and movement as was the case with most games when this came out. \n\nAll in all, I think this is a great game and will probably play this again on a harder difficulty in the future.

someone and weaker \"knifing\" which is actaully hitting with your weapon\n\n+2 primaries and a side arm\n+normal hp\n+a lovely training mission\n+really low specs needed\n+really balanced multiplayer no killstreaks,perks,attachment combos that ruin things\n+weapons differ depending on the classes and their weapons differ depending on the nation\n+still a few people playing online\n+ really fun

100% accuracy and no med kits well have fun......\n-not alot of people playing but some so you still can get the multiplayer feeling\n-no default 16:9 support so you have to play on 4:3 res is you dont want to change something in some files\n\noverall a great game some times enemies respawn yes but at some areas like the (spoiler) russian  campaingn  where you first have to snipe german

Works best when it makes you feel more like just another soldier instead of the missions where you feel like James Bond, but either way the game is gorgeous and really just a lot of fun. Veteran may feel a bit cheap at first but keep playing and you'll get the hang of it and realize that for the most part it's pretty fair.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++Fantastic sound design\n++Gorgeous, colourful graphics that still look really nice today\n++Game runs like a dream on modern hardware and operating systems\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Brilliant first-person animations\n+Back when Call of Duty could be lighthearted and not dead serious the whole game. A welcome change for what most people would expect in the series in that regard. Can bring the seriousness of the war when required.\n+Shows three different sides of the war, all handled decently well. Pretty unique concept for WWII shooters.\n+The only CoD where you can quick-save\n+Set-pieces are handled well\n+Weapon variety is decent\n+Voice-acting is of high quality\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-Run of the mill multiplayer, but it's still enjoyable\n-+Veteran is strange in that health\n+-I don't miss health regeneration when there's no health kits on Veteran and there's waves and waves of enemies, but it's not too much of a big deal. I also imagine it wouldn't be too annoying on easier difficulties either.\n-+Characters can be humourous and are likeable, but only appear very, very shortly\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-Animations were always pretty dated\n-Singleplayer is far too short. Lasts only about 5 hours on Veteran.\n-I've always found weapons to not feel impactful enough in the CoD games. This is no exception.\n-Campaign pacing is poor\n-Not a lot of weaponry and you'll be using the same ones constantly across all factions since the best ones are so rare\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--Game gets repetitive and tiring quickly\n--Ridiculously linear to the point where it's just stupid. Even moreso than the rest of the games.

"Though the franchise has undergone many time-period changes through its 14 year existence, the original Call of Duty heralded the true beginning of a gaming era; one that brought on an onslaught of World War II first-person shooters. It also helped to birth the hardcore FPS multiplayer scene that we know today, since the series focused more on an online experience than an in-depth campaign. It's with the first Call of Duty title, released in 2003, that we see many of the staples that the franchise has carried on for the last decade and a half, including the unmistakable \"death\" sound, and the floundering campaign that bridges between multiple main characters and regiments; though it's important to note that this title comes equipped with an actual health bar, rather than a regenerating life mechanic.\n\nIn single-player mode, there are three campaigns to be enjoyed; American where you control Private Martin during the years of 1942-1944, British which follows the journey of Sergeant Jack Evans during 1944, and Soviet Union that chronicles Corporal Alexei Ivanovich Voronin's experience during the Battle of Stalingrad, up through the years of 1942-1945. Each of these campaigns, which span across 26 levels, bring fast-paced, action-driven content to the table that was considered unique at the time that this title was released. Whether you're in a speeding car and avoiding being gunned down by the enemy, infiltrating underground bunkers, or controlling a tank, or sneaking onto an enemy ship as a spy, there's always something fun waiting for you.\n\nSurprisingly, the graphics and amazing atmosphere still hold up in this advanced day and age; as do the mechanics and AI. In fact, the AI in Call of Duty is better than some of its successors, your allies that help you gun down your foes will actually hit them and help you to proceed, rather than just firing in the general direction of the enemy, leaving you to do all of the work. The enemy AI is so well done that it can be frustrating at times, especially those on mounted machine guns as they will tend to target you, even if you're hiding behind cover, despite your 10+ comrades who are doing the conga-line out in the open. Also worthy of a mention, the optimization is fantastic, and the game runs smooth as butter even on Windows 10. However, the sound is another story; there are no separate option sliders for sound effects, music, and voice. This leads to the gunfire completely overwhelming any spoken dialogue, and largely overtaking the few music tracks that are present.\n\nAlthough I personally did not partake in the Call of Duty multiplayer, it's included and the servers are still functional if that's something that you're interested in. It's your run-of-the-mill basic deathmatch kind of multiplayer, and even for its time it was extremely barebones; don't purchase this game with the expectations of anything that even remotely resembles the Modern Warfare series and onward. More realistic expectations would be to brace yourself for a World War II themed Unreal Tournament experience if anything. There also aren't a lot of people online, so it's best to only consider purchasing this game if you want to play the single-player campaign.\n\nEven though 14 years have passed since it was originally released, Call of Duty still stands firm as a landmark title that spawned a plethora of World War II FPS clones. It revolutionized the FPS genre at the time, with its unique action segments that exceeded the boundaries of the standard run-and-gun titles that surrounded it. If you're a fan of the series and are tired of the latest deviations in the franchise, or if you've never played the original, come back to basics with this title. If you're a fan of World War II shooters, then this will most certainly be an unforgettable experience for you. The only downside is that the ending is a bit anti-climactic, but other than that Call of Duty is a true classic that must be played.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]5.0/5.0[/b] - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n\n[h1]Related Reviews:[/h1]\n[b]Review for Call of Duty - World at War: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/10090/]Here[/url].\nReview for Call of Duty - Modern Warfare: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/7940]Here[/url].\nReview for Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 2: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/10180]Here[/url].\nReview for Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 3: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/42680]Here[/url].\nReview for Call of Duty - Ghosts: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/THNEmbalmer/recommended/209160]Here[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1495439937, "timestamp_updated": 1513694614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684737", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31896713": {"recommendationid": "31896713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319765238", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519603164}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a fun game to play on PS3.

Of all the Call of Duty games, this one has by far the best AI.  They utilize formations and cover well, and they seem to better acknowledge what each other is doing.  You won't find multiple soldiers dynamically fragging an MG nest for example, only one will attempt it while others cover.  \n\nThis is also the only CoD game to my knowledge that has a fire selector for guns, otherwise it plays much like the other WWII CoD games.  Portable support weapons are not available to the player, that was introduced in United Offensive, its expansion.\n\nYou play as an American in France, Belgium, and Germany, as well as a British soldier in France, Norway, and Germany, and also a Russian soldier in Russia and Germany.  You take part in major battles like Operation Overlord, Stalingrad, Battle of the Bulge, and more, many of which are covered by other CoD games as well so expect some repetition in that regard.  The game includes car chases and a tank segment, stealth operations of various kinds, a bit more mission and terrain variety than other CoD games (especially the WWII ones).  \n\nIt shares some of the same limitations with its successors as well, such as the less than impressive physics, very limited environmental interaction, excessive invisible walls, unrealistic reliance on the player (e.g. you will be told to use a mounted MG and then switch to a Panzerfaust when tanks show up, forced gameplay variety at the expensive of realism).\n\nThis game, United Offensive, and CoD 2 are the only ones to my knowledge that use DirectSound3D and Creative EAX 3, so you better use a sound card and select Creative EAX 3 as the sound device.  This results better positional audio as every sound is processed in 3D space, and dynamic environmental effects not present in the ones after CoD 2 like echoes/reverb and more.\n\nBe sure to get United Offensive as well and use Marcomix's Real Weapons mod, which is compatible with both.  This adds much needed weapon variety to the game, and a bit more authenticity as well.\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/marcomixs-real-weapons", "timestamp_created": 1494382611, "timestamp_updated": 1494446702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700713", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31613313": {"recommendationid": "31613313", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994135829", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471684795}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my all time favorite FPS series ever made.

There's something for the whole family! \n- No wallrunning, jetpacks, or other goofy shennanigans!\n- No Rambo tactics like in other games. Your squad is there for you (most of the time)\n\nCons:\n\n- Other than trying to win WW II the story is kind of forgettable\n- Compared to the character development in its successors it's simply just not there for this one (Don't expect to get to know Price's Grandaddy in this one) \n- To many the scale of the battles and map sizes may be disappointing but Infinityward did a great job with 'smoke and mirrors'  considering the now primitive tech they had to work with and develop for.\n\nOverall: Althought there isn't much replayability this game was a ride well worth the enrty price.

Each country has its own weapons, and you can also pick up and use the Axis weapons as well (MG42 and MP40).\n\n[*]\tThe combat is fun, intense and satisfying, especially if you are using a rifle; performing head shots.  \n\n[*]\tSome memorable missions; like operation overload. \n\n[*]\tI like the idea behind the cut-scenes were it shows you historical WW2 footage, and I also like the idea that you can read the soldiers diary or their briefing form before the mission. \n\n[*]\tA great variety of missions; like for example in one mission you get to drive a T-34 tank and in another mission you are on a truck firing a bazooka. \n\n[*]\tGreat soundtrack; goes well with the gameplay.\n\n[*]\tGreat arsenal of weapons; they were all actually used during WW2 and each country has its different weapons. \n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u] \n\n[*]\tDon't get me wrong this is a fantastic game, which is well made; there was never a dull moment in it, but it's a lot of money for what it is. If it had included United Offence, then it probably would have been worth it. I managed to complete the game in less than 7 hours. You probably be better of buying this game at a discount. \n\n[*]\tSome of the missions are too short. \n\n[*]\tSometimes you can't jump over obstacles; like fences and sandbags. You can't also jump through windows. \n\n[*]\tSometimes it just feels like your doing all the work. \n[*]\t I hate having to equip the grenade to throw it; would have been better if you could just press g to throw the grenade. \n[/list]\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nA fantastic game, but too expensive for a 2003 game.

Especially a series that at one time was revered as much as some of the best military shooters out there today, if not more so. \n\nThe original Call of Duty is structured a bit differently than your typical modern Call of Duty. Your modern Call of Duty follows a three act structure for a majority of its campaigns and this can tend to make them a bit predictable in terms of story structure. This Call of Duty does have three campaigns, but each one has it\u2019s throughs and valleys, which in turn creates three distinct experiences. Something that the later Call of Duty\u2019s fail to evoke. One could look at it as a three-act structure, but I look at it as a unique structure. A way to tell a story that only a game could. \n\nFor the most part the campaign is hardly ever mundane or boring, and I don\u2019t really like saying that as some of these missions were actually done. So it feels odd to criticize something that at one point in time had real stakes involved. However I think, that ultimately Infinity Ward\u2019s choice to include these missions gives the original Call of Duty an air of authenticity that is severely lacking in the modern Call of Duty\u2019s. \n\nGoing through the campaigns 20 or so levels is a breeze. Clocking in at around 8-9 hours plus another 5 or 6 with the United Offensive expansion. It\u2019s a decently long game and definitely worth the money if it\u2019s on sale. \n\nCall of Duty may be a bit hard for some newer fans, but if you power through it, you\u2019ll enjoy yourself. I for one was enthralled and taken aback when I saw what these brave men did for our country. It\u2019s not like the game is an exact recreation of war events, but it gives you an idea how it must of been for these people. A very slight idea as I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s nothing like the real thing.  And thus this gives the original Call of Duty a timeless quality. It\u2019s something you can look back to and be able to experience just how bad this world can get. It\u2019s a lesson and warning for all time. It\u2019s poignant in such a way that modern Call of Duty\u2019s can never be. This doesn\u2019t mean that later Call of Duty\u2019s are bad it just means they are missing one thing that makes the original all the better for it.", "timestamp_created": 1485677693,

It\u2019s not a particularly innovative game, but rather does an excellent job of bringing together all of the best facets of World War II shooters and wrapping it all in top-notch level design. Who cares about innovation when you\u2019re having so much fun? Anyone who\u2019s a fan of FPS or the Call of Duty series in general should give the game a try, picking it up when discounted on Steam.\n\nIs it good?\n=================\nCall of Duty provides a mix of realism and arcade elements that work together nicely to provide a great gameplay experience.  A well-placed shot or two will be able to bring you down, but you can actually take a fair amount of damage and there are health packs scattered about the level or dropped by the dead that can restore you to full strength. If the game's missions could be described in a word, that word would be intense.  Right from the start you'll be in the thick of things, outnumbered and facing withering fire from the enemy.  In just the first few missions you'll have to assault bunkers, take out Wirbelwind Flakpanzers protected by machine gun nests, and face the devastating fire of a Tiger tank's cannon and machine gun.  If you think that's tough, wait until you reach the Russian missions.  In a sequence obviously inspired by Enemy at the Gates, you'll have to cross the Volga River into the heart of the maelstrom in Stalingrad ... and do so without a gun.  Throughout the campaign the game doesn't let up, moving you from one action-packed mission to the next.\n\nThe game is also mod friendly with a pretty decent following still. There are a few interesting mods that improve just the graphics and sounds including Extreme Mod Light [2013] and CoD Realism Enhancement.\n\nDoes it have any problems?\n========================\nThe game requires PunkBuster update to play on protected servers which are no longer hosted on EvenBalance's website. Even still, the multiplayer is actually pretty active for such an old game. Just make sure you get the United Offensive expansion pack since that\u2019s where most of the multiplayer servers need. \n\nA big word of warning though, a lot of people have experienced problems running the game on newer hardware, one of the biggest problems when trying to play older games. The biggest problem is a buffer overflow with newer Nvidia hardware and Intel HD cards (http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Buffer_Overrun_error_on_start-up). These issues can be fixed, so if you do have errors, please check the PC Gaming Wiki link for the fix.\n\nFinal Thoughts!\n====================\nIt was all too easy to peel away the layers of glitz and gloss and come up with a long list of inconsistencies, flaws and slightly irksome design decisions.

Clearly, IW recognized this as the big issue when trying to combine the game aspects of how to fight and what you\u2019re fighting for, and this became perfected later on in the series in later iterations.\n\nFor some reason, what really stuck out to me about this game (even after playing countless modern FPSs) is how smooth the vehicle combat was.  It was fair for the most part, but you\u2019d get hit randomly and it would raise the stakes enough for you to make your shots count and rely on the game\u2019s minimalist in-car cover system. \n\nIt felt better than 9 out of the 10 scripted car chases in games these days. I guess they just don\u2019t make them like they used to. \n\nI should also note that you can play these games on your monitor\u2019s native resolution.

It revolutionized the FPS genre by providing a narrative element. Along with that came the linear level design, since you cannot have proper storytelling without one. No more would the player just run around in the maze-like level design, picking off enemies, collecting keys and finding the exit to the next level. Love it or hate it, but what we know today as FPS is all thanks to Half Life.\n\nAfter Half Life, many games have come out with mechanics very similar to Half Life. Medal of Honor and Call of Duty were one of them.\n\nIt's important to note that Medal of Honor franchise was started up by Steven Spielberg himself - it has its roots in N64's Goldeneye. To be exact, Steven was inspired to make the game after he saw his son playing Goldeneye. Early Medal of Honor's would come out only on PS1, and would look very similar to Goldeneye. That said, in 2002 they would release Medal of Honor Allied Assault - made from ground up for pc. The most iconic moment of that game was the omaha beach level - copied straight out of the Saving Private Ryan movie. Unlike the older FPS games, it was very atmospheric, and that's all thanks to the narrative element. That said, the rest of the game lacks the atmosphere of the omaha beach level, mainly because throughout the whole game your character fights alone.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Call of Duty? Well, it so happened that during the development of Medal of Honor Allied Assault, a group of people left the development team and formed Infinite Ward. They got a contract with Activision and made Call of Duty, which would come out in 2003. It is said that the reason that group left is because EA wouldn't let them make a soviet campaign.\n\nAnyway, both games have a very similar feel, but there is one big difference. In call of duty - \"no man fights alone\". That's the line that was used to advertise the game, but it's 100% true.\n\nThere are 3 campaigns: American, British and Soviet. Just like Medal of Honor Allied Assault, many levels replicate existing movies. Like for example, American campaign is very similar to Band of Brothers, while the early levels of the Soviet campaign are from the movie Enemy at the Gates (which is a terrible movie with a few good scenes here and there).\n\nThe british campaign is the only one that doesn't follow the \"no man fights alone\" motto. Mainly because it's about a group of SAS operatives, doing various things behind the enemy lines.\n\nI suggest this game to anyone. Actually, this game will make you realize how little evolution in terms of mechanics we had in FPS genre. Here it is as simple as point and shoot. But that's not why i am suggesting it. I am suggesting it because how well it combines narrative and gameplay.\n\nAs for my statement above, for those who i interested. Personally, i think that shooters are generally very fun. That is why people always keep buying them and that's why there is so little evolution. Regenerative health, grenade toss back, knife button, sprint - i wouldn't really call them big evolution steps, mostly they just automate stuff that you can already do.

There are repeated characters and missions where they go over briefings but overall, I couldn\u2019t discern any plot other than kill everyone and follow the objectives. It tries to bring character into the mix by having named characters who sometimes have a line or two but it seems like an afterthought. The story is NOT the reason you play the game.\n\nThat being said, there is a lot of effort put into establishing atmosphere. As a russian soldier, you feel like fodder. As an American, you feel the ranks progressing and the desperate struggle to stay alive. It\u2019s not rich on narrative but the setting really pulls you in.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nIt\u2019s COD. You shoot other people. But surprisingly, health bar! Which means that you have to look around for packs and you\u2019re on the edge because you die pretty easily. It keeps the game tense especially when you\u2019re in tight hallways where people could come at you from different angles. The shooting itself feels actually pretty good. It holds up well as you take opportunities to pop out of cover to shoot at a guy at a distance or mow down close soldiers. Both sniping and machine gunning feel good and hell, even the tank section controls and plays well.\n\nThat being said, I never threw a grenade or used my pistol throughout the entire game so it might be kinda unbalanced. One big problem area is the AI. You usually have a few people with you except for a few missions where you\u2019re alone. It\u2019s really strange fighting alone because you\u2019re not freaking Rambo. Even if you start the level with comrades, they can die which can leave you alone at the end of the level. It\u2019s really annoying and I wish there was more group charges (like the end level which was awesome). There are short sequences where you have to wait for reinforcements and I found these to be annoying because you can wait for 2 minutes but for fucks sake 5 sodding minutes?\n\n[b]Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)[/b]\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to say this but the game looks fine. Old? Yes. But fine? Definitely. You know what you\u2019re shooting at and why. The outdoor environments are especially really nice as they tend to open up a bit more.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]\nThis game really shows a team with a good idea making a not perfect game. There are flaws but the core is really good. It\u2019s tense, it shows diversity in its levels, and it tries to be engaging. I\u2019m surprised I really liked it.", "timestamp_created": 1477985839, "timestamp_updated": 1477985839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26327436": {"recommendationid": "26327436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269655331", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494204701}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e!", "timestamp_created": 1477875202, "timestamp_updated": 1477875202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26273446": {"recommendationid": "26273446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326015479", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509322817}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Para su tiempo una excelentes gr\u00e1ficas y una historia que te atrapa, recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1477681102, "timestamp_updated": 1477681102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500907", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26269686": {"recommendationid": "26269686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088461259", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507685106}, "language": "french", "review": "Super bon jeu !

But in comparison to other first-person shooters released around the same time, this title holds up supringly well after all these years.\n\nI feel like many of these early 2000's first-person shooters have not aged particulary well, primairly when it comes down to the core gameplay loop, even if there is of course exceptions. And Call of Duty being one of them. Apart from the obvious graphical age, the game does feel very smooth in its general  gunplay and movement. Although the AI is not the best, it does it's job for the most part.\n\nThe levels are rather varied, as it takes place on both the eastern and western front and so are the scenarios, as they include anything from conventional warfare to special forces operations and even an infiltration. The perhaps obligatory \"turret-sequences\" seems to atleast generally work better then the ones in the newer installements, as there is something more glorious to riding in a \"french tin-can\" through enemy lines then blowing people up from a plane situated far out of reach for the enemy combatant. And while one should perhaps keep the technical limitations of the time at hand, a decent ammount of the levels are literally just corridors with the occasional boxes as cover, which is not too great.\n\nThere is an at the least decent variety of guns on all sides, all the most well-known equipment for each side essentially. Albeit a lack of heavy machineguns, as all parties make use of the MG42 for unknown reasons and handguns only exist for the americans and germans.\n\nAs far as the actual campaign goes, it covers the american, brittish and soviet war efforts on different front. The first one being as one might expect, largely being based on an airborne soldier and covers his adventures from D-day and beyond. The second brittish one, seemingly only covers one conventional battle, while the rest consists of more special operations as well as the occasional solo run, which I personally find less entertaining. And last but not least, the Soviet one, while the initial landing at Stalingrad makes for a memorable scene, questions need to be raised regarding it's authenticity, due to some reoccuring unfortunate tendencies when it comes to portraying them alongside the other factions. But after the initial scenes, it too does a a good portrayal of the war and has the most glorious ending.\n\nI have not played the multiplayer since probably about 12 years, so I won't go too deep into what it is about, but to my understanding there are still a few servers with a fairly active community up and running.\n\nIn conclusion, I would very much recommend this title if you can handle the aging graphics, although it may still be a bit expensive for being older then a decade, so one might want to wait for a sale in that case.", "timestamp_created": 1472873044, "timestamp_updated": 1472873990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25312059": {"recommendationid": "25312059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170218702", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514320993}, "language": "english", "review": "The first game of the Call of Duty franchise!

This three-word video game title would make most gamers cringe. Recent Call of Duty titles trend towards science-fiction setting and the fanbase are strongly divided in this issue. Gamers (in general) are a bit tired of hearing Call of Duty on gaming newsfeed and want to hear something else. Before Call of Duty was on identity crisis, there was a simpler time back in 2003 when an unknown title dominated many Game of the Year titles and projected first-person shooter genre into new heights. \n\nCall of Duty (2003) is a World War II first-person shooter where you play as three soldiers from the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. Each campaign is based upon historical significance such as the Western Front in late 1944 for the British and American campaign, the Battle for Stalingrad (1942), to intense street battles in the Fall of Berlin (1945). Most first person shooters in the early 2000s were mostly World War II, but Call of Duty was unique at the time because of the sound effects, AI interaction, music composition, and a solid first person shooter. The audio and sound effects are outstanding. Without a doubt. The audio is very loud and is \u201cauthentic\u201d with the MG-42 firing continuously, the mortars pounding the ground, or German Stukas dive bombing on your allies\u2019 positions. For the game that came out in 2003, this is very impressive. \n\nThe enemy AI is competent who would take cover and shoot back, or flank against your position. This presents a good challenge for the player and encourages to conduct some tactical maneuvers, not recklessly charging upfront and spraying bullets like a maniac. The music composition is solid with orchestral music and fantastic soundtrack. Personally, I really enjoy listening to the soundtrack. Ultimately, the game has health packs and medic kits alongside with no health regeneration. This strongly encourage the player to take cover and carefully advance toward the objective while paying attention to one\u2019s health status. \n\nOne negative criticism for the game is the price. $20 (or regional equivalent) for a game that came out since 2003. There are other game titles that came out way later and the price is cheaper than this. The Steam Sales usually cuts by -50%, nothing more than that. Essentially, this criticism comes directly towards Activision and its greedy policy. I find this bitterly disappointing. As frequently mentioned throughout the review, the game was released in 2003 and playing this game in modern PC architecture would lead to some problems. Few examples are the inability to play in widescreen resolutions (though there is a solution to this), and other technical issues that gamers personally can\u2019t get it to work or function correctly. \n\nCall of Duty was a great franchise (emphasis the word, was). Many fans debate among themselves on what Call of Duty game was considered as the \u201clast great game\u201d. The franchise usually leans on historical or modern settings, but the futuristic or science-fiction genre caused many to leave or show grave dissatisfaction. If you want to travel back to a historical time where the franchise actually did very well in the gaming market, then this game (and up to Modern Warfare trilogy or your personal opinion) is for you. In my perspective, the Call of Duty games that took place in World War II was considered as the best and many people who played this setting would agree with that. With raging elementary school children dominating multiplayer in later titles, it is best to say for any sane individual to enjoy the nostalgia and play the single player campaign with ease and peace of mind.", "timestamp_created": 1466647072, "timestamp_updated": 1466739281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23673246": {"recommendationid": "23673246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088958951", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486916792}, "language": "english", "review": "Aaa Childhood memories:) Easy worth the money", "timestamp_created": 1466447939, "timestamp_updated": 1466447939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23644265": {"recommendationid": "23644265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310986756", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496620728}, "language": "english", "review": "I cant get the game to work on windows 10.

Si tratta del primo, vero, grande fps bellico, dal momento che \u00e8 ambientato durante la seconda guerra mondiale.\nVenendo all'analisi, dal punto di vista tecnico, il gioco eccelle. La grafica \u00e8 assai gradevole, moderatamente dettagliata, il sonoro \u00e8 sublime, sia per quanto riguarda le armi sia per quanto riguarda le voci e i rumori d'ambiente; inoltre, il motore \u00e8 solidissimo e anche con tantissimi personaggi sullo schermo e tonnellate di proiettili, il gioco, anche su computer recenti ma poco performanti, non mostra alcun rallentamento. La I.A. dei nemici \u00e8 valida, ma non sublime, anche se essi reagiranno alle nostre azioni, cercheranno riparo dietro muri, colonne ecc. e fuggiranno alla vista di una granata.\nIl gameplay \u00e8 sicuramente un dato d'eccellenza del gioco, con qualche difettuccio: movimenti, sistema di aiming, shooting ecc. sono notevolmente fluidi; \u00e8 possibile svolgere tutte le azioni tipiche degli fps (saltare, accovacciarsi, sporgersi da un angolo) con l'aggiunta della possibilit\u00e0 di strisciare sul tasto CTRL; il gameplay \u00e8 vario, in quanto si passa da azioni in campo aperto ad azioni pi\u00f9 di supporto o sabotaggio; da inseguimenti su camion o auto a manovrare la contraerea per abbattere aerei Luftwaffe fino a entrare in un vero e proprio carro armato. Tra le note dolenti, per\u00f2, l'eccessiva difficolt\u00e0, le missioni a \"tempo\", lo spawning infinito dei nemici nelle suddette e il fatto di essere troppo \"scriptate\" di alcune di esse, ovvero che si dovr\u00e0 risolvere solo in un modo e altri approcci saranno un po' vani; nelle missioni in campo aperto, comunque, si ha carta bianca, anche se il limitato numero di tipi di armi (fucili, fucili da cecchino e d'assalto, pi\u00f9 una pistola e granate di vari tipi) contrapposto a una veriet\u00e0 complessiva di singole armi, rendono gli approcci alle missioni un po' uguali. \nSottolineo comunque l'ottima variet\u00e0 dei paesaggi e l'eccelso level design.\nTrama, storia e personaggi ripercorrono le vicende della seconda guerra mondiale inserendo un certo dato d'invenzione, articolando il tutto attraverso tre campagne: USA, Gran Bretagna e Russia, pi\u00f9 tre missioni singole finali una per ciascuna campagna.\nLa longevit\u00e0 non \u00e8 eccelsa ma aumenta vista la facilit\u00e0 in cui si muore, direi una decina d'ore a normale se ci si gioca una prima volta, meno se si rigioca.\nIn definitiva, \u00e8 un assoluto Capolavoro, ben lontano dagli orridi CoD di oggi, soprattutto per l'ottimo single-player, di gran lunga la pi\u00f9 importante modalit\u00e0 in un videogioco.\n\nPro:\n- Epico, immersivo, realistico e fomentante\n- Missioni varie\n- Buona grafica, ambienti e level design, con ottimo sonoro\n- Buona I.A.\n\nContro:\n- Si tende a morire un po' facilmente\n- Si possono portare solo due armi + la pistola\n\nVoto: 9/10\n\n______________________________FOR NON ITALIAN VIEWIERS_______________________________\nSimply epic IIWW fps with awesome gameplay and nice grapichs and I.A.\nFunny, realistic but quite short.\nBuy it.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1457995941, "timestamp_updated": 1474314286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21804465": {"recommendationid": "21804465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019711553", "num_games_owned": 1458, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503608797}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Um dos melhores cl\u00e1ssicos FPS da 2\u00aa Guerra Mundial.\n\nPara a \u00e9poca, est\u00e1 muito bom.", "timestamp_created": 1457836552, "timestamp_updated": 1457836552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21801201": {"recommendationid": "21801201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029565135", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517167288}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "When CoD had honor...", "timestamp_created": 1457823169, "timestamp_updated": 1457823169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21774900": {"recommendationid": "21774900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967252783", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501448229}, "language": "german", "review": "ein guter alter klassiker. werk auf jeden fall errinerungen", "timestamp_created": 1457732506, "timestamp_updated": 1457732506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21758916": {"recommendationid": "21758916", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980079138", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518466179}, "language": "english", "review": "I have always enjoyed Call of Duty for its singleplayer campaign, it's still one of the greatest out there.", "timestamp_created": 1457667279, "timestamp_updated": 1457667279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21736724": {"recommendationid": "21736724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002548751", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457653764}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my all time favorites.

Sort of like having a bipolar girlfriend.\nSo, I have mixed feelings on this.  On one hand I'd like to recommend the game, but on the other, I wouldn't.\nI like the WW11 setting.  I get a feel for the atmosphere.  But the gameplay is extremely irritating.  Enemies are bullet sponges.  You can't mow them down with a machine gun or at close range with your primary weapon.  Most times, after 3 or 4 shots, they fall to the ground only to get back up, brush themselves off and continue fighting you.  A couple times I found myself reloading after what I thought was a kill (close range 3 rounds into the enemy) and during my reload animation the a$$ hat got back up and killed me.  WTF???  Anyways, now I know better.  I make sure they're dead before reloading.  \nI found hit detection to be a problem, as well.  I've shot numerous rounds at enemies that were directly in my sight and found myself having to compensate to make hits.\nThe most annoying part is your team/allies.  They get in your way and can get you killed.  There's nothing like walking through a corridor or staircase with a member of your squad directly following behind you.  As you turn a corner you find yourself in conflict and want to retreat back around the corner.  But you can't because your a$$ hat teammate is humping your leg and won't back off.  *Dead*  So I always let that f****r go first if possible.  When you need a quick escape, you can bet there will be someone, somewhere, that will get in your way.\nFor a war game, first of it's kind or not, I am struck with awe that there is no way to sprint.  I am talking about the original COD here and how it was originally designed.  I served in the Army, and one of the first things they teach you in basic training is the 3-5 second rush.  So, needless to say I was very irritated trying to advance from point to point  without being able to rush for cover.  This may be a minor gripe, but I feel it's important to have something like that in a war game.  I can't understand why it wasn't there.  Oh well, let me walk to this cover point while I get shot up.  Need a health pack?  Let me walk over to the health and hope I don't die in route.  Sometimes you'll grab a health pack only to get shot the f**k up in the second it took you to turn around to take cover.\n\nI somewhat like the game, and like I said, only playing it to play through the franchise.  I had high hopes for it since it was given a lot of praise.

Nonostante sia datato (2003) il gioco \u00e8 tranquillamente godibile anche ora.\n\n\u00c8 diviso in 3 campagne: americana, britannica e russa, dove si impersonificano 3 differenti soldati dei 3 eserciti.\n\nLe missioni sono ambientate in vari luoghi e sono abbastanza varie: sono presenti una fuga in auto, una in camion, la difesa di un ponte tramite l'uso di un cannone anticarro, l'abbattimento di Stuka con una contraerea, una missione a bordo di un carro armato russo con, ovviamente, scontri a fuoco con i Panzer tedeschi.\nNelle missioni \"canoniche\"alla fine si tratta sempre di sparare ad ogni tedesco che si pari davanti: un bello sparatutto vecchio stile, insomma.\nMi sono rimaste impresse anche alcune scene del gioco, molto toccanti per certi versi.\n\nDa un punto di vista tecnico, le armi sono decisamente ben fatte e abbastanza fedeli alle originali, anche se ovviamente qualcosa poteva essere migliore, come il fuoco delle MG42. Anche gli effetti sonori ambientali personalmente mi piacciono molto.\nUn lato negativo forse \u00e8 la IA: bene o male i soldati nemici non faranno altro che ripararsi dietro qualcosa per qualche secondo e poi sporgere la testa per sparare, oppure correre in campo aperto pronti per farsi ammazzare. Ci\u00f2 che rende difficili alcune missioni \u00e8 pi\u00f9 che mai la quantit\u00e0 di nemici.\n\nNon sono particolarmente ferrato con la storia, ma da quanto so le vicende che il gioco narra sono anche storicamente accurate.", "timestamp_created": 1452210011, "timestamp_updated": 1452210011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20306275": {"recommendationid": "20306275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970364091", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 189, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449097960}, "language": "spanish", "review": "6/10", "timestamp_created": 1451945738, "timestamp_updated": 1451945738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20292934": {"recommendationid": "20292934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993298881", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504269080}, "language": "english", "review": "Can anyone help im running win 8.1 just got call of duty war chest i can play cod 2 but not cod 1", "timestamp_created": 1451918824, "timestamp_updated": 1451918824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20281668": {"recommendationid": "20281668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092829897", "num_games_owned": 874, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452985234}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome nostalgic game that everyone can appreciate.

It's SO HARD.  I set the game on normal, I'm not sure if it glitched and turned it to insane because man, that enemy AI is so flipping good, everything is BS.  \n\nI had to hold this building down that I just killed loads of germans to take back.  So after already killing 40 of them to get this building, I now have to kill another 100 guys plus 6 tanks.  Not at the same time of course but within like 6 minutes.  They just keep coming, to take down the tanks there are 2 anti tank rifles places at crappy places, one of them is right where the enemys are coming up so you are screwed if that ONE guy covering two stair cases die, so you have to fight and kill as many of them as you can so he doesn't die while trying to take out tanks when they show up, and you have to figure out which place the tank spawns to go to which ever rifle meanwhile protecting that guy.  \n\nBut guess what?  After me saving his ass and there's only a minute left, he throws a fucking GRENADE.... right at his feet and he just curls up in a F**CKING ball and BLOWS UP!!!!  After all that, after me working so hard to save him, he just kills himself, and right after that a German comes up the stairs and KILLS ME.  So I restart and do it all over again, I get passed it and 10 of our tanks show up... when we already killed everyone.  WHAT?!  \n\nSo then we go onto the next mission, it spawns you without much info and you instantly have to kill people, I mean instantly you're in a fire fight.  You then go through buildings getting COMPLETELY screwed over, using most of your ammo, running out of health with the most crazy ai that shoot you so badly and omg they're just so good.  I barely find health and most of teammates die\n\n After killing the guys and you're about to get to the next bit, a few more of your new teammates show up replacing the ones that die and then you get to this really stupid bit.  I thought I was done the stupidness but it just got even worse.  I got to this trainyard where there were loads of enemys and artillary fire was hitting us.  And guess what?  My teammates are talking and it's actually OUR guys that our shooting at this location, and they said they don't even know we're here, and they also said even if they did know, they probably would shoot here anyways?  WHAT?\n\nSo I'm in this place, the Germans are everywhere and owning the crap out of me and then guess what, I run out of ammo on my sniper and my sub machine gun but luckily I killed most of them so it takes all I got to take out that last guy... while I was killing the last guy, I could see 10 green dots around the corner and loads of gun shots, I come around to see what the fus is about and... there's a tank, and only one of my guys left.  \n\nLUCKILY there's a rocket right there so I use it to destroy the tank.  YEY, oh wait, there's like 20 Germans in that hanger that are the best flipping guys ever, I swear they were all Rambo.  So I go back and find a sniper on the ground.   I go to the hanger and start trying to hit these shots but man is it hard, they're so good and I manage to kill at least 10 of them.  My teammate runs in there and actually survives and is in there shooting them but I'm still back here trying to kill the remaining guys that are behind all these pillars in there.  I finally stick my head out to see the few last guys and I get shot 5 times in less than a millisecond and DIE.  RESTART from the start of the trainyard.  I quit right away. \n\n\n\n I'm going to be back and I will beat this but OMG this game was a lot of fun until Jason Statham showed up.  Once I saw him it was like the game changed to insane.  It was so much fun.  I'll give this game that though, It's a war simulator.  I mean I feel like crap, I feel so stressed and feel so tense.  I do recommend this game, but just play the first few missions and then get out of here because WW2 was kinda fun for like 30 minutes, but once it comes to it, it was horrible.\n\n\nBelow is after 30 minutes of gameplay\n\nI've only played a bit more than half an hour, already hooked.  The first Call of Duty I played was Black Ops.  That game is awesome, but this game is better.  I'm so sad that I never played this one before.  You know why this is so much better?  NO FUTURE CRAP.  You move as a unit, you feel like you're REALLY there, staying together, moving together.  Just so good!  You know what's also good?  Being able to have to primary weapons PLUS a sidearm.  How all games should be.  Not sure why they took this out of the one later in the series.  STUPID.  \n\nThis game feels like if they kept going in this direction, they would have WW2 SIMULATOR DOWN.

Subsequently some of the development team went their own way, and thus created Call of Duty. \n\nI have to say, given the amount of time this has been out, and it's only taken 12 years for me to 'give in' and give CoD a shot, because I've always seen the game-series itself 'tarnished' by it's more modern work, especially all this guff being created with advanced-advanced-advanced warfare. \nThe series itself of CoD, is more robust, proper and rooted properly with their earlier work. Subsequently- this makes the mark, and makes it an honour to play such a game.\n\nAlright, into the nitty-gritty. It's a game, alright from 2003.... graphics are going to be limited- bear in mind this was awesome stuff from back in the day, stuff which was top of its peak.\nPerformance wise, on a semi-good/mid-range rig.

I get the bridge, kill the tank, kill all germans and my officer will not end the quest. Restart level, I get the bridge, tank comes, but I cannot go to kill him, becasue the engineer who must go with me, is \"inactive\". Restart level.

The longevity and multiple entries into the series are a continual cause of debate, argument and even insult. And it all started here in 2003 with the very first entry.\n\nI'll keep it relatively brief here since I go into a lot more detail in my episode on Call of Duty for my web series Knee-Deep in the Dead (found [url=https://youtu.be/askWqepLNVY]HERE[/url]).\n\nCoD sets you up in three different campaigns, American, Russian and British and was one of the first FPSes to really work towards a larger, battlefield experience. Two levels that showcase this goal the best are the invasion and defense of Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise in the American Campaign, and the Battle of Stalingrad in the Russian campaign.\n\nThe sound design and environments are one of the best stand outs of Call of Duty. The guns are all loud and reflect their real-world counterparts. Some negatives would largely be the very baseline AI, lack of enemy variety and the fact that, even when you have allies around you, enemies more often than not target you.\n\nCall of Duty is a fascinating object of study when it comes to evaluation of the evolution of a game series. In playing the first entry, you can see all of the budding elements that would eventually become core \"staples\" of the campaign: scripting, having to wait for sergeant to boot down the door, press \"F\" to do thing, simple AI and stories seemingly assembled solely for the set pieces. Also, a side note is that it seems a /bit/ overpriced on Steam...$20 for a 12-year old game is kind of silly. You'd likely be better off getting the War chest, since it has the expansion pack to CoD and Call of Duty 2. Which has one of my favorite CoD levels ever, the Battle of Pointe du Hoc.\n\nNevertheless, the first Call of Duty is an important entry in the series to play, though it's much easier without nostaliga goggles and truly seeing it for what it was: an immersive, action shooter that helped ensure the FPS genre kept fighting WWII for 6-7 years afterwards.", "timestamp_created": 1444743528, "timestamp_updated": 1444743528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18450516": {"recommendationid": "18450516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028241902", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503042031}, "language": "english", "review": "Forever classic", "timestamp_created": 1444704256, "timestamp_updated": 1444704256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18442660": {"recommendationid": "18442660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174785558", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505432657}, "language": "english", "review": "Cocka of Doodle is the best RPG game that i never seen, with blazing 1p graphics and some random actor that i dont know. how do i shoot xdidieiidiz", "timestamp_created": 1444660938, "timestamp_updated": 1449266749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431655", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18436782": {"recommendationid": "18436782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135907182", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510967561}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u6709\u6570\u5b57\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u526f\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u771f\u00b7\u4f7f\u547d\u53ec\u5524\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e4b\u5904\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u4e91\u5b58\u6863\u3002\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u7528S/L\u5927\u6cd5\u65b9\u80fd\u78d5\u78d5\u7eca\u7eca\u6253\u8fc7\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1444611862, "timestamp_updated": 1444611862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18371733": {"recommendationid": "18371733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084446270", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420488794}, "language": "english", "review": "Ah, the nostalgia.

gioco \u00e8 completamente in italiano (testo + doppiaggio)\n\nBene vediamo com'era call of duty prima di diventare commerciale.\n\nIo personalmente l'ho trovato fantastico sotto ogni punto di vista\n\nTrama/Missioni: La trama si svolge nella seconda guerra mondiale diviso 3 tipi di campagne diverse:\n-Campagna Statunitense\n-Campagna Britannica\n-Campagna Sovietica\nMi \u00e8 piaciuto molto il fatto che impersoni 3 personaggi diversi (anche se alla fine cambiano solo le armi e le ambientazioni).\nTutti eserciti alleati contro i nazisti, ognuno ha il suo punto di vista.\nQua il punto potremmo dire che di trama ce n'\u00e8 veramente poca, sono le missioni che sono molto ben fatte, e molte di esse sono realmente accadute (almeno leggendo su wikipedia).\nIl ponte di Pegasus, La diga di Eder , La corazzata Tirpitz, ecc.\nSaranno gusti personali ma io sinceramente preferisco questi tipi di missioni invece che avere una trama di un gioco (almeno nei giochi della prima-seconda guerra mondiale)\n\nArmi: Ce ne sono parecchie per ogni campagna. Diciamo anche tante per essere un gioco del 2003, solo che ho trovato un \"difetto\" in queste armi, tutti i fucili sono troppo precisi.\nNon servir\u00e0 avere per forza un fucile da cecchino, ogni tipo di fucile  \u00e8 accurato alla perfezione.\n\nIa alleati: Non saprei se metterlo come un difetto o come un pregio.\nNon fraintendete, sono molto intelligenti come bot, forse fin troppo. Mi ricordo ancora nella prima missione che praticamente facevano tutto loro. Ogni volta che ne moriva uno si aggiungeva un altro, quindi potevano magari metterne di meno di bot, metterne forse solo uno e basta (come in una delle ultime missioni).\n\nGameplay: Il gameplay l'ho trovato molto classico, sembrava di giocare a \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\" ma pi\u00f9 \"tattico\" e meno \"frenetico\".\n\nDoppiaggio italiano: Ben messo pure questo con voci di doppiatori che conosciamo gi\u00e0.\n\n\nConclusione:\n\nChe dire come esperienza di gioco mi ha divertito molto.\nSapere che qualche missione \u00e8 realmente esistita mi ha fatto incuriosire e informarmi su internet di queste ultime.\nForse come pecca potrei dire che dura poco (l'ho finito in 5 ore), ma che comunque vi consiglio di acquistarlo (magari il pack di Warchest o World War II Bundle, che quando li scontano sono pi\u00f9 convenienti del gioco singolo)", "timestamp_created": 1439720282, "timestamp_updated": 1459359577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736660", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17560263": {"recommendationid": "17560263", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977280577", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408354935}, "language": "italian", "review": "Unico nel suo genere...ha fatto la storia e ha preparato il mondo a vedere cos'\u00e9 la guerra, non solo un ''gioco''. 10!

Developed by Infinity Ward (members that left 2015 Inc. to form their own studio after the development of Medal of Honor Allied Assault) this is their vision of war.\n\nThis game took heavy inspiration from the developer's previous title (Medal of Honor Allied Assault) and so some elements may seem similar if you played their previous title you'll see some similarities such as standard health and the classic espionage mission that was in a lot of WWII games at the time. However this game contained three shorter campaigns with different soldiers in different armies and it's quite cool fighting in France, Russia, Germany etc. Graphically it won't wow you but there are some really good set pieces with the Russian campaign being the best as it was quite brutal going out into battle without a weapon. Music is nice and gameplay wise it's great. I was playing Black Ops II alongside it and my favourite thing about the earlier Call of Duty titles and FPS games in general was that you could usually go at your own pace. No waiting for characters to talk your ear off for half the game. Maybe a sentence or two then off you go! The game is linear but gives you a long enough leash that it doesn't fully hold you back compared to the more mordern titles. Shooting is fun and responsive, you have some good weapon variety and you feel like a soldier just trying to survive and do his duty... THE CALL OF DUTY! :P\n\nAs a WWII shooter it's fun, the only problems I have is that it's a little short and I wasn't able to find a game in the multiplayer. This game at most goes on sale for 50% off so don't expect a great deal. Is it worth playing? Depends if you like WWII shooters and if you don't mind a short but fun campaign. If you do get it I'm sure you'll have a good time with it.

Then I remembered vaguely that this original Call of Duty game had a mission at the beginning where you're part of the 101st Airbourne on D-Day and thought it might be cool to play through that mission and see how similar it was to the movie. It's identical. Infinity Ward didn't even try to shy away from the fact that they borrowed heavily from \"Band of Brothers\" in their very first in a massively successful franchise, Call of Duty. I mean, there are lines in the cutscenes that are directly from the movie. So this Call of Duty is essentially the Band of Brothers video game and the first couple missions let you personally experience those epic moments like fighting through the trenches on D-Day as you work to destroy the artillery guns. Unfortunetly, this game has not aged well. \n\nThe graphics are likely the first thing you'll notice when you boot this game up. The game requires you to edit the config.ini file just to put in an HD resolution, and even then the textures, models, and animations are severely dated. They were fantastic for their time, don't et me wrong. But they just did not age as well as some of the later games. Explosions are weak, the gun is awkwardly small compared to the screensize, and all of your fellow soldiers will waddle around like their pants are falling off which really pulls you out of the experience. The graphics aren't the only thing that didn't age well though. \n\nOne of my biggest complaints about this game are the terrible British campaign missions. Instead of giving us more epic largescale World War II battles, Infinity Ward felt it necessary to sprinkle in a whole lengthy and boring campaign of almost solo missions where you infilitrate Nazi supply depots, hydroelectric dams, and battleships and just absolutely obliterate hundreds of nazis by yourself. These missions are typical of shooters back in the day, which is a shame because Call of Duty is revolutionary for its contribution to the idea of having larger open battles with more friendly AI fighting alongside you. Thankfully the game comes back to full strength in the final campaign that features the Russians reclaiming stalingrad and eventually capturing Berlin. The crossing of the river into Stalingrad is as epic as any D-Day mission with tons of soldiers storming the beach and plenty of gunfire, artillery, and planes flying overhead. It really was surprising to see a mission of this scale put into a game this old. \n   Another major problem with this game is the outdated health system. It's a static health bar that will only replenish if you find healthpacks that are scattered throughout the missions. There's at least 3 different types of health packs that give you varying amounts of health. The problem with this system is that even one shot from an enemy submachine gun will drop your health down to half or even lower and the game barely does anything to let you know how close you are to death. Dying becomes so frequent and frustrating that it turns into a game of absolute luck, running from cover to cover and spamming F5 to quicksave the game. The health system wouldn't be as bad if not for the overly difficult enemy AI. I played on the \"Hardened\" difficulty which is not even the hardest setting, and whenever I peaked out to get a view at a Nazi soldier, they instantly are aware that I can see them and stop everything they're doing and start firing directly at me, even if there's allied soldiers standing right next to them. The same is true for enemy tanks and enemy MG42 machine gun nests. If you peak out of a corner to shoot at one of these enemies, you have about half a second before they turn their gun and start perfectly firing at you, and once that happens, your screen will continuously jump upwards preventing you from landing a shot on the enemy. Not to mention enemies generally take more than 1 shot to kill which can be frustrating when you're stuck with mostly bolt-action rifles. \n   Finally, there's no sprint button. I know this was back in the day when sprinting was not expected in shooter games, but it feels really absent in a war game that requires a lot of cover-to-cover movement. Oh! And friendly allied units can accidentally shoot you in the back and kill you, which happens very frequently. Never in all of the shooter games that I have ever played have I ever found a game where your own friendly units can shoot you in the back and actually kill you. That is an impossibly stupid design choice. \n\nSo despite the graphical shortcomings, the poorly designed middle campaign, and the outdated gameplay mechanics, Call fo Duty is a classic that features some intense battles from World War II and a great game to help you relive the experiences (albeit very watered down and unrealistic in comparison) that are represented more acturetly in \"Band of Brothers.\"", "timestamp_created": 1437318485, "timestamp_updated": 1437318485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439367", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17110778": {"recommendationid": "17110778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124762265", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420098652}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ubaa8\uc744\ub824\uace0 \uc0b0\uac70. \n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1437240596, "timestamp_updated": 1437240620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17103227": {"recommendationid": "17103227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164523963", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450983546}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this classic", "timestamp_created": 1437201869, "timestamp_updated": 1437201869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17072732": {"recommendationid": "17072732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050394059", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1337670000}, "language": "english", "review": "the only main flagship installment in the cod series not to be on the xbox 360 at the time of this review which is kinda wierd cuz all of cod but one game has only lived through one console cycle", "timestamp_created": 1437033128, "timestamp_updated": 1437033128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17049899": {"recommendationid": "17049899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137412822", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498690115}, "language": "english", "review": "i cannot get it to play wont down load the whole game this one and call of duty united offence", "timestamp_created": 1436905101, "timestamp_updated": 1436905101, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17037743": {"recommendationid": "17037743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136848975", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433734882}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic...", "timestamp_created": 1436843650, "timestamp_updated": 1436843650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16955168": {"recommendationid": "16955168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966533360", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434979914}, "language": "english", "review": "Great WW2 shooter that redefined a genre.

Let's start this up with the first one then.\n\nSo let's just get this over with from the start, the original Call of Duty is a classic and a great game. That said, i think people overrate it waaay above of where it actually stands. First off, the game has a pretty crappy story which is basically just composed of different missions in the second world war. The gunplay is fun, but feels a little weak compared to many other games of the era. Remember that this game came out in 2003 and by that we already could have had fun with the Venom Gun in Return to Castle Wolfenstein for two years.\n\nThe game includes a total of three different campaigns. One for each of the British, US, and Soviet factions. Funnily enough, you only fight the Nazis in this game regardless. Which makes the campaigns rather similar besides from having different weaponry at your disposal. Remember that this was before they got the series staple regenerating health, so the missions can be vastly different from one another. At one point you are playing a generic CoD sandbag mission and the next you have to kill 100 dudes alone in a bunker, which makes it really odd and unbalanced honestly.\n\nAlthough this might sound like a bit of ranting, i did have fun with the game. Especially once they introduced the Sturmgewehr 44 as a weapon, that gun is pretty awesome and i highly recommend picking it up whenever possible. And while i said the missions can be a mixed bag, they also bring out something the later CoD games are missing. Variety. Which made the game a breeze to play through. The game took me around 6 hours to beat, but it's really all in the player. I found it a tad too easy for my tastes on the regular difficulty, but then again i didn't have to save scum at all.\n\nI guess i should give these a score rating since i'll be going through the entire series.\n\nOn a scale of 44 Nazi helmets being good, and 5 million dead jews being bad. I'll give this game a rating of \"Certified Tiger Tank\"\n\nIt's pretty good fun for what it lasts, but don't buy it for the full price on Steam. 20\u20ac for a game this old is just ludicrous.", "timestamp_created": 1435148806, "timestamp_updated": 1435148806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16669437": {"recommendationid": "16669437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140869327", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435001742}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember when i first got into FPS.

We start off as a simple American rookie in boot camp where we are thought the basics of crawling, shooting and reloading. Before you know it you are sent right to the heat of battle and left to fend for yourself as your allies are too busy trying to survive to help the recruit. It was a pretty cool intro that immediately reminds you that you are just a simple soldier not John Rambo. There is no regenerating health but instead you must rely on health kits to restore your health. It forces you to play much more smartly and knowing when to duck and hide while letting your allies take the fatal wounds in your stead.  You are very rarely alone and will have allies watching your back throughout most of the battles. \n\nUnfortunately your allies can prove to be just as fatal to your as the enemies. They will occasionally block your path while you are under fire and have a habit of looking into your barrel while you are trying to line up a shot. You are not allowed to shoot them since the gun won't fire when you aim at them but they somehow find ways to get killed by your bullets. They are not completely awful and will frequently save your life but they can be quite a burden at times. Later on you will also play through the eyes of a British and Russian solider which have completely different feel and take place simultaneously to the American war efforts.\n\nEach nation has their own unique set of weapons but the Germans use different guns so you will run out of ammo and have to rely on scavenged German weapons in all three campaigns. The British campaign is the weak point of the three as you will usually be \u201cinfiltrating\u201d some place but it always ends up with you killing tons upon tons of enemies by yourself or with a few allies which feels very out of place from the chaos of the other two campaigns. Chaos is where the Russian campaign exceeds. It is very brutal and you better pay attention to what people are saying and duck when you hear them say so or you will without a doubt die. Your comrades won't even equip you with a gun, just a round of ammo and tell you to run up a hill where the Russians are being slaughtered by the dozens. Gods help you if you stop running to collect a gun and some more ammo, they will assume that you are a coward  that froze up and gun you down killing all sense of comradery between you and the people at your back.\n\nGun play is top notch and is very fluid. All the guns feel unique and sound very powerful. It is truly a pleasure to the ears to hear the battle around you and  everything comes together to be very immersive. The Germans have far superior aim than your allies and it can be annoying how accurate they are with anything in their hands including mounted machine guns. Your allies are pretty capable when they are rushing toward the enemy but as soon as they are stationary they suddenly have the aim of a drunk Stormtrooper. You are equally as accurate as the enemy with most guns and are capable of leaning sideways without moving which is very useful. Up to two weapons of your choice can be carried along with your pistol and grenades. It does present a problem when there are tanks in the area and you are forced to carry one since your allies are always extremely reliant on you even if the anti-tank launcher is right next to them.\n\nGraphics are obviously dated and it does not support modern resolutions out of the box. You will have to tweak the config files a bit for HD. It is surprisingly pretty tame on violence. There is no gore and the only blood is a small burst when shot that quickly evaporates. Music is great, sound effects are incredible and voice acting is pretty good too minus the Russians. Multiplayer is only played by a few dozen people and it's alright. Nothing special but it is pretty fun though expect a challenge from the veterans that still play this game. You will not be on foot throughout all of the campaign, you control a tank for a brief mission and will have to occasionally shoot out of a moving vehicle. The latter can be a bit frustrating since you do not regain health and have no way to avoid damage other than shooting them before they fire a shot at you. \n\nThis is still a great title that holds up well to this day. The only feature that would be odd to modern FPS gamers is the health kits required to survive but other than that you should be able to fit right in. All the things that make a game like graphics, sound effects and gameplay work very well with each other in this title and it makes it a immersive and brutal experience throughout. This is definitely not the Call of Duty to get if you want to play multiplayer though. Outside of the campaign there is nothing else to do and there is no incentive to replay it again so it is the type of game were you play through it once and delete it. It is one hell of a ride though and  highly recommended to those seeking a single player World War 2 experience.", "timestamp_created": 1432259754, "timestamp_updated": 1432259754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15902592": {"recommendationid": "15902592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069863156", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477935264}, "language": "english", "review": "The Classic !", "timestamp_created": 1432053727, "timestamp_updated": 1432053727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15883098": {"recommendationid": "15883098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970509330", "num_games_owned": 718, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 2546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494028764}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic world war 2 shooter.

Call of Duty sets itself in WWII, but unlike others. this isn't just a game that glorifies one side of the battle, specifically within the American ranks. Something that has been done for too many times to the likes of Medal of Honor and Brothers in Arms. \nCampaign missions are diverse as they're spread out across the different Allied  , ranging from the Americans to the Soviets and British.

It doesn't have regenerating health, it has a different game engine, combat flows differently, and you are a regular soldier, not a super soldier or super agent.\n\nThe campaign follows three nations battle against the Third Reich and their constantly growing military. You play as Americans, British and Russian soldiers in different battles against different groups of the massive Nazi Army. As the American solider, you are fighting in France in a desperate battle to claim land and villages from the Nazi's, as the British, you go from standard soldier to SAS agent, and charge on Stalingrad as a Russian soldier starting as a lowly conscript and end as a senior soldier. In the campaign, you never feel invincible, and unlike modern Call of Duty games, you will almost always have a large amount of soldiers with you, rather than going alone or with a single invincible commanding officer. This doesn't make the game easier however, the lack of regenerating health means that it is unwise to carelessly move, especially on higher difficulties where having low health and no health kits for another mile can make the games campaign brutally difficult.\n\nThe soundtrack is a high-point for the game as well, with memorable themes. The voice acting is far from modern Call of Duty's Hollywood voice acting, but then again, it can stand with it as an equal because nearly all the Call of Duty games have bad voice acting (minus Kevin Spacey, he was the best part of Advanced Warfare of course!). The sound effects hold up to players because they were re-used for several more games, and as they stand, they aren't exactly low-quality.\n\nVisually, the game has aged since release, with odd faces, bad animations and low-resolution environment textures. The gun models are noticeably lower detail compared to Call of Duty 2's models as well. Despite this, the visuals only get in the way if you decide to only focus on them. The engine is clearly quite old, but the game runs well on modern computers for most of the time. The only real annoyance is the lack of support for most resolutions, meaning that .cfg configurations are needed to run in resolutions such as 1920x1080.\n\nDespite its problems, Call of Duty still stands as one of the best in the series, the game may be visually aged, it may lack the narrative focus of later games, but it stands taller because it focuses more on spectacular battles and large set pieces instead of plot and the excessive use of QTE's. I ultimately recommend this game to anyone who loves Call of Duty to see how the series should be done, and lovers of the genre as Call of Duty, and its expansion pack, United Offensive make the best the series.

The gameplay is FUN, the guns are awesome, and feel great., the weapon you will be using the most is the MP40, its powerfull, all troops carry it, and plentifull ammo. Now cod is split into 3 campaigns, i will review each.\n\nThe Americans\n\nThe worst, its basicly a tutorial, gets you in the ropes, but the only redemming quality is the revisted last mission, were you sabotage V2 rockets.\n\nThe British\n\n2nd best, lots of sabotage, airdroping into the french country side, and plus Captain Price.\n\nThe Russians (Putin Aproved)\n\nThe best, INTENSE FIGHTS, difficult, and the ending is amazing (if youve beat you will know what i mean)\n\nThe Multiplayer\n\nIts okay, but you cant change/mod the FOV, so that sucks.\n\nOver all Call Of Duty Is What I \"Call\" A FPS Game, i Reccomend Buying It In The Warchest Bundle, Comes With COD:UO And COD 2.

As I felt with Call of Duty 2, it was kind of a boring FPS that I only really liked because of its World War 2 setting and mainly Russian campaign. Now, it was not a bad game at all, just some missions were more like a chore than anything else, but that is what I expect from a Call of Duty game. I really respect this game for turning into a great franchise for at least a little bit and making the World War 2 FPS more of a thing like Medal of Honor originally did before it. Though I still prefer the earlier Medal of Honor games to the early Call of Duty ones, I think this game was still a solid WW2 FPS and it gets a 7/10 from me.

It\u2019s just trying to be a fun game.\n\n-You really do feel like you\u2019re in the middle of pretty epic battles, when they happen.\n\n-Harder difficulties are actually hard.\n\nBottom line: I had a lot of fun with the different weapons and scenarios, and can forgive its mistakes because it was the studio\u2019s first project.", "timestamp_created": 1415061643, "timestamp_updated": 1415064764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608157", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12756242": {"recommendationid": "12756242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042935853", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1314428400}, "language": "english", "review": "The campaign is mediorcre, but the multiplayer is bad.

I played the Original Xbox version of Big Red One, and loved it. Much like other WWII FPSes like Medal of Honor and Battlefield, I love this too!\n\nCall of Duty is a first person shooter game that, unlike the recent titles, focuses on shooting and killing things than making it look like some silly interactive movie. The shooting and kill is essentially artilleries, tanks, at some cases, turrets, not where you are stuck with it, it is optional that you use it but recommended if you want to take down large waves of enemies. Artilleries are also opitional but should be used at all cost with tanks, or in some cases, use a bomb given to you to destroy things. In some cases with WWII games, you are in a airplane doing things to destroy buildings that support the enemies, which is satisfying to see the destruction of the buildings.\n\nAside from that, it's a great game, infitnitely better than the recent Call of Duty games in the recent years.

You sit hunched down among 20 other comrades in a small, beat-up wooden raft, your only protection from the rain a worn red tarp full of holes flapping in the wind above your head. Your superiors circle around your small pit with machine guns and shout with a megaphone about reclaiming the motherland. German fighter planes strafe the rafts and blow them apart one at a time, until only yours remains. Some of your friends attempt to dive into the water, and your superiors turn around and shoot them. Your boat just manages it to make it to the opposite dock, where wounded Russians are being treated in a makeshift hospital. You line up with the rest of the survivors and pass a checkpoint, where the man in front of you is given a gun, and you are given five bullets. You have no weapon. With that, you begin running forward and almost immediately get knocked down by a mortar shell, and with your head swimming and your ears ringing, you continue up a hill as if in slow motion, where a long row of German machine gun nests lie in wait. You watch flag carriers and unarmed soldiers get mowed down around you, and you know your only option is to continue your suicidal advance. It's a unique set piece that I have not experienced in any other WWII shooter.\n\nThe rest of the game bored me.

This is the second game in the series that I played (after CoD2) and I enjoyed it very much. This game is old-school, made back in the days where they gave you med kits instead of regenerating health. It is one of the first FPS games of this kind and the start of the CoD series, when the series was actually good. Graphics are old but who cares as long as the game is fun and hell yeah it is! Lots of action to be had in the campaign.

AI-controlled squadmates? That was here baby. \"Ramirez DO EVERYTHING?\" This game pioneered that. \n\nThe hardest time I had with the game was the fact that there is no sprint key, So you feel like you are running a lot slower than other CoD games, Oh and theres no regenerating health, which means getting shot is punishing. And you will die. A lot. The enemies in this game can still be tough little buggers frequently. But thats also what makes the game rewarding.\n\nFlaws? Oh the game has them, Some are simply due to the age of the game, such as enviornments feeling quite linear and the draw distance feeling very low, these are just due to technical limitations of the day. THe bigger flaws to me would be that sometimes inputs are very.. picky.. on when they want to do what you need, and sometimes you seem to get stuck on debris. Also some areas feel very \"narrow\" and you end up hitting a corner. Oh and the squad AI, as innovative as it was back then, is still pretty bloody bad, I've watched them grenade each other or me from time to time. But hey these dont detract from the immense fun and challenge this game provides. And to me the missions in this one ended up being the ones I remembered the most.\n\nGet it, You wont regret it", "timestamp_created": 1403665814, "timestamp_updated": 1403665814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10770192": {"recommendationid": "10770192", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973050825", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446259296}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed the romp and the chance to play as a soldier in the American, British and Russian forces.", "timestamp_created": 1403643491, "timestamp_updated": 1403643491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10754776": {"recommendationid": "10754776", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984315436", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403124491}, "language": "polish", "review": "I nikt mi nie powie, \u017ce COD 2 czy tr\u00f3jka, pi\u0105tka \u00f3semka jest lepszy od jednyki.

Anders als der ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter erschienene erste Battlefield-Teil (Battlefield 1942) kann man sich letztendlich auch in einer doch recht komplexen Story mit den gespielten Charakteren identifizieren und sich nicht nur Hals \u00fcber Kopf in ein rundenbasiertes Gemetzel zwischen Nazis und Aliierten st\u00fcrzen.\nWas in CoD 1 im Vergleich zu nachfolgenden Teilen ein Vorteil ist, ist meines Erachtens das Behalten von Waffen, die man im Laufe eines Levels gefunden/eingesammelt hat, im n\u00e4chsten Level. Dadurch findet man sich irgendwann mit so gut wie jeder Waffe zurecht und hat bessere Chancen beim Nazis t\u00f6ten.\nDoch um nicht nur die Vorteile aufzumalen, hier ein Nachteil: Ich finde es schade, dass man die \"Schlachten\" nicht auch von der anderen Seite betrachten kann, anders als beispielsweise in BF1942. Warum nicht ein bis zwei Level einbauen, in denen man als deutscher, italienischer oder japanischer Soldat auch mal eine Niederlage erlebt? Das Spiel ist durch und durch so konzipiert, dass es nie eine Niederlage f\u00fcr den Hauptcharakter gibt, letztendlich gewinnt man immer, egal wie viele Versuche man braucht. In sp\u00e4teren CoD-Teilen gibt es auch solche Niederlagen, wie beispielsweise in \"Modern Warfare 2\" am Ende der Mission am Moskauer Flughafen. Wobei man eingestehen muss, dass hier der Vergleich zu BF1942 nicht zieht, da die \"Dialoge\" nur aus einzelnen W\u00f6rtern wie \"Sanit\u00e4ter!\" oder \u00e4hnlichem bestehen.\nDer einzig wirklich gro\u00dfe \"Fehler\" ist jedoch das System, dass man nicht von Zeit zu Zeit von allein Hitpoints regeneriert, sondern man sich diese von Medipacks holen muss. Das entwickeln Activision und Infinity Ward dann leider erst in CoD 2.\nAlles in Allem bin ich allerdings dann doch mit dem Spiel sehr zufrieden und hoffe, dass es da drau\u00dfen noch andere Nostalgiker wie mich gibt, die immer noch \u00fcber 10 Jahre alte Spiele zocken.\nDen Multiplayer habe ich ehrlich gesagt nie getestet, den m\u00fcsst ihr selber f\u00fcr euch entdecken.\nActivision und Infinity Ward haben ein f\u00fcr seine Zeit gro\u00dfartiges Spiel entwickelt, das auf meiner CoD-Rangliste nach Modern Warfare 1 & 2 gleich auf Platz 3 folgt.\nIn der Hoffnung weitere Kunden geworben zu haben,\neuer YakToDaMaximum", "timestamp_created": 1394918632, "timestamp_updated": 1495302015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9486869": {"recommendationid": "9486869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054074119", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469281038}, "language": "english", "review": "At one time Medal of Honor was the premier World War 2 FPS.

And this makes the first CoD-Expierence so much lively.\nThe graphics are great for the year 2003 and the used high modified Quake III Engine.\nThe soundtrack of the game is awesome.

game on Steam. The levels feel exciting, the music provides an excellent complement to the atmosphere; the level design and AI is great.  The levels are all set pieces unto themselves, featuring a nice variety of scenery and objectives: shoot down planes, take out tanks, and kill Nazis by the scores. But I can\u2019t really do justice to the game. The greatest strength of Call of Duty is that the game play feels both immaculately paced. Each mission feels like a fleshed out conflict that changes over the course of your playthrough, and the soundtrack lends each mission an air of significance. For its time, Call of Duty had some truly impressive set pieces. Each of the three campaigns brings a unique perspective and its own dynamics to the game, as the Americans seem to favor running and gunning over the Russian campaign, which feels more like a war of attrition. The first mission for the Russian army is perhaps one of the most intense I\u2019ve played so far. As the Russian Army suffers heavy losses you make it out onto the battlefield without so much as a gun at your disposal.

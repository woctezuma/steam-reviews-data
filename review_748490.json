Rean is a member of Thors, and given the knowledge we have at the beginning of the story, the goal is the graduate. Progress is made by getting good grades, making friends, and advancing the timeline. Eventually, this is extended to solving whatever mystery or crisis Class VII encounters while on your field study and getting closer to the identity of their ringleader. From the first field study, Class VII becomes entangled in a conspiracy to overthrow an ostensibly benevolent, yet ruthless dictator. Falcom skillfully weaves a documentary and exploration of late 1700's French society/late 1800's Prussian military society with a political thiller, one that gets even more intriguing as the story continues. The villains are introduced and built up from the start, and once things kick into full swing, it all about finding your friends and stopping the revolution from happening.\n\nGameplay: As much as we'd like to tout Kiseki's amazing writing and treat it as a visual novel that allows us to see more of the world, we must keep in mind that this is first and foremost a GAME that we play. The fact of the matter is that you will spend about 50% of your play time in traveling roads and fighting monsters. A game can have an excellent story, but that won't make up for boring, tedious, or downright frustrating gameplay. Fortunately, Trails of Cold Steel 2 is a game where I love the wandering Erebonia and fighting just as much as talking to NPCs and watching hours of cutscenes. \n\n40% of your playtime is spent in battle, and the vast majority of said battles are trash fights with random mobs on roads and in dungeons. It goes without saying that trash fights/random encounters are pretty boring. The saving grace of Cold Steel is that it actually managed to make even the most mundane aspects of JRPG gameplay entertaining: you have access to a wide variety of different builds, team comps, and strategies to experiment with. The game encourages you to take the time and abuse the gameplay mechanics thanks to it's XP multipliers. You never feel like you are just going through the motions. It didn't even matter that there was no real difficulty Cold Steel; it was engaging as it was.\n\nTrails of Cold Steel benefits from being able to show off the scope of it's world and a brighter color pallete and at realistic proportions, but suffers from a limited set of stiff animations that are unable to bring out of the full potential of the story, nor be able to fully encapsulate a character's pose from how they appear in their 2D art. Understandable, since this was Falcom's first attempt at a 3D Kiseki game. That said, Falcom was still able to nail the facial features, as they are able to convey the same amount of emotion as the 2D portraits from Trails in the Sky, evoking the same sense of befuddlement, suspicion, anger, sorrow, and crazy. While their 2D art looks like something out of a contemporary A1-pictures production, the ingame models look quite unique and quite pleasing to the eye. Furthermore, I have fallen in love with science-fantasy aesthetic of Erebonia, particularly it's CS3 look which you can see traces of in CS2, such as Machias' new fold-over coat and the Crusader train. The steel grey, white, and deep blue fold over coats are quite dazzling, and that's not to mention the new architecture, orbment, and architecture! Having seen the Famitsu scans of CS3, I am absolutely hyped to experience a remodeled Erebonia!\n\nMusic: Trails of Cold Steel draws upon conteporary genres, utilizing some syntheized pieces such as my favorites \"The Glint of Cold Steel\", \"Machinery Attack\", and \"Awakening\". It uses rock pieces such as \"Belief\" and \"Bring Up Trust\". The few orchestral tracks it has made me swell with resolve, particularly \"Courageous, Laucnh!\" and \"To gamble all or nothing\". The quiet tracks were fantastic as well: \"Wholehearted Feelings\" and \"To the Irreplaceable People\". The mixed tracks were also great, such as \"Blitzkrieg\". What really took me by surprise was the extensive use of choruses in Cold Steel, with \"Great Power\" and \"EOV\" evoking the feeling of participating in some traditional saga. \"Aria of the Holy Saint\" is, as previously stated, one of the best pieces in the entire Kiseki series, evoking a sense of grandeur, melancholy, mystery, and heartfelt friendship during the vision scenes.", "timestamp_created": 1521500470, "timestamp_updated": 1521500470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40927662": {"recommendationid": "40927662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008680000", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2610, "last_played": 1521447505}, "language": "english", "review": "The plot revolves around FRIENDSHIP POWER and is sometimes painfully forced or juvenile, the timeline doesn't make any sense, days last for well... days, several of the characters are too young to have the experiences the story claims they've had, the characters excel at the Japanese art of saying a  lot while actually saying nothing at all, the adults are super irresponsible, the frequent twists in the plot are sometimes interesting (moreso in the first game) but make you question the intelligence of the lead for missing them as they tend to be broadcasted earlier on, the combat is super exploitable (4-5 move boss fights on hard mode), the characters are super over-idealistic, the villains are very bad at their job, and no one bloody dies (IN A \"WAR\").\n\nAll in all, it's a typical anime in game form.  If you play it with that in mind and fast forward through most of Rean's nonsense dialogue and the \"Oh, Rean\"s from the rest of the cast, you should be fine.  I rather enjoyed it.  It really did feel like playing through an anime with all of its flaws and perks (harem), which is exactly what I was expecting going in.

The music was once again fantastic in these fights.  Boss fights required some strategy to really maximize your character's strengths but sometimes this worked too well because of the overdrive feature having the potential to break the balance in a fight so easily.  \n\nAll the characters return, and generally are very enjoyable.  It's a given that you'll grow attached to some of them especially as you get Class VII back together, and youll have the mix of quirky and serious and fun personalities in full force, while learning more about some backstories.  This is a good thing because I think it makes up for Rean being a relatively bland protagonist, despite his special powers.  Unlike Estelle from Trails of the Sky, I think Rean's character arc is heavily dependent on everyone else supporting him and building him up, as opposed to building others up and growing on his own.  Luckily this gets masked because outside of the beginning of the game Rean is rarely left on his own unable to interact with his classmates.  \n\nStill though, spending 90 hours without it ever feeling like a chore is all I need to say to tell you how much I enjoyed the game, although it might be a while before I work up the energy to do that again.

Apart from wasting potential resources you also waste nerves and time just to see how the boss one-shots your character or party because it's \"plot event\". May be there's something in it, but I hate to feel cheated. I hate to lose despite my best efforts. I hate to see consecutive lose battles. If the plot demands to lose the fight - make it a damn cutscene.\n\nFor me this point alone would make it a \"not recommended\" - but hey, it's just my humble opinion. The game has it's charm and benefits. I just don't get this core plot concept - i.e. why it has to be so centered around unwinnable plot events. To add to this is that even if you win the fight - the opposing characters always get away from you. They teleport, giggling and troling you, they run away under heavy fire, etc..

Then again the point of the first game was to build up erobonia so it did a good job there.\n\nThis game to me at least had more emotional moments though, especially at  the end.\n\nIn terms of gameplay its pretty good as well. You have so many options to choose , tools to travel etc...\nThe game is also very convinient, like it will usually ask you  \"do you want to go back to town\" after completing the quest or something. My only problem with the gameplay is probably the fact that this game is a joke when it comes to difficulty. I have played it on nightmare and still beat it just fine. There was only one hard battle and thats because of how much dmg the guy can do , you can still beat him without him getting a single turn. Yeah thats how easy it is to break this game.\n\nAnyway all said and done , I really liked this game.", "timestamp_created": 1520767523, "timestamp_updated": 1521126199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40731698": {"recommendationid": "40731698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166464724", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3402, "last_played": 1521477403}, "language": "english", "review": "Great series like always, now waiting for sen no kiseki 3 translation \ud83d\ude18", "timestamp_created": 1520746105, "timestamp_updated": 1520746105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40727546": {"recommendationid": "40727546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104106598", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1119, "last_played": 1521408781}, "language": "french", "review": "meilleur serie de jrpg", "timestamp_created": 1520731198, "timestamp_updated": 1520731198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40719501": {"recommendationid": "40719501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020824195", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 912, "last_played": 1520705439}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel[/b] is the second in the \"Cold Steel\" trilogy of JRPGs, themselves part of the broader \"Legend of Heroes\" series.

This time, we have at least an ending that ties up the important points while leaving plenty room for continuation.\n\n- Most characters are well developped. Really enjoy all the main character and even sub-character developments/stories, though this is nothing new to Falcom. Also great world building as usual.\n\n- Overall good port to PC (Though bugs were frequenctly encountered: game crashes due to costumes, battle menu going unreadable, audio \"delaying\" Turbo mode, etc.). Good voice acting. God bless Turbo mode still ...\n\n- Large amount of content with good replayability (Explore the oh so many character interactions and dialogues as well as the many possible battle set ups).\n\n- Fun battle mechanics with the quick time events making the fights more engaging. \n\n- Good depth to the battles that pushes you to think (or just look up guides) of proper team, equipment, and quartz set ups to deal with challenging opponents. This makes the battle preparation itself a fun part of the game ... up to the point where you gain access to game breaking set ups, at which point you can waltz in on any boss knowing you will humilate them regardless of their specialties.\n\n- Game does not force you to grind for exp or currencies as the game progresses.\n\nDislike: \n\n- Story kind of abused the \"Last Second Save\" of our protagonists, to the point I felt it was a running gag. This is especially true in the last dungeon, where you would expect that the protagonist would demonstrate their great growth through countless struggles, only to have to be saved oh so many times during key confrontations simply because their opponents can pull second winds out of their ass ...\n\n- Falcom is too pushy with their favorite gril (Alisa).\n\n- Too easy for a LOH game (Probably due to the possible game breaking mechanics that are readily available)... \n\n- As a follow up to the point immediately above, game Balancing issues ... Though I enjoy humiliating bosses, I should not be able to abuse them to the point they don't get even a single turn ... or to kill them in one blow even before their first phase ends (One Punch Laura set up)...\n\n- Mech battles are kind of uninspiring ... I still find them fun, but they felt like a convoluted rock paper scissor game ..\n\n- Game crashing occurences ...\n\n- I was forced to grind for the 100 overdrive activation achievement ...", "timestamp_created": 1520654500, "timestamp_updated": 1520654500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40698879": {"recommendationid": "40698879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120805983", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 322, "last_played": 1521288251}, "language": "english", "review": "Great stories, but battle's needs to be improved a lot.

I never played the other The legend of Heroes games so I was really FRUSTRATED when theres this cool characters shouting exposition like I have a Falcom Encyclopedia with me! \n\nBut most of all. The bane of my existence. Are those damn report score for every chapter.

Now, on later part of the game there wont be any \"Hidden\" quest but more of \"Hidden students\".  This mechanic irritates me!

This game is a great way to end the story right then and there but surprisingly a third game has been released in japan with the series ending on trials of cold steel 4. \n\nThe second game brings about new elements to the battle system to help make your battles easier by just a little, besides that, items are mostly the same as the first game and tactics from the first game can mostly still be applied here.\n\nThe characters in this game shows development throughout the story and it really makes you feel that you have accompanied Class VII through their journey side to side. Also, unlike the first game, you can technically romance other characters but i cant go much into detail as it is spoilery.\n\nOverall, the two games could have ended the story here. The game is already very polished and the story is very well written. My only complaint is that they broke the game's story into two pieces so i had to wait a pretty long hiatus before i can continue to the story from the midpoint. Other than that, great game and conclusion to this chapter of trials of cold steel 1 & 2. 9/10 stars.\n\nP.S. Game has no jap voices only english dub.

Klar, die meisten Locations sind die gleichen, die man auch zuvor schon besuchen konnte, die Grafik hat sich auch nicht gro\u00df ver\u00e4ndert oder gar verbessert, aber wenn es um die Story geht, dann verfolgt man die Sache schon etwas mehr.\nSch\u00f6n ist dabei eine gewisse Abwechslung, die man mit dem Kampf durch Valimar bekommt, sowie die Erweiterung von Blade und die M\u00f6glichkeit, Snowboard zu fahren. Zu guter Letzt kann man auch dank Motorrad und Pferd die Umwelt bedeutend schneller durchforsten, was ein gro\u00dfes Komfort-Plus gibt.\n\nSicher, es werden in der Story und den Charakteren viele Stereotypen aus Animes aufgegriffen (Der Freund, der an seinen Rivalen glaubt und ihn trotz all seiner Vergehen zur\u00fcckholen will), aber es bleibt dabei eigentlich immer spannend, wenn sich die Story wendet.\nIch k\u00f6nnte jetzt noch in den New Game-Plus-Modus gehen, aber ich muss erst mal alles verdauen.

Class VII is back in business.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II is a turn-based JRPG that is a direct sequel to the first Trails of Cold Steel. The game once again focuses around Rean Schwarzer and his friends in Class VII as they struggle against the realities of [spoiler]the sudden civil war that erupted in Heimdallr between the Noble Alliance and the Imperial Army. As the class is separated in the ensuing chaos after the events in Heimdallr, Rean goes on a journey to find his friends and reunite Class VII, while also finding a way to end the war between the social classes.[/spoiler]\n\nAs a word of warning, the game takes place at the same time as Trails to Zero and Trails to Azure (Zero no Kiseki/Ao no Kiseki) and they will spoil each other. These two games (referred to as the Crossbell duology) are not yet fully localized, so you may be left with more than a little curiosity about the happenings in Erebonia's defiant neighbor.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of the first Trails of Cold Steel, which is a traditional turn-based combat with a party of four. However, it's been tweaked a bit from the first game. A lot of game-breaking strategies were somewhat nerfed (but most still remain game-breaking), and a new mechanic has been added in the form of Overdrive. Activating Overdrive with a linked partner allows them both to instantly take the next three turns (the overdrive activator taking two and the partner taking one), as well as granting an instant HP, EP, and CP boost. All attacks made during this overdrive period are guaranteed critical hits, and arts have no casting time, which allows for some creative combinations to secure a victory or turn a losing battle around. Notably, the [spoiler]Divine Knight battles[/spoiler] from CSI have a much more prominent role in the second game. So, as such, you can expect to see a good amount of the [spoiler]Ashen Knight [/spoiler] in action.\n\nThe \"bonding\" system from CSI is back, as well. On \"rest days\" (as opposed to free days in CSI) you can see bonding events with certain characters to increase their link levels. However, the array of characters in your party and that you can bond with is quite a bit bigger than CSI's roster, and there are a number of guest characters that take up arms and join Class VII in their efforts to [spoiler]stop the civil war.[/spoiler]\n\nAnother improvement is the amount of freedom you have to move around. A common complaint about CSI was that it was far too linear - CSII fixes that by taking a rather nonlinear approach to its second half, with the player having a very large amount of liberty to go where you please. A lot of interesting things are happening all over the country during the war, after all.\n\nAs always, Falcom's music is top-notch. Borrowing from the best of Cold Steel and playing new tracks in just the right moments, CSII does not disappoint on the audio front. Visually, the game also exceeds Cold Steel I in that it showcases a number of new gorgeous locations (such as the town of Ymir). In general, most of the strong points of CSI were made even stronger in CSII - however, in my opinion, something else suffered with it.\n\nOne of CSII's biggest flaws, in my opinion, is the somewhat inconsistent character development in comparison to other Trails games. There are a number of times in which the characters' actions and motivations have little logical sense, and sometimes their actions contradict the reasoning behind them. I can think, off the top of my head, at least five instances where this took place. The characters are still overall well-written in comparison to other JRPGs, but for a Trails game, it's somewhat off-putting. Most of the characters that were good in the previous games remain at a high quality for writing, but there were more than a few questionable decisions made by the characters that didn't really correlate with their goals, which had a negative impact on the story.\n\nDespite my reservations on this front, I would highly recommend CSII, as it is still a Trails title - meaning it remains a quality game. Even the weaker Trails games are still excellent in their own right, and the entertainment you get from the game is well worth its price tag. This series is a must for any fan of JRPGs. \n\nTowa's still the best, as well - but she may have competition from a black rabbit and a blonde princess this time around.", "timestamp_created": 1519616590, "timestamp_updated": 1519616676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40402882": {"recommendationid": "40402882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352849814", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520038861}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply the best RPG!", "timestamp_created": 1519602875, "timestamp_updated": 1519602875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40402474": {"recommendationid": "40402474", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964588534", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519285476}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game so much... I want to do NG+ of both games. Now I am just yearning for CS3 to be on PC because of how much I loved these games. The character development is superb and the story is incredible, but the combat system is something that I had been missing since the masterpiece that is Grandia 2. \n\nI would also like to talk about the 'Turbo Mode' which you can easily set to a controller button and use whenever you please whilst playing the game. Do you wish that you could speed up the running back and forth to diffrent locations, movement animations and dramatic pauses in some games? The super cool spell animations / cutscenes are great during epic as hell boss battles and taking revenge on the big baddy with a fully powered up super attack, they really are. But be honest with yourself, whilst grinding you really wish you could just speed that stuff up. Its a much welcomed and needed game mechanic that should be in any and every adaptation of story drived JRPG's. Now the 'Turbo Mode' is in no way cheating at all. You don't hit harder or get super everything, it is just speeding up the game. Thats all it does. If I could play Golden Sun 1 and 2 with these features I would beat them multiple times a year because of how much I love them. My play time for the Trails games shows around 45ish hours, but my in game time is well above 80 hours. To be able to enjoy these games and get the full experience while just speeding through the unnecessary, lengthy camera panning is a godsend. \n\ntl;dr\nThe game is absolutely fantastic in both

People recommended the first Trails of Cold Steel game so I decided to give that a shot. I was completely taken away by the presentation and the immersion that the game gave to me and it quickly became one of my favorite series of all time. Then I decided to play the other games in the series, Trails in the Sky 1,2,3 and then even those that are not available officially on PC only via emulator, Zero no Kiseki and then Ao no Kiseki. \n\nWhich brings me to this masterpiece. Simply put if you played the previous one, you are gonna want to have this one too. The cliffhanger of the previous game was unbearable and I was so close to actually playing this on an emulator but then they finally released it. It took me a week to play it through and I spent every waking moment yearning to come back for more. And now that I am done with it, I just can't wait for CS3. \n\nI know this hasn't been much of a review, but really the only thing I wanted to get across was the enthusiasm I feel for this series. They are long and can have tedious quests, but in the end, the immersion, the gameplay, the characters, the story and the epic interconnectivity, allusions between the games is worth every second people can pour into these games.", "timestamp_created": 1519491711, "timestamp_updated": 1519491711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40362196": {"recommendationid": "40362196", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960369063", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 7202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520263459}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a hard game to review.  Not because it is a bad game (it is, in fact, excellent in so very many regards), but because as a direct sequel to a game as big as Trails of Cold Steel, your impressions of it will largely be predicated on your feelings for CS1.  Needless to say, jumping in mid-arc in any Trails/Kiseki series is ill-advised, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/538680/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_of_Cold_Steel/]so go play the first one[/url] before considering picking this up.  If you enjoyed it, you're going to want to play this one.  If you didn't, CS2 is unlikely to greatly sway your opinion of this story arc.\n\nStill here?  With that out of the way, you might ask how CS2 fares as a sequel to CS1, and the answer would be that it is an improvement in most regards.  The pacing is significantly faster as the story shifts into a higher gear and the stakes are raised for all the characters involved.  If you loved them before, you'll continue to love them here, as their characterization hasn't changed enormously.  A big change however in CS2 is the large number of guest party members, who come and go with enough frequency that it keeps things fresh outside of the now-familiar members of class VII.\n\nOn the whole, polish is much higher in CS2, with animation improvements being the major standout from the often utilitarian ones in CS1.  Considering that CS1 was Falcom's first fully-3D game, that jump isn't too surprising, but it is very nice to see.  Structurally, the game is mostly similar to the original, but eventually opens up into large non-linear sections where you have free access to most of the game world.  If you have any nostalgia for Final Fantasy VI and VII, you'll definitely appreciate these sections.\n\nThe only final thing to keep in mind for CS2 is that it is [b]not[/b] going to deliver you the kind of closure you got in Trails in the Sky SC.  This is the second part of a four part story, and while it doesn't end on a cliffhanger like CS1 did, you absolutely will be left with more questions than answers.  As long as you go in with that understanding, you'll doubtlessly have a great time.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1519491103, "timestamp_updated": 1519491103, "voted_up": true,

Even the combat that was teased at the end of CS1 is massively expanded and improved. The series has so far made it to my favorite game series of all time, and it's proven it can keep that title.

And better, play the rest of trails series before or later ( sky trilogy, zero, azure ) \n\n(+)\n- Great soundtrack ( again! )\n- Interesting character interaction, NPC, world building.\n- Detailed NPC dialogue. I mean I already playing a bunch of JRPG before and while not all, there are MANY JRPG that too lazy to fill the NPCs dialogue ( like they didn't change the dialogue for looooooooong time, unrelated/inappropriate/too stiff dialogue etc etc, ). Cold steel ( and ofc the rest of the series ) is one of the best NPC dialogue i have ever experienced.\n- More freedom for exploration\n- built-in frame skip\n- Bonding event for more character interaction\n- more playable character = wider party build\n- gundam battle is more fun and balanced \n- you can customize towa!1!1!\n\n(-)\n- While you think they balanced some of the previous game battle system ( like accuracy is now not ignorable, evasion tank is less broken ), they actually make the battle setup is much more abuseable ( and you can easily build it ). AT delay spam, OP back-to-back S-craft damage, ( too ) huge boss damage output, basically if you didn't setting up your party to the point of abusing certain feature, your party will be wiped out in a few turn of them. overdrive, good ol' noble command buff and backtoback chrono burst, etc etc. heck, even many of their single craft is broken enough by itself.

This is a jaw dropping sequel to an already amazing game and an equally superb PC port. XSEED and Durante knock the ball out of the park once again making NISA (localizing YSVIII) look chumps in the process.\n\nI played ~20 hours on my PS3 and when I heard the PC announcement I immediately stopped, waiting to play it on the definitive platfrom. And believe me , it IS definitive!\n\nRight off the bat, similar to CS1 you are treated to an amazing launcher which shows via screenshots what each graphical option does, so its easy to tweak your settings according to your specifications.\n\nThere's also a 'continue from last save' option when you hit the Play button from your library, allowing you to directly jump in your last save without opening the game and main menu and such. An option I never knew I wanted and now I think should be made for every PC game! :D\n\nTurbo mode is back, you can fast forward cutscenes and battles (wouldnt recommend the former unless you are on NG+).\n\nWont go too much in the story cuz spoilers, but its a direct sequel to CS1 so you definitely have to play that one first. However this game does a pretty great job in summarizing the events of CS1. There's a detailed summary under 'Memories'  tab on the main menu.\n\nYou can import your CS1 clear save data which gets you extra items like the casual clothes dlc if you bought them for the first game. Importing your save also means your character will recognize some people he met and dialog will be changed. Also your waifu will also be carried over , hue. (I got Alisa and Sara in 2 separate save slots :P )\n\nAlso if you have any prior Trails in the Sky  game in your library you get Estelle and Joshua's dlc outfits for Alisa and Rean respectively  for free!\n\nSo yeah! Long story short, if you ended CS1 buy this ASAP, if you didnt end CS1 , buy this ASAP and end CS1 before starting this. You wont be dissapointed.\n11/10 all the way!\n\nEDIT: Clocked in my first playthrough at ~70 hours. As the curtains fell, i realized that we are only halfway through the Cold Steel saga.

The combat animations are faster which makes impatient gamers pleased.\n\nBut the story is arguably the weakest point. The usual cliche plot devices are spammed, the power level relations between characters went afk and you get to see characters who are considered to be inhumanly strong monsters fight against Class VII and the result is them feeling... exhausted like heavy smokers on a treadmill.\n\nTropes and cliches were always present but they just went overboard with them. The symbolical representation is weaker, alongside the direction.\n\nIt's a decent modern JRPG since we don't have anything worthy to compare it with on PC. Berseria I guess? Berseria's story and characters were so more intriguing and fleshed out, plus it doesn't require you to play two games to get an idea as to what's happening. \n\nI simply recommend this game for existing Trails fans because we're in too deep to be criticizing the game objectively so we show leniency to trope spamming, repetitive writing and flashy+fast yet abysmally balanced combat system.

needs. The port is impeccable, brought to life with over 50 percent more voice acting than any other version by a group of people who are true fans of the series. Don't think, just buy. \n\n\nOne of the best RPG (let alone JRPG) series of all time. It's devoted fanbase speaks for itself, but instead of talking about the game itself (which is, by pretty much any available standard, amazing) I would rather briefly touch on the group who have helped to localize and bring this amazing experiance to us.\n\nPorting games the size and scale of these is no easy task, the sheer amount of content means that the project is unlikely to bring in much money, thus why these games have taken so long to reach US shores, and then again to reach us here in the PC Gaming community. \n\nYet XSEED didn't port these games to make money, they ported them because they, too, are long time fans of the series and wanted to bring them to a new group of players who may not have been able to experiance them otherwise. \n\nYou can feel their love and dedication to the games especially well in this port, everything they have added shows the love they hold for these games. From the Turbo feature, allowing you the choice to cut out any addition fluff and making something like grinding fly by as if an afterthought, all the way to the 50 percent additional voice acting, which true fans of the series were able to select their own important moments that they always wanted to see voice acted and make it a reality. \n\nThis is all the more clear when you look at the amazing jobs done by the voice acters, and how well the behind the scenes process of choosing who to voice each character was done. English voice acting for JRPGs has historically been synonmous with the word \"Cringe\" however for Trails of Cold Steel NONE of the voice acters ever left me reeling or wishing for original japanese voice actors. \n\nOn top of this, some characters, such as sharon, who have never before been voice acted in the english OR japanese versions of the game have found VA's who fit their personality so perfectly that you could never imagine them speaking with any other voice.", "timestamp_created": 1518742847, "timestamp_updated": 1518742847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40110251": {"recommendationid": "40110251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057473091", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518731391}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the few JRPG series with an engaging, novel-like storytelling out there, especially if you are an anime fan.

(to be released alonside the first episode of Final Fantasy VII Remake around 2048AD).\n\nIf you are looking for a game that has compelling characters, good story progression (which even affects the gameplay mechanics directly), a marked characted development and hour upon hours of gameplay for your money, look no further. Trails of Cold Steel (and The Legend of Heroes in general) tend to be heavy-story-focused JRPG games, so for us who are looking for something really worthwhile that will stay with you long after you've beaten the main storyline, this series is a heaven-sent.\n\nCons:\n- You NEED to play the first Trails of Cold Steel to understand what's going on (though the game includes a summary of the story from the previous game alongside detailed character profiles).\n- It's a very long game.

But really, go buy CS1, it's fantastic, then you can move on to this when you're done, because CS2 is also fantastic.\n\nRegarding the PC version: I've only played it briefly so far, but everything about it looks and runs great from what I can see. This makes sense, given that it runs on the same engine as CS1, and was ported by the same person. CS1's PC port is widely considered one of the best JRPG console->PC ports ever made, and CS2 looks just as good.

is based on my PS3 experiences (Cleared ToCS I and II twice), early PC insights and my personal opinion about this game. \n\nTrails of Cold Steels II:\n\n-J-RPG \n-Turn-Based \n-Flexible skillsystem with a lot of strategy\n-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal] \n(Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) \n\n-Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)\n-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) \n-No prior knowledge needed execpt ToCS I of course (but nothing from Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references)\n\n-Great and illustre characters and character development\n-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) \n-Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story \n\n-A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)\n\n-Average graphics in general\n-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment \n-Graphics are still way better compared to PS3!\n-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth\n\n-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)\n\nPlaytime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)\n\n-It's the second game of a trilogy/quadrilogy\n-ToCS III will hopefully come to us later this year or 2019...\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIt's pretty difficult to recommend this to everyone depending on what you like...and if you have some experience from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona \n\nAt best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and \"Persona\" in general \n\n-It's a mix because like in Persona you have your everyday school life and mysterious battles/characters\n-You are deepening your bonds with the \"main characters\" and getting to know their personality. This depends on the time you are giving each of them individually (Pretty similar to Persona)\n\nThe rest of the game is how you know it from Trails in the Sky \n-A lot of text-based conversations with spoken dialogues (way above average RPGs)\n-A lot of details put into the story, the chraracters, background information and collectibles\n-A lot of different things to do (next to the main story) like fishing, playing cards, quests and so forth \n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSo who would I recommend it to?\n\n=> People who liked the first game ;o)\n=> People who like Persona and are into spending time to develop bonds with various characters\n=> People who like to play turn-based games with deep strategy (You can abuse every system...)\n=> People who are into longer games (Average time = 90-100+ hours)\n=> People who are seaching for a great story where everything feels connected (Characters, Story, Backgrounds)\n=> People who don't dislike certain clich\u00e9s \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nOne of the best J-RPGs in recent years! ;o)", "timestamp_created": 1518641942, "timestamp_updated": 1518641942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40076985": {"recommendationid": "40076985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122446696", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 392, "last_played": 1520795608}, "language": "english", "review": "Talking Tsundere Cat - Check\nTalking Gundam - Check\nSerial Headpatter - Check (seriously somebody has to stop him)\nCarry over the Savestate from the perivous Game - Check\nJRPGS favorit Mini Game Fishing - Check\nSlow paced Story so that all Character have a purpose and kinda grow on you (except Machias) - Check\n10/10 would collect Interest on my 50 Mira again.", "timestamp_created": 1518641388, "timestamp_updated": 1518641388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762673", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40076844": {"recommendationid": "40076844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362999555", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519815910}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u6c38\u8fdc\u559c\u6b22\u83f2.jpg", "timestamp_created": 1518640904, "timestamp_updated": 1518640904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546597", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40076527": {"recommendationid": "40076527", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997180907", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 128, "last_played": 1521489423}, "language": "english", "review": "Headpat/10", "timestamp_created": 1518639826, "timestamp_updated": 1518639826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40076451": {"recommendationid": "40076451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088673031", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2076, "last_played": 1520862344}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great Trails game.

It has basically all the features you're going to need for pixel art and pixel art animation in one package.

The price is really great for the content, but it isn't perfect. For example, you cannot add \"Add-ons\" or \"Workshop Items\" into the application. Another example is, the tool they give you to set one block down, doesn't allow you to set more than one block at once.

Every tool is dedicated to drawing in binary. \n\n+ Frames and Animation tools are so smooth and easy to use. I'm still learning tons about it as we speak! \n\n+ Layers.

WHAT A BLESSING.\n\n+ You can split your screen a ton of ways and pull colors from a reference layer and it's super convenient.\n\nCons:\n\n- Resizing can be a bit of a hassle. Often times pixel images can be heavily distorted when downsizing or rotating. But this  is really not Aesprite's fault since that is just what happens when you try to turn a very small image on its side. \n\n- Blur tool?? Who invited you??? Why are you here?????\n\n- Sometimes inserting text does not work with custom fonts you have installed.\n\n- Aesprite does not magically make you better at art. \n\n\n\nOverall, this is a great product for anyone really looking to hone their binary/pixel art skills.

Back in the days of GameMaker 8 and GameMaker: Studio I was able to use the built in sprite editor for my pixel art. I normally draw 16 x 16 tiles and scale it up to 64 x 64. The interpolation was fine, but then came GMS 2. Don't get me wrong, I love GMS 2 but the damn sprite editor is BS. Some pixels would upscale to 3 x 3 and some to 1 x 1 instead of all of them scaling up to 2 x 2. Thank goodness for Aseprite. It's very basic to the core, but just what I needed for pixel art. No over the top complex features to clutter the interface when all I want is a basic pixel art program. Best of all is you can export color palletes and reimport them later when you need them.

Today an update came out for it and it is top notch. For me, the two biggest improvements are that they added a gradient tool, and they made the symmetry option able to do horizontal and vertical symmetry at the same time. These are two huge improvements to me. This program really is great. Worth every penny.\n\n--------------------------------\nALL BELOW WAS ORIGINAL REVIEW ON JULY 20 2017\n--------------------------------\n\nGreat program. \n\nI got fired from my graphic design job a few weeks ago. I have been doing graphics for around 20 years. I have all of the Adobe software and several other programs. The day I got fired, I decided I no longer wanted to work for anyone else again and I decided that I was going to learn how to make a video game. That is what I am doing full time now. \n\nI bought Aseprite the day I got fired and learned the majority of the program by the end of the day. It is super easy to learn, yet is powerful enough that I feel more comfortable making my sprites in Aseprite than in the Adobe programs.

There is also the major cost difference between the two apps.\n\nWell thought out!\nAseprite features a lot of the same basic handy functions that Photoshop offers like easily dragging your canvas around. Several selection tools, works great with moving pixels around and on layers.\nOffers a really nice resizing tool that moves your pixels in a very nice way, which is great for animating as well.\nYou can import video files for animation reference and tracing.\nHas very easy and clever default keyboard bindings allowing you to speed up your work a lot.\n\nOne thing I was a little worried about before purchasing Aseprite was the pixel GUI, thinking it'd be awkward to use. After about 5-10 minutes playing with the app, I hardly even notice and find it to be pretty nice.\n\nIf you're out searching for a pixel art app, I recommend giving Aseprite a try.\n", "timestamp_created": 1493844043, "timestamp_updated": 1493844043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506442", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31489596": {"recommendationid": "31489596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086298130", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504551048}, "language": "english", "review": "Pixel art", "timestamp_created": 1493653746, "timestamp_updated": 1493653746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31478397": {"recommendationid": "31478397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108964000", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "last_played": 1514695930}, "language": "english", "review": "This program is by far my favorite to create sprites in.\nGimp and paint.net are good but you can't beat aseprite.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone who makes sprites on a regular basis", "timestamp_created": 1493611049, "timestamp_updated": 1493611049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31457635": {"recommendationid": "31457635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116403291", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512549258}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice fixel animation maker.\nIt help you to animate some characters easily without professional ability.", "timestamp_created": 1493537886, "timestamp_updated": 1493537886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31439281": {"recommendationid": "31439281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014141125", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 266, "last_played": 1514163823}, "language": "english", "review": "I've used every pixel art software there is and this one is hands down the best one on the market.

If you disagree with any or all of the points feel free to give me a dislike and/or a comment to discuss things. But if you are just here to rant and rage, I will ignore you.\n\n=[Review]=\nAs I recently began to make a game with a few of my friends, I also began to find out that I am not just bad at Pixelart. I am absolutely terri- Ok jokes aside, I am not all that bad but I have much to learn. After a while a friend had shown me a browser pixelart tool which I used for a while but didnt help all that great and I came back to using Gimp. Shortly after I see a person on twitter writing on how to make a custom brush in a program that looked like it was mainly used for Pixelart and I was already interested. After asking this person, I was redirected via name to steam where I then bought it only one day after and used it for about 10 hours straight with varying results.\n\nOverall, if you want to get into Pixelart and you dont want to pay a buttload of money for some high-end program, Aseprite is perfect for you. At first, like with any program, you will have to find your way around but after a while it actually becomes quite easy to use. Or in other words: You do not spend 5 hours on figuring out the basics unlike with some other high-end programs *cough*Photoshop*cough*. What? I didnt name any programs. You are hearing things. What? This is a written review?\n\n...\n\nLOOK A PERSON ON THE INTERNET WHO IS WRONG!\n\n(Too soon?)\n\nThe program gives you a full on working layer and frame system. Layers work as intended. Human base, then ontop a layer of colour and ontop of that a layer of hair and another one for clothing. But what about animation? Here is where the frames come into play. Lets use a chest as the best example that I will give you now. A container. You have the chest right infront of you but you want to put in content that you dont want to redraw everytime? Then simply draw the chest without the top, put the top on another layer and only animate said top part. That way, one copy of said chest bottom part is enough for you as it will stay stationary no matter what. It is only the top part that moves.\n\nOther than that, the program also gives you alot of colours to work with. Unlike your usual painting/drawing programs you can not only choose your own colours, but you can also choose from wide variety of palletes. You can make a real oldschool game look-alike or you can go in and create Pixelart Mona Lisa in the colours of the rainbow. You can even customize and create your own palletes to your liking. And those then can also be saved and loaded for later use.\n\nThere are a few different modes that I have yet to find out but one mode, the \"Tiled\" mode is honestly one of the best if you want to make continous tilesets. It mirrors every side of the tile you have on display and from there you simply pain as per usual. But at the same time as you paint on the basetile, all other tiles will be painted the same way and even overlay each other. This way you can make tilesets that add on to each other very easily and that, thinking about how hard that can be, is very very appreciated. I nearly ripped my hair out once due to a trial on actually making such a tileset in gimp. It became so frustratingly hard that I gave up until I found this tool.\n\nOther than that, there are also a good amount of brushes. Not too many to say \"Oh Lord, where just where is the pencil?\". But also not too few to say \"Where is the eraser?\" You have what you need for the task that is pixelart. A pencil, spray, line, box or circle, eraser, fill and even a blur tool. You heard me, a blur tool for pixelart. Now doesnt that make things a bit easier?\n\nOverall, this program saves me a lot of time going around trying to find out which colours to use because it is all in two windows. Oh yes, another point I nearly forgot is the second window afterall. You gain a second window which is the review window for your pixelart. While you go deep and dirty into the finest details, this review window can still show you, your masterpiece in its full glory. No more zooming out. Just a look to the right and you are up to date on how the mistake looks you just made. Well, or should I call it a happy little accident? Either way, its all there.\n\nAnd that is about it. Another small point I would like to mention are the easy access keyboard shortcuts that make it very easy for righthanded people like me who mainly use their left hand on the keyboard. You are able to rebind them but the default layout works quite well for me~\n\nAnd that is about it.\nI would certainly recommend this program to anyone who wants to get more into pixelart. Actually have done that already with a friend of mine who bought it a day later. Do not know of the results but I doubt they will be worse than what I have done so far~", "timestamp_created": 1488493516, "timestamp_updated": 1488493542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8,

Aseprite has the Scramble Tool!\n\nWhile it's easy to draw something in any sprite editor, Aseprite has \"Pixel-perfect\" drawing, so you don't get those weird jagged lines when you try doing something like a curve, and \"linked cels\" which don't change with every frame, so you don't have to do any cut-and-paste into all the frames like I used to. The downside is that, if you accidentally forget to unlink something, it changes in all the linked frames. The good news is you have unlimited undos, unlike some of the other spriting tools I've used.\n\nThere's also things that other spriting tools have, like layers and palettes, and while Aseprite has some cool layer stuff, I haven't used it much, and if I were to talk about the palette editor, we'd be here all day.\n\nAseprite is worth the $15.

It's simply a joy to use. \n\nThe basic interface works like Photoshop, but everything is tweaked and optimized with pixel art in mind. You have every drawing tool you need right there, ready to go - as well as layers, frames (for animation) and a TON of really cool, intuitive tools designed to make your life easier - and they do! Take, for example, the shading tool: This pen-type cursor auto-shades the hues on a block of colour you draw on. You can very quickly add convincing depth and shadow to blocks of colour, and believe me that saves a HUGE amount of time. \n\nAseprite is also very light on resources meaning it runs like butter on basically any machine. Great for those long hours of drawing whilst watching films or listening to music. The interface itself is beautiful to look at, kind of like a nu-retro version of classic mac os aesthetics. \n\nI cannot recommend this software enough.

You'll be surprise what you can do if you pick the right colors. \n3.  Use reference photos and make them into pixel artwork. If you hit the art block just find simple things to turn into pixel art.

The chunky 8bit stylization wastes an ungodly amount of screen real estate in the GUI. The minute I saw it in the trailer I thought it looked gaudy, gimmicky, tacky,  unnecessary and wasteful. I'm trying to draw some basic sprites in an efficient interface, not pretend I'm using an ultra lo-res monitor with an 1980s microcomputer. Lets keep in mind I paid for every inch of panel space I have, and if a program just throws it away, I'm basically losing money. I also finds this stylization highly distracting, though that seems to have been the opposite of its developer's intention. \n\nIntention vs. Implementation:\nThe first problem is that it wastes so much space. \nAnother problem is the icons become cryptic. It was very hard to figure out very basic things about the program, which doesn't yet have a huge community online do draw knowledge from. \nHere's the big one, something the dev probly didn't consider. \nThis interface looks *nothing* like any productivity program I have running on my computer. \nAnd herein lies the big issue, I am constantly having my eyes pulled to the GUI elements looming in my peripheral with their (as of 2016 at least) highly sylized blocky pixels. That bold, jagged, upscaled unicode font is constantly screaming at my eyes to look at it.\nI would love to just have this look like my normal computer, which is running in Classic mode, AKA it looks basically like Windows 98.\nI edit video in a program that doesn't look like a piece of glass candy. My eyes ignore the UI and focus on the content I'm making. It's lovely. Importantly, the interface doesn''t *match the content*, so my perception never blurs the lines.\n\n\nThere are some serious concerns I have with the default layout. I was unable to find any way to change it on Google and the program does not make anything about itself obvious. I was finally able to change it thanks to developer response(thank you), and I can finally get to setting up a workflow.\n\nOverall the program performs well, hasn't crashed, and the thing that has frustrated me the most is that these issues stood in the way of me using a program that does have basically all the features I need. \n\nUI scalling has steep gradations only.

PyxelEdit is great if you want to do tiling, but it's not very good for animation (no frame manipulation, movement, no cels).\n\nOn the other hand, Aseprite has all those things and more - it can open anything you can throw at it, it has a very intuitive timeline feature, it even has a fancy pixel-style interface. \n\nIt takes a little bit of getting used to, since the controls are quite a bit different than something like Photoshop (which Pyxel Edit's control system is based off of), but once you do get to grips with it, you can come up with complex animation in record time.\n\nHere's a couple of examples I've made in it:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qtvMqn5.gif\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5GU4hnZ.gif \n\nAnother great advantage is that the developer keeps a close eye on what people ask for and does a good job introducing well-tested new features regularly.

The reviews weren't lying!\n\nThe built-in animation stuff works really great and your exported spritesheet is easily imported into Unity. Next to all that, it is the little things that make this software great, like the option to change the hotkeys or using the eyedropper to sample through several layers without having to click the individual layer. There is a lot of attention to user functionality.\n\nOne thing that might scare you off, which was mentioned in the currently single negative review, is the interface. However, this interface serves as a really comfortable work environment for pixel art, although I can imagine this might not seem obvious to the average user. If this interface bothers you, there is the option to change it into a regular interface. \n\nThere is a lot more positive and interesting stuff to say about this software, from the color palettes to the selection tool, but if you are looking for something to make your sprites and animations with, look no further and find out for yourself!\n\n10/10, HIGHLY recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1478890304, "timestamp_updated": 1478993298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665704", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26535476": {"recommendationid": "26535476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038746634", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513796162}, "language": "italian", "review": "The onion skin mode is really useful for animations :)\nI'll use this for my projects !", "timestamp_created": 1478867383, "timestamp_updated": 1478867383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26531427": {"recommendationid": "26531427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041821586", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 3248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 538, "last_played": 1513951915}, "language": "english", "review": "Successfully made pixel art.

Arguably the best, but does lack some features other pixel art editors have and has some minor issues of it's own.\n\n---\n\nThe features that impressed me include the palette editor, complete with many presets from classic hardware and other platforms. The animation editor comes with onion skinning. Each frame of the animation retains all the same layers in a matrix of frame & layer data. The freehand tool works very well for certain lines & shapes when drawing as it prevents the raw jaggedness of the shape as it would normally be rendered. The interface is just perfect for low-res pixel art.\n\nDither & pattern features like Graphics Gale and some other pixel art softwares have is disappointingly missing. It is particularly useful with the bucket tool. Another nice feature would be to allow selecting a portion of the animation to preview, like when I highlight certain frames it should use only those frames when I press 'play animation'.\n\n---\n\nI have found 2 issues that are only in the Linux version as far as I know (if you use Windows or OSX, skip this):\n\nSometimes the layer itself will copy and leave a highlight around it inside the animation editor that I can't get rid of without closing the tab. This is because it retains focus or something (I can't pin down the cause for this issue). \n\nThe second Linux glitch is that Alt does not provide a functional eyedropper tool for me (using MATE). It shows the eyedropper in place of the cursor while it's held, but it does not process clicks for color swapping. Still, it is a reassignable key and setting it to something else bypasses the issue. I had gotten so used to Alt though...\n\n---\n\nOverall, it's great software that's near perfect for a pixel artist's needs. It's drawbacks are annoying, but that does not stop it from being the best pixel art software on the market despite all that.\n\nI will update this if the above features or bugs are addressed.

Only an hour at the time of writing? And no past experience? Surely this can't be an accurate review. Take of it what you will, but an hour was all I needed (and the 15 dollars to buy it.) .\n\nWhy?\n\nDawnBringer's 32 color palette was the default palette. Considering the tiny amount of work I've done with a limited palette (no \"dirty\" brushes) has been with this palette, I felt at home with this program almost instantly (Disclaimer: You may not feel as comfortable as soon as you start it up like I did. Trust me, it won't take too long.) .\n\nOk, so the palette isn't the real reason I love it. You can set up your own anyways, just thought that was awesome.\n\nWorking with it is easy for any beginner pixel artists or anyone new to the program (like me), while still powerful enough for professional artists. The pixelated interface is a nice touch, too. Dunno why that one guy was complaining, a round/smooth GUI would look strange (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, some guy gave a negative review because the GUI was pixel art itself.) .\n\nBut what is (what I think) the one thing that makes this worth more than some free digital art program?\n\nLAYERS AND ANIMATION FRAMES ARE SEPARATE! That makes both simple and complex animations FAR easier to make. It functions a bit like other animation programs out there (I've had a little experience in Adobe Flash). What does this mean, you might (or might not) be asking? You can edit an image in different layers (like Photoshop layers), then move on to the nexxt frame of animation, while keeping the layers of the image!\n\nI already have a small project in mind to use this program for, too! I will take [url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7-StDyt752DMkxrcGFlc2lkZ2M]THESE[/url] (I made these back in an animation/image editing class. I used Photoshop for them...) and redo them (unposterize, if you will) while using the same 32 color palette.\n\nOh yeah, and you can make sprite sheets for games.

It is also a very good one.\n\nIt almost handles like Photoshop and MS Paint combined and if you're familiar with either software you'll be able to adjust in no time.  \n\nThere are three features that I like very much: the ability to create [Layers] and [Frames] plus the ability to [Play] those frames. Layers functions similarly to the one in Photoshop. Frames one the otherhand lets you create a  subsequent image you can edit. Then you can Play the Frames with a press of a button to see how well your animated sprite is coming along.

It works for Steam, HumbleBundle, and requires no real installation. What I mean is that after the first installation, there is really no need to use Steam to run Aseprite. Windows recognizes its file extensions and you're pretty much set. For more complex spriting, I still prefer Photoshop but Aseprite makes it a lot easier to animate considering you don't need to identify Layers and Frames as two separate Windows as you would in Photoshop. \n\nAseprite is a dedicated spriting platform much like how Painter is a dedicated Painting program. Photoshop is robust but like Painter, Aseprite makes it easy to sprite things on the fly without having to go through a lot of configurations. \n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+ Recognizes most shortcuts Photoshop uses\n+ Easy to remap shortcuts\n+ Color code selection made easy\n+ Frames and Layers in one window\n+ Frames and Layers are easy navigated by Arrow Keys\n+ Multiple windows within one window\n+ Exporting made easy; includes interlace option, animation loop option, scaling option up to 1000% without anti-aliasing\n+ Tagging your frames so you can have idle/run/shoot/etc animations on one timeline; making it possible to play specific animations on that timeline, these can be color coded as well \n+ Cycle through animations with < and >, I had this setup in Photoshop but since it came like this in Aseprite by default, I was pretty happy about it\n+ Runs a lot more efficiently than Photoshop, obviously dedicated pixelart/spriting platform\n+ Live symmetry, option where you can draw both sides at the same time vertically or horizontally \n+ Live tiled preview, option where you can make seamless textures easily\n+ Animated tiled preview and symmetry view\n+ Custom brushes made easily (feels glitchy sometimes)\n+ Dithering made really easy\n+ Anti-aliasing tool that gives you blurred effect like brush\n+ Sprites automatically backed up, made to recover lost sprites\n+ Ability to paint within the same shading so you don't go outside the pixels\n+ Onion Skin; this option gives you the ability to see a less opaque version of the previous and next frame allowing for easy transitions and animations\n+ Not intense on the system's resources\n+ Pixel perfect option performs where you won't get a distortion in the pixels forming the right amount of pixels between lines. However, this can be an issue if you're trying to fill in a color or paint a chunk of pixels somewhere. \n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- Arrow keys don't move pixels or objects unless selected by \"Marquee\" or \"Select All\" so you need 3 more actions for it\n- Aseprite files don't transfer to anything else well\n- Can not have windows outside of Aseprite's window (can window full screen it to all your monitors though)\n- Wish there was an easy option to export frames via tags", "timestamp_created": 1464573452, "timestamp_updated": 1464573461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23262902": {"recommendationid": "23262902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057440428", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 12652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 934, "last_played": 1514147248}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good pixel software.

This sprite tool is serious business.

Photoshop oldbies will tell you, PS tries to be the be-all, end-all, and as such has many features, fully 60% more than you'll ever use, even in professional sprite generation.  This tool cuts all the crap and gives you exactly what you need.  Now PS has tons of default features, most sprite tutorials show you how to turn them off.  Aseprite's default features are EXACTLY what you need!  \n\nWhile I was trying to painstakingly duplicate one of the palette I use in PS, I began to compare them to the default 32 color palette in Asesprite.

It's very easy to use and has a lovely, stylised UI that doesn't intimidate you. It is also quite feature rich and customizeable. While it is simple enough for anyone to use, it also has a bunch of advanced tools and options, so there's a lot you can do with it. \n\nIt may not be as advanced and complicated as something like Pro Motion, but as a result, it's much more inviting and easier to use. You can tell that the developer(s?) put a lot of effort and care into making this software. While the UI looks very colorful and cutesy (which I really, really like), it's also a very powerful tool in and of itself.\n\nI have very few criticisms with this app, and none of them are really that major. I found doing some actions to be repetitive, but I ended up making keyboard shortcuts for them so that problem was solved for me. The palette editor could be a little better, it kinda feels a bit clunky and can take some time to get used to. I also wish you can adjust the intensity of some of the tools like the blur/jumble tool (if you can, I don't know how). Other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\nI think the main reason why I like this application so much is that it's actually fun to use. It doesn't have a steep learning curve, loads almost instantly and the tools are easy to use. It's great for quick doodles as well and full on sprites, tiles and animations.

But I finally gave Aseprite another chance this year and it quickly became my favorite art program for Pixel Art. There is so many good things about this program and I think its trailer does a very good job saying its features. I used the offline version the most for 2 weeks straight, 6 hrs a day, to create badges for RPG Maker MV. So I have played around most of its features.\n\nIf there are some things I enjoy about it the most:\n\n> The color wheel (the option to be not square) is greatly appreciated. Especially since I find it easier to pick colors from there.\n\n> The way it handles palettes is a lot better than any pixel art program I used. It's easy to use and doesn't require me to go through much hoops to save.\n\n> It has an animation timeline for animation. Similar to flash/toon boom/other animation programs. That is very much appreciated. Additionally, it has a separate preview for animation. I can edit the frames themselves, similar to graphics gale, than adjust the canvas position for the next 'sprite sheet frame' and edit that. I hate it when other art programs physically stops me from touching the canvas to do adjustments while watching the motion. It is infuriating. \n\n> Adjustable grid sizes and it doesn't have to 'constrain proportions' all the time. If I want a 43x50 sprite grid I am going to get it and I love this program for that.

After watching the trailer video and seeing the animation workflow, I decided to give it a chance, and man I'm glad I did. \n\nFor anyone who has used flash, you'll feel right at home. The interface is similar and feels just as robust and 100x easier when making animations. Being able to draw/animate each piece in a different layer gives you a lot of control and ease, also for anyone who has used GG, they should know the frustration in editing multiple frames of the same layer and/or setting up sprite sheets after you've completed your animation. Aseprite does all of this automatically, and god does it speed up workflow!\n\nOne of the most surprising and powerful features of this program is the Pixel-Perfect option which lets you draw freehand (with a mouse even!) and get fairly correct results when drawing. I would advise to not rely on this tool, but it helps tremendously in learning how a line works, or why a line you made doesn't work. \n\nI also enjoy the option to change from a color wheel, to a color spectrum when picking my colors; and also being able to pick different colors from modes such as Analogous, Complementary and Triadic. (This just makes color theory something you don't have to master to have great colors in your art.) Also the default color palettes are great (really love having a NES palette) and I hope to see more implemented!\n\nExporting is super easy and simple as well! You can keep your file in .ase format (so you can keep your layers and animations exactly how you left them) and when you're ready to export them into your game, it's as simple as hitting CtrlL+E. I can't tell you how much of a blessing this simple little feature is, and how much time it saved me.\n\nThe only two issues I've run into so far are-\n1: Lag seems to be a problem when making the color wheel/spectrum larger.\n2: After playing and then stopping your animation, the layer defaults back to the top. Not knowing this at first caused me to draw on the wrong layer which was frustrating. After I figured out it did this, it was just something I had to be aware of, but annoying none the less. \n\nI've only scratched the surface of this program, so the issues I presented may have easy fixes I'm not aware of, nor do they take away how great this program is! If you're an aspiring artist, or a veteran in game design, I would definitely recommend this program.

Palette options are impressive and straightforward, exporting has a zillion options for your convenience, there are layer and animation and onion skin functions, and my only real gripe is that despite having plenty more room for tools in the toolbar, half of them share a button space with one another and you need to hotswap them as you go along.

Still, I jumped in and made a dinky little sprite in about 5 minutes that I was happy with.

I don't know how big of a deal the aesthetic will be for some people, maybe the low-res nature of it will drive some of you batty but to me it helps encourage a creative atmosphere, which is something sorely lacking in today's market.

I supported it before it hit steam and let me tell you it has delivered.I have used planty and primarly photoshop for my gaming projects. But aseprite continues to be my trusty go-to for sprite production.\n\nIt has most of the basic needs you would need,Pen, erasor, fill. But the swatch system is very nice and preloaded retro swatches also is convneyiant. I find myself using primarily the countour and polygon tool.\n\nA another thing I enjoy about Aseprite is it has a very nice backup system. It has a good color replacment tool as well as a nice \"jumble\" tool that can be usefull as well. You can do a symetric mirror option to mirror your working plane, this is very handy if you like precision.\nA recent addition is the implimention of brush saving,which is very neat!\n\nThe animation in Aseprite is pretty basic,but the addition of onion skins really helps it give it that extra push.\n\nMy only complaints would be the lack of export options for images with layers, some bone animation support would be good too. My only other nit-pick is the draw to grid mode is automaticly activated on a new image rather than toggled off.\n\nIn conclusion, Aseprite is very promising. It still is in a early state,but the features implimented are robust and functional. It feels like a complete program. Despite these good features it still feel like a few are missing,although I have no doubts they will be implimented.

The things I do NOT do on asesprite are: concept, choosing colors and values. With photoshop this is easy, it's easy to draw (high res) and pick colors and there's a million adjustments tools. This is not even a frame of animation, by the way, it's just a preparation for the sprite. Then I take this image to aseprite, create the palette out of it and redraw the whole thing in low resolution using aseprite tools and everything else is done in aseprite.\n\nI love the animation tools. I think it's worth mentioning because it's by far my favorite thing about it. It's extremely simple and powerful.

IT IS MUCH MUCH BETTER AND EASIER TO USE!! O:\n\nLet me say:\n\nIt's like photoshop, but for pixel art. Seriously. \n\nPROS\n-- \n+Super rad real time animation preview makes animation smooth\n+ onion skin lets you see what's on other layers when you're drawing new frames\n+ LAAAYERS\n+ work with opaque or transparent backgrounds\n+ layers can be transparent and have opacity \n+ incredibly easy to navigate\n+ YOU CAN LOCK UR LAYERRRS!\n+ super cheap animation program that's cute, simple and well made. (Google the price of others, like Ulead GIF animator 5.0)\n- able to save in basically any format (EXCEPT PSD. HOPING THIS WILL CHANGE!)\n-also has a tiny preview to show you what you're working on.\n- really really cool rotate tool, so your stuff doesn't get super fuzzy\n\nCONS?\n-- \n~ [strike]No crop? Seriously I can't find crop. If anyone can hint me that, ping me. \n- I hate that [ and ] don't change the size of the brush, but instead scroll through the colours. I keep messing myself up.[/strike] *** crop DOES exist! The dev stated it's in SPRITE - Crop\n- no colour adjustment button. (in photoshop its edit > adjustments > adjust hue/saturation, but I wish we had one here so I didnt have to switch programs)\n- [strike]no opacity lock so you can't just draw on the layer without worrying about messing up others, but that's a minimal complaint. [/strike] Lock alpha exists which lets me do that! Nevermind!\n\nIt's still a new program and has so much potential.\nI hate trying out new software and have had my gif program for 18 years, I'm actually really really happy with this. I recently made a guide for this program if you're interested at looking at what it can do and how simple it really can be. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630941660\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1456202047, "timestamp_updated": 1468573928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869949", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21398868": {"recommendationid": "21398868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105145404", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502747502}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud53d\uc140\uc544\ud2b8 \ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \ub108\ubb34 \ud3b8\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774\ub124\uc694!

They've implemented a color picker similar to the style I prefer, which was my main limiting factor before. Now my only wishlist is to have multiple windows open so I can have a reference picture and the art I'm working on both visible at the same time, though that can be mitigated with multiple monitors.\n\n----------\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI've been making pixel art for over ten years now, most of which was using Photoshop CS3. A year or so ago I got fed up with it - photoshop is a great tool, but not designed for pixel work and having to work around everything to make it suitable was frustrating - and started looking for other programs. It was about that time that I discovered Aseprite.\n\nAseprite is not my primary tool for pixel art, but the only program I use for animations is Aseprite. It took a bit of getting used to, but it is MUCH better than PS CS3 was, and better than other pixel art specific programs I have used.\n\nI would consider moving over to Aseprite as my main driver for pixel art if there were a few things different - my main program allows for holding down shift and using the mouse wheel to change the brush size, and I've come to rely on that. I also do not like the color picker, and prefer photoshop/corel painter/etc style of color pickers with a slider to change the hue, and picking the saturation/brightness on the picker. Right now the main methods of color picking are an MS Paint style where you have all the colors in one box, or by using Hue/Saturation/Brightness or RGB sliders, and I find it difficult to choose a good color with the precision I'm used to.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent pixel art-specialized art and animation program. This is not a full suite painter program like Photoshop, so don't expect to do digital painting. This is for pixel art, and the specialization makes it extremely suited for the task.", "timestamp_created": 1456164107, "timestamp_updated": 1503864604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768491", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21389401": {"recommendationid": "21389401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970556493", "num_games_owned": 716, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 21966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511958938}, "language": "english", "review": "My favourite pixel arting tool!", "timestamp_created": 1456160832, "timestamp_updated": 1456160832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21388061": {"recommendationid": "21388061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063078123", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495292314}, "language": "italian", "review": "Consigliato assolutamente, per quello che costa vale la pena comprarlo.

You think I'm writing a review with my ridiculously low amount of total usage time of 15 minutes. Well let me tell you, because I've installed Aseprite in steam while working on Aseprite that wasn't launched through steam for the whole day already, and have been waiting to write a bloody good review about this software since I first knew it was coming onto steam.\n\nI made my first pixel art ever in gamemaker, but gamemaker's image editor was rubbish. I never understood why I didn't start with Adobe Photoshop when it existed in my computer way before I started with gamemaker, but having being used to other digital drawing softwares, sometimes I think Adobe is being difficult with me, and vice versa. Then I came first came across Aseprite through some youtube video. I watched his brief introduction of Aseprite, and went to check out the program itself, and instantly bought it. But know this, because at this point, I am still no digital artist, nor pixel art artist, and definitely not an animator. With Aseprite, I was quickly introduced into how the program works by watching the introductory video on the official site, and fiddling with things in Aseprite. \n\nWhat I have found likable about the software so far:\n- Loading closed image or aseprite files, or even an entire folder has never been so easy with the home menu.\n- The software UI is neat and clean, and very comfortable to look at in relation to your own works. \n- Layers and frames arrangement are easy to change.\n-Aseprite was a wonder when it came to animating pixel art as well. I could never for the life of me draw an animation perfectly in synch with the previous or later frame. The guides in Aseprite makes it easy for you to see and change your work at anytime and in any order. \n- Attempting to resize or saving a specific part of a whole image in a different file is too easy without needing to know your selected sprite size. It quickens work pace.\n- I am fickle-minded with colour usage and the palatte selection here is godsent. With most other programs, you only have two active colour selections at any given time. Sure, you have the same two main colours in use, but you are also able to store your colours into the current palatte for easy access later, instead of having to simply pick and drop, lose it and bash your head on keyboards.\n- Talking about keyboards, here's some icing on a cake. You can rebind every single tool to your choice of keys.\n- Wacom works with this program like a charm. But screen scrolling with wacom can be too fast for naked eyes, so take note of it and you'll be used to it. P.S. Enabling touch on your wacom can sometimes caused unnecessary extreme zoomed in rare accidental cases.\n- There is also fx customisation for your sprite images. Though options are not as fanciful as softwares like Adobe, but they cover a good basic ground all-around easily.\n\nThe only thing I am looking forward to that isn't present:\n- Gradients. You can achieve a full range of gradient tones between two colours in the palatte, but not directly on the image. So if you want to do a pixellated gradient background pixels by pixels, you're in the right place. I stick to Adobe Photoshop for my smooth gradient backgrounds and imports back into Aseprite. You could turn your flawless Adobe Photoshop image to slightly pixellated gradients, I'll have you know.\n\nI may not seem to have covered everything. I'm sure, but I haven't actually taken full advantage of Aseprite because I only stick to a good few tools in my making of pixel art and have found no problems thus far in my usage. What I've come to notice is that the developer is an active player in the community and answers your concerns or hears your suggestions very often. Not to forget, but before stating your questions, you might want to check out the massive library of documentation, reference and tutorials readily available on the official site.\n\nSo. If you're looking for a software at a comfortable price with ease of use for making, editing, or animating pixel art with a good deal of functions most big name softwares will offer, consider giving Aseprite a try. Because I'd be damned if it wasn't for this magnificent piece of a software.", "timestamp_created": 1456154169, "timestamp_updated": 1456154366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 149, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21387074": {"recommendationid": "21387074", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970372340", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 114565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2403, "last_played": 1514765969}, "language": "english", "review": "A great little pixel art program by a great independent developer.

There are onion layers to help you when animating, a blending tool, layers, etc. \n\nPersonally I have used the program to create assets for video games, designs for t-shirts on RedBubble, an intro animatic for a game, and animations just for the fun of it. It's very easy to export frames onto a sprite sheet which makes implementation for games very easy. \n\nSo I legitimately believe Aseprite is a great program to get for pixel art considering it's price. I mean $15 is a steal to me considering how much I use it. The only program I think that might be better than Aseprite for pixel art is Pro Motion NG, but that one is a bit more expensive.

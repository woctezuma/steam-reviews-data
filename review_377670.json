(I think). Maybe putting around 65-70 hours. Literally had no idea what a visual novel was before then. All I wanted was to have my Japanese filling for the rest of my life since I didn't really watch anime and I came across a few torrents. What a great mistake. I buy this today because back then I had no legal means of acquiring it and I have to thank the developers for hours of entertainment.\n\nVisual novels are not short nor are they hard to get into. Although there are less lengthy ones, this VN is the perfect size for a decent plotline to engross you. In my very biased opinion, this is one of the best entry visual novels you'll ever read. However, I'd also recommend Katawa Shoujo and that one is free. If you are not very knowledgable about VNs - it's a sort of weird. But there's always a first for everything and keep your expectations low. That's what I'm trying keep this review about.\n\nIt's 2017 and there are an exceedingly amount of hours that can be used to read visual novels. Consider this one if you are starting out.

Yes, it's more expensive, but without voices it just sucks.\n\nG-Senjou no Maou or otherwise called Devil on G-String is a Mystery / Drama Visual Novel, with a bit of romance an does its job fairly well. It's thrilling and at times touching as well - which should be exactly what you want, right?\n\nI won't go into detail of the synopsis (you can read that on the shop page), but I will say: G-Senjou no Maou has a rather interesting story, that takes a lot of unexpected turns throughout the chapters and also intentionally leads the reader to make the wrong conclusions. While the prologue isn't really that appealing, you should definitely at least give chapter 2 a chance because that's when the story really starts to build up. The only thing I didn't like about the story is that Harus route is the only one that concludes everything. It's possible to jump into each of main heroines chapters (with the story ending after that chapter) but if it's not Harus route, then apparently the events of Harus route don't happen in the other routes. This causes a lot of strings to be untied and takes the impact away. As such the story really only makes sense if you play Harus route.\n\nPerhaps it's biggest strength are its characters. G-Senjou no Maou boasts a high number of well detailed characters, with a lot of depth and personality added to them. Each of the four heroines (Tsubaki, Kanon, Mizuha, Haru) has her own chapter, with Harus chapter being the true route and also the longest and (from the point of view of many) best chapter. Because of this, every heroine has a lot of screentime that builds up their personality, with other characters like Yuki, Gonzou and later \"Maou\", getting their screentime between the chapters as well. That overall gives G-Senjou no Maou a good cast with a lot of likeable characters, even if they are \"evil\". While some characters are merely stereotypes (Tsubaki -> naive, childhood friend, Kanon -> stepsister, Mizuha -> classic tsundere ...) they are at least detailled enough to differ from the rest. I also want to highlight a rather interesting motivation on Maous side for his actions, it's always nice to see something that isn't \"ruling the world\".\n\nG-Senjou no Maou has a visually appealing art style, though the characters designs aren't really unique and more \"generic\". This isn't necessarily bad though and I don't think a more unique style would make the VN any better anyway. What really stands out though, are the soundtracks. Almost all soundtracks are remixes of a number of different classic music pieces (which include Bach, Orff and other well known composers). This makes G-Senjou no Maous OST rather remarkable and fits well into the story.\n\nAll in all, I don't think G-Senjou no Maou is a necessary \"must-read\", but if you're a fan of drama or mystery, then maybe you should give it a try. And if you're not entirely opposed to romance, then it's even better. I wouldn't call G-Senjou no Maou a \"true masterpiece\", but it's fairly enjoyable.\n\nPoints? I think anything from 8 to 10 is justified. Personally I would give 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1511334539, "timestamp_updated": 1511334539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36585642": {"recommendationid": "36585642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218141715", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510623604}, "language": "english", "review": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW!*\n\nI'll level with you - when I originally heard about G-Senjou No Maou, I wasn't sure if was for me.  While I like my fair share of crime and dark themes, the story of the son of a yakuza boss didn't 100% appeal to me, so I bypassed it.  However, as I continued to search around online for enjoyable visual novels that were different from the average high school romance theme, G-Senjou No Maou kept popping up on everyone's lists...  so I thought what the hell, let's give it a go.  GREAT DECISION.\n\nThis game is popular for good reason.  The visuals are nice, the soundtrack is interesting in that it's reimagined and often modernised versions of real classical pieces by famous composers (you'll understand where the whole 'g-string' thing comes in here...  it's not about underwear), and it has an overall polished feel to it.  What really got me hooked was the plotline, how it was paced and how it unfolded.  At first, I was doubting whether the style of plot it had would really ensnare me to play through to the end, but it really got under my skin because it was so well written.  The speech and perspective of the protagonist is very natural and easy to want to follow.  The characters are not 2D in the slightest, all very important and different from your average schoolkid in various ways - they've all had dark experiences, they all have secrets...  and it makes their actions, thoughts and potential motivations VERY interesting and compelling because each of them could have a massive positive or detrimental impact to the events of the story, should they choose to.  There's a big theme of moral integrity throughout, of what is wrong and right, how to view and treat people, whether it's worth it to fight to stay in the 'light', or whether it would be more satisfying to embrace darkness and become something people would fear...  it walks that delicate line between insanity and purity that people do face in real life.  Should I do what's right, or what's easy?  Should I turn against humanity because of my own pain, or should I invest my belief in the power of love?  There are big questions in this plot, big struggles, constant surprises and exciting possibilities that keep you playing.\n\nThere are four routes in this game, and each have their own good and bad endings.  One character holds the 'true route', and I'm not going to spoil anyone, but if you find out which one that is, I would highly recommend pursuing that route LAST, because it leads you to an ending that closes off a lot of possibilities that are explored in the other routes, and not only that, but if you play the other routes first, you will have a higher appreciation of the feelings of the characters in the true route ending.  It's vital to explore every route in this game because, as is wonderful about visual novels, each one changes the story and the actions of the protagonist so that new situations arise and the characters go through major experiences that would not be possible had you not gone down that route.  Since a lot of big things happen in this game, the course of events changes massively in some cases and it's interesting to see that plot difference once you've played them all.\n\nAs for the story itself, it's surprisingly compelling, mysterious, full of secrets that you long to uncover, and full of action; there's criminal activity, hostage situations, espionage, murder, even terrorism...  the story is very well paced and told in a way that makes you not want to rest until you discover the truth.  It's exciting and thrilling, but it's also balanced out with romance elements and the in and out trappings of daily school life, which only helps to make the story more interesting, as it's a cool juxtaposition; one minute you're having lunch on the rooftop and laughing at the guy with the crush on the teacher, the next, you're shooting a gun in the streets trying to stop someone from activating a bomb...  it's crazy in just the right way.  Again, I won't spoil, but the twist in the true route's ending regarding the identity of a certain person and what people have to go through in order to protect those they love and try to achieve the happiest future they can is really worth the effort you put into the game.  There was a detail right at the very end that made me cry because, like the protagonist, I'd resigned myself to the thought that a certain possibility was gone...  and suddenly there it was, like an impossible dream come true.  Very well done.  Also, they really know how to present a villain.  I still see that guys eyes in my mind and feel a little flicker of nervousness every time I do.  He was written so well that his CG alone began to make me uncomfortable.  You'll probably see what I mean once you play the game and learn his personality.  When he had that little smile on his face...  I felt like he could see me through the screen and had already plotted my demise before I'd had the chance to click anything.\n\nI'd like to close off by saying that sometimes, you have to pay a certain price to acquire a visual novel of a certain caliber, but G-Senjou No Maou managed to surpass my expectations by displaying a level of sophistication and enjoyability that punched above its price bracket.  A lot of other visual novels that cost this much are definitely not as good.  It has a maturity and poise to it that makes the whole experience feel like a real thrill and very much worth it.  Like I said, I didn't think it was gonna be my thing, and it's now one of my favourite visual novels I've ever played.  If you like crime, drama, psychology and the duality of darkness and light within the human mind, this is definitely for you.  If you're not sure, hey, I wasn't either, but I'd still recommend it, cos it'll get you hooked before you know it!.\n\nVery strong performance.  And also, once you play, you'll understand...

The characters are well designed and have distinct personalities. Kudos to [b]AKABEiSOFT[/b] on their incredible story writing. There are [spoiler]2 endings per character except Haru (who is the original route)[/spoiler].\n\nEven after finishing the game, it was still in my mind for quite some days - the ending with Haru in particular. It almost made me cry while completing it. Apart from making the setting a thriller, mystery and a bit of drama - there are a couple of 4th wall breakers as well (which to be honest, was completely unexpected).\n\nI nevery really write about the characters, but the main female lead [b]Usami Haru[/b] is awesome by all accounts. Funny, eccentric and has an extremely sharp mind. Kudos to whoever created her.

If you said yes to all of them, then this VN may have literally been made just for you.\n\nG-Senjou no Maou is a really good story which I won't even spoil a shred of because you won't want me to.\n\nThere are 3 side routes which diverge from the \"one true ending\".  Actually, nothing in the one true ending seems to happen  in the other side routes.\n\nThe 3 other routes are mostly fluff.  (Mostly) sweet tiny romance stories about three of the other characters that are there along your story, two being school friends, and one being your step-sister.  However, it's important to play them at least once, and you'll know why once you finish the main route.\n\nI have one and only one warning.  This game has been perfectly made.  There are quite literally no drawbacks.  You could say that the long dialogue is a \"drawback\", but every bit of dialogue in the game is important, so if you're there for the story, it won't matter.\n\nThe warning is that you will think about the game.  You'll question the way you think.  With the ending that it has, you will question your sense of justice and your sense of right and wrong, and you'll probably stick with this question: \"Was it really fair?\"\n\nG-Senjou no Maou has [b] the most bittersweet endings in any story I have ever read or seen. [/b]  Whether it be anime, other visual novels, manga, light novels, novels, chapter books, biographies; you name it, it won't outdo this.\n\nGranted, that's just what I've seen, though I've gone through many stories.  Even all that said, G-Senjou no Maou has, hands down, the most bittersweet ending that I have ever witnessed, and I couldn't hold back tears at all.  Tears and anger at the unjustice of it.\n\nI won't spoil much.

I'm glad I listened to the raving endorsements of my fellow VN-loving friends and didn't give up a second time, as pushing through to the meat of the narrative was well worth it.  I can't remember the last time a VN (or book for that matter) had me up until the wee hours of the night unable to pull myself away from the intrigue.  The Devil on G-String is a compelling crime drama that had me second guessing everything I thought I knew for almost its entire length before smacking me with a gut-wrenching finale that stuck with me long after I was done.  \n \nIt's difficult to offer a short description of the story without giving anything away, but I'll try.  Our protagonist is Kyousuke Azai, a young man living a dual life of high school student in the day and yakuza underling at night.  Kyousuke isn't your regular yakuza thug, however.  Adopted by one of the organization's most ruthless leaders, he's stuck in the precarious position of paying off old family debts while trying to drag himself out from under his foster father's abusive thumb.  When an awkward young woman transfers to his high school class, life spirals out of control as he's dragged into the vendetta between Usami Haru and the mysterious criminal mastermind named Maou.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1083518166  \nThat little synopsis doesn't even scratch the surface of the story as the plot twists and turns in ways that will have you dizzy before long.  Kidnap, murder, betrayal, deceit, revenge - there are very few atrocities not touched upon, and the writers bring it all to life with fast-paced action, vivid imagery, and lively banter between the characters.  Even the narration is excellently paced with a rhythm that ebbs and flows with the action.  Rich descriptions and familiar cultural references that don't feel ham-fisted leave little question in my mind that the translators did one hell of a job localizing this brilliant piece of fiction.  \n\nUnfortunately, the side routes are where the excellence falters.  Serving as little more than fluff-filled diversions from the main plot, they slow down the narrative and prevent the reader from getting to the meat of the story for far too long.  Yes, they add some back story to Kyousuke, but it's not enough to make the amount of time you'll spend reading through them worth it.  When I do read it again (which I indeed will at some point), I'll be skipping them entirely.   \n\nThe overall presentation is phenomenal with gorgeous artwork and so many CGs I felt like I was watching a movie at times.  The voice overs are also extremely well done, and I'd suggest picking up the voice pack if you happen to have the extra dollars (though the story is good enough to hold its own without them).  I only wished the soundtrack was a little more memorable.  I know that sounds odd considering it's comprised entirely of arrangements of classical masterpieces, but I feel like the sound quality of the instrumentation used just doesn't do them justice.  At least they weren't disruptive to the story at all.   \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1083517450\nI really wish I could delve further into explaining just why you NEED to read this, but doing so would only ruin the experience.  So I will leave you with this: If you enjoy well-written thrillers that will have you on the edge of your seat one moment and holding back tears the next, then you need to read The Devil on G-String.  It really is one of the best visual novels I've read in quite some time.

Main characters clash each other not with bare-hand but brain-using which is freaking COOL and hard to stop playing. Plot and twists in the story made me think it is more than worth buying this game.\n- Unfortunately I found 2 things which are considered the drawbacks of this game. Firstly, it focuses too much on the route of the main heroine (Usami Haru) and makes the others too short in length. Even though those routes are high quality and really touch me, I think it would be more sentimental if I can spend more time with the girls.\n- Secondly, this game shows the best of psycological fight and plot twists that I have ever seen, but unfortunately at the very last chapters the fascination of unpredictable plot is suddenly dropped and overcome by melodrama and easy-guessing plot procedure. I'm not hate a melodrama plot, the true ending is even one of the best ending that I almost cry, but the game cannot make my heart beating like the very first chapters.\n\n- To conclue, everyone should play this visual novel, honestly.

Though I found Kanon's route the most touching (which is surprising since I didn't like her at all at first)\n- A great antagonist\n- Many surprising plot twists\n- Great voicing\n\nCon:\n- I could not get to like the protagonist, he kept annoying me until the end\n- The 'main route' could not completely satisfy me in the romance department (although it did well so in the plot department)\n- The music seemed average to me (although to be honest, the music is not nearly as important as the story for me, so it was not a big bother)\n- contrary to what other people wrote it took me a while to get hooked to the story (like the first 90 minutes)\n\nnonetheless a clear recommenadtion for every VN fan out there :)", "timestamp_created": 1493332408, "timestamp_updated": 1493332454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31213856": {"recommendationid": "31213856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028102968", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484474070}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic!", "timestamp_created": 1492500592, "timestamp_updated": 1492500592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31155084": {"recommendationid": "31155084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057063243", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492261089}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great visual novel.

As a reader you are checking reviews to see whether or not there is anything in particular that may be problematic with the game or to help sway your opinion to buy the game and read it. And there is no problem with doing this. This review will accommodate this purchase methodology.\n\nGenerally checking reviews is the safest way to go about making a purchase. But, in this particular case researching too much will have the opposite effect and ruin the experience of reading the story. There is a difference between reading with background info and with minimum information known. The latter is the best way to enjoy this game, hence no breakdown of the story. [i]However[/i], this isn't to say there aren't problems with the product nor will I exclude some information on the structure of the game and discuss presentation tidbits. I will go in order of structure, problems, and then presentation, following a conclusion.\n\n[h1]Structure:[/h1] \nThere are four routes you can go through. In terms of setup there is a prologue, 5 chapters and an epilogue. A route coincides with a chapter, and each route, except the \"true\" route, has a possible bad ending. The ending you receive is influenced by the decisions you make while playing. In total it took me approximately 18 hours to read, including every route and ending.\n\n\n[h1]Problems:[/h1] \nIn my 18 hours of playing there were a few notable issues present. Sometimes the skip text button would not work properly and skip all text that was read before; however this was mainly present in the beginning, but disappeared later after I switched the option from \"All\" to \"text read\". One other issue the game suffered from was crashing when accessing Steam overlay. As long as I did not access Steam overlay while playing there were no crashing problems, and in most cases it was rectified through regular saving. Taking screenshots was sometimes a hit or miss too. Sometimes the overlay feature wouldn't work and would require a quick restart to work properly. Finally there were a few issues in translation. Not many were present, but some stuck out and were fairly noticeable in the later half of the game.\n\nIt is also worth noting that there are some disputes about the Steam version being censored. However, it did not take away from the experience. \n\n\n[h1]Presentation: [/h1]\nThe game's art and music are terrific, in my opinion. You can get a strong sense of what is going on throughout the game using the imagery provided. *I did not buy the voice edition; and would not mind updating my review in the future to accommodate it when I do; however, for the moment it will not touch on that specific.* In terms of UI it is simple and straight-forward with no navigation issues. There are also more than enough save slots to accommodate regular saving and multiple playthroughs. Lastly, most tracks are based off of pieces of classical music. The original, non-classical, scores made for this visual novel complimented the classical renditions well. In the top right-hand corner when a new track begins the classical score is noted as well, providing it has one.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nIn closing, this game was a phenomenal experience. The structure is fairly standard with a decently long read time, there are some technical issues in this version of the game and other issues such as censorship; however, the presentation of the visual novel is will done. The art and music go together well and by all means is a very story rich experience. \n\nI would recommend this product.", "timestamp_created": 1492068520, "timestamp_updated": 1492068974, "voted_up":

You will face different heinous crime topics and I will not say take it lightly but really dissect and understand the nature of the games theme and intended environment. That being said it is a very thought provoking game in design because of it I recemmened playing and getting every route that you can stomach. In order due to Chapter constraints > Tsubaki, Kanon, Shiratori, and Usami. Each opens up a bit of understanding on Kyosuke's history but also a bit on those characters and their other struggles or understandings.

I could've sworn there was no doubt that Kyousuke was Maou. I'm on the Haru Route, not sure if I read it during the route or before but I'm sure I read Maou admitting to himself as being Kyousuke. I didn't take any screenshots but I could've sworn he said he had recently became aware of his other half Azai Kyousuke. On multiple occasions the heroines witnessed him start talking like Maou. After Kyousuke would have his headache and supposedly become Maou he'd be in the exact same place Kyousuke just was. IMO it goes way beyond just tricking the reader into thinking Kyousuke was Maou with his forgetfulness and headaches. Example, when Kanon comes to Kyousuke's house to talk about her feelings and you tell her to talk about it later and she goes to take a shower, Kyousuke gets a headache and becomes Maou, Kanon says there's no towel and then Maou replies that he'll get one. So how is his brother secretly alive and is Maou all along?? And what was Kyousuke getting mad about his mother's death and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Haru about and threatening to kill her if he ever saw her again about? He showed absolutely no knowledge of her being the daughter of the man his father killed and even though he says he knew but pretended she was someone else why did he suddenly get angry about it? It was so weird there was no purpose, him being upset about his mother's death had nothing to do with Haru so why'd he get mad at her? And why did Kyousuke's adopted father save him from getting killed by his brother, he wasn't supposed to give a rat's \u2665\u2665\u2665 about him. And why was Kyousuke suprised about Haru being the daughter of the famous violenist? How did he know that Haru was the daughter of the man his father murdered but not know who her mom was, especially concidering he had no memory of meeting her when they were kids at that point? I know Haru says she loves Kyousuke and was willing to smash but he said he \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 her and said he'd kill her if he saw her again. That being said how on earth does she still like him and much more how does he like her? Literally nothing happened between them between him saying he'd kill her after he'd \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 her and then him coming to rescue her from his brother and calling her his women and now acting like they're in love and smashing repeatedly. And after Kyousuke woke up in his house and was threatened by Gonzou's men and managed to get away with some idk even know questioning their mafia honor or something about robbing and killing him, he gets a call from Tsubaki, talks to her and then immediately says let's go kill Gonzou without a headache. So how is he not Maou?? Idk maybe I misreads somethings or something I just don't know.\n\nI just feel like the story was sooo good until they revealed that Kyousuke wasn't Maou. It was starting to feel like the best visual novel I have ever read. When they revealed how Maou took the stock certificates from the breifcase because he was dressed up like a police man and nobody noticed I was LIKE OMGG that makes sense and is soo cool. I just thought it was pretty funny and thrilling story of how Kyousuke had a split personality who would've been trying to kill Gonzou and Haru and how they would try to find Maou not knowing it was Kyousuke all along, but then I get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed over and everything I thought I knew was a lie. But the lie has so many holes in it it just doesn't make sense. I think I'm going to re:read through the parts I found inconsistent to make sure I haven't misread something.

The main difference is that they cut the adult content and edited some CGs and that's pretty much it.\n\nG-senjou no Maou - The Devil on G-String is definitely one of the best Visuals Novels available on Steam, one of my favourites as well.\n\n[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]\nThe story is superb, this VN is all about crimes in the underworld. Kidnapping, murder, genocides, etc. and they did a very good job with it so it's really hard for you to actually get bored with it. The intro \"Maou vs Haru\" is one of my favourite scenes in the game.\n\nSoundtracks are great. I'm actually quite surprised knowing how many soundtracks in this game that are actually good. Try to listen to [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfthFelJnsk]\"The Moment of Truth/Shiyuu\"[/url] and you'll understand why, Tiko-\u03bc is such a top tier music arranger.\n\nArtworks? Not much to say here, the game was first released back in 2008 so the it looks a bit dated compared to recent VNs. Regardless, they're still pretty nice to look at.\n\n[h1]The uhh... not so good stuff, opinion-ish[/h1]\nSide routes. I did say that the story is amazing and indeed they are, but that is because I was talking about the \"True Route\" of the game. Now, I'm not saying that their routes are bad, I actually like them, I just want to say that their routes is not that amazing when you compare them to the \"True Route\".\n\nWhat else? One thing that I didn't really like was the Chapter 4 when [spoiler]Tokita is revealed to be the 'Maou' childrens. I don't know, it came out of nowhere so it felt forced considering she doesn't have that much screentime compare to everyone. In the end, I could not sympathize about her for the rest of the game.[/spoiler]\nYeah, probably it's just me being nitpicky and all but eh, I need to at least get this thing off from my chest.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this VN.

The voice acting is very good even though it is in japanese (would be nice if they had English voice pack too). The Vn also has an incredible selection of music that fits the scenes very well.

My only real complaint is that depending on the route you choose to take the story gets longer or shorter, but I still enjoyed each ending and was satisfied by how they ended. I wish they would have taken more time and fleshed out all the routes to the conclusion of he true ending, and made them all the same length. Overall I'd  give this a 9.5/10.

The game uses a system where you ultimately have one single storyline. \n\nEnjoyment:\n\nHad fun, cried, laughed, cried laughing.\n\nOverall:\n\n10/10 for every aspect, this is definitely the best visual novel i have ever played and it will be REALLY hard to top this one.", "timestamp_created": 1478909514, "timestamp_updated": 1478909564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535317", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26135035": {"recommendationid": "26135035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006455520", "num_games_owned": 950, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 3461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476988698}, "language": "english", "review": "G-senjou no Maou is detective novel. \nIt features conflict betwen protagonist and mysterious \"Maou\" character.

I hate to admit it, but I used to be one of those people, but no longer.\n\nWith that said, let's start with the title: The Devil on G-String. \n\nThe game is essentially about a battle of wits between a \"hero\" and a \"devil,\" called \"maou\" in the game, with a pleasing reliance on classical music to set up things. Thus, the \"G-String\" refers to a violin string, not underwear. Most of the soundtrack is comprised of songs built on classical music, and a violinist and a fan of classical music make up two of the core characters. \n\nWhile you don't need to have any real knowledge of music going in, chances are you'll recognize some of the music, which is a nice touch. The game's arrangement of the songs gives them a unique flair that fits very well with the game's mood and setting, and one of the tracks in particular is probably one of my favorite visual novel tracks ever now. \n\nAs for the story, well, it goes like this. You've got the adopted son of a yakuza boss running around doing shady-but-not-quite-illegal business for his adopted father's company in order to pay off a massive debt he owes. He lives for money. There's political intrigue, comedy, violence, drama, and even romance galore to be had here. \n\nThen this \"Maou\" character comes into the picture, followed by a girl calling herself \"Hero\" that's hot on his tail, and starts stirring up trouble, all while your protagonist tries to keep up his double life and get rich. He's an open sleazeball, which in a way, is somewhat refreshing compared to other protagonists.\n\nThe story is pretty solid, though you might find yourself let down with certain aspects of it towards the end. It's not the longest visual novel in the world, but it's well written and entertaining enough that if you're drawn in, it should keep you sufficiently entertained for more than a while. Even longer than me if you don't skip read text or use saves to reload from choice spots.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the soundtrack is also really nice, and despite being built on classical music, even if you're not a fan, you should not find yourself bored with the tracks this game has in its arsenal. The art style is also pretty pleasing to the eyes, and the amount of CGs they managed for this isn't too bad either, all things considered.\n\nOne issue that popped up a few times for me, however, was the game's localization. Besides for a few typos here and there, it is just somewhat bizarre to have situations where characters are both using honorifics and \"onii-chan\" as well as things like \"Babe\" and \"Baby\" for their partners, among other... interesting choices. Once you get used to it, if you can get used to it, it's enjoyable in its own way, but it's jarring.\n\nOn the other hand, while I personally found this to be a good example that fading to black works fine in a game that originally had sexual content in it, I'm sure there are people who disagree, so for what it's worth, I'll mention that yes, this version of the game is missing it. \n\nAll things considered, though the game does suffer from some focus issues involving its heroines, which I'll mention below, I'd say that while it may not be a masterpiece, it's definitely worth a read if you enjoy visual novels. \n\n**MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW**\n\nPositives aside (and there are many positives here), one point of contention I do have with the game is its focus. \n\nIn chapters two through four, the player is introduced to scenarios that involve three different heroines, and they are given the option to branch off to different routes focusing on the other heroines. At this point, the player can enter the route and pursue the heroine romantically (or to get a bad end) or keep on with the main story.\n\nOne of the issues I found was that, justified well or shakily, the game tended to write off the other heroines as soon as their chapter in the main scenario ended. In two of the three cases, the other heroines weren't even particularly present in the story to begin with, and in one of those cases still, their personal route just left a lot to be desired. All in all, it leaves a bit of a poor aftertaste and a desire for more for those characters.\n\nThen, when it finally comes time for the main heroine, another focus-related problem arises - the game then has to switch gears from prioritizing her as part of the plot to a love interest, and at times, I'm not sure it handled that balancing as well as it could have. The conclusion is definitely worth it all when everything is said and done, though, but the road getting there (in terms of the \"heroine\" part of her arc) was definitely a little more bumpy compared to the first two routes in the game.\n\nBut would I still recommend the game despite all this?

No erotic fanservice anywhere & No magical girl stuff. its a realistic story\n\nAnything I say will be a spoiler. Read this visual novel without any prior knowledge for best expierience. Its a mature & deep story about Rivalry & Revenge. If you dont read visual novels then this is a probably one the best places to start. One more thing.. even though the side stories of other girls are interesting the main attraction is the main heroine Usami Haru, picking other girls ends the story abruptly & shows a chapter of love story, but not doing so will continue the main storyline which includes 2 more dark & gritty chapters which could have been missed if you picked others.

It does take until the end of Chapter 1 to do so though. Also, the main story gets more and more intense per chapter too. The writing is excellent, but has some vulgarity and many pop culture references. In the end, the story made me feel all kinds of emotions. \n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\n\nAll I can say is that the graphics look nice. The character art, backgrounds, and UI have nice synergy.\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\n[b] Music and Sound [/b]\n\nMost of the music was an interesting rendition of classical music. The music still managed to be creative enough in its own way though. I could feel the intensity and emotion of each song. The sound effects are pretty average, but get the job done just fine. Both the music and sound made reading the text more immersive.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n[b] Characters [/b]\n\nEach of the characters have a distinct personality and text color. They range from having a dark past to an innocent childhood. Throughout the story, you can see the characters developing themselves and their relationships. I felt empathy, sympathy, happiness, anger, sadness, etc. towards the characters. Not too many character tropes, like a tsundere, are used either.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n[b] Gameplay and Miscellanous [/b]\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and works well.

This is to date my favorite Visual Novel out of the many I've played, mostly off steam. I was intrested in the premise of this game a few years before the original enlish fan patch was released, and I picked it up as soon as they were done and read all of it in one go. Since then I've probably re-read all the routes 2 or 3 times and the main route an extra 1 or 2, mostly from streaming it for other people who had yet to experience it. Though I have yet to completly play through it again on steam, I made sure to play enough that I could review it and let people who might be thinking of getting it know: Yes, 100x yes. It's an enjoyable and unique story of cat and mouse, with many intresting characters who grow and flourish as the story continues. I can honestly say I was never bored, however some people who are itching to get to the meat of the story may tire of the into chapter, as it is mostly setting up and getting you introduced to many of the key people in the story, but if you're one of those people, stick to it! It's worth it, and make sure to at least read all the way through the 'true' route, because that's where the real good stuff is at.\n\nTL;DR: The main route is a fantastic game of cat and mouse but it's a bit slow to get going to to that part, which might put some people off, but stick with it and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.", "timestamp_created": 1457253785, "timestamp_updated": 1460786425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496384", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21619527": {"recommendationid": "21619527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096003698", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455140312}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u041d \u0441 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0435 ( \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 ), \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435, \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442. \u0414\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430\u044f. \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f - \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u043d\u044b\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0434 \u044d\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u0430\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0441\u0438\u043c\u044b.\n\n9 FUCK HER \u0438\u0437 10.", "timestamp_created": 1457096448, "timestamp_updated": 1457096448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21543792": {"recommendationid": "21543792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054814348", "num_games_owned": 479, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456846502}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont cry.

The art is qute good (While not amazing, the backgrounds can sometimes use work, and some charecters arent even drawn). The music is an excelent pairing of classical music with a modern vibe. The actual plot (While a bit reppetitive and drawn out at some points) extremely interesting, but the way it manages to suprise me is incredible.

I would highly reccomend this game, besides its various shortcomings and originally pornographic nature (Which hey, I personally find no error), this game is a masterpiece of a VN.\n\n8.7 out of 10, a must play.", "timestamp_created": 1453616613, "timestamp_updated": 1453616642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20688000": {"recommendationid": "20688000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051342651", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455975708}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Spiel......Hat mich ber\u00fchrt........Tief in meinem Herzen, ja es ist ein sehr sch\u00f6nes Spiel, es zieht einen langsam aber sicher in seinen Bann und fesselt einen.

While it is definitely a good read, it had a few glaring flaws that need to be addressed.\n\n1) Unlikable characters. There are a few, but there is one constant character who I wouldn't think twice about locking in a trunk which I would then proceed to drop-kick down a flight of stairs into a vat of acid.\n\n2) Archetypal heroines. This one is less of an issue, given the medium, however it really did feel like the author was just going through a checklist of sorts, particularly the side characters.\n\n3) Wasted plot potential/deus ex machina. This was present throughout a lot of the routes, but none more so than the Mizuha route. Seriously, I finished that route and was extremely dissapointed.

And I'm glad I was curious enough to buy it. It's actually a really good detective visual novel. The story is akin to Death Note's - a genius detective tries to stop an evil criminal, and they engage in a cat-and-mouse game of outdoing each other.  At the time of this writing I'm near the end of Chapter 4 and found myself blown away by a plot twist I totally didn't see coming. \n\nA word of warning though - this is not traditional game. It's a visual novel and while there is the occasional choice you have to make, it's 99% reading. The story is broken in chapters, and each one will take a couple of hours or more to read through. Along the way you meet interesting characters, and each chapter of the novel usually focuses on a crime that affects one of them.\n\nLuckily the reading is made bearable thanks to the pretty anime art that accompanies each character. I recommend buying the fully-voiced edition as it breathes more life to each character. The music that accompanies the game is made up of remixed classical music from Bach, Beethoven, etc and gives the game a unique touch.\n\nAre there any flaws? Not really - just that sometimes the story digresses into parts that seem pointless.

It probably stemmed from my love for immersive stories and because of that, I was constantly reading as a child. Since I was kid, I was into anime and always heard of these \u201cvisual novels\u201d but never really understood what exactly it was until I got around to reading them. I remember reading the fan translated G-senjou quite a while back and it left quite an impact on me and would lead to my eventual obsession into all things visual novel related. (I have no qualms towards pirating only because it was next to impossible to read English translated visual novels back then. But since that\u2019s a bad excuse, I generally go out of my way to buy visual novels I\u2019ve read before as they come onto steam to make up for pirating and also to support the work that went into making the product.) \n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\u201cThe world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.\u201d \u2013Sherlock Holmes from [i]The Hound of the Baskerville[/i]\n\nFor this visual novel in particular, the story is heavily driven by corruption, money, and revenge. While it does have its light-hearted moments, this novel, at its core, is of the mystery - and thriller - genre and shows this through many different scenarios similar to that of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. The story itself begins a bit slow, but as more and more mysteries start revealing others and the main villain, \u201cMaou\u201d, shows up in the shadows, the story accelerates and it becomes very captivating. It was next to impossible - for me - to peel my eyes away from the computer screen; especially at moments like the previously mentioned \u201cSherlock Holmes and Moriarty\u201d-esque scenes between the main characters Kyousuke, Haru -and others - and the villain Maou.\n\n[b]Sound/Music and Voice Acting[/b]\nLet me go ahead and say I\u2019m a big fan of classical music. I\u2019m also a big fan of Japanese pop music. (My computer and phone are filled with anime openings and endings that I listen to constantly). You can expect a lot of high paced violin and orchestral related music. Me trying to be as objective as possible, I really did think that all the music was very well done. It fit the mood of each scene and served to bring out the best in G-senjou. \n\nThe voice acting is truly a wonderful addition. There really isn\u2019t much else I can say about that. They really do bring out the best. Sometimes I had goosebumps at just how much of an immersive experience it was. Every single character that was voiced was spot on and made for an exponentially better read. That being said, the voice acting is an add-on for the Steam version. Personally I kind of want to punch you \u2013 or maybe drop-kick you - if you don\u2019t buy it with voices, but I do understand that some people can\u2019t pass up a cheaper product. \n\n[b]Artwork[/b]\nIn my opinion, I always thought the artwork was pretty good. It isn\u2019t super godly tier artwork, but it\u2019s very beautifully done. The characters are properly portrayed, the sprites are cute as heck, and transition and effects are very well done. I do enjoy the high resolution as compared to the fan translation though. I noticed people complaining about how the event CGs was cut due to the new aspect ratio, but I honestly didn\u2019t even notice on my run through of the game even though I played the original version. Everything still looks amazing.\n\n[b]Cut Scenes[/b]\nYes, a couple of H-scenes are cut. Coming from someone who's read it WITH the H-scenes, it didn't really...mess with the immersive-ness of the experience. \n\n[b]Personal Enjoyment[/b]\nObviously this is the only category that truly matters. Reading this way back when \u2013 I forget the actual year because I\u2019m a forgetful person \u2013 this transformed my visual novel experience. It made me realize how amazing a well written story could be for a visual novel setting with its artwork and voice acting. To this day, it has remained a contender for my favorite visual novel of all time and that will probably remain a fact for many decades to come. \n\nI\u2019m not going to numerically break down the scores for the key points of this visual novel but I will rate my personal enjoyment. 10/10, totally, 100% best visual novel ever, will read again. But in all honesty, this is truly a work of art. Perhaps even a masterpiece, at least in my subjective view. But in the end, only you can decide whether or not you want to read said visual novel.  \n\n\u201cThere is nothing like first-hand evidence.\u201d \u2013Sherlock Holmes from [i]A Study in Scarlet[/i]\n\n-Dris", "timestamp_created": 1448579866, "timestamp_updated": 1448728875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19287130": {"recommendationid": "19287130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145117795", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505121485}, "language": "schinese", "review": "G\u7ebf\u5c45\u7136\u767b\u5f55steam\u4e86\uff0c\u679c\u65ad\u5145\u503c\u4fe1\u4ef0\u3002\u7136\u800c\u6211\u8fd9\u624d\u4e70\u6ca12\u5929\u9a6c\u4e0a\u5c31\u6253\u6298\u4f60\u662f\u9017\u6211\u5462\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1448550074, "timestamp_updated": 1448550074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19280867": {"recommendationid": "19280867", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993240784", "num_games_owned": 676, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 3269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448520325}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432 20-\u043a\u0435 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445...\u043f\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e.\n\n\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435...\u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0435 30 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f, \u0433\u0434\u0435 true ending \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0443; \u0432\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c.\n\n\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c \"\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043a\u043e\u043c\"...\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 CG...\u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435...\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0432 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u044f \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e.\n\n\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0412\u041d\u043e\u043a, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c-\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043c\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0439\u0442\u043b\u0430...\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0436\u0435, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u044f \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b-\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438.\n\n\u0417.\u042b.

It's definitely worth picking up, if you're still on edge about getting it.\n\nAs for the voiced version, it's up to you whether or not to get it, but I'd definitely recommend it. I basically went broke after buying it, but I don't regret my decision in the slightest. The voice acting was fantastic. A lot of people are against it because they think it's a ripoff, but I'm not sure that they understand the licensing issues. It costs extra for them to get the voices in the game, and it's your choice whether to get the voices or not. Some other VNs are quite expensive simply because they're voiced, but here you have option to get it cheaper non-voiced version if you don't mind that.

Kyousuke is a slave to money, working for his foster father to pay off his father's staggering debt. When a new girl, Usami Haru, transfers to his soon, a mysterious man known only as \"Maou\" also appears. A stange series of events begin to unravel, including kidnapping and murder threats, in this 30+ hour crime/mystery visual novel.\n\nThe Devil on G-String is by far one of the best visual novels I've read to date. The writing is absolutely fanastic, although I did feel the endings were a bit weak. The artstyle and music are also fantastic, helping to show the scenes perfectly. Fans of the old fan translation may find issue with the fact the CG scenes were adjusted to fit the 16:9 format, but I felt the CG scenes looked amazing. There are some spelling issues within, such as Gonzou being spelled \"Gonzo\" once. Also, while the original version had erotic scenes, this version does not, though the lead-ins to them are still present. I didn't really feel like I was missing much with them not being there however, so they don't really seem to necessary.\n\nThis VN is more than worth the asking price. The voices do add to the experience, but for the asking price of getting the game voiceless, you're getting a fantastic deal.

This is a story of family loyalty, revenge, crimes that cannot be forgiven, and hatred that cannot be let go. A picture of a few girls for the protagonist to pursue is as far from the focus of this story as it gets, but that's what sells the copies in the marketspace. The name itself is a reference to \"Air on G-string\", and an unfortunately distracting choice of name for the western market.\n\nStory:\nThe writing is excellent, particularly if you're the sort who enjoys crime mysteries where the villain and protagonist clash in deadly knife fights of razor sharp wit. The girls who you are given the option of pursuing are a distraction in the most literal sense, as those story branches will detour you from the main plotline and prevent you from getting to the best material of the novel.\n\nBGM:\nThe majority of the tracks are remixed classical pieces, some of which do an amazing job of setting the mood. A remix of \"Marche Slave\" was used as a mood piece and character theme for a mafia boss and I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nFin:\nThere's not much more to say than that. This isn't The Fruit of Grisaea. Grisaea was entertaining and had its dark moments, but at the end of the day it was a gal game.

To clear up the confusion, the title is [b]NOT[/b] referring to the butt floss type of underwear. It is referring to the musical instrument of the violin in reference to classical musician J.S. Bach.\n\n[h1]G-Senjou No Maou Review[/h1]\n\n(Score Breakdown Found at the Bottom of Review)\n\n[b]Introduction & My Personal History With This Game:[/b]\nIf I recall correctly, my first experience with G-senjou no Maou was in 2011. I'll confess, I was a bad person and pirated the game, along with the fan translation patch, because I didn't have a legal way of purchasing this game at the time. I always feel terrible any time I do this for a product, especially if I turn out really liking the product. However, as with every product that I've ever acquired in this manner, I promised to myself that, if this game was ever officially localized, I would be sure to make it an immediate purchase. With that out of the way let's jump right into the review.\n\n[b]Differences Between The Fan Translation and Official Localization:[/b]\nFirst off, the interface is much cleaner. I don't remember every aspect of the original interface, but everything just feels \"smoother\". Switching between the currently open scene, transcript log, and save/load screen is very quick and doesn't seem jarring at all.\nThe next biggest thing to talk about is the removal of the sex scenes (H-Scenes). Personally, I prefer these scenes being removed. If you are someone who enjoys the H-scenes when playing Visual Novels (VN's), then I'm sorry to report that they are not present in this current version.\nthe artwork appears to have had some work done on it's sprites to make them look quite a bit better, and the new 720p resolution is awesome.\nLastly, from the 6 hours I've put into this game so far, I can safely say that I prefer this translation to the original fan translation. Sentences just seem to be structured a little bit better, and It just feels easier to read.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nThis visual novel is a mystery story at it's core, and places the themes of money and corruption front and center. The story of G-senjou no Maou centers around our main protagonist Azai Kyousuke; a high school student who is a prodigy when it comes to making money. Being the adopted son of the big shot Yakuza (gangster) family known as the Azai, we follow him as he tries to live his double life of normal high school and the dark and twisted world of the Yakuza. When a new transfer student named Usami joins his class at school, and other characters start to slowly learn of his double life, Kyousuke will find himself in over his head well before he knows what hit him. While all this is going on, we learn of a certain character named \"Maou\" who is lurking in the shadows planning something huge, that will shake the very foundation of the city. Unfortunately, I cannot give further specific details on the story without delving into spoilers.\nThe pacing is the story's high point. It knows just how much time to spend with each expositional scene, character, and event. The level of immersion is also phenomenal. You'll find yourself absorbed into this story from beginning to end.\n\n[b]Characters:[/b] \nThe highlight of this VN is it's unique cast of characters. Azai Kyousuke (our protagonist, and player character) is as morally grey as they come without being a strict anti-hero. Learning more about his skills, and seeing how he deals with each situation is one of the biggest reasons to keep reading hour after hour.\nAizawa Eiichi (the \"best bud\" character) isn't anything like what you're used to seeing in most VN's. He's a slimeball through and through. While often pretending to be cute, innocent, and effeminate, his true nature is that of a very angry little man who wants to go out with (and \"bow chicka wow wow\") a MUCH older woman.\nEach of the girls are also very well developed, especially the main girl Usami.\nUsami Haru is very good at noticing when people are lying, and is incredibly socially awkward. She loves using game metaphors (especially those referencing the RPG genre).\nShiratori Mizuha knows about what Kyousuke is up to after school when he returns home. She's a constant threat to our protagonist. If she was to say something he could easily lose his comfortable  life.\nMiwa Tsubaki is perhaps the most generic of the girls. She is the class representative of Kyousuke's class, and writes down absolutely [b]ANYTHING[/b] that happens during a day in her diary.\nAzai Kanon is the last of the girls that Kyousuke interacts with on a daily basis. She is the adoptive sister of our protagonist, so they are not related by blood. She is an incredibly talented figure skater, who is trying to making it into the olympics. She adores her adopted brother and will often go out of her way to see him as much as she can.\nThe antagonists are also very good, but even mentioning their names (let alone their personalities) would be a huge spoiler. That said, just keep in mind that when they do show up, that they're going to be the highlight of the scene currently taking place.\n\n[b]Artwork, Sprites, Transitions, and Effects:[/b]\nThere isn't really much to really say here. As far as all the visual effects go,  they're all top notch and show just how high the production values for this VN are. The new 720p resolution is also VERY welcome.\n\n[b]Sound, Music, and Voice Acting:[/b]\nAgain there isn't much to say about the Sound effects. They are simply crisp, clear, and appropriate.\nThe music leans heavily towards the classical genre of music, and remixes of said classical music. This is appropriate as Kyousuke is a huge fan of classical music, especially J.S. Bach. There are some custom tracks, but they are far fewer in number than the classical songs on the soundtrack. Almost all tracks feature some kind of violin.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is top notch. All characters are voiced, [b]EXCEPT[/b] for Kyousuke himself. Whether you believe that having the japanese voice acting avaliable is worth paying double the price of the base game... well that's up to you. Personally I'd say that it is worth it, but if you'd prefer to get the game at half price; I can see why and wouldn't fault you for passing up the voices.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwMIpszBD9Q]Back in January of 2012 I listed G-senjou no Maou as my favorite VN at the time.[/url] Although that list has changed a lot after reading the Zero Escape series and Danganronpa series, G-senjou no Maou Is still easily one of my top 3 visual novels. I can easily say that if you're a fan of visual novels, despite the high pricetag for a Steam VN, that you should buy this story asap. You definitely won't regret your purchase. Before ending this review, here's a numerical score breakdown for this visual novel, and a list of the types of people that I recommend this game to. \n\n[h1]Score Breakdown[/h1]\n[b][u]User Interface:[/u][/b] \n[i]95/100 (Super Easy to Use, Smooth, and Intuitive)[/i]\n\n[b][u]Optimization:[/u][/b] \n[i]100/100 (Will Run on a Toaster)[/i]\n\n[b][u]Story:[/u][/b] \n[i]97/100 (Unforgettable and Amazingly Paced)[/i]\n\n[b][u]Characters:[/u][/b] \n[i]95/100 (Unique and Memorable)[/i]\n\n[b][u]Artwork and Visual Effects:[/u][/b] \n[i]82/100 (Solid but Slightly Dated From Being 7 Years Old)[/i]\n\n[b][u]Sound Effects, Music, and Voice Acting:[/u][/b] \n[i]87/100 (Appropriate and Consistent)[/i]\n\n[b][u]Overall Final Score:[/u][/b] \n[i]96/100 (Characters and Story Weighted Higher Than Other Sections)[/i]\n\n[b][u]Recommended Purchase For Those Who Enjoy:[/u][/b] \n[i]Mystery Stories, Unique Characters, Philosophy, Criminal Underworld Stories, Drama, and/or Anime[/i]\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this review, and I hope it was helpful to you.\n\nLove\n[i]-Aristile[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1447022825, "timestamp_updated": 1447038348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 127, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890287", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18954612": {"recommendationid": "18954612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105288064", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456252511}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u87ba\u4e1d\u7684\u5267\u672c\u529f\u529b\u7b97\u662f\u6709\u76ee\u5171\u7779\u4e86\uff0c\u4ece\u8f66\u8f6e\u4e4b\u56fd\u5230G\u5f26\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u4e24\u6b3e\u8ba9\u6211\u56de\u5473\u65e0\u7a77\u7684GAL\n\u6e38\u620f\u6309\u6811\u72b6\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u771f\u7231\u624d\u80fd\u8d70\u5230\u6700\u540e\uff08\u7b11\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4e5f\u7701\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u770b\u653b\u7565SL\u7684\u70e6\u607c\uff0c\u79fd\u7ffc\u548cG\u5f26\uff0c\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n\u5267\u60c5\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u591a\u5267\u900f\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u7ed9\u529b\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684\u4e00\u9996close your eyes\u548c\u5267\u60c5\u914d\u5408\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e5f\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u6211\u6700\u7231\u7684GAL\u4f5c\u54c1\u97f3\u4e50", "timestamp_created": 1446997224, "timestamp_updated": 1446997224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18943094": {"recommendationid": "18943094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070335188", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484045176}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u77e5\u9053G\u5f26\u7684\u53d1\u552e\u540e\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u4fbf\u6765STEAM\u4e0a\u4e70\u6389\u3002\n\nSTEAM\u7248\u672c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u754c\u9762UI\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u6539\u4e3a\u5bbd\u5c4f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\uff01\n\n\u7edd\u5bf9\u7684\u4e00\u6d41GALGAME\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4f60\u662fGALGAME\u65b0\u4eba\u8fd8\u662f\u8001\u624b\uff0cG\u5f26\u90fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u5931\u671b\u3002\n\n\u987a\u4fbf\u5b89\u5229\u4e00\u4e0b\u6211\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3896028237?pid=71587919011&cid=0#71587919011", "timestamp_created": 1446945967, "timestamp_updated": 1446947079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18942692": {"recommendationid": "18942692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005322616", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484684958}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent 3 hours on reading awesome story - [b]opening[/b] movie came in. \n\nSeriously though, it's probably one of the best VNs ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1446944052, "timestamp_updated": 1446944052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18941825": {"recommendationid": "18941825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030901442", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446939477}, "language": "english", "review": "Yessssssss! I played this game 2 years ago and I completly fell in love with it! I saw that this was on Steam just now and I immediatly bought it. It was mostly because of this game that I got into visual novels. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nFrom what I have read, the H-scenes have been taken out, but those aren't really worth caring about. This gem of a game has an amazing story and there are many hilarious parts (especially with your green-haired best friend). The gameplay is zilch however, so be warned. This IS a visual novel after all. Pretty much all of the music reflects the protag's choice in music, so it's really immersive (he likes Classical so most of the original sound track is Classical music). The main route is Haru's story and is definetly the true route while the other endings are for the other heroines. There are some bads ends though if you choose a choice incorrectly. \n\n[h1]Personal Review[/h1]\nI'm really glad that Steam is finally getting some awesome VNs! I would give this a 9.5/10 and not feel sorry. No offense to those of y'all out there, but Nekopara and games like that have ****ing terrible stories. Please give this game a chance! Not sure if this game will be this much on sale afterwards, so take this as what you will. Keep it up Steam!\n[b] I'd like to see Fate/Stay Night and Tsukihime up next!!!!!!!!!

G-String is a mystery-thriller visual novel is developed by AKABEiSoft2 and published by Sekai Project and was released on November 5, 2015 on the Steam platform. Originally released in 2008, the Steam Release of G-senjou no Maou \u2013 The Devil on G-String marks AKABEisoft2\u2019s first officially localized release. The Devil on G-String prices at $19.99 for the standard edition of the game, and $39.99 for a fully-voiced (in Japanese) version of the game. Both versions of the game will be discounted 30% until November 12.\n\n[h1]The Story [/h1]\nYou will play as Azai Kyousuke, the adoptive son of a yakuza boss you will see the world through his eyes as he puts up a facade of being a \u201crich person with taste\u201d to keep his classmates away from him. He often enjoys listening to Bach and \u201cworking\u201d part time for his stepfather. But when a beautiful girl named Usami Haru appears in town along with an international criminal known as \u201cMaou,\u201d they bring with them their cat-and-mouse game of plotting and intrigue.\n\n[h1]Visual and Music elements [/h1]\n[b]Visual Elements[/b]\nBackgrounds and CGs are beautiful and detailed very well done overall very smooth looking sprites and they look really cute when i first saw Miwa Tsubaki sprite with the cute \u201cAhoge\u201d above her head my first impression was \u201cwow she looks really cute\u201d. There is also time based character color calibration which is a really cool addition because it makes the character have Evening and Night color immersion which adds to the overall atmosphere of the visual novel.\n\n[b]Music[/b] in the menu give that creepy feeling when you play in the dark I loved the overall creepy atmosphere it manages to set and I loved the way they can turn the creepy and dark atmosphere into a cheery and cute atmosphere all with the use of music that goes along with the gloomy and bright colors being put to use. Overall music being used in the game is good\n\n[h1]Interface and Features[/h1]\nThey have features like having song titles appearing at at the top right of the screen when a new song plays with the composer name.\nThey also have the feature to change specific characters text colors which not many Visual Novel have this feature which I find this a nice feature to have because sometimes the words colors may blend into the background and thus making it very hard to read them.\n\n[h1]To sum up [/h1]\nI would definitely recommend this visual novel to anyone because this visual novel overall would appeal to most people and would recommend anyone that likes mystery/thriller genre with investigations going on all around in the visual novel.\n\n[url=https://azusantiara.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/g-senjou-no-maou-the-devil-on-g-string-review/]Click here for the full review![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1446809533, "timestamp_updated": 1453133394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18905168": {"recommendationid": "18905168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961112236", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489179292}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u540d\u4f5c\u30a8\u30ed\u30b2\u304csteam\u3067\u767b\u5834\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u97f3\u58f0\u306fDLC\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5f62\u3067\u8ca9\u58f2\n\u3053\u306e\u58f2\u308a\u65b9\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u597d\u611f\u304c\u6301\u3066\u308b\n\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u306e\u3067\n\n\u30d9\u30bf\u79fb\u690d\u304b\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u304c\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u5bfe\u5fdc\n\u8eca\u8f2a\u306e\u56fd\u3082\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u30aa\u30ca\u30b7\u30e3\u30b9", "timestamp_created": 1446802647, "timestamp_updated": 1446802647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.381648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18904298": {"recommendationid": "18904298", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965064385", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448924431}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]Warning:[/b] Terrible formatting ahead[/h1]\n\nThis is one of my favorite visual novels. Top 5 for sure. \nA lot of visual novels start off slow, making you used to the characters before you get to choose which one you want to know more about further. This can make early reading a chore for people who just want to read a story and find it difficult to make an emotional connection with each character through hours of comedy.\n\nThis novel is [u][b]not like that at all.[/b][/u] This novel starts off strong, and makes you come back because you want to know more. It grabs your curiousity, and pulls you in. This is the first and only novel I've read that does this. Not once did I feel like I had to struggle through content I didn't care about in order to get to the main dish. It's full tension from start to finish.\n\nUnlike some visual novels, this one is very linearly story-oriented. However, there are plenty of choices to be made here. \nThere are route branches to different heroines, but doing so will abandon the main story, or canon route if you want to call it that, and grant you a character-specific route. While I'm not personally into that, more power to the people who are. That's a good thing, right?\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nThe story gives me a slight Death Note vibe due to the cat and mouse battle between wits, while still being original and not copying. This is, in my opinion, a must read for people who are into that genre, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Death Note or anything mystery/crime. \nThere are a lot of dark themes, and it's definitely not a fanfare title for sure. If you prefer titles like Sakura <insert whatever here> or NekoPara, this is probably not for you. May contain badassery.\n\n[b]Artwork:[/b]\nThe artwork is fairly decent, better than average to most standards. Steam's release had a lot of UI improvements made, which I only welcome. There is plenty of CG to be unlocked, and it looks pretty. \nCompared to Akabei Soft2's previous releases, it's definitely an improvement.\n\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b]\nBefitting to the title of the novel, the soundtrack consists of remixes of [u]classical music[/u]. Need I say more? There's a wide variety of classical composers, ranging from Beethoven to Bach to Tchaikovsky and the list goes on. As a Norwegian, it makes me feel special that there's even Edvard Grieg in here. Hot daym. \nAnd yes, the title theme is Air on G-String. No more G-string jokes pls.\n\n[b]A few last words:[/b]\nA complaint I see is the price difference between the voiced and the unvoiced version, but this is because of how Japanese voice licensing works. It's expensive, and you're given a choice, rather than being forced to pay full price.

Dir\u00eda con las pocas horas de juego que llevo, que esta visual novel se centra en como es la gente de verdad, es decir, como es con la gente en la que conf\u00eda y como es con los dem\u00e1s, algo de lo que nos daremos cuenta nada m\u00e1s empezar el juego. Poco m\u00e1s puedo decir de la historia, pues seria destrozaros el juego y empezarlo a leer es muy interesante y entretenido, aunque me cost\u00f3 un poco arrancar a mi...\n\n\nNo todo son cosas buenas para el juego, si tuviera que decir algo negativo ser\u00edan dos puntos importantes, lo primero es que si queremos escuchar las voces en japones tendremos que pagar un extra de 17 euros (19,99 si se paga por separado) algo que en mi caso no he acabado de entender, ya que encarece el producto un huevo por las voces, el otro punto negativo son los escenarios, siempre vac\u00edos y sin vida, aunque muy bien dibujados y localizados.\n\nEl juego se nos presenta con un dise\u00f1o muy propio y bien definido, el dibujo de los personajes me ha gustado bastante (aunque el padrastro podr\u00eda estar mejor), las voces (si hab\u00e9is pagado por ellas) son muy buenas, todo aquel que disfrute los juegos en su versi\u00f3n original japonesa las disfrutar\u00e1, son muy profesionales y agradables de escuchar hasta el momento. La verdad es que no soy un profesional en cuanto a VN y he jugado las gustas, as\u00ed que no os puedo decir si son de alguien famoso, ya que todo lo que pongo en la review es de lo que he jugado y se, no he le\u00eddo nada del juego salvo un par de opiniones positivas.\n\nMe ha sorprendido que el juego tiene 50 mil slots para guardar la partida y un huevo de opciones que aun no he ni mirado, de verdad que son muchas, incluso estilo color de subtitulos por personaje, posici\u00f3n, rapidez, etc.... pero lo mas sorprendente es que pod\u00e9is controlar las voces por separado, callando a quien no quer\u00e1is escuchar o baj\u00e1ndole el volumen de la voz, todo ello de manera individual. Me dejo muchas opciones, pero ya las ver\u00e9is, que son muchas y ni me acuerdo XD.\n\nResumiendo (que poco se puede decir de una VN jugablemente), un juego que apunta maneras y que me esta gustando desde el principio, me mantiene en vilo con algunas cosas y tengo ganas de seguir, sin duda alguna cuando lo acabe os dir\u00e9 que me ha parecido, espero que no pegue un baj\u00f3n y me deje con el culo roto, que ya me ha pasado con alguno y da mucha rabia, pero de momento no parece el caso. Espero que mi peque\u00f1a review (aun sin terminar el juego) le sirva a alguien.\n", "timestamp_created": 1446796116, "timestamp_updated": 1446796116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny":

For information pertaining to this specific release, see below the line.\n\nThis novel game is a mystery-thriller with an unreliable narrator--the combination of which is unbelievably engrossing. The title is actually a reference to Goethe's/Schubert's \"Erlkoenig\" (called Maou = devil in Japan) and Bach's \"Air on the G-String\"--no funny business, don't get the wrong idea. Obviously, classical music plays a major role in both the musical and story motifs revisited throughout the game.\n\nEvery chapter, there is a pending crime of escalating severity that the protagonists attempt to prevent, but the antagonist stays two steps ahead of them all along the way.\n----------------------\nThis game is near and dear to my heart, as you might garner from my screen name--I was the editor of the English fan translation. This is what I think about the Sekai Project update, cut down to bullets so you can spend more time reading the game itself.\n \n-Everything's at significantly higher resolution. There's a 2000 pixel tall Gonzou sprite, for crying out loud. 2K Gonzou. Think about it. \"Marche Slave\" never looked and sounded more menacing. The music is still a high point, but the richly colored, HD visuals are now a fitting complement.\n\n-Because of the new aspect ratio and higher resolution, you see a bit more of the sprites (they're actually full-body, though you could never tell in the original release) and a lot more of the backgrounds. The event cgs are cropped just a little bit, but I went through every last one, and they all still look great--better, actually, at the higher resolution.\n\n-The new UI is much sleeker and more modern.\n\n-The translation is awesome, duh.\n\n-The spirit of the game isn't \"censored\" by any means. Literally the only parts taken out of the adults-only source material are the adults-only bits. Anything that would be rated \"R\" in a modern theater is still in there, last I saw... expect the gritty and dark world the 2008 Japanese release had, and nothing less.\n\nThis is exactly the build I would release as an \"Editor's Cut\" if I had the balls and resources of Sekai Project. Well, except I might add an Eiichi yaoi route. I love that guy. Steamworks modders, get on it.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY: The game still has mature content, and even explicit sex. It's just not AS explicit. (For example, there might be a black screen while the main character directs a sex act, but then instead of showing and narrating the act \"to completion\", the scene cuts away.)", "timestamp_created": 1446754088, "timestamp_updated": 1446785619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 285, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878935", "comment_count": "73", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39387385": {"recommendationid": "39387385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335418642", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 267, "last_played": 1515935840}, "language": "schinese", "review": "......\n\u5341\u51e0\u5c81\u7684\u5c11\u5e74\u672c\u5e94\u5728\u6821\u56ed\u5ea6\u8fc7\u91d1\u8272\u5e74\u534e \u6211\u4eec\u5374\u4e3a\u4e86\u751f\u6d3b\u800c\u5230\u5904\u5954\u6ce2 \u4e5f\u57cb\u6028\u8fc7\u82cd\u5929\u7684\u4e0d\u516c \u4eba\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u5e78 \u4f46\u4e5f\u4ece\u4e0d\u540e\u6094\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u9009\u62e9\n\n\u9752\u6625\u5982\u68a6 \u516b\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u5149\u5c31\u6b64\u6d88\u901d \u773c\u6cea\u65e9\u5df2\u5e72\u6db8 \u601d\u5ff5\u5374\u672a\u66fe\u4e2d\u65ad \u751f\u6d3b\u8d77\u4f0f\u7684\u5982\u6b64\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e \u552f\u4e00\u5728\u5fc3\u4e2d\u94ed\u523b\u7684 \u662f\u94c1\u95e8\u524d\u4f60\u4eec\u5bf9\u6211\u7684\u54ed\u8bc9 \u662f\u8363\u4e00\u6b6a\u6b6a\u626d\u626d\u7684\u4e66\u4fe1 \u662f\u5c11\u5e74\u65f6\u7684\u8a93\u7ea6 \u5e73\u65e5\u91cc\u5b09\u620f\u6253\u9a82\u7684\u5b87\u4f50\u6625 \u5df2\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u62e5\u6709\u6210\u719f\u97f5\u5473\u7684\u5973\u6027......\n\n\u5929\u7a7a\u6d51\u6d4a\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0b\u5348\uff0c\u98ce\u5439\u62c2\u7740\u4f60\u4f9d\u65e7\u957f\u957f\u7684\u79c0\u53d1 \u4eff\u4f5b\u4f60\u53c8\u56de\u5230\u4e86\u516b\u5e74\u524d \u66fe\u7ecf\u8ddf\u6211\u4eec\u7ad9\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u7684\u5927\u5bb6\u4eff\u4f5b\u4e5f\u5386\u5386\u5728\u76ee \u54ed\u7740 \u8dea\u7740 \u518d\u600e\u4e48\u9009\u62e9\u4e5f\u6362\u4e0d\u56de\u6765\u4ece\u524d\u7684\u7f81\u7eca \u4e5f\u8bb8\u73b0\u5728 \u4f60\u966a\u5728\u6211\u8eab\u8fb9 \u5c31\u591f\u4e86 \n\n\n\n\u201c\u4f60\u8f9b\u82e6\u4e86\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby 1056353103", "timestamp_created": 1516102266, "timestamp_updated": 1516102266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39270006": {"recommendationid": "39270006", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993703914", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 872, "last_played": 1516052798}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this up to chapter three before finally giving it up. This is an incredibly poorly written story. I have played enough of the game that regardless of any sudden improvement that may otherwise await me, it doesn't change that what substantial amount I have played has been of mediocre quality. The characters are moronic, and their behaviour dictated by the requirements of the story. For example, the antagonist is portrayed to be extraordinarily good at their work, seemingly taking great effort to perform a crime without leaving evidence or risking capture. But those established facts about the character are entirely forgotten soon after, as they later repeatedly visit the same highly public area where they performed the initial crime, to talk to their victim. \n\nThe main character is the worst part of the game. The main point of telling a story from someone's perspective is to get their point of view, but the writer makes it so absurdly blatant that they want you to doubt the veracity of their perspective, that to call the writer's attempt to do this simply clumsy would be a massive understatement. Not only does this detract from the experience by having the writer beat you over the head repeatedly with so much obvious foreshadowing, which may or may not be a red herring (at this point I don't care), but it gives the reader no obvious character to empathise with. What you are then left with is a main character you feel that you know nothing about, whose internal dialogue you can't even trust to be true. Whilst this is probably the intention of the writer, it doesn't lead to engaging storytelling. He's no Walter White or Michael Corleone; unlike those characters he detests the virtues of others and revels in seeing everything and everyone as a means to more wealth. The other main character, Haru isn't much better. The reader is given so little information about them that they are simply stuck as a mysterious archetypal character with no clue about her motives. \n\nThe tone is all over the place, so that whilst covering major traumatic events that affect the characters, it punctuates them with drawn out, unfunny jokes that feel entirely unsuited to the situation. This happens repeatedly and detracts from any dramatic tension. \n\nThe other issue I have is with the lack of mystery in how it sets up its scenarios. At one point the antagonist hides something away that the main set of characters seek to find. The writer tells and shows us exactly how and where this thing was hidden from the antagonist's perspective, and shows us that that it is intact. Then for the next large chunk of text, we are told how the main characters follow the various clues to pinpoint where the thing might be hidden, with an implied threat that it may be damaged or destroyed. There is a distinct lack of tension or mystery in that time because the reader already knows how and where the thing is hidden, and that it is in fact safe. It is just another one of the many odd ways in which the writer sabotages any dramatic tension. \n\nVisually it looks alright, with high definition, if slightly bland artwork. It doesn't do anything special visually, and the visual designs are typical. The music is a mixed bag with some tracks that just don't work, which was surprising as the name of the game and the way the game always tells you which track is playing leads one to think that it might include some better music. I think the decision to have the music be rearrangements of classical music sounds good on paper, but given how well known most of the music is and how many arrangements already exist the end result is lacking. \n\nDue to the poor writing that failed to hold my attention, I can't recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1515720579, "timestamp_updated": 1516074109, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39004533": {"recommendationid": "39004533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258360938", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "last_played": 1515500133}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u82b1\u4e8620\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u6bd4\u6211\u60f3\u8c61\u4e2d\u8fd8\u8981\u597d\u7684galgame\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5267\u60c5\u4e0a\u6709\u60ca\u8273\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u611f\u60c5\u523b\u753b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u522b\u5177\u5320\u5fc3\u3002\u5728\u6709\u4e9b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\uff0c\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u80fd\u591f\u8ba9\u5185\u5fc3\u52a8\u6447\u3002\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u7f3a\u70b9\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u652f\u7ebf\u5267\u60c5\u4e0a\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u591f\u4e25\u8c28\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u7ed3\u5c40\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7f8e\u597d\uff0c\u5374\u4e5f\u50cf\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5973\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u4eec\u7684\u7eaf\u771f\u548c\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u592a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u7cb9\u800c\u4e0d\u591f\u771f\u5b9e\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u5168\u7ebf\u901a\u5173\u540e\uff0c\u6743\u4e09\u7684\u8bdd\u4e5f\u5c31\u4e0d\u96be\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u3002\n \u751f\u8005\uff0c\u751f\u8005\uff0c\u8def\u5316\u51b0\u6cb3\u3002\n\u4eba\u751f\u6ca1\u6709\u56db\u5b63\uff0c\u552f\u6709\u90a3\uff0c\u5bd2\u51ac\u7684\u8352\u91ce\uff0c\u82e5\u4e0d\u5c06\u6d41\u51fa\u7684\u8840\u6cea\u62b9\u53bb\uff0c\u5c06\u51bb\u7ed3\u6210\u51b0\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514971291, "timestamp_updated": 1514971291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38945342": {"recommendationid": "38945342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006909271", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 331, "last_played": 1515856017}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10\n\nYou will close your eyes....

Maybe just to upgrade some of the stuff in the diner, new menu's, buy extra seats to seat more customers, better quality drinks or even furniture, even something mundane as getting access to new music or skins. I know we are getting into simulation territory here and I understand the simplicity is part of Duo Diners' appeal but I really have the feeling there could be so much more to it! \n\nStill, a GREAT game that I would wholly recommend to anyone who loves asynchronous co-op multiplayer!

Kommt ein Gast an, rennt einer vor zwei Roboter-Bedienungen hin um die Bestellung aufzunehmen und stellt sich dann vor die Theke um diese anzuzeigen. Die Burger haben zwar auch Nummern, die man lernen kann (was aber doch etwas nervig sein kann) aber so kann man schnell sehen, welche Zutaten in welche Reihenfolge drauf m\u00fcssen.\nMan kann auch verschiedene Sachen vorbereiten, darf sie jedoch nicht zu lange liegen lassen.\nDas Spiel hat verschiedene Level mit steigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad und einen Endlos Modus.\n\nGrafisch ist es eher zweckdienlich, die Musik dudelt belanglos im Hintergrund (kann mittels dreier Tapes auch gewechselt werden). Der Arbeitsberiech kann vor Start auf H\u00f6he und Gr\u00f6\u00dfe angepasst werden (Vorbildlich!) und ben\u00f6tigt einen Spielbereich von etwa 1-5*2m.\n\nDas Spiel ist extrem spa\u00dfig und wer auf dem Smartphone oder Tablet gerne solche Zubereitungsspiele spielt (oder auf dem PC Cook, Serve, Delicious), der wird begeistert sein.\n\nDie echte Kr\u00f6nung ist allerdings der lokale Koop Modus. Ein Spieler sitzt am PC und steuert dann die Bedienung (dann nur eine). Man steuert mittels WASD, der Maus und der Leertaste. Der andere bereitet wie gewohnt zu. Der PC Spieler rennt also zu den G\u00e4sten, ruft dem anderen den Burger zu, muss sich aber auch f\u00fcr sich merken, was die G\u00e4ste noch an Getr\u00e4nken haben wollen und holt und bringt dann entspechend alle Sachen. Das erfordert genaue Kommunikation und man hat schnell Codew\u00f6rter f\u00fcr die einzelnen Burger \"Ich brauche einen Doppelk\u00e4se, einen Big Mac und einen Cheeseburger Ketchup\"! Beide Spieler sind gleicherma\u00dfen gefordert. Einziges Manko, der PC ist entsprechend auch gefordert, da er beides berechnen muss, bei mir hat es manchmal etwas geruckelt. Aber verschmerzbar.\n\nVRTDD ist ein absoluter Top Titel, der zeigt, was VR neben Shootern zu bieten hat und wie spa\u00dfig das ganze ist (meine Freundin, die VR nicht mag, hat mir die Brille aus der Hand gerissen, um selbst zuzubereiten und war begeistert).

I played for several hours by myself, then one of my kids joined in as the waiter. Just... wow. If Job Simulator actually had anything challenging to do, it would have turned into this game. Wonderful!\n\nPOSITIVES:\n- Decently challenging. There are 30 levels (and an endless mode I don't think I've unlocked), and while I feel I'm pretty good at the game it's going to take me a while to beat them all.\n- Great price! $14.99 is the perfect price for this title. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth out of my purchase.\n- Simple, addictive fun. It's like Diner Dash in that way. While many people are clammoring for deeper, longer VR experiences, I'm not sure they fully understand that the format doesn't lend itself all that well to a super deep, epic adventure. Do you really WANT to walk miles and miles and miles in VR like we do in our adventure games? I didn't think so. These types of games are great for hop-in, hop-out experiences.\n- Excellent performance. It doesn't have fancy graphics, but my bare-minimum VR PC handles it excellently even with another player going.\n\nCONS:\n- Devs said elsewhere they're not really looking to add more to the game. The whole time I was playing I was thinking about how it was just CRYING OUT for more features, but I'm never going to get them, apparently.\n- Pacing can be a little weird. I know they wanted to make a frantic game, but it seems like things burn too fast.\n- Upgradeables are only cosmetic. I really want to upgrade my counter space, or get a bigger grill... or... well anything besides a new hat, really. Which sort of makes the money you earn seem worthless - other than keeping track of how well you did on a level, what's the point?\n\nDon't let the cons list dissuade you, though.

Really fun and has so much room for growth. Most VR games get stale quickly. Even with the early state this is in right now, it is still more entertaining than many others. It doesn't do much (yet), but what it does, it does well, and it is fun while doing it. So many cool things that can be done and would make it even better, one of the few VR games I am looking forward to seeing more content released.\n\nMy wishlist:\n1. Money: Being fast shouldn't just get you points, I want tips that I can use to fund things. \n2. Unlockables: Can I buy that soda machine? Or upgrade it? Maybe buy a deep fryer and make fries or onion rings, to then make more money? Maybe buy a larger grill to cook more at a time? Maybe buy a new restraunt that looks different? Decorations for my restraunt?\n3. More players: This one may be hard, and may not be possible. The formula now is good now with two players, and adding more may disrupt that. This would require more things for non-VR players to do though. Unless perhaps you bought a larger restraunt, but that may end up putting more strain on the chef in the end.\n4. More locations: Maybe a higher level that is a nice, expensive restraunt? Or maybe a single player level that is a noodle stand? Maybe a food truck? So many possibilities to add a new spin to gameplay.\n5. Food quality: Maybe buy your ingredients for each day/week. Better ingredients means happier customers. But also quality in cooking. Maybe there is an optimal time to remove food from the grill, rather than just raw/cooked/burned, which could correlate to tips.\n6. Food cost: What about that burger you have to throw away? That stuff isn't free, that is lost income. Same with those \"free\" pies, they cost somebody something.\n\n\n(The only thing I could criticize is that burgers cook then burn just a little too fast, but maybe that is just the chef in me. I want to put the patties on the grill first, then prepare plates and buns, but by then they are burned. Might slow down the gameplay, but could allow for preparing more meals at once and being able to deal with more customers more easily).", "timestamp_created": 1484289812, "timestamp_updated": 1484289812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29179294": {"recommendationid": "29179294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079747672", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499619698}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving both multiplayer and singleplayer.

Part of me wishes the game wasn't so short and could've expanded the jobs a bit more.\n\nThis is a large part of the reason why I absolutely love Diner Duo, which not only takes the ideas from Job Simulator, but expands them into brave new territories for VR multiplayer games.\n\n---\n\nThe game is fairly simple in concept. You're a chef making burgers for customers, and there's a bunch of different burgers you can make. But this makes way to a very challenging game of dexterity, coordination, and memory as you quickly try to make several different types of burgers for a whole diner full of impatient customers. There's plenty of fun screwing around and even some customization to go with your burger flipping goodness, and the art style is akin to Job Simulator with the robot waiters and customers who go about your diner.\n\nBut the real magic to Diner Duo is in the asymmetric co-op multiplayer, which is sadly local only. But while it may be local, it is more than worth finding a friend to try the game with.\n\nIn singleplayer, you play as a chef while the waiters show you easy-to-follow icons of the recipes you need to make as they patiently wait for you to make them. But in co-op, the second player controls the waiter. So instead of getting handy-dandy icons to look up and read, the waiter will call out orders from customers while you try and make them. This requires the chef player to start committing recipes to memory as a #1 hamburger is followed up by a #16 double-stacker cheeseburger with zuchini and mushrooms, ketchup, and mustard stacked in exactly the right order.\n\nWhile the chef has to handle the cooking and recipe memorization process, the waiter meanwhile has to relay the information to the chef as they avoid customers bumping into them while carrying drinks to serve to the customers, and serve pie when they're getting particularly impatient. This in some ways can raise stress levels pretty high, but for a very well coordinated couple of players with a great sense of communication, it makes for an undeniably rewarding experience of comradarie and teamwork.\n\nSomething else that's relatively minor, but deserves some seriously special mention is the manual customization of the play space. Far few games try to contain you to a single region of your room that may end up being incredibly inconvenient, too tall or too short for your height or hard to interact with because of the scale. Plus you could hit your friend trying to cook a mean cheeseburger in co-op. But thank goodness Diner Duo came with some incredibly handy levers in the main menu to adjust height, scale, shelf height, and position of the play area. Now if we could just find a way to rotate the play area too, then it'd make it perfect.\n\nCouple this with making the game fun to pass around to change roles or have friends try and beat your score, it becomes a very fun social experience on top of a solidly designed game. In fact, the concept is such a great and well-executed idea that it's a shame how minimal the game is in terms of actual content.\n\n---\n\nThe game is something of an arcade experience, having only a decent handful of levels that last about 2-3 minutes a-piece that gradually ramp the challenge up as new recipes are thrown into the mix. But it's all over before you know it and there's not a whole lot to keep you coming back for more. For example, there's no leaderboard support. The levels show a high score but it doesn't show who got it or who was playing as what role, so it doesn't give that extra incentive to beat your couch buddies unlike something like Space Pirate Trainer. It's also a shame not to have some type of option to play online. There's customization in the way of hats for your human chef character (that are done via unlockables for completing levels) as well as customizing the waiters, but there aren't a great deal many to choose from and you can't customize your diner. Plus the only menu item in Diner Duo are burgers, so no expansive meals to rotate between just yet.\n\nThere's also a lot of tools that could add more content to the game, like workshop support, custom recipes, custom stages, customization options for the layout of the food on the table, or a way to have random players place orders to challenge the chef. There's no endless mode, options to customize your chef outside of hats, no ways to earn bonus points for timely/perfect orders, no sort of \"team vs team score attack\" mode where one team tries to shoot for a high score, trades to another team, and they try to beat it. It's things like these that could add more depth and versatility to expand such a strong concept of a game, but we're left with an extremely well-put-together tech demo that lasts far shorter than I wish it does.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I absolutely love Diner Duo's relatively simple but engaging gameplay, and it's an even more incredible experience when bringing a friend along. I'd definitely love to see more content added to the game or a potential sequel in the future to explore more gameplay with the waiter, more types of food to make, a more streamlined and visually-complimentary UI, and more ways to expand the arcade experience that Diner Duo excels at. Maybe if it takes only a couple more cues from the clear inspiration of Job Simulator in regards to the polish and UI, then we'll no doubt have a very special multiplayer game VR multiplayer fan should have.\n\nThat said, grab an apron, grab a friend, and open your new restaurant to serve some juicy burgers!", "timestamp_created": 1482366423, "timestamp_updated": 1482366423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28480475": {"recommendationid": "28480475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966918652", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482116357}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely amazing!

These 2 player games, 1 in vr, 1 on the computer, have proved to be an incredibly fun mechanic in games such as 'black hat oculus' and 'Keep talking and nobody explodes'. The diner duo is another great example of this, with 1 player frantically cooking and making incrasingly complex burgers, and the other serving drinks, telling the chef what to cook, and keeping diners happy. \n\nThe game pushes you to go faster and faster, and it makes for a quick learning experience. In no time, you'll be pre-cooking your fish, building towers of slowly rotting beef and chopping cucumber fast enough to chop fingers, all to make sure your customers get their food before they decide to leave.\n\nThe 30 levels give a decent amount of content. A level typically lasts a few minutes, but I found the final ~5 levels to require multiple attempts to complete. The endless mode gives you the oppurtunity to slowly descent into frantic cooking madness forever, with a scoreboard so you can attempt to beat your previous highscores. \n\nI played this game with the oculus rift and touch, and had no issues. I did have noticable fps drops with an R9 290, but I still found it comfortable enough to play without reducing the graphics. The game does require you to look behind, to see the 'star' burger that is randomly generated every round, which may be an issue for some camera setups. When looking behind with 2 front-facing cameras, I sometimes lost hand tracking, but never lost headset tracking.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482158498, "timestamp_updated": 1482158498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28461276": {"recommendationid": "28461276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020440057", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511584236}, "language": "english", "review": "Had framerate issues, posted on reddit about them, dev added a graphics option and fixed the issue for me.

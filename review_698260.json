But can wholeheartedly recommend it now after playing for a few more hours.\n\nYes. It's early access. Yes, there are still a few bugs. But unlike with most early access games I played the creators are incredibly active, they communicate with their playerbase directly, and fix things with incredible speed. (If you're curious about this game but wondering if it's properly supported, hop on to the discord and find out.)\n\nPros: \n- The feeling of pushing yourself away from your little ship and floating through space only to grab onto that piece of spacejunk you were aiming for by the tip of your fingers is awesome.\n- Very involved devs, bugreports get handled at an incredible speed. \n- Information ingame is presented in a very clear and intuitive way.\n- Controls take some getting used to, but once you have them under control it feels natural.\n- The harshness of the survival aspect of the game makes you feel an incredible sense of achievement once you managed to build that *insert item here* you've been wanting.\n- Available ships to explore still feel new and exciting after 8 hours of play, finding the biodome ship and... well.. spoilers.\n- There's a poll up right now for the direction the game should take. Awesome options available. \n- Great balance between what you retain after death, and what you lose.\n\nMixed:\n- Survival can be a bit harsh, having just salvaged an entire derelict ship and floating back to your own little capsule only to notice your oxygen is on 2%... either pray you've aimed correctly or use thrusters to maneuvre while you're still able to... suffocate or miss your target... Then again, that's part of the charm. \n\nCons: \n- No definite roadmap for the game (that I could find). As developers there's always a battle between using community input for the game development, or sticking to your own ideas. For now the devs use community input it seems, which can be a good thing, but doesn't give us an idea what to expect.\n- Not much to do yet other than surviving. The core survival mechanics are in game, and a hell of a lot of fun, but an objective seems to be missing, it's being worked on from what I've heard though.\n- Player body looks... off... Your arms reach to the floor, it makes your feel like an orangatan.\n- Some bugs as mentioned. Latest update should have fixed the ones that were gamebreaking for me though. \n\nAll in all, for an early access game: 9/10, would suffocate climbing into my ship airlock again.\n", "timestamp_created": 1513877570, "timestamp_updated": 1513877570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38444244": {"recommendationid": "38444244", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997729439", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 272, "last_played": 1514657207}, "language": "english", "review": "Early Access Review!!\n\nPros: \n\nFloating through space on intercept trajectories with space junk using only your handheld boosters (and your gun if your desperate) to guide you... dont miss your target...\n\nA survival game that is a real challenge \n-You have to grow food, in order to grow food you have to source the materials and seeds from the space junk.\n-Oxygen and electricity are a commodity, use them wisely.\n- Defend you ship from the ever present threat of asteroids that can punch holes in your ship and suck out all your precious O2.\n\nStanding, Sitting, or room space compatable. you'll be flailing your arms around to jockey around satelites to avoid asteroid showers so bring your motivation.\n\nCons: \nBasic graphical design.\nThe tutorial doesn't explain much.\nNo music/ over tone sounds\nDieing is frustrating, but your progress on the ship is saved\n\nConclusion:\n\nNo it doesn't have great graphics or a formidable musical score.

And I was holding a dialogue with myself about whether this would save me, or if this character would be happy enough that the next iteration would be better off.\nI died by the way.\nOne of the niftier features is the fact that when your character dies, It's not cloned, or revived, instead you are now a new name and age... which is purely cosmetic, and yet I found myself playing differently for each iteration based on the personality I assigned to the name.\n\nIf you are having a hard time finding what you need on the debris around you, head to home base, fly up to the pod on top and hit the sleep button, this resets the randomness of the debris fields, and spawns new major discoveries.", "timestamp_created": 1511421399, "timestamp_updated": 1511421399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36903950": {"recommendationid": "36903950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005171700", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510374617}, "language": "english", "review": "For an early access game, this one blows me away.

Not enough oxygen, impossible to find seeds for planting both oxygen and nutrition plants, no energy canisters to be found... needless to say it was VERY difficult (for me).

It's by far the first VR game I have been able to play for hours straight.\n\nIf you are worrying about the motion sickness factor of being in Zero G; don't. I can barely do anything in real life that involves motion sickness and trust me VR is the same with it, but this game after the first few minutes of getting the feel for it, aslong as you have a good FPS which I do except for inside my ship facing certain ways which I assume is part of the game being so fresh they have to work on parts to fix issues like that, but there is no instance where I got motion sick. It may be different for you but the whole point is don't worry.\n\nI do appreciate the ability of when you die, which happens a lot in the beginning unless your quick and know what your doing, that the ship and anything in it's inventory stays next to it for you to continue on your work. I like the feel of a VR Subnatica in a sense. If there was an ability to modify the exterior of the ship and maybe add on to it in the future this game would have some even more serious attention.\n\nThe developers seem to be constantly at work and interacting with the community and the to be fair, the price is exactly what any VR game should be especially for Early Access. There is not a single thing I dislike besides a few bugs with the GUI when I try to quit and for some reason it won't let me so I have to force leave from the Desktop and lose a load of progress, so don't go button smashing around in the menu's is my advice.\n\nIn one line to sum this game up.\nThe developers make Unity seem like a AAA game engine.", "timestamp_created": 1511111650, "timestamp_updated": 1511111650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36567975": {"recommendationid": "36567975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119322387", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "last_played": 1514392988}, "language": "english", "review": "Though YoreVR would be the first game to capitalize on the booming game genre that is survival crafting open world popularized by Minecraft (Which also has a VR version btw), I feel like Star Shelter captures the genre more in terms of adapting survival with dynamic environmental systems giving the VR space you are playing in more alive than I have ever felt with other open ended VR games. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1 - Except your ship, everything else is procedural. Why is this so good in VR? \n\nBecause being immersed into an environment not even the Devs can predict is when the gaming world you play in has a life of its own. That is so close to actual reality the only parts missing are full wireless and all senses capture which is a console creator's job and not the dev.\n\n2 - Unlike other VR survivals, you actually have to grind it out just to be able to survive. That means you have an objective at the beginning. which makes getting comfortability up and expansion a quest worth taking so that you can survive better. Being able to at least reach minimum no death stability by adding components to your base and hopefully expanding it soon feels so rewarding and fun because you can to feel its progress where you altogether stop dying and then being able to explore further (where no man has gone before or probably did but died anyway)\n\n3 - Undefined borders of map area. To some, this may be too uncomfortable, prefering to have a guide or tutorial in clear instructions to explore with ease and security. However this I believe is the secret that made Minecraft the grand daddy foundation of the entire survival genre. I hope they make it endlessly procedural and add multiplayer, then you put a dlc or even sell it after as Star Shelter 2 once its endless with some large floating platforms that can be built upon and multiplayer. Now this would make this game feel exactly like Star Trek says, \"To boldly go where no man has gone before,\" even if its digital space, that unique coding with a set parameter encompassing an unpredictability that is you and your friends holds true as a fact.\n\n4 - Best locomotion used. I would say Lone Echo came up with the coding first but who knows, all I can say is that this type of zero-G locomotion was something I thought of the moment I saw Detached intros and within months, two games already have this thought that became a dream and is now a reality.\n\n5 - Didn't notice that much bugs on Oculus and even if some sensor screw up happens, the game is forgiving if you are used to survival games and know how to prep yourself. \n\nTIPS: Dont do anything except scavenge for plant pot parts and you will find an oxygen plant seed or two with other plant seeds. One is enough to allow you to survive indefinitely without suffocating for oxygen, and two will allow for some canisters to be packed with you or explore comfortably. Then focus on more plant pots for other seeds for nutrition. These two will allow you to finally be immortal without dying constantly from suffocation or starvation. Once you reach this immortal stage, you can then focus on upgrading your suit for better survivability whilst exploring further into the depths of space. Dealing with comets and drones can be annoying but remember you dont lose stuff you keep in the ship or have built. Once you have upgraded your suit, then it is important to deal with them. Comets dont give anything but drones do. Ignoring them means passing up on their valuable parts.\n\nCons:\n- Its EA\n- Deal with it\n- Keep Calm and VR\n- Keep watching for updates", "timestamp_created": 1510912574, "timestamp_updated": 1510912574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36509029": {"recommendationid": "36509029", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992623535", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511655854}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the best \"survival\" type games on VR right now.

that will soak up hundreds of hours for me - not just a shallow five-minute or hour-long experience, but a real game that keeps you coming back for more. I haven't played that much of Star Shelter yet, but what I've seen is deeply impressive and hints at the possibility of something really deep and addictive.\n\nStar Shelter reminds me of other space survival games like Space Engineers or Starmade, and in that regard it's not really reinventing the genre or anything. But this is, of course, in VR - and what an amazing difference that makes. The movement mechanic is very intuitive and very fun - like a real astronaut, you grab handles and bars to fling yourself around, and there will be plenty of [i]Gravity[/i]-style situations where you reach out to grab a passing satellite just in time before floating into deep space. You do have thrusters if you miss - but in a clever mechanic, using the thrusters depletes your oxygen supply. So there's a constant challenge of exploring as much as you can without suffocating on the way.\n\nThere are some annoyances - picking up resources feels clunkier than it should be, and I'm still not really clear on how you replenish your oxygen supply without being lucky enough to find a spare tank floating around. But that's all early access stuff and there's plenty of fun for the money even at this stage.\n\nThat sense of wonder that VR promises is fulfilled in Star Shelter - coming across a derelict spaceship, hacking the airlock open, and pulling yourself inside to find the eerie abandoned bunks and silent cockpits of the dead craft. Clinging on to your space station with one hand while lining up a shot on a rogue comet with the other. The palpable sense of relief when you enter an oxygen pocket and raise your hand to your helmet to open the visor.

They're the same developers behind Abode and Conductor. It's along the same lines as Subnautica or Don't Starve in that you have to explore, find resources and craft items to survive.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand. As is common in survival games, you're left to figure out a lot of things yourself. More guidance has appeared since the first time I played, so this may become easier as the development goes on.\n\nYou have stats for oxygen, power, hunger and health. Running out of power isn't much of an issue as it just inconveniences your collection of resources, but \nif your oxygen or hungry drops to 0, your health will drop and you'll soon die.\n\nYou move about by either using thrusters or grabbing surfaces to manuvuer yourself about. You can also propel yourself with the gun in a pinch. The thrusters use oxygen so you have to be careful not to overuse them.\n\nYou'll spend your time exploring space and collecting resources. You can use those to repair and upgrade various things in your ship, as well as other things.\n\nYour ship will often take damage that needs patching up and you can create upgrades from simple ones like plant pots to grow food and plants to create oxygen to shield generators to protect the ship. \nYou can also upgrade your suit.\n\nGraphically the game is good, particularly for something made by two people.\n\nI do have to say, and again with the disclaimer that I've been playing the pre-release version, even before Early Access, that I have come across a few bugs. Luckily it's mostly been minor things, graphical issues and the like. A couple have already been fixed since reporting them. \n\nThe only major one is an issue some people are experiencing with the game not creating a save file.\nThe devs are aware. Until it is fixed, they recommend setting the executable to run as administrator if you experience this.\n\nStar Shelter is a really fun survival game. It gives that feeling of wanting to keep going and do better next time.

The different mechanics fit together really well. Gives you meaningful in-game reasons to do goofy, Saturday Morning TV, superhero stuff-- acrobatic stunts, power-ups, team-attacks. The team members play off each other in ways that are as satisfying as any RPG I've played.\n\nI even enjoy the crafting and studio upgrades (though I'm usually not much into resource management) because it gives you awesome bonuses during the episodes. And getting \"drops\" of crafting materials from killing enemies is really crunchy and fun.\n\nReally a joy to play, and I hope it influences other RPG and tactics games to be this much fun.

Tambi\u00e9n me ha gustado el componente de gesti\u00f3n de la productora de televisi\u00f3n; aunque la administraci\u00f3n de equipo, recursos y dem\u00e1s es un 10% del juego y el resto son cinem\u00e1ticas y combates (no hay m\u00e1s).\n\nHe echado en falta la posibilidad de explorar alg\u00fan tipo de mapa y m\u00e1s libertad en ese sentido.

Si lo que buscas es un reto m\u00ednimo, mejor jugarlo en la m\u00e1xima dificultad directamente. \n\nEn la mayor\u00eda de escenarios hay un momento de combate de mecha, que viene a ser un minijuego de precisi\u00f3n. Me parece simp\u00e1tico porque hay un taller en el que personalizas el maquinote y le pones habilidades y tal, pero sigo sin entender por qu\u00e9 se cura autom\u00e1ticamente cada vez que derriba a un enemigo. Es imposible que te maten con ese tiesto, hasta tal punto que me ha costado trabajo sacar el logro de que me derriben. \n\nEl combate podr\u00eda pulirse. Si te equivocas en el movimiento te fastidias ya que no puedes andar hasta que se agoten tus puntos de movimiento, sino que antes de hacer clic tienes que contar las casillas y hacer todos los c\u00e1lculos. Tambi\u00e9n faltan peculiaridades del terreno. Todos los escenarios son dibujos planos y no puedes interactuar con nada. En Fire Emblem si te pones detr\u00e1s de unos arbustos te dan un bonificador para esquivar ataques a distancia y esas cosas. \n\nEn general: un juego curioso que, si bien no est\u00e1 mal, podr\u00eda ser infinitamente m\u00e1s de lo que es con unos mesecillos m\u00e1s de desarrollo.\n\nNOTA: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1521596728, "timestamp_updated": 1521596849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40947085": {"recommendationid": "40947085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253888658", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1521135442}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "joguinho 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1521585304, "timestamp_updated": 1521585304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40946099": {"recommendationid": "40946099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116413026", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501114831}, "language": "french", "review": "Petit jeu assez technique.\nOn roule sur la campagne principale et le boss final est infaisable.\nBeaucoup de clin d'oeil, un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"gestion\" et beaucoup de strat\u00e9gie qui rappelle un peu advance wars ou pit people plus recemment.\n", "timestamp_created": 1521580841, "timestamp_updated": 1521580841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40927260": {"recommendationid": "40927260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041768725", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "last_played": 1521493233}, "language": "english", "review": "The combat is good and the story is not boring, but that's all there is to this game.

It was awesome. Everybody loved it.\n\nChroma Squad allows you to re-live all those great childhood moments as well as engaging in a great story line as you film episodes, upgrade your studio, craft gear and improve your squad and Mech with a wide range of equipment made of cardboard, plastic and a shit-load of tape.\n\nOne thing I found very cool was how the game constantly broke the 4th wall by introducing characters as Kick-starter Backers, the bad spelling of the narrator and constantly referring to itself as a game and TV show and cracking jokes about the original Power Rangers show. Chroma Squad doesn't take itself too seriously, but you can, because on higher difficulties it is actually pretty hard.\n\nI played the game on the 'Interesting' difficulty, and most of the way through wasn't too hard, there were a few restarts but it never felt impossible, that is, until the final level.  The difficulty seemed to ramp up significantly. So much so that after about 25 attempts at the final level I had to resort to dropping the difficulty in order to finish the game so I could write this review.\n\nI had a great time playing Chroma Squad, my first play-through took a good 25 hours. There is a lot of replay value here also, I played with the default squad but there are over 20 different cast members to choose from and all their interactions with each-other is different. There are multiple endings also depending on your squad composition and the choices you make throughout the game. And upon completion of your first play-through there is a New Game+ also. So for the price of $15AUD you will get hours and hours of content and it is all very enjoyable, at no point did I get bored or feel like the game was wasting my time.\n\nSo we have nostalgia, entertaining story all the way through, crafting and upgrades, great pixel art, light RPG elements and challenging, Engaging tactical game-play.  AND it's Power Rangers.\n\nChroma Squad 9/10. \nI had to deduct a point for the difficulty spike on the last level if not for that it would have been a solid 10/10\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/251130/Chroma_Squad/\n\nGO GO CHROMA RANGERS!", "timestamp_created": 1521256776, "timestamp_updated": 1521256776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40828185": {"recommendationid": "40828185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082737523", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477680488}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a Power Rangers fan, play this one!", "timestamp_created": 1521119039, "timestamp_updated": 1521119039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40827096": {"recommendationid": "40827096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203185740", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1261, "last_played": 1521300715}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Chroma Squad es un juego de estrategia RPG, con un tono de humor bastante acorde al juego.

You've just grabbed your bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and orange juice.

The feelings I had watching Power Rangers was a major driving force for how much I enjoy this game. \nPros: \n-Story is funny in the sense that it's just as cheesy as the original Power Rangers.\n-Soundtrack is retro 8-bit stuff and really helps with setting up the scenes.\n-Villains are hilarious and offer fun narrative to the story.\n-Easy to understand upgrade system that allows you to go back and make changes without penalty.\n-Name your squad and studio whatever you want.\n-Easy to understand gameplay that allows ease of entry into TRPGs.\n\nCons:\n-No real difficulty. The game was kind of a breeze throughout and never really felt like a challenge. Could be different for others, but that's just how I felt playing.\n-Character customization is a little basic and doesn't add a ton of diversity.\n-Kinda short. Wish there were more side missions and whatnot.\n-The sponsorship system never really added a ton to me. Once again, just my opinion, but I never saw a ton of use in it.\n\nTL;DR: Chroma Squad is a great, simple TRPG based on the Power Rangers series and is great for anyone trying to get into TRPGs or anyone who loves Power Rangers.", "timestamp_created": 1519946820, "timestamp_updated": 1519946820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40496530": {"recommendationid": "40496530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095383816", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519939865}, "language": "english", "review": "Spend 90% of the time skipping the mindless, crappy dialogue.

What's not to love? [spoiler]Besides Fishmaid[/spoiler]\n\nNow, the presentation might be a bit misleading, it is not a tycoon/management game, there is not that much to actually manage. Some studio upgrades which are purely functional (but do include some nifty visual upgrades for the background of your studio managing menu), like unlocking more upgrades or getting better bonuses for completing director's orders for an episode.\nWhat this really is, is a light RPG. You progress through chapters, get equipment in various ways and at the end of each season (set of chapters), every character in the squad earns a new skill slot (where you can choose between, generally, 2-3 passive or active skills, and switch them after every chapter if you want to try a different build).\n\nManaging your various resources (audience/fans, crafting materials, money...) is important, but not some hardcore experience that'll screw you over if you don't play it optimal.\nNow, the RPG aspect is quite a bit fleshed out. Although there are no levels at all to gain (a good thing in my books, as it helps tailor the difficulty of every stat of every enemy and similar perfectly for every chapter, without overlevelling or underlevelling impacting it, plus no grinding), there are plenty of wildly different builds to take depending on which perks, skills and equipment you have on each of your five different classes: Assault, Techie, Support, Scout and Leader.\nTrying to get the optional objectives, and as many fans as possible is actually quite challenging as well.\n\nThe difficulty was on point for me, and there are four different settings that change enemy stats. The highest difficulty also features something great: Enemies aren't going to blindly rush at you anymore, but instead focus the weakest chararcter, or generally those they have the best chances of taking out, almost as if the AI was playing like a real player. It's still AI, but it's definetly a welcome change if you're tired of dumb and easy to exploit AI.\n\nThe writing is really funny, I enjoyed all the puns and references and generally lost count of how many times this game made me laugh out loud. Plus, it's translated into a bunch of languages. It's been ages since I played a game in spanish, instead of the usual \"English/Original language or no deal\" that a lot of games feature, and I was very pleased with the quality of the translation, which wasn't a bad straight translation, but adapted the humor to the language and generally did a fantastic job at making it feel authentic.\nI love the job the translators did here.\n\nThe finale was epic, and a fun challenge as well [spoiler]even though I have to admit I did ragequit the first stage with the massive spam[/spoiler]. I had the best gear I could, so I don't think you can cheese it via overwhelming stats, unless you lower the difficulty enough (I played on the highest, and toned it down to the equivalent of Hard later on).\n\nNow the game is not without it's flaws, it can be (slightly) buggy in a few rare cases, and enemy phase can drag out a little if there are a lot of enemies (the mines individually exploding on that one chapter...), but if you're willing to put up with a little bit of annoyingness, the game is really worth it.\n\nOverall, a blast for anyone, and completely worth the price.\nOh, there's also giant mech battles just like in the Rangers' shows, fully customizable one-liners and controller support.\nThat's cool too.\nAlmost as cool as the fantastic retro soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1517905532, "timestamp_updated": 1517905532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39870764": {"recommendationid": "39870764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045697475", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518232271}, "language": "english", "review": "Its not often you find a game with an amazing soundtrack, but this game blows everything else out of the water.

I think it's the only game i've ever played that REALLY made me have some kind of connection with the characters. I started doing another run (to get the game 100% completed) and almost gave up because i didn't want to play the game with a different team (i actually could choose the same team and give the same names to the characters but after playing the game and seeing that the attributes i chose in my first run were messed up, doing the same thing again would be stupid). I guess i can explain better with the classic pros and cons.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Extremely catchy story\n[*] Extremely catchy soundtrack (i recommend buying it)\n[*] Very funny speech lines (at least on the portuguese version)\n[*] Replayability (to get all achievements, you need to play the game at least 3 times, which means 30+ hours)\n[*] Awesome combat system (similar to Wakfu and Dofus)\n[*] Makes you feel like the characters are actual people\n[*] May be a little bit cliche, but the game (mainly because of the soundtrack) still gives you chills\n[*] Crafting system\n[*] Pixelized Power Rangers\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] Doesn't have a sequel\n[/list]\n\n\n[b] Conclusion/Resume: [/b]\n\nChroma Squad is a really good and unique game. You can customize literally everything you want in your team, craft new items and swap abilities anytime you want. It has a very good, attractive and easy to master battle system. The characters and the humor of the game are simply awesome, the story (even though cliche) is very addictive and will get you playing for hours and the soundtrack is a masterpiece.

Each of your characters get new skills each season and which ones you choose give you a sense of personalization, its not as in depth as a job system (FFT) but it's nice. A big part of the game is \"teamwork\" which will let your characters do things like throw one another around to get over an obstacle or use multiple characters and do a team attack which is essentially just like 3 characters kicking the shit out of one enemy. Staying in line with the power rangers theme there are giant robot battles which are based more off timed attacks and blocking than actual strategy (think FF Lightning Returns). \nIt's a little cheesy and actually funny in a lot of parts as even the characters at some points are like \"isn't this a little much?\" or \"why are we doing this?\".

Cheesy lines, silly storylines played up until you get a shiver saying \"epic\" despite your best reasoning and a sense of satisfaction from the repeated, well-made sequences of transformation, finishing moves and whatnot. Giving the ability to customise often used lines and even the team name allows to turn this factor up to eleven.\n\nThis is backed up by a very well made content of missions, each of them a chain of several tactical fights, sometimes ending with a quick-timey battle in your Mecha. While this last part might sound bad, its execution is better than you would expect - the fights are basically just timing button presses with a little bit of strategy sprinkled in, but the audio-visual effects and plenty of impactful, meaty slowdowns make this feel better. And honestly, how interesting can you make something as awkward as the kaiju fights from Power Rangers and the like?\n\nThe on-foot combat is much more nuanced, with a few enemy types introduced over the course of the game and a tonne of boss monsters. Fair warning, some of them are very similar, including two that are basically reskinned - I didn't like that decision, but thankfully the RNG in those fights made it actually engaging. Equipment and skills are drip fed to the player as well, helping to familiarize yourself slowly with how the game works. Puzzlingly, that doesn't mean everything is explained all that well; skill regen is the main example, it is more convoluted than you would expect, requiring some digging to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of it. At the same time, this might be just me being pedantic - for a normal player, the idea that the higher it is, the better for your skills is probably everything needed.\n\nThe combat stands out from a run-of-the-mill tactical grid in two ways. First, there is a big focus on 'teamwork' stance, another engine for sentai nostalgia. Your characters can propel each other around for high-distance jumps, join forces in an attack and even perform a finishing move when the entire squad joins in (with a bonus, [b]very[/b] Power Ranger-esque animation if that is done with weapon attacks). Several nuances are built into this mechanic - Lead boosts your Audience and damage if he is a part of a team move, Assault can throw people really far while Support heals in AoE every time they enter teamwork.\nAnd yes, I said Audience, that is the second thing. Your team is a bunch of stuntmen working on an indie super sentai show, which means you have to go through every mission (dubbed 'episode') in a possibly most fan-pleasing way. There are special goals (director's instruction) that give you bonus audience, aside from steady income on teamwork moves and just beating baddies. Each character can unlock skills catering to their fanbase: Support lovers will want to see them heal even more, while Scout is cheered for when they zip across the battlefield. The audience is no small deal, and sometimes you will have to either sacrifice fan growth (and thus money) for efficiency in combat or vice versa. Later on, director's instructions become quite the challenge, satisfying to fulfil.\n\nThe game is not without its fault, and the difficulty curve is pretty uneven; I played on Challenging, which meant that most of the time game required reasonable tactical thinking, but some episodes/instructions can send you back to the drawing board many-many times. I already touched on the problems with copy-pasted enemies and not everything being perfectly clear, so let me add two more to this list. One, it is pretty hard to switch your strategy on the inventory level. The crafting system demands a lot of materials, so destroying old weapons is mandatory. Now, that wouldn't be so bad if not for the inherently random nature of crafting, that means you might go up a tier of equipment but finish with a substandard set of traits (especially dangerous on class-specific items). You can still make it through the game, or lower the difficulty if you are desperate, but the problem exists.\n\nAll in all, however, we have a loveable indie title here, one that brings you back to the time when you rushed, as a kid, to the TV for yet another same-ish episode of Power Rangers.

The game is quite easy, at least on Normal difficulty, but adds challenge via special instructions for each mission. While it is linear, you are also able to choose the order of regular missions building up to the season boss.\n\nAs a TRPG, it works. Each class has unique skills available to them, though I found little-to-no reason to ever change from the build I assembled, and as there's no way to change actors once a file has been made, it's possible to give a character an asynergetic role, especially when salaries are presented as a factor you'll need to concern yourself with when they're meaningless beyond Season 1.\n\nChroma Squad brings a few fresh concepts to the table, as well. A \"Teamwork\" button allows gang-up attacks and throwing allies, but because gang-ups must be basic attacks and throwing distance is individualized, I ended up just having my slow strongman pitch my leader where I want the team, then using his group up skill to bring everyone else over. Teamwork also enables you to use the often-mission-fulfilling finishing move, but it can be a bit awkward positioning every ally adjacent to the boss, especially when many foes have knockback and at least one unit is range-based. Finally, Teamwork locks in a turn. If anything results in your not being adjacent to the target when it's time to combo them, such as the fixed camera angle concealing a tile or random knockback, the turn is wasted.\n\nAssembling a mecha is one of the more enjoyable parts of the game, and adds some variety. Mecha battles used to be pure RNG, but have been updated to a more timed-hit basis. Still, even a perfect guard takes chip damage, which I imagine can frustrate players.\n\nOverall, Chroma Squad is palpably a mobile game, but an excellent one, only lacking in freedom of variety due to locking in characters and having such static roles for static missions.

More often than not, I found myself skipping through painfully stale dialogue that constantly fails to make any sense at all. Chroma Squad attempts to replicate the 'terrible-but-entertaining' stories of the TV shows it's influenced by, but it doesn't quite manage to achieve the same effect. The story is tongue-in-cheek and far too self-aware, causing an already incoherent plot to throw any hope of logic out the window.\n\nNow if it sounds like I'm being too hard on a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, remember that a Tactical RPG generally focuses heavily on two areas: strategy and story, and when the one element is lacking, it's usually left up to the other to compensate.\n\nUnfortunately Chroma Squad doesn't involve much strategy at all.\n\nEach character fills a specific role in your squad; the Assist squad member has supporting skills that allows them to heal other members, the Scout squad member has a larger movement range, etc. As you complete seasons, you unlock more skills, gaining the ability to further customise your characters to fit your play style. These skills - while fun to execute - serve only to hasten the inevitable victory.\n\nThe battles are simple; while that isn't a bad thing, it does cause the game to lose its appeal with the limited challenge the game presents. Episodes generally devolve into a routine of clearing waves of enemies and then battling a giant-sized version of the boss with your Mech while completing a set of tasks called 'Director's Instructions' for bonuses to your Audience meter. This means more long-term fans and money.\n\nSpeaking of money, you'll be able to outfit your squad with a number of different items purchasable from the store or crafted yourself from the materials enemies drop. It's such a treat to watch as your squad who started out wearing buckets for helmets progress to wearing awesome space helmets.\n\nThe soundtrack is catchy at best and repetitive at worst. At the start of the game, the music will seem like a beautiful work of Chiptune - which it is - but as you approach Season 5, the limited number of tracks becomes annoyingly obvious.\n\nChroma Squad is rife with bad design choices, but it isn't an entirely bad game, and you'll either love it or hate depending on whether you can get behind its story and one-tone gameplay. I had fun with it for little over two hours, but two hours do not justify that price. \n\nI would suggest looking elsewhere for your Tactical RPG fix.", "timestamp_created": 1506995023,

I actually did seek this game out unlike some others, though I did acquire it in a bundle, I bought that bundle just for this game. Pretty good deal, really. \n\nI love Super Sentai stuff, I love Voltron, I loved the new Power Rangers movie. I love tactical RPGs; Final Fantasy Tactics, Front Mission, etc. It seemed like this would be the perfect game for me. Unfortunately, there's also a tactical RPG I hate: Disgaea. Disgaea and this game only have a few things in common.\n\nIn Disgaea there is a Sentai (Power Rangers) Parody mission, and Disgaea's plot is full on joke after joke with never a serious moment. The Power Rangers mission was the best joke in the game, but it gets dull, especially when you don't find the jokes funny. Like many Indie games, Chroma Squad cannot fucking turn it off. It's full on quirky so much that even the cute jokes like Construction Walkers (Zombies Construction Workers) lose their appeal in the sea of 'hilarity'. It's too much. \n\nYes the writing in those older shows, and some of the newer stuff based off of them, was not Shakespeare. But, let's be real. It was not as terrible as people remember, and some of the plots are legendarily entertaining. This game does not have good writing, or good plots. It's just 'intentionally' bad. The stories Framework as being in a studio pretending to film a Sentai show wears thin, and meaningless upgrades are rendered to you via a meta joke that gets old fast. In fact, since it's an indie game you can expect endless meta jokes. In fact, the plot of this game where they cannot really tell reality from what they're doing sometimes because it's all so meaninglessly squished together itself becomes a meta joke, which begets the plot, which was another joke all along. It ends up being a confusing, incoherent mess that wasn't enjoyable. It totally fails to capture the enjoyment of the genre it's parodying and it comes off as not even understanding it.\n\nThe gameplay itself is low rent. It's missing vital options like enabling the grid, which really would have helped with coordinating movement ranges which become a major thing. Especially when mid game becomes a bounce house of everyone being tossed all over. Ultimately the gameplay is 'fill this meter by repeatedly using the same tired special skill over and over'. It's fun at first, but then it gets old fast. \n\nThen you have the mecha fights, which should be the absolute coolest. They aren't. Do you like QTE? Because it's a QTE. And after a certain point it's in every mission. \n\nThere's something called Director's Missions which are technically required. You could ignore them but it would result in basically failing after a certain point. Some of these missions are poorly worded, and use very unclear terminology that the game hasn't actually gone out of its way to explain. Other times they're literally impossible without foreknowledge or RNG. One example was to get 6 consecutive combo on an enemy in mecha. Unfortunately I was too strong and it proved literally impossible due to the way the QTE sequence is designed to reset after each health bar is knocked off. \n\nAs far as RPGs go, there's no leveling up. It's 100% equipment based. Some of the equipment does look pretty cool as you move on, however it also all has its own unique look. So that kind of makes the squad look weird when half of them are dressed differently, again somewhat going against the theme of the game. \n\nSometimes the game itself doesn't even know what it's talking about. In the late game I still have trouble hitting a certain mook who's been around since chapter 2 at least, if not 1. Yet it tells me a boss has a super high hit rate and that I have to use skills, but I never once miss the boss. Now you could say 'that's just the RNG' and speaking of RNG, one of the director's missions was to never miss a hit once. Thanks, you can guess how well that went over. \n\nI don't hate this game, but I would not recommend it to anyone unless you love indies and need to kill time. This is a weak excuse for a tactical RPG or a Sentai/Power Rangers reference. I just can't help but feel that the vision of what was announced for this game is not the end result. Not even for $15 do I think this game is worthwhile.

Deal with it.\n\nChroma Squad is a tactical RPG in the same vein as Nintendo's Fire Emblem series, but with a strange twist. Instead of being a knight or a dude with spikey hair and a giant sword, you play as a group of five stuntmen who act in a Power Rangers inspried show, complete with cheesy catchphrases and mech battles.\n\nChroma Squad's story is pretty simple. Your goal is to film each of the gangs' adventures for their TV show. Things seem fine at first, but the group begins to realize that their adventures may be more fact than fiction. I won't spoil any of the three endings, but they're all great.\n\nGameplay: As previosuly mentioned, this game runs in a similar way to the Fire Emblem series. For those who are uninitiated into weeb culture, Fire Emblem (and this game) do away with the idea that in turn-based battles your characters all stand in a line. Instead, you move them around a grid to get an advantage and perform special moves. One of this game's most important features is its' teamwork specials. By having a member of Chroma Squad perform the Teamwork move, other member can perform teamwork attack, Finishers, or Team Acrobatics which extend your sprint range. At the end of each episode, how well you did will be tallied into \"Audience Points\", which are then converted into your profit and fans. You'll also recieve materials which can be used to craft better weapons and armor for your squad.\n\nMecha Battles: These are, in my opinion, the most fun part of the game. At the end of most episodes from Season 2 and on, the boss you fight will grow to gigantic size! In order to combat this, your Squad gears up thier Mecha bot. Your bot and the enemy then take turns hitting eachother, defending, and performing specials. Each time you attack, your percent chance of hitting goes down by 10%, meaning you'll have to be careful to balance your attacks and defences. You can also use the materials you recieve or buy to upgrade parts of your mecha in order to increased attack, defence, hit chance, or give new specials.\n\nCustomization: There are a total of 5 rangers on your squad. The techie is best at dealing ranged damage. The Scout is the best at sneaking in, dealing damage, and getting out. The Assualt is good at hitting things really really hard. The Support is for healing your team, and the Lead is for keeping your team organized so they don't become too thinly spread. Within each ranger, there are 6 actors you can choose from who each gives their own extra stats. For instance, the lead in my first playthrough had the Asimobot actor, while my second playthrough used Mr. Beaver. Beyond that, you can also choose the nicknames of your rangers and what colors their suits are! :D\n\nPros:\n1. Simple gameplay that's easy to pick up, but still has some depth for experienced players\n2. The story is just interesting enough to keep you invested\n3. Multiple endings adds a ton to the replay value\n4. Four levels of difficuly most different types of players (Casual for those who want to see the story, up to Legendary for those who want a callenge)\n5. It's so gosh darn charming! Each boss has their own personality and taglines, and it makes me feel so fuzzy inside. <3\n\nCons:\n1. There are occasionaly a few visual glitches, but unless you're a real stickler, they shouldn't hinder your experience much.\n2. The only real complaint I have is how short the story is. In total, one playthrough of the campaign takes about 15 hours. Again, this is brought up to about 45 hours between 3 different endings, but the 2nd and 3rd playthrough are mostly filler until the last season.\n\nIf you don't play this game, you're doing a disservice to yourself. This game is filled with so much charm with it's characters, palette, and story, you'll find it hard to stop playing. Prop all of that up with awesome gameplay, and you've got yourself an awesome way to spend 40+ hours.\n\n9.5/10, HIghly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1504406764, "timestamp_updated": 1505093887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683228", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34697085": {"recommendationid": "34697085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255093619", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504362996}, "language": "polish", "review": "xD is this game :D", "timestamp_created": 1504392092, "timestamp_updated": 1504392092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34690201": {"recommendationid": "34690201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143746480", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518878765}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[h1] SIMPLESMENTE SENSACIONAL [/h1]\n \n    ele \u00e9 um \u00f3timo RPG t\u00e1tico, nescessitando de habilidade para conseguir vencer, mas ainda \u00e9 bem simples, o que pode afastar algumas pessoas mais \"hardcore\" , mas \u00e9 or esse motivo que como trocar a dificuldade, n\u00e9?\n    tamb\u00eam  \u00e9 muito bom principalmente para quem est\u00e1 entrando nesse estilo ( RPG t\u00e1tico ) por sua simpliscidade.\n    \ne, para quem n\u00e3o gosta muto desse estilo de jogo, existe o modo *casual*, em que voc\u00ea pode apenas ficar ouvindo a hist\u00f3ria, as musicas sensacionais, lendo o di\u00e1logos engra\u00e7ados e costumizando seus rangers do jeito que quiser. :D\n\n[b] OBS: N\u00c3O FIQUEM PULANDO OS DI\u00c1LOGOS, ELES S\u00c3O SENSACIONAIS [/b]\n\n\n[spoiler] LORD GAGA IS THE BEST ENEMY!!!

Une aventure humaine assez proche finalement de la cr\u00e9ation d'un jeu ind\u00e9pendant comme nous le rappelle fr\u00e9quemment les d\u00e9veloppeurs \u00e0 travers de nombreux clins d'oeil et brisage de 4e mur. On regrettera juste une interface perfectible (pas acc\u00e8s aux statistiques des h\u00e9ros depuis le menu de craft notamment), mais dans l'ensemble on s'amuse, \u00e7a fonctionne bien.\n\nDu c\u00f4t\u00e9 des phases tactical, on retrouve bien \u00e9videmment cet humour aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9reux que ridicule avec poses absurdes, r\u00e9parties bidons et oublis de sc\u00e9narios. L'exp\u00e9rience tactique se montre plut\u00f4t light. On reste sur les basiques avec des r\u00f4les bein d\u00e9finis, auxquels le jeu ajoute des acrobaties et attaques coordonn\u00e9es pour coller \u00e0 la th\u00e9matique, ainsi qu'une poign\u00e9e de pouvoirs \u00e0 cooldowns.\nOn regrettera tout de m\u00eame un level design en dessous de tout, avec quasiment pas d'obstacles (seule une map en propose), une IA qui n'agit plus quand elle est hors de l'\u00e9cran et une difficult\u00e9 davantage g\u00e9r\u00e9e par le nombre de points de vie plut\u00f4t que par la forme du niveau ou les comportements ennemis -il y a pas mal de vari\u00e9t\u00e9 pour le coup mais l'effet est plomb\u00e9 par la platitude du level design. Il y a aussi ces phases r\u00e9currentes en mecha, mal foutues et monotones, mais bon, le ton parodique et l\u00e9ger du titre fait passer la pilule.\n\nAu final il m'aura fallu une vingtaine d'heures pour terminer le jeu une premi\u00e8re fois (il y a 3 fins diff\u00e9rentes, d\u00e9blocables via le new game+ ou en cr\u00e9ant une nouvelle \u00e9quipe de h\u00e9ros). Ce n'est pas le tactical du mill\u00e9naire, loin s'en faut, mais si vous n'\u00eates pas un fan hardcore de Fire Emblem et consors, et ouvert \u00e0 la parodie un peu d\u00e9bile, j'aurais tendance \u00e0 le recommander.", "timestamp_created": 1504271295, "timestamp_updated": 1504271396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34644793": {"recommendationid": "34644793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286100665", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508293628}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "chroma squad \u00e9 um jogo muito foda\neu acho que poderiam adicionar mais temporadas,itens,personagens etc...\nisso deixaria o jogo muito melhor", "timestamp_created": 1504215683, "timestamp_updated": 1504215683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34636169": {"recommendationid": "34636169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107634114", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504797526}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c9 um jogo BR com muita zoeira :D Se voc\u00ea gosta de super sentais, rpg\u00b4s taticos e jogos de simula\u00e7\u00e3o de zoeira..

I sold it after about an hour of forced gameplay due to the price I'd paid.\n\nThis is now my second experience with a game like that... and I think this game is downright fun, and amazing. The 2 games are not identical by any means, but for those new to a strategy RPG, Chroma Squad is an excellent place to start whereas something like Disgaea dropped you in with no guidance at all.\n\nIt is most definitely influenced by the likes of Power Rangers and other hits from this genre. The gameplay is so much fun and it's made incredibly easy by design. I love the challenge that this game has but it also is very understanding for those who have trouble learning the tactics of a game like this.\n\nI know that there are plenty of games similar to this and many have their favorites. When I saw the first level of this was strategy play, I immediately thought \"here we go again with another crap game I got in a bundle\" but then I beat the first level. And another... and another.\n\nAnd I kept playing and I haven't stopped. Something about being able to make your own team of fighters is so much fun. You have a lot of options to make the Chroma Squad feel like your own. The bosses are really funny and play into the mechanics well. It banks hard on nostalgia does it perfectly.\n\nThe story is not amazing but it's definitely cheesy and hits all of the right notes for the game.

Dialouge in the beginning of the 2nd \"Episode\" revolving around it being a sexist trope to rescue a girl (who apparently always wanted to be rescued by the power rangers) so the chroma squad decided it should be a boy (who also wanted to be rescued or in the show) instead to avoid the issue of racist or sexist motivations.  If they wrote the episode to rescue a guy just because he was the one that wanted to be in the show, and that be the end of it, I wouldn't have even noticed.  But because they tried to shove their agenda in your face while you are attempting to be immersed in this quirky story, it just ruined it for me.  Still playing it, but keep this shit out of video games for the love of god.  Doesn't matter if the characters are black or white, chinese or hispanic, male or female.

The art style and bright colors really popped out to me and made me smile.  All the spites are well detailed and animated.  A lot of love whent into the graphics!\n\nSound:\nBieng that I bought the soundtrack, that tells you that I LOVED the sound of this game.  The soundtrack was always a joy to listen to and the sound effects were funny and great!  So much as that I BOUGHT the soundtrack! I especially loved the impact sounds when you got a critical on enemies!\n\nControl:\nBieng this was point and click, there were few issues with it, save for an instance here or there were it would seem you can click a spot when you can't.  Other than that, no issues whatsoever!  I did not get to try the addiction joystick controls that were recently added.\n\nGameplay:\nManaging a team of stuntment as they evolve into actual rangers may seem silly, but it works well!  You have a finite amount of resources to deal with as your try to buy equipment or crafting supplies and crafting equipment or new parts for your mech.  You gain money from beginning of season grants, completing episodes and crafting supplies from enemy drops.  You also control what abilities they bring into battle, and they gain more as you complete seasons.\n\nEach battle is a careful dance of keeping your rangers alive and trying to complete Director Instructions, additional episode objectives that gain you extra money and audiance, but can be difficult to do at time.  Many battles were very difficult but never unfair or cheap, and at least for me, you could always come back from a major screw up.  The mecha battles used to be difficult, having to deal the RNG, btu after the Director's Cut, this is now alleviated by a reaction bar minigame, making it easier to perform combos and survive battles.\n\nThe story also gave me a smile with each episode, which felt like I was watching an old tokusatsu show!  From dealing with a silly moment to saving citizens from petrification, this game's episodes were always fun to play!  The jokes werte always funny and never ham fisted.  Props to the writers!\n\nThis is an excellent game to play and watch!  My lil sister enjoyed watching it as well.  She never got to see the ending, but I know she would have loved it.

There's just not a lot to be liked here, and quite frankly I don't know why it has so many positive reviews. The game can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or not, constantly switching between in show dialog. (character to character) and studio dialog (actor to actor out of character) This makes the game feel really jerky, and the transitions don't make any sense. The game play is repetitive and confusing. The way you move to determine your attack range isn't intuitive, and doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. One character might be able to make a hit from a specific distance, but another character (even with the same general stats) can't make the same hit. \n\nAs stated above, the game can't decide if it's going to be serious or not. The game can't decide if it's going to be an action oriented, turn based RPG, or just a humorous game with RPG elements thrown it. When it tries to be serious it never succeeds, and when it tries to be funny the humor just falls flat. It's full of all the kitschy cliches you could ask for, and not even the endearing kind.  The game also has a real \u201cwhat the hell are we doing?\u201d kind of vibe. No single idea in the game seems to be fleshed out enough. It's very jerky, and can't really stick to one plot line long enough. \n\nI can't really recommend this one, and will be asking for a refund.

After the patch, I found them to be almost laughably easy and I never suffered another knockdown, so I think they may have over-corrected somewhat. But still, they're fun and cool ways to end big battles.\n\nIt is hard to say this game is worth 15 bucks when Disgaea costs 20, but I got about 10 or 12 hours out of it (I play offline frequently which messes up my stats), and in those terms it's easily a fair price.", "timestamp_created": 1500283752, "timestamp_updated": 1500283752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33594835": {"recommendationid": "33594835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063580718", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517725345}, "language": "english", "review": "As a huge fan of Power Rangers, and I mean a HUGE fan, I love this game. It has so many jokes, references, and fun packed in to this great indie title. This is not just \"inspired by Power Rangers\", it's its soul. This is no \"Power Rangers\" game. THIS IS POWER RANGERS. And for that, I am so greatful. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and one of the best written. It is a masterpiece in that respect.\n\nAs it is in others. The gameplay, a short buisness management and crafting side pairs nicely with the more heavily present Mecha Fights (skill-based QTEs) and a Turn-Based Squad-Focused element, similar to XCOM, but not as complex. It is beautifully done. It is extremely well polished, and I have encountered little to no bugs on my runs through this game, and those present are fixed by hitting ESC and resuming.\n\nAside from gameplay, this game's Soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. Great variations from area to area, amazing use, as well as being catchy as hell and never gets old or grinding on the ears. The pixelated art style and an 8-bit inspired composition have been done before, but not as fantastically as done here, in my opinion.\n\nAny fan of Turn-Based RPGs, any fan of Power Rangers (or the Sentai), or any fan of a good game with kind devs and great content updates (for free) buy this game.

It\u2019s very easy on lower difficulty levels. Full game takes roughly 12 hours to finish.\n \n[h1] Review\t[/h1]\nYou oversee a group of actors as they film a knock off Power Rangers TV series and gain popularity. The main gameplay offers very basic turn based strategy battles where you fight monsters and power up for mech duels. Between filming episodes you organise your squad, buying and crafting new gear, reply to fan mail and activate bonuses with \u2018fan power\u2019 that is earned by completing goals in each episode.\nThe game has been updated recently. The mech battles have been changed to use timed button presses. They seem very easy but they aren\u2019t long so they don\u2019t become annoying.\n\tThe graphics are well designed with different sets and monsters. Each characters has a different class with unique abilities. However the fighting quickly becomes tedious, there is very little enemy variation or new mechanics, so virtually every battle plays the same. The main strategy is just to use your special abilities when possible. \nAlthough there is a story the player has little input so it lacks involvement. It focuses on the actors rather than the characters in the TV show. It fell flat for me because it was written for laughs but the jokes were too referential. I appreciate that the source material is not serious but I feel that focusing on each episode as a quest where you could make key choices would make each episode feel more unique.\n\tOverall it\u2019s decent but I don\u2019t recommend it at full price unless you want something to play without much thought required and don\u2019t mind repetitive battles.", "timestamp_created": 1499247892, "timestamp_updated": 1501772467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33265280": {"recommendationid": "33265280", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981107155", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498706455}, "language": "english", "review": "Like many reviewers, I received this game in a bundle. I did not specifically seek this game out but decided to give it a shot since I have many games sitting in my library. I do not believe this game is worthy of a $10-15 price tag. I have put in a few hours and have enjoyed the gameplay and story to a lesser extent, but it gets very repetitive in many ways and is quite shallow for the price they're asking. It's an XCOM style turn based combat system with quirky yet tiring dialogue and storyline. In recent episodes, I've found myself skipping through entire sections. The upgrade system doesn't do much for me as there seems to be very little consequence for playing poorly. Often times the director's instructions are tedious or just too easy.\n\nI cannot justify recommending this game.

The game also has very little fat to it - the whole thing from start to finish will run you between 8-12 hours. There's no need for grinding, which is great, because there isn't a convenient way to grind. So to that end everything requires strategy - every decision about marketing and team building matters because they're all permanent.\n\nIt would be incredibly difficult to have a fully decked out team by the end of the game, which is fine. The game is balanced well, and you can lower your difficulty at any point in the game.\n\nThe music is very nice, the graphics are vibrant, well animated, and have lots of variety. The camera zooms around a lot, so if you're prone to some kinds of motion sickness it could possibly set you off in story heavy chunks of the game.\n\nIf you do not like a dash of meta in your story telling - AVOID - this game's story is 100% meta. It's one of the first games I've ever played that has essentially no forth wall at all. It being SO abundant made it less grating than it can sometimes come across in games that rely on it a lot but not always. \n\nI didn't care for the mech battles. They're a little on the slow side.\n\nI feel this game has enough content that they could have stretched it a little further. While I appreciate that the game has very little padding, some optional bonus episodes within the seasons wouldn't have hurt. There are several monsters you only see once or twice, several backgrounds you only see a couple times, mechanics that don't get explored to the fullest they could be.

The idea of pandering each hero pandering to the audience by taking certain actions (along with \"dramatic\" optional objectives) to rack up points while you fight is great fun in concept, and breathes a bit of life into combat. The focus on using \"teamwork\" to launch people through the air and perform combo attacks is also very fun and helps sell the feel they're going for. Each party member feels very different and can be built several ways, and skills feel varied and useful. The humor is also top-notch and lends to a light-hearted but entertaining story.\n\nOther pluses: It's quite long and has multiple endings, and also multiple actors to pick from. There's also great music and good pixel art. And lots of good jokes.\n\nIt's not perfect though. The audience system, despite being a central mechanic, isn't fully explained in-game (specifically which actions each person can perform to earn points, what effect death has, how much director's instructions are worth, and whether the mecha battles affect it). On some particularly easy levels (or levels with nigh-impossible director instructions) it can also lead to you wasting turns farming audience to max it out (which could have been mitigated a lot if it told you how much each director instruction is worth).\n\nAlso, the difficulty curve is backwards; the first season is the hardest because you have very few skills, and in the last few missions your heroes are ridiculously durable if you have the best available equipment. It's probably balanced towards you NOT maxing out your audience every level, but perfectionists will almost always do that. Still doesn't keep it from being fun though.\n\nThose are small complaints though. By the time you notice those problems you should already be hooked.

Quienes acostumbramos a jugar RPGs t\u00e1cticos nos damos una idea de lo largos que pueden ser y lo complejos que son. Los gamers que preferimos este g\u00e9nero sabemos que ciertos mecanismos son vitales para mantener nuestro inter\u00e9s vivo en el juego. Jugu\u00e9 Final Fantasy Tactics, por ejemplo, dos o tres veces (quiz\u00e1s m\u00e1s de 100 horas en total). El primer Agarest lo jugu\u00e9, al menos, 120 horas (o lo que diga mi cuenta de Steam). He jugado Disgaea, Phantom Brave y Ogre Tactics (y tambi\u00e9n me veo tentado a incluir dos Suikodens, aunque son m\u00e1s RPG que t\u00e1cticos).\n\nEs un g\u00e9nero al que suelo tenerle cari\u00f1o por varios motivos: a diferencia de un RPG normal, un RPG t\u00e1ctico suele tener historias m\u00e1s maduras o complejas (traici\u00f3n, conspiraci\u00f3n, enfrentamiento a los dioses o reinos en guerra) y los personajes pueden crecer de maneras incre\u00edbles, lo cu\u00e1l hace m\u00e1s interesante y personal su desarrollo. Estos juegos suelen estar acompa\u00f1ados de dificultades y retos tan exigentes como una buena partida de ajedrez, lo que a veces lleva a un par de horas de frustraci\u00f3n, pero cuando el juego tiene buena historia te empujas a continuar hasta entender c\u00f3mo resolver alguna batalla.\n\nEl primer aspecto negativo va por el lado de la historia y el guion. Tiene algunos rasgos interesantes de metaficci\u00f3n y la estructura es atinada para hacernos dudar de la realidad, o el universo, de ficci\u00f3n adentro del juego; es imaginativo y crea capas de realidad que son interesantes (v\u00e9ase Mario 3, el cu\u00e1l hace un trabajo excepcional y sin una l\u00ednea de di\u00e1logo), pero la narrativa tiene errores de redacci\u00f3n \u2014incluso se atreven a convertir esto en una broma recurrente\u2014, varios de los cap\u00edtulos son forzados y abundan los lugares comunes. Entiendo el esp\u00edritu par\u00f3dico del juego, veo que respeta y se divierte con los show sentai, pero m\u00faltiples giros y chistes pudieron evitarse para dar pie a una historia un poco m\u00e1s rica.\n\nEn vez de hacer chistes sencillos sobre la traducci\u00f3n y un reiterado esfuerzo por romper la cuarta pared, el equipo de desarrollo pudo enfocar sus energ\u00edas en pulir la historia, mejorar la redacci\u00f3n general y buscar un sano balance entre la seriedad y la comedia. La historia es vital para un RPG, sobre todo un t\u00e1ctico. La narrativa es un mecanismo important\u00edsimo para que un espectador ceda horas de su vida a un juego como este.\n\nEl segundo aspecto negativo tiene algo que ver con el primero. No s\u00e9 exactamente c\u00f3mo propusieron las recompensas del kick starter, pero era demasiado evidente que agregaron varias batallas y personajes como una recompensa para quienes aportaran m\u00e1s dinero. Entiendo que esto puede parecer interesante y atractivo para los inversionistas, pero en el caso de Chroma Squad, en ciertos escenarios, ciertos personajes fortuitos, excusa para poner el nombre de alg\u00fan kickstarter, simplemente secuestraron el juego. Esto \u00faltimo, aunado a batallas repetitivas y sencillas (en dificultad mediana (o interesante, como lo llamaron los desarrolladores)) no ayudaron a cubrir la falta de recursos narrativos, al contrario, exhibieron todas sus debilidades. Consejo para cualquier creador en kickstarter: no permitan que su propia obra los sobrepase y no permitan que el buenaondismo se los coma y se robe lo que puede ser el trabajo de sus vidas. Quiz\u00e1s, lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, es no comprometer la obra.\n\nA pesar de los comentarios negativos del juego no pienso que sea malo.\n\nChroma Squad no tiene una gran dificultad, para nada, mor\u00ed una o dos veces y eso fue porque las mec\u00e1nicas del juego me parecieron demasiado amplias y me intimidaron. Apenas le mov\u00ed durante los primeros episodios (o batallas). Si mor\u00ed, fue porque no me hab\u00eda metido de lleno en los atributos y las posibilidades del juego. Eventualmente me anim\u00e9; una vez que te acostumbras a las opciones y navegas por todo lo que puedes hacer: producci\u00f3n, vestuarios, habilidades y actores, el juego se vuelve progresivamente m\u00e1s sencillo y mucho m\u00e1s interesante.\n\nEl aspecto de simular la producci\u00f3n es entretenido y enriquece el juego de maneras inesperadas pero tambi\u00e9n facilitan el juego muy r\u00e1pido. Las \u00fanicas batallas que realmente me emocionaron fueron las \u00faltimas dos o tres. Hubiera preferido algo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil pero tem\u00eda que si lo pon\u00eda en la dificultad m\u00e1s alta se pusiera perr\u00edsimo como suele suceder en un RPG T\u00e1ctico. Pienso jugarlo, en un futuro, en la dificultad m\u00e1s alta (los desarrolladores prometieron una actualizaci\u00f3n que agrega un modo de Nuevo Juego+). En total me tom\u00f3 unas 10-15 horas terminarlo.\n\nLos pixeles me parecieron divertidos, muy bien trabajados, la animaci\u00f3n en las capas de los h\u00e9roes, por ejemplo, me pon\u00edan de buenas. El dise\u00f1o de los villanos, por lo general par\u00f3dicos de varios g\u00e9neros televisivos, cultura pop, c\u00f3mics y de videojuegos, me encant\u00f3. Los minions cambian poco a lo largo de las temporadas y la historia, pero as\u00ed est\u00e1n bien, uno se familiariza con ellos y sus habilidades, y m\u00e1s o menos ya sabe qu\u00e9 esperar de ellos. La m\u00fasica y el sonido es excelente sobre todo los temas de entrada y de salida. Se nota que hay un gran equipo art\u00edstico y un buen trabajo de direcci\u00f3n atr\u00e1s del juego, por ello me cuesta mucho trabajo perdonar sus errores en cuanto a historia y narrativa.\n\nEl juego tiene varios finales y caminos, pero no recomiendo sacarlos todos de una sentada. En serio. A algunos quiz\u00e1s les importe este detalle, y normalmente a m\u00ed me llamar\u00eda la atenci\u00f3n y me animar\u00eda a dar la segunda vuelta, pero la calidad de su historia es tan err\u00e1tica que repelen mis ganas de dar la segunda vuelta.\n\n\u00bfRecomiendo Chroma Squad? Me cuesta trabajo recomendarlo a gente que adora los RPGs t\u00e1cticos dif\u00edciles. Chroma Squad definitivamente es m\u00e1s casual que los reyes del g\u00e9nero. En instantes construye escenarios agradables y graciosos, pero a veces es repetitivo y cae demasiado en el buenaondismo del kickstarter.

Time just escaped me while playing it.\n\nYou should know that I'm reviewing this from the perspective of someone who has never touched a tactical RPG in his life. I just like Super Sentai/Power Rangers and superhero games. I bought this on a whim and haven't regretted it since.\n\nThe game is fairly short. I beat it on Casual in less than a day and am probably 65 or so % of the way through my Normal mode playthrough about a day later. That said, the game warrants at least 3 replays due to the branching story which leads to multiple endings (not Mass Effect 3 style endings. REAL alternate endings). So far I've already encountered 2 brand new bosses and one new stage that I didn't play on my first time through during my second run.\n\nThe pixel art is really fun and doesn't take away from the experience at all. It runs like a dream and only takes about 5 minutes to download due to the small set of files. The music is very reminiscent of my Game Boy days and brings me back. It'll stick in your head in a good way and definitely helps you feel pride when you finish a really tough Megazord fight. The real selling point for me was the ability to fully customize your ranger team from what they shout when they morph to what they yell to summon the Megazord - you really feel like you're running a season of the show.\n\nA couple of negatives include an inability to undo accidental purchases in the in-game currency shop system. I have to quit without saving and go through buying everything again which can be a pain if I regret buying a certain piece of gear or crafting a certain item. You can't preview the stat changes on craftable items before making them which pushes you to do the quit without saving thing a decent amount on your first playthrough. The RNG side of Megazord fights basically makes them a big gamble as my stats don't seem to be doing me any favors in my second playthrough. It's also somewhat boring compared to the ranger parts of the game due to basically only having the choice of attacking or defending as your pray to RNGesus to bless your next move.\n\nOther than that, I can't praise this game more highly for fellow casual strategy game players. If you're more hardcore, you might find it too simplistic, but maybe the game's humor and charm can win you over into donating a few hours of your life to a little Power Rangers nostalgia.", "timestamp_created": 1494778412, "timestamp_updated": 1494778412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31739295": {"recommendationid": "31739295", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962908512", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494736075}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like stupid NRG games, i guess that your kind of game.", "timestamp_created": 1494736160, "timestamp_updated": 1494736160, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.324603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31732124": {"recommendationid": "31732124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166244058", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494704467}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "N\u00e3o \u00e9 um game perfeito, alguns problemas de c\u00e2mera, repeti\u00e7\u00f5es de formatos de niveis e coisas do tipo.

I'm not a power rangers/sentai fan, but I do like srpgs and I was pleasantly surprised by a lot of things in this game:\n\n+ The gameplay is simplistic but satisfying. Where you can sometimes have maps that last for ~30 minutes in a game like X-com or FF Tactics, it's not uncommon to find yourself done with a Chroma Squad map in about 15 minutes. This is great if you have that strategy itch but you don't want to commit a lot of time. \n\n+ The teamwork abilities are a very nice inclusion that offer some depth. There is a nice sense of risk/reward in choosing how you control your team - for example, do you throw a ranger across the field to take out an enemy, potentially leaving them too far out? Do you chromatize now, or wait until your actors' health bars drop significantly in order to take advantage of the full heal? These are things I caught myself thinking about before I committed to any actions. \n\n+ The presentation and story are charming enough, even though I found myself skipping through the cutscenes more often than not. \n\n+ Micro base-building feature that allows you to do things like respond to fanmail and improve the studio so that you can make the most out of your next battle. \n\n+ It's obvious that the developers loved making this game and there's always something to be said for that.\n\nThere are some really deep flaws, though:\n-The giant robot fight sequences. You trade out a decent-sized field for a setting similar to a really basic fighting game where your only options are to hope you click the right thing to defend (which only blocks a meager amount of damage) and hope your attacks keep hitting. Even if you lose this fight, there is a safe-guard that brings your health back to full, so I never really felt like these fights were as climactic as they probably should have been. Compared to the surprising depth you can get out of the field combat with the rangers, the giant robot fights feel really underwhelming and lazy. \n\n-Dumb boss fights. You can breeze through a set of interesting fights only to come across a season finale (aka boss) that can not only attack more frequently than half of your team -combined- but can also teleport or heal in addition to summon extra minions. These fights are sometimes difficult but always annoying. These fights come off as cheap ploy to increase difficulty rather than actually coax you into utilizing the best that your strategy has to offer. \n\nobligatory numerical rating: 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1492983914, "timestamp_updated": 1492984526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31308652": {"recommendationid": "31308652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001454789", "num_games_owned": 1490, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489164293}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is trying too hard to funny.

It doesn't help that it's almost impossible to pin down if the AI is just a little too good or just stupid enough to get lucky too often.

The teamwork mechanic is a simple concept that opens a lot of choices and suits well with the game genre and setting. Each character has a different role on the team and can be customizable from the name, looks, traits, abilities and equipment, making room for multiple play-styles and different tactics which make the game fell fresh and new as it proceeds. Fans of Sentai (A.K.A. Power Rangers-like shows) will be pleased to see that transforming into your Power Suit and gigantic Mech Battles actually play a role in the game.\n\n\tAesthetically the game makes use of Pixel Art with vibrant colors that suits with the lighthearted tone of Chroma Squad. The sound design is spot on with a great Sentai themed main song and a happy chiptune music that fuses together with the game\u2019s vibe. The bosses are really interesting both in abilities and design and also very silly (like the giant pigeon with macho arms) but the minions do start to get a little repetitive specially as they get recycled as stronger versions with a different color scheme. \n\n\tThe plot is not very forward thriving but it does have some intrigue right from the start and it is a fun setup for the rest of the game. You will most certainly have some good laughs with Chroma Squad as long as you are ready to read through the characters\u2019 dialogues. Although the game is very smartly written, it may sometimes become boresome as the scripted events drag on. As mentioned the game has a very lighthearted tone and it doesn't take itself too seriously which is actually connected to the main story. \n\n\u2022 Final thoughts\n\n\tChroma Squad is a game that excels in the strategic battle gameplay with great, fun core mechanics and offers other pleasant side activities like the Mech Battles, Crafting and Studio Management which make the game flow fell fresh and non-repetitive. The direction of the story may seem a little odd sometimes as the silly, lighthearted, \u201cnot taking itself too serious\u201d plot develops but it is a game that I recommend, specially for those who enjoy a really good squad strategy turn-based game.", "timestamp_created": 1492530613, "timestamp_updated": 1492530613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31183210": {"recommendationid": "31183210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080127403", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519689754}, "language": "english", "review": "An all around good experience.

En este juego tendremos la oportunidad de crear nuestro propio estudio de televisi\u00f3n que podemos  ir mejorando para hacer mejores episodios en cada temporada. \n\nAlgo destacable de este titulo es que no solo nos permite tener batallas estrat\u00e9gicas al propio estilo de un Fire Emblem, si no que nos permite tener nuestro propio robot gigante o Giant Mecha como quieran llamarlo, con un entretenido sistema de combate por turnos y con diferentes habilidades que podemos ir desbloqueando mientras lo vayamos mejorando.\n\nMe gusto mucho las referencias de este, ya de por si esta inspirado en los Power Rangers por lo cual se puede esperar que hayan muchas referencias a la serie de televisi\u00f3n como los combates con el Mecha y Cerebro, pero podemos encontrar algunas referencias como lo son: Correos Electr\u00f3nicos de un tal Spider Boy al cual Nick no quiso invitar a su fiesta, un dinosaurio con una escopeta que se esconde en un traje de alguien llamado Barni y hasta desarrolladores del titulo dici\u00e9ndonos que tengamos cuidado con un jefe que tiene errores de programaci\u00f3n. \n\nUna historia muy, muy pero muy entretenida con una narrativa muy curiosa llena de referencias a la Cultura Pop con jefes cuanto menos curiosos.\n\nEste titulo cuenta con tres finales distintos, si hemos jugado t\u00edtulos como The Stanley Parable vamos a saber donde esta uno de esos finales Narrador: *gui\u00f1o, gui\u00f1o*.\n\nAlgo que llamo mucho mi atenci\u00f3n fueron los cr\u00e9ditos, muchos se preguntaran como es eso posible ya que solo son simples cr\u00e9ditos y ya, pues no, Chroma Squad es una excepci\u00f3n, debido a que todos los cr\u00e9ditos est\u00e1n acompa\u00f1ados de el maravilloso Soundtrack que contiene este titulo, que para ser un indie esta muy bien hecho. Los primeros minutos de los cr\u00e9ditos solo vemos algunos de los jefes que hemos derrotado y otros que no, mientras pasan los nombres de los desarrolladores, la sorpresa es que cuando estan a punto de terminar empiezan a salir cientos de nombres de la A hasta la Z de todas aquellas personas que apoyaron en Kickstarter, tal vez tu nombre este ah\u00ed, compruebalo.\n\nPara finalizar, un Soundtrack memorable y muy bueno, una gr\u00e1ficas estilo Pixel Graphics muy bonitas a la vista y una historia muy llena de referencias a la Cultura Pop. Tal vez podr\u00eda hablar mas de este titulo pero es mejor dejarlo hasta aqu\u00ed y que lo descubras por tu cuenta.\n\nEste titulo puede ser adquirido en ofertas con el 70% de descuento a unos 4.49$ o 45 Pesos Mexicanos.\n\n10/10 Pru\u00e9balo, s\u00e9 que te va a encantar. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1491675673, "timestamp_updated": 1491675673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596109", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30995162": {"recommendationid": "30995162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975634553", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491563218}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a game for me. Reasons off the top of my head:\n\n- Story, while ok for a short joke, is extremely boring and clich\u00e9 for a long game. The conversations between the team members really don't help; \"I am not good enough\" -- \"you are an important team member and we all love you\" -- \"I now know I am good enough\" is just infantile writing.\n- Mecha fighting is trivial with one repeated QTE that is just annoying. Yet is still a gear check, so if you were silly enough to not upgrade your mecha a lot in the start, you can get to impossible fights.\n- Fighting with your team is reasonably varied, but gets very repetetive after you get far enough into the game.\n- Fight setup is sloooooooow. Monsters arrive one at a time when fighting is about to start, and later stages have up to 20-25 monsters slowly jumping in and moving into place. Doesn't help when certain fights also do similar summoning of mobs/mines/etc. during them.\n- Cutscene skipping is not a thing. At best you can fast forward (much too slowly), while the screen shakes, which quite frankly is annoying after the first time you use it.\n- Studio upgrades (base upgrades, essentially) are not interesting and by mid-game there aren't any more new ones.\n- Crafting, while interesting, has the very big weak point, that you buy upgrade packs with random items in it, which makes getting specific items annoying. Also, one item for mecha upgrades can only be found in mid-level fights (and certain one-off event), which makes getting specific upgrades for your mecha impossible once you use the last of that item and move on to higher level fights.\n- I wish games would stop using the method of slowly typing spech one letter at a time for dialogue. Reading is not done by reading each letter and then building the word, it's based on recognizing the entire word and understanding what word it is, which is why you can read text even when all but the first and last letter have been jumbled up. Also, most people can read much faster than what games devs set the speech speed to.\n\nI would not recommend this unless you honestly truly love power rangers in the way that bronies love my little pony; the joke setting really doesn't work for a long game and the core gameplay is not strong enough to make up for it.", "timestamp_created": 1491564194, "timestamp_updated": 1497357530, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30987446": {"recommendationid": "30987446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043728484", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493581448}, "language": "english", "review": "Was able to make JoJo characters.\n\n10/10 best game.", "timestamp_created": 1491518242, "timestamp_updated": 1491518242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695631", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30983156": {"recommendationid": "30983156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340257937", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480635837}, "language": "english", "review": "Chroma Squad is a nicotine patch for everyone reeling after the deaths of both comedy games and tactical RPG's, the strong writing parodying power rangers almost surprisingly well especially for anyone who grew up with the show and the game balance make the game consistently enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1491500427, "timestamp_updated": 1491500427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30979548": {"recommendationid": "30979548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063048114", "num_games_owned": 2872, "num_reviews": 540, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491552838}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you love Power Rangers??\nOf course you do!\nThis took me back for not less than 20 years...

Its a unique game that uses props as armors and weapons, its because the story is involving a movie studio. What I like about this game is a mecha fight or megazord fight. No problem with optimization, game run flawlessly, but it lacks of graphic options. \n\nPros:\n- Mecha fight, standard fight, 1 on 1, basically just hitting a def, atk, or skill button. Its repetitive, but still is a unique concept.\n- Power ranger theme game, you can choose who will be the rangers from humans to dog. There are also space rangers that you can get when you pick certain choices in the game\n- Story is OK\n- Because the game is about making an episodic tv series, you can upgrade your studios, equipping your studios with new and high tech equipments, and ofc you can hire a marketing team, each team has their own perks, to activate these perks you need fans, yep sacrificing your innocent fans to the devil to gain some bonuses. You can gain fans in battle, every action you do will grant you a small amount of fans, you get more if you can fulfill the director's mission (sort of side objectives) everytime you go to do missions.\n- Finishing move, there are 2 finishing moves here, both of them are executed by positioning your rangers around the enemy and use Teamwork command to finish their turn and the last ranger has to attack the enemy. Pretty neat. \n- Crafting system, you can craft weapons, armours and robot parts. Fortunately, you can buy materials from the crafting shop, but its randomize though. And unfortunately, you cant grind money or materials in this game. Its kinda hard when doing the challenging difficulty because of this. \n\nCons:\n- Graphic is bad, really bad. Because of lack graphic options, my rangers has become square rangers. \n- The weapon I equipped to my rangers are useless aside from the skills attack. I dont know why the dev decided that any equipped weapons cant be used to attack the enemies, but can use their skills. I dont know if its a lack of animation or this is how the game designed the game\n- Battle system is too simple and unpolished, aside from skill attack from weapons and from level up, there is nothing more. So, battle will become boring after a while.And because I cant grind materials or money, with no means to upgrade your characters, I had a bad time a few times on challenging difficulty. \n\nIts not a bad game nor a great game, its OK game. So, I dont recommend this game. If you are a power ranger fan, you're good. If you're a casual, stay away.

Tactics RPGs can be hard to get into because they're often 100+ hour epics with large numbers of characters, classes, and items to sort through; Chroma Squad strips away a lot of that to create a tactics RPG that doesn't require the same level of commitment, while keeping enough elements to maintain a certain level of strategic depth. \n\nFor the most part, beating the missions is relatively easy - the tricky part is usually trying to fulfill the optional objections to maximize your audience. This worked pretty well as a way of challenging the player without punishing them too much for the occasional failure. Unfortunately, the giant mecha fights are more difficult and rely fairly heavily on luck.\n\nThe character statistics are pretty straightforward, but some of the global boosts aren't as clear as I'd like. For example, how much is +10 Drop Rate? I guess the base Drop Rate is 100, but it doesn't seem to say that anywhere. +2 Fan Conversion Rate and +25% Crafting Rate are similarly unclear.\n\nFortunately, most of these concerns do little to take away from the game's solid core.

It's a very funny game, much deeper than I expected (30h + on it), and overall it's very well done. \n\nYou start with 5 stunt men, from a Power Rangers alike TV show, that get tired of doing all the hard work of the show and getting none of the credits, so they decide to create their own show where they can be the leading actors too. I won't talk about the rest of the story because that would be a spoiler. \n\nThe combat is turn based, like XCOM or The Banner Saga. When you are not fighting, you are running the show and you have to deal with TV ratings, marketing, season budgets, etc. At the beginning it will be a very crappy and low-budget show, and it will be up to you to improve it.\n\nThe 95% of positive reviews are a good indicator of the quality of this Brazilian game funded through a kickstarter campaign. It's an homage to the Power Rangers / Super Sentai kind of shows from the 90's, so you'll probably find it more interesting if you were a kid during that time. \n\nThe key feature of this game it's his humor. They managed to pay an homage but yet at the same time they mock every single clich\u00e9 from those shows. The acrobatic jumps, the different colors of each fighter, the giant robots (Mechas) at the end of each episode, and much more, it's all there.

But I don't think that's really required here to appreciate that this game is a love letter to cheesy TV and all the fun people have had with it. Everything in this game is so goofy and so fourth wall breaking wink wink, but it's done in a way I found really charming and sweet, as opposed to, say, Retro City Rampage which just bashed you over the head with how funny it thought it was every 5 seconds (hot tip: it wasn't).\n\nThere are about five million of these faux-16 bit games now, but here is one that actually uses that effect correctly and accurately. The target audience for this game is, at least in part, people like me that actually remember when 16-bit was real and spectacular, and tactics RPG's were just an emerging thing. There's just enough depth here to be interesting without being something overwhelming to work out, both in terms of the combat and the crafting system. The gimmick with the game is you are playing a fight scene in each episode of the show, and you can get bonuses for fulfilling director's instructions, things like \"kill three enemies on a turn\" or \"use team attacks 4 times\", these add enough spice for completionist types without, technically, being neccessary to advance the game.\n\nThe game isn't flawless, I hit a couple annoying but inconsequential bugs (there's an annoying one with one of the Space Sherrifs where his finisher doesn't actually count as a finisher). There are a couple spelling errors that aren't part of the on-purpose narrator gag (breath/breathe mixup happened at least twice). And I really, really wish this game had saving mid-chapter.\n\nBut on the whole, I had way more fun with this than I could have ever anticipated. It's cute, almost disgustingly so. But not quite. I got this in the Humble Freedom Bundle which was so large it was inevitable there were several indie games I'd never heard of there. This was the first of those I tried becaue the premise of \"some stuntmen quit a TV show to start their own knockoff\" is a hilarious, great premise.

There are some things that feel like i don't understand an in-joke, but i never really watched a lot of power rangers, so that might be the reason for that. \n\nThe combat is complex enough in the later stages, but sadly a bit stale in the early game, as you both gain additional abilities throughout the game at a rather slow pace, and additional enemy types take a while to appear. It is pretty accessable due to that early simplicity, but it can drag on for a while. There are some customisation options in gear and skill selection which feel relevant, and the optional objectives can be fun. \n\nThe Mecha fights are pretty annoying. They are usually either impossible (If you didn't invest enough material into your mecha) or boring (If you have invested enough), and they don't really involve a lot of interesting decision-making.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing.\n\nOverall, i can definitively recommend the game, i am having fun and have nearly finished it now.

Maybe all the words are in the right places because the teacher helped them out a bit, and maybe their spelling's all been fixed with red pen, but the story still reads like a grocery list?\n\nThat's Chroma Squad. That's Chroma Squad in its excruciating, every-mission-is-a-plot-mission tedium.\n\nThis would be tolerable, I guess, but the gameplay is boring too. Even on the hardest difficulty, missions just take longer to clear, and most of that time is hammering away at putties waiting for something to actually threaten you.\n\nThere's a whole resource management/business sim back end to the game and that, at least, isn't boring, but it's grindy and obnoxious instead. You try to farm enough resources to craft new gear while deploying advertising bonuses to get new fans and increase revenue from viewership, while pumping your stats with a few small global bonuses, so that you can quickly and efficiently win the next mission with lots of style and max out your money gain.\n\nThat's not awful, but it ends with you playing the mission, which is.\n\nIf you liked Knights of Pen and Paper, you'll like this. It's a time-waster with bright colors and a surprisingly pleasant soundtrack.

I liked the premise and got my hands on the game, but didn't feel the pressure to try and play it for a while. \n\nI have finally decided to give it a shot, and I honestly can't say that I regret that decision. The game is a tactical RPG with minor management elements - you control a squad of five (and later - six) characters, who will fight against sets of enemy minions and bosses. I am not going to discuss a premise, because it is very clearly stated in the description. \n\nWhat I will say, that gameplay-wise, the game is pretty good at what it does. Game is split in two phases - episodes (which consist of combat) and studio management. The combat system is simple, but enjoyable - your characters can use simple melee attacks, weapons and their abilities. There is also a teamwork system, which allows you to attack with a few characters at the same time. In some episodes you also get control of special characters which have some unique abilities of their own. \nThe management part of the game is less robust and in many ways confusing. You can craft equipment for your squad, you can upgrade studio equipment which comes with different bonuses, and you can choose a marketing agency, which also provides you with a set of benefits based on your fans. That part of it all is, however, fairly simplistic and lacks any real depth.\n\nThe game makes good use of it's theme, and most of the game is enjoyably cheesy. If that's something you are not into, you will probably not enjoy your time with Chroma Squad. It does also take a bizzare twist half way through, but it only adds to the experience in my opinion. \nThere is a single place where the story diverges. It isn't a huge difference, honestly, and happens very late into the game. If you are going to unlock all the achievements, you will have to play through the game three times - and about 80% of each playthrough is going to be identical, sadly.\n\nThere are some minor issues that I have with the game. The mech combat is extremely repetitive, and if you are planning on finishing up the game in short period of time (I personally did last 2 seasons in one sitting), you will have to do A LOT of mech fighting. A system which is a cool idea, but execution of it is rather lackluster, and you will always be doing the same thing. No matter who you are fighting, the enemy will always have the same pattern - either three basic attacks or one large attack. You just sit there and click the same button time after time, hoping for RNG to work out for you. \nAnother issue right now is the scarcity of information - or at least information which is not being presented in a clear way. There are some terms thrown around without much explanation at all, and at other times information that you could need at any given time is not given to you in the right place. Sure, you could remember it - but you shouldn't have to. I didn't realise you could read buffs and debuffs on your enemy until the last season, because of how unintuitive it is.  \n\nWhile the game has it's flaws, I would still recommend it. There is nothing that actively makes it less fun - the mech combat is a bit of a drag, and management could use more work, but the episodes themselves, with turn-based combat and abilities to use, can be really fun. \nIt's a small and enjoyable experience overall.", "timestamp_created": 1486206169, "timestamp_updated": 1486206169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29679230": {"recommendationid": "29679230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242158832", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517434675}, "language": "english", "review": "I do like the game, but I have some problems.\nOne problem is that I somehow can't delete a saved game, no matter how hard I try.", "timestamp_created": 1486160817, "timestamp_updated": 1489882354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29657446": {"recommendationid": "29657446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994000906", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 373, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479021288}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most retarded stories in gaming.

If you\u2019re not familiar with the sentai genre, it\u2019s basically costumed people doing goofy acrobatics and occasionally piloting giant robots to fight space monsters and other wacky stuff, and this game features all of that. You even get to name your team (I picked Colorblind Crusaders to be ironic) and can customize all of their catch phrases.\n\nEach of your team members has a role that defines how you will use them in combat. The scout typically runs ahead to stun groups of enemies or pick off individual monsters. Support heals and technician has a variety of useful skills and long distance attacks. Lead and Assault are for tanking and damage dealing respectively. All characters have their own skill tree that expands with new selectable skills every season.\n\nThis game features an assist system where a character ends their turn and becomes available for throwing other characters across the battlefield. If you put characters in assist mode while surrounding a monster and attack with a non-assist character, you will perform a team attack for additional damage. Finally, placing all five members of your squad in assist mode surrounding a monster initiates a special finishing move that does a lot of damage. \n\nA major underlying system in Chroma Squad is the audience meter. You gain audience by successfully completing levels. To keep things interesting, each level has director\u2019s instructions that are essentially mini-quests ranging from \u201cdefeat the monster with a finishing move\u201d or \u201cattack the monster with lead 5 times\u201d. Audience is turned into cash at the end of each episode and can be used with various marketing agencies to give your squad various different bonuses as well as additional cash. Cash is then used to buy armor or weapons or crafting materials to make specialized gear.\n\nIf I had to sum up Chroma Squad with one word it would probably be \u201ccozy\u201d, if only because of the soundtrack and overall graphic theme. Try listening to the OST on youtube and you\u2019ll see (or hear rather) what I mean. I really liked the simplified retro-look as well, it has sort of a late-era SNES feel to it which fits perfectly with the game\u2019s style. There are all sorts of little campy details like the characters doing different silly poses when they\u2019re the focus of conversation or the omnipresent recording crew following you to every single battle and staying just out of harm\u2019s way. \n\nAll of this comes with a nasty catch though; there are some significant performance issues in this game. My rig is capable of doing VR games no problem but I still had loads of framerate drops at random parts of the game. The good news about this is that it typically won\u2019t effect your playthrough due to the tactical nature of the game, but it will be a bit of a pain for giant robot fights where you have a QTE during the monster\u2019s turn that requires you to click at a precise time to defend.\n\nIf you are in to sentai-style stuff at all, you will probably love Chroma Squad. Even if you aren\u2019t though, this game is still fun for anyone who would enjoy a tactical rpg like Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics.\n", "timestamp_created": 1485731166, "timestamp_updated": 1485731166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29559748": {"recommendationid": "29559748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983086292", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485680969}, "language": "english", "review": "Good fun - 20+ hours of entertainment - def worth a playthrough", "timestamp_created": 1485681046, "timestamp_updated": 1485681046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29529286": {"recommendationid": "29529286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045102955", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485555032}, "language": "english", "review": "Good RTS that has a great Power Rangers nostalgia factor to it.

I really, really do. I'm a huge fan of Tokusatu shows and I love Power Rangers and Super Sentai. I also love strategy games, business managers and RPGs. This game is based off Power Rangers, is a strategy game and has business manager elements. Sounds like a combo made in heaven, right? Well...I've tried to play through it over 3 times now and every time I just get tired of it. It's not a bad game, really, but it reeks of poor design choices. \n\nBut I don't want it to seem like I hate the game, so lets talk about the positives of the game. \n\nThe game looks gorgeous. Pixel art sometimes feels lazy, but this game makes it look really nice. Sprites are put together nicely and are animated well. The maps in particular look sweet, I especially love the city block with the toy store map.  The pieces of gear you can craft also look great, most end game gear even looks like cool Power Ranger suits. The animations your characters do when they fight enemies are also done really well and just feel like they really connected. The sound effects really help in making every hit feel like it landed too. \n\nThe gameplay itself is also fun. It's simple, very simple, but fun. It's a basic SRPG affair. Units move across a grid map and punch enemies in the face. Some classes like the Tech Guy can hit enemies from afar and each class has their own skills to spice it up a bit. You only get 5 Rangers (missed opportunity for a dope 6th Ranger to join you), so the actual strategy element is a bit lite. \n\nNow for the bad...\n\nThe story...oh dear the writing. The writing in this game can range from just plain boring to borderline offensive statements that make no sense, but I want to avoid that can of worms so let's just talk about the other way the writing just isn't very good. \n\nFirst of all, the actual show you produce doesn't seem to have any sense of internal continuity with itself. You don't really see this unbelievably powerful alien king plotting his plan to take over earth in the show itself. That's like, a trait in Power Rangers since MMPR. Lord Zedd, Emperor Gruumm, Master Sledge etc, even the more fantasy ones had a similar antagonist. Almost every episode feels like a basic \"Monster of the Week\" episode. You only get to see the action elements of the show too, not the character development or world building Power Rangers is known for. The show you're running is boring and none of the episodes stand out. It's ironic because the actors you play as complain about the former show being all action and no substance. \n\nNext off, the monsters you fight all seem like jokes with no substance or personality. Yes, Power Rangers had silly looking villains (Diabolico still makes me chuckle), but most of them are still meant to be taken seriously, and to an extent, are. Some monsters in Power Rangers look downright [I]awesome[/i]. Lord Arcanon, Lord Zedd, Loki, Badussa, Koragg, Ransik, etc all look awesome and threatening. Meanwhile in Chroma Squad we get...that \"has science gone to far\" meme from a few years ago and a stop sign wizard...it's not very riveting. \n\nYour characters have no portraits for dialogue either, nor do they change expression at all, which makes the mood hard to read. It's hard to take a serious seeming role with a half naked boxer perpetually in a \"1-2 punch\" animation cycle. Those issues I listed, plus the fact that if you get down to it, the plot boils down to a basic \"leader who got full of himself and has to get back down to earth\" scenario (Man, Power Rangers SPD had that plot resolved in like, an episode...) that just isn't fun or interesting. \n\nWhen the plot actually does get going...it's just a typical villain arc with no flair or personality. The main bad guy is a joke in both literal and metaphorical senses. He has no menace to him. It's just a lady gaga parody. Imagine if we got someone like Lord Zedd, Octomus The Master, Emperor Gruumm or even King Mondo or Rita Repulsa to hijack the plot? That would've been 10 times more interesting then what we got. Heck, Power Rangers even had a similar villain to Lord Gaga named Heckyl...and they made him so much more interesting by giving him more depth then \"he's feminine and girly\". \n\nNow, the bad parts of the gameplay. The bosses just feel like they're tailored made to be as counter productive to a strategy game as possible. The first major boss teleports around every turn -- which makes gaining distance to regroup feel pointless, can scatter your units -- which makes positioning feel pointless, can attack multiple times per turn -- which is just mean and can stun your units -- which just removes an aspect of strategy. Not only that, but he constantly summons ranged units, which widdle you down while he attacks your units twice a turn. What makes this even worse is that you're healer in this game is borderline worthless. 1 heal per 5 turns? Are you serious?\n\nAnd it doesn't get better...Season 5 is where I always just give up. It's just not fun in the slightest at that point. Stage gimmicks become bull and enemies have way to much health. The fact that you can't save in episodes -- which can take up to an hour -- is just painful. Theirs no check points, once you feel an episode, that's GG, gotta re-do it unless you want those major drawbacks. What makes this even worse are the mech fights. Oh god the mech fights. The mech fights have literally no strategy to them at all. No extra skills, no items, no techniques, just \"punch\" and \"super move\". Winning or losing is based off your luck with RNG. \n\nCharacter customization is also plagued with RNG. Getting crafting items is based off enemy drops or you can buy them in the store (Money is painfully scarce, mind you), so getting that piece of gear you need is up to chance. You think your characters are under equipped? Just got to live with it, I guess. You can't re-do episodes and theirs no way to grind reliably. If you're doing bad with drops, you just have to deal with it. Because of this, my squad always feels so lopsided, with my frail healer and scout getting all the good gear to cover their bad defenses, while my fighter and Red Ranger lack behind. \n\nSpeaking of your squad. You can create your own Ranger squad with 5 classes. Pretty basic stuff, you got your Red Ranger, Blue Ranger, Black Ranger, Yellow Ranger and Pink Ranger, but you can customize the colors. Each has a different bonus and skill variety. My issue with this is the actual people you get for your Rangers. Most characters you pick just seem like jokes. I would've liked a variety of normal looking humans. In the words of the wise Zordon \"Alpha, Rita's escaped! Recruit a team of teenagers with attitude!\". \n\nThat's probably just a nitpick on my end, but I just wish this game took something serious, you know? Everything feels like a joke. The characters are jokes, the mentor character is a joke, the plot is a joke, the monsters are jokes, the main villain is a joke. Theirs nothing to take seriously, nothing to really get into. Power Rangers had silly moments, but was meant to be taken seriously. This is just nothing but a joke. It's not a funny one either.\n\nAll in all, this game isn't bad, but it lacks substance, balance, depth and just fun.", "timestamp_created": 1485450872, "timestamp_updated": 1485450872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500847", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29500912": {"recommendationid": "29500912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022343428", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491546691}, "language": "english", "review": "Take fire Emblem, add Power Rangers & you got a gem of a game!!\nChroma Squad is a must buy!", "timestamp_created": 1485434783, "timestamp_updated": 1485434783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29492521": {"recommendationid": "29492521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138954803", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431402541}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "excelente", "timestamp_created": 1485389774, "timestamp_updated": 1485389774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29492013": {"recommendationid": "29492013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100395221", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506220411}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of fun and funny :) But when you near the end it gets so hard but over all a AWSOME game ;)", "timestamp_created": 1485387054, "timestamp_updated": 1485594101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29485496": {"recommendationid": "29485496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159456053", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483095924}, "language": "french", "review": "C'\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t pas mal.

However, while I personally enjoyed the game, it has far too many issues and bugs. Behold Studios can do better.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n* [b]The Teamwork system[/b]\nThe core of the battle system is the Teamwork system. I overall really like it. During a character's turn, you can end it by selecting \"Teamwork\". That character can then do one of two things: A. Join another team member's attack on an enemy.  B. Throw another team member to a further space.\n\n* [b]You can fast forward through scenes by holding down Enter or Space[/b]\nA lot of games simply have a \"skip scene\" option, but that's a very binary choice. With fast forward, I can selectively skip through parts of scenes.\n\n* [b]Character models change as you change equipment[/b]\n- In a lot of RPG's, the character models are the same regardless of what you've equipped. In Chroma Squad, the characters look different depending on what you've equipped!\n\n* [b]Music[/b]\n- The background Studio music got stuck in my head. In a good way.\n- The music that plays in the Mecha battles is good and gives the appropriate feeling.\n- Japanese theme songs are great.\n\n* [b]Can choose the order you play Episodes in[/b]\n- Each Season, there are 5 to 6 Episodes. Except for the first and last Episode, you can choose which order you play the Episodes in.\n\n\n[h1]Mixed[/h1]\n* [b]Story branches based on your choices[/b]\n- Great to have branching\n- But the branching is simplistic. There's only [spoiler]one minor branch and one major branch[/spoiler]\n- If you want to see all 3 different endings, you have to replay from the beginning. And because the branching is so simplistic, you'll be mostly replaying the same content.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n* [b]Many game mechanics are not clearly explained.[/b]\n- What's Crafting Rate? Fan Conversion Rate? Income Conversion? Skill Regin? None of these are clearly explained by the game.\n- Some abilities boost Defense. Wait, how do I see my character's Defense stat? Well, you can't. They hid it.\n\n\n* [b]Difficult to plan character movement[/b]\nIn Chroma Squad, you'll often want to use Team Acrobatics to have one team member throw another to a further tile. But this is tough to plan and I was often off by one.\n- You don't get to see the member's throwing range until after you've already put them into Teamwork mode.\n- The grid is only explicitly drawn as you're moving a character. And it is only drawn covering the area that that member can cover. \nThe ability to undo actions that don't trigger RNG would be helpful. So you could undo movement or putting a member into Teamwork (exception: the Support class can heal neighboring members when put into Teamwork mode, which does trigger RNG). \n\n\n* [b]Crafting is problematic.[/b]\nYou can either buy equipment or craft it yourself. Crafting is neat in concept, but it has several issues:\n- The bought equipment is unique from the crafted equipment. You'll often be asking yourself whether you should buy Equipment B or craft Equipment C.  However, the Shop and Crafting screens are separate, so there is no direct way to compare the two. I found myself constantly jumping between the two screens. (And you can't jump directly between them. You have to back out to the main Studio screen first. Bleh.)\n- I generally found the Crafted equipment to be worse than the bought equipment.\n- Some crafted items get random properties, which are basically boosts to one of the stats. But there's no explanation of what to expect. If you get Health +10 is that a good roll or a bad roll? Also, sometimes your rolls can be for the same stat. I found that a bit surprising at first and wondered if the game maybe failed to give me one of my random properties.\n\n\n* [b]The story scenes have horribly slow pacing. Thank goodness you can fast-forward.[/b]\n- In many scenes, the enemies are shown appearing one... by... one...  by... one... Why? No one want to see that.\n- Do you like watching characters move across the screen with nothing happening?\n- There are significant pauses between characters saying lines\n- The fast forward system doesn't have an option to let you stop fast-forwarding at speech lines. That's what I really want. I want to read the dialog, but I don't want to have to wait through poorly choreagraphed scenes. \n\n\n* [b]Every mecha battle is the exact same[/b]\n- Every monster you fight behaves the same way. And so you never have to change your strategy in how to fight them.\n- The setting where you fight is always the exact same. (The game lampshades this, but that doesn't excuse it.) \n- This was a huge missed opportunity. Imagine monsters that attack in unique ways that require unique responses. Or unique environments that you can use as part of the fight.\n\n\n* [b]The final bad guy is a huge letdown.[/b] [spoiler]He simply just shows up at the very end. You've never seen him before. There's absolutely no connection to the character. That's a big story failure.[/spoiler]\n\n\n* [b]Tons of bugs[/b]\n- About 20+ minutes into the final battle, the game wouldn't advance. I had to restart from the beginning of the battle.\n\n- After finishing an Episode, I pressed escape while it was totalling how much Money and Fans I had earned. The game got in a messed up state and never gave me credit for the Money or Fans.\n\n- For a game that fails to explain its mechanics, it compounds this by showing incorrect information around those mechanics:\n-- The game often improperly calculates Expected Income. \n-- One Ad Agency gives you a bonus of 35 Fans per Episode. The game improperly shows that the Fan Conversion rate is increased by 35, instead of just a flat increase of 35 Fans.\n-- The game is often incorrect about the number of Fans and Money you earned the previous Episode\n\n- When defending in the Mecha battles, you basically have to time when you press your mouse. Unfortunately, this is exactly when the game would decide to stutter on me.\n\n- Sometimes a character is attacked offscreen and the camera doesn't move to show you what's happening.\n\n- If you click the upper right corner, you can submit a bug report, which is great. But, the form to report bugs has bugs!

And it's all tongue-in-cheek and very corny, just like the original Power Rangers. It's amazing to see the big Mecha fights against a giant enemy, or the exaggerated moves, or EXPLOSIONS!!\n\nThe game has a really cool battle system, it is somewhat basic, but still fun. You watch over the battle field and you can either move or attack an enemy, you also have skills you can activate and a teamwork mechanic, which I think it's really well done. But that's just when you're filming, when you are between shoots, you can manage and improve your studio and show, by buying or crafting clothes and weapons for your rangers and improvements for your mecha, purchasing new filming equipment, signing contracts with advertising agents, and answering fan mail. Everything is really creative and well done.\n\nThe game looks really good, it has a wonderful 32 bit style to it, and sometimes there's also a 90s TV filter in the studio management screen, which sets the tone pretty well, all the sprites are really well drawn, and the enemies design is also fantastic, especially the bosses, who are a ton of fun.\nThe music and sound effects though, those are the best part, in the title screen, the game has an Japanese opening music playing, which already sets the mood to the game, and the rest of the soundtrack, is really good and somewhat catchy, I love it!\n\nOverall, this game is great, I absolutely recommend it, it has the soul of the Power Rangers in it, with all the fun corniness the show had, the developers did a wonderful job!

El gui\u00f3n es entretenido y est\u00e1 muy bien traducido al castellano, con 3 finales distintos en funci\u00f3n de algunas decisiones que tomamos durante el juego.\n\nLa mec\u00e1nica es sencilla, siguiendo las pautas marcadas por el nuevo XCOM (1 movimiento + 1 acci\u00f3n, o 2 movimientos), con un \u00e9nfasis en la cooperaci\u00f3n entre personajes. Las habilidades est\u00e1n bien pensadas y se le saca juego a todas, a la vez que dejan claros los roles de cada uno de los integrantes del equipo.\n\nFalla un poco en los objetivos de misi\u00f3n, que siempre se reducen a \"Mata a todos los enemigos\" o \"Aguanta X turnos\" (que al final son b\u00e1sicamente lo mismo: Mata todo lo que puedas y procura no morir), aunque est\u00e1n las \"peticiones del director\" que a\u00f1aden objetivos secundarios mucho m\u00e1s espec\u00edficos y variados (gana en X turnos, no golpees al jefe hasta derrotar a los esbirros, realiza N ataques cooperativos, cura N puntos de salud...). En cierto modo es como los jueces del Final Fantasy Tactics, con la diferencia que no estamos obligados a seguirlos (aunque la recompensa de audiencia es importante).\n\nLos enemigos son variados en parte: Por un lado los jefes son muchos y muy diferentes entre ellos, por el otro los esbirros/masillas los hay de s\u00f3lo 4 tipos y no tienen apenas habilidades especiales, lo cual contribuye a que no haya demasiada variedad en la estrategia a seguir para las misiones.\n\nDespu\u00e9s tenemos los combates entre Kaijus, con nuestro Mecha gigante. Estos combates resultan bastante espectaculares y sus mec\u00e1nicas apenas son m\u00e1s que un Stat Check (intercambio de pu\u00f1etazos hasta que uno caiga), hay una ligera toma de decisiones respecto a qu\u00e9 habilidades usar y cuando dejar de golpear para defenderse, pero al final estas batallas se ganan en la tienda, no en el campo de batalla.\n\nEntre episodios, conseguiremos fans en funci\u00f3n de nuestra actuaci\u00f3n, lo cual nos da ganancias y nos permite obtener mejoras o m\u00e1s dinero a base de usar las agencias de publicidad. Tambi\u00e9n hay un sistema de crafting, aunque es bastante dif\u00edcil conseguir los objetos que buscamos as\u00ed que al final resulta un poco secundario (se pueden comprar objetos en la tienda con dinero).\n\nRespecto a la dificultad, lo jugu\u00e9 en la m\u00e1xima disponible y por lo que veo en los n\u00fameros creo que es la m\u00e1s adecuada (en Normal los enemigos tienen casi la mitad de vida y hacen la mitad de da\u00f1o). No fue un paseo pero tampoco result\u00f3 especialmente dif\u00edcil, tan s\u00f3lo tuve que repetir una misi\u00f3n y una batalla de Kaijus.\n\nEl soporte con mando es regulero (manejas el cursor del rat\u00f3n con el stick), mucho m\u00e1s recomendado un rat\u00f3n o un Steam Controller.\n\nEn resumen, un juego de estrategia muy recomendable, ameno y con buena ambientaci\u00f3n.

I started on \"interesting\" as a difficulty setting as I've played plenty of tactical rpgs. And, boy, did Chroma Squad deliver an enjoyable experience. Not accounting for times when I left to get food in my bidge-play of this game, you can complete it within a reasonable 10-12 hours, even faster if you skip the dialog on replays. \n\nBut onto the important stuff, what was good?\n+ Customization of characters, studio, and your OMEGA SUPREME mech. (eh, couldn't help it). \n+ Storyline does develop overtime but is slow in the first season.\n+ Multiple endings\n+ Quirky narrator\n+ Crafting options for your squad and your mech\n+ High level of detail (clouds hang from strings, cardboard backdrops, etc).\n+ Multitude of bosses\n+ Required episodes of annoying red leader being an annoying red leader\n+ Character development(?), some people have stated that they didn't think the characters were developed enough, but I think part of that has to deal with being involved with your squad. By the end of the game I new what each team member's personality was, their flaws, and dislikes. (I.e. overzealous, not liking violence, etc). To get more out of the game maybe name rangers after friends or read the dialog out loud (oh, what a concept) to bring more life to them. Regardless I thought the charactization was good. \n\nStuff I wished there was more of: \n- More characters to choose from. I'm on my third playthrough of the game and I do have favorites that I like to use, but there are other characters available that don't work well for the \"challenge\" level of difficulty where you need to spend money and upgrades for the studio and characters wisely.  This is not to complain about the difficulty, I think it is fine, but more characters would add more variety and depth to playthroughs. \n- Possibly less marketing partners.I know I just said I want more variety, but sometimes there can be too much of a good thing. I honestly only used 2-3 depending on my need for the episode. More options for other sections of the game could have been prioritized more instead. \n- Side-characters. I include this lightly as Chroma Squad does pay homage to other rangers coming to save our would be heroes by introducing different characters throughout different episodes, but some of them fall to the way side and don't re-appear (besides when you make choices that cause that to happen).\n\nIf it were a perfect world:\nKeep in mind that this development team has been wanting to add more to Chroma Squad but, has been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense due to licensing agreements with the Power Rangers franchise.

It was heavily influenced by various Tokusatsu series, two of the chief inspirations being Saban's Power Rangers and Shotaro Ishinomori's Kamen Rider.\n\n[h1]Go Go [strike]Power[/strike] Rangers![/h1]\nFive professional stuntmen who've grown tired of the poor production values and tyranical director of their current television series decide to uproot and take their talent elsewhere. Soon after impulsively deciding to leave, the group begins developing an original Sentai series, and must work through a myriad of problems to ensure that the series is successful.\n\n[h1]Out of the frying pan, into the casting department.[/h1]\nBefore the game rears into action, the player is given several options to tailor their experience: A choice between three difficulty settings, helping to accommodate players of all skill levels; selecting your squad and studio names, colors and transformation shout; and finally, designating the actors to the roles that you see fit.\n\nEach of those actors have unique bonuses, which help to determine how they'll influence the team for the better. Several of these bonuses are especially beneficial with a particular role, e.g.; Skill Regen for an Assist character to improve the rate at which they can heal the rest of the group. Some actors go so as far as to impose combat penalties on themselves, so that they can provide a heavy boost in another area.\n\nBranching paths are another feature that help to provide some elements of customization. The studio will occasionally receive an email with several options for replies. While most of these only lead to an audience bonus, others can provide weaponry that otherwise wouldn't be available. The largest branch in the game is accessed during one particular battle: depending on how one chooses to complete an objective, the game determines how the second half of the journey will play out. All of these add a great degree of value to subsequent plays.\n\n[h1]It's Morphin' Time!\u200b[/h1]\nThe foundation that the game is built upon is squad based combat, which plays out on a turn-by-turn basis in which the rangers move around on an isometric grid. The team use their varied skill sets to turn the tide of battle, in whatever way they can. Be they used for healing, or rapidly bursting down the health of nearby enemies, each member is prepared to put up a fight, whether they're alone, or working together. \n\nShould they choose the latter, teamwork is used as a mechanic that allow them to launch one another to distant locations, as well as attacking enemies as a group for higher damage. Still, sometimes even a team of powerful heroes need a little more help to defeat a daunting foe.\n\n[h1]Megazord, Eat Your Heart Out\u200b![/h1]\nAt times like these, our heroes call upon their Mecha to participate in Kaiju battles; essentially, giant robots fighting giant monsters. These also play out turn-by-turn, but here the objective is to create combos with your abilities, all the while paying close attention to a percentage representing you're likelihood of hitting the target. The significance of this is that combo-chains determine your damage multiplier, and missing an enemy breaks this chain, resets it to 0, and proceeds to the the next turn. While these sections aren't especially interesting on their own, they do add enough variety to keep the core gameplay relatively fresh.\n\n[h1]A Heartfelt Tribute\u200b[/h1]\nPersonally, I've never been particularly compatible with isometric tactics, as they tend to be very slow paced, without providing something that makes it feel necessary. That said, I found Chroma Squad to be a game that meaningfully improves the pace of the genre. Perhaps the kindest thing I can say about it in that regard is, while the gameplay is familiar, the time you spend in battle doesn't feel like it massively exceeds the amount of time allocated to plot and cutscenes, as it does in many tactical titles.\n\nAs a longtime enthusiast of the source material, Chroma Squad had an easy time getting through to me, as it shows an incredible amount of reverence for the style, and does a wonderful job of presenting it in a unique way. Going beyond that incredibly initial premise, there's an incredible amount of charm to be found here. From the moment you launch the game, the main theme mimics the vocal styling of many classic Tokusatsu themes, and perfectly sets the tone for the adventure. Something as simple as skipping through cutscenes is done as though someone was fast forwarding through a VHS tape, showing an immense amount of character for something that otherwise wouldn't be noteworthy in the slightest. Here we have an incredibly quirky game that makes for a very engaging experience and is absolutely worth the price of admission.\n\n[b]Time Spent: [/b]132 Hours (Average game length: 15 hours.)\n[b]Further Playing:[/b] Fire Emblem: Awakening (3DS), XCOM: Enemy Within (Windows, OS X, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360)", "timestamp_created": 1483781253, "timestamp_updated": 1507005560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29075476": {"recommendationid": "29075476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029249690", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483828157}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un delirio muy bueno!! \nUn gran homenaje a las series clasicas de super sentais de los a\u00f1os 90!\n\nre contra recomendado!", "timestamp_created": 1483753332, "timestamp_updated": 1483753332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29075068": {"recommendationid": "29075068", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960587588", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483751803}, "language": "english", "review": "Great tactics game, full of funny references to old classics.", "timestamp_created": 1483751859, "timestamp_updated": 1483751859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29074188": {"recommendationid": "29074188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054304779", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483748120}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

It's self aware, funny, and one big homage to sentai, while playing like Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea in combat, and like nothing I have ever played in the management aspects.\n\nPros:  Combat.  You have team attacks, acrobatics, heals, buffs, stuns, and special attacks.  The studio management stuff seems a bit overwhelming at first, but you get used to it.  You can use marketing to increase your income, buff the actors in combat, increase your fanbase, etc.  You can choose to make all your costume pieces, or buy them instead, while getting rare items during episodes (missions).\n\nCons:  Might be a relatively short playtime.  I'm at 12 hours now, and that's just because I screwed up my first playthrough and wanted a fresh start, might have 4 more hours of play left.  Aside from the first few missions you get, and some emails you read in game, you kinda have to learn a lot of stuff on your own.  I'll give you an example, the game teaches you if you get all 5 actors next to an enemy, have 4 locked into team action, and then attack with the last, you'll get a finishing move.  What the game didn't teach me and I found on my own, you can have some attack from afar with others in range of the target, and get a finishing move with a mega laser gun where all the actors merge their weapons together.  All that being said, these are still minor cons.\n\nI love this game and I recommend you get it if you enjoy some light to intermediate management gameplay and tactical rpg combat similar to Disgaea and FFTactics.  Also, if you like sentai and don't take it too seriously.  If you like playing these type of games on difficult, buy it no matter the price.  If you play on casual or normal (you'll probably finish a lot sooner), then I recommend waiting til its 10 or less.\n\nHave fun.", "timestamp_created": 1483584297, "timestamp_updated": 1483584297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29023678": {"recommendationid": "29023678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074201420", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452304179}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game.

The reason I think they are flawed is because the fights are extremely luck based. It doesn't have any strategy to it at all. It's pretty much, \"Am I feeling lucky enough to punch again with a 74% chance to hit and leave myself completely vulenerable if I miss and even if I do hit, am I feeling lucky enough to do it again with a now 64% chance to hit?\" You don't get to upgrade your mech very much either which just makes the upgrades extremely obselete the futher you go into the game. My mech is fully upgraded with the max studio buff giving an extra 15% health to my mech, but after 4th season, I have not been able to win any mech battle without failing at least once. the mech battles just seriously disappoint me because other than that there isn't really much to complain about aside from a few non-intrusive bugs and because of how good the rest of the game is, it just accentuates to terribleness of the mech battles.

I know!\nTL;DR\nChroma squad is a fantastic action startegy game with an in depth, self aware story. With a well written set of dialogue, and a surprisingly deep combat system Chroma Squad is sure to please strategy fans... even if you haven't seen power rangers!\n\n\n\n\n\nChroma Squad, in an depth action strategy game that never ceases to amaze me! With large a (and albeit, very obvious) inspiration from Sabans Power Ranger. Chroma Squad is a game that will make you want to relive your childhood... and at the same time want to destroy it. You see Chroma Squad's difficulty system can be changed on the fly for those of you who don't want to think... If you do enjoy a challenge however, play the game on hard mode (warning! PLAN ABOUT THREE STEPS AHEAD ON HARD). This game can, and will kick you in the rear so hard you won't remember what you planned to do afterwards.\nChroma Squad has a very (from what I have played) unique system called teamwork. This system allows your teamates to perform double, tiple, even quadruple attacks (similar fire emblem fates), but there is a catch... teamwork is the only way to use your finisher (a vital tool later on) , and can allow your team to move further on the set! Now you may be wondering what can make this game so difficult, IMO I believe Chroma Squad is one of the few games that got difficulty right. It doesn't just swarm you with hundreds of cheap, or extremely powerful enemies, atleast not in the beginning. Chroma Squad has a real sense of growth meaning that as you get stronger the game can and WILL adapt.\nMecha battles, this feature surprised me. when I had my first mecha battle I was pleasently surprised. Though simple the mecha battle can really make you question your \"startegic genius\" and really mke you pull your hair out if not careful.\n\n\n\n\nTo sum it up, this game seems very simple, and easy on your first run.

Some jokes might go way over your head if you don't watch Sentai series, but it doesn't ruin the experience. \nThe gameplay is really fun as well. The Final Fantasy Tactics-esque gameplay is a good point in my book, although it might get repetitive for some. The length of the game and the \"guest stars\" that appear from time to time make up for it, in my opinion.\nI think the visuals are really great, really digging the pixel art.\nThe soundtrack is superb.

Hierf\u00fcr gr\u00fcnden sie kurzum eine Produktionsfirma und fangen in einer alten Lagerhalle an eine eigene Serie zu produzieren und zu vermarkten.\n\nDeine Aufgabe wird es sein die Beliebtheit deiner Serie von Staffel zu Staffel zu garantieren, viele neue Fans zu bekommen und die Einschaltquote zu steigern. Dieses erreicht man, indem man Regieanweisungen durchf\u00fchrt, im Teamwork zusammenarbeitet, spezielle F\u00e4higkeiten benutzt oder einfach nur die Gegner umhaut.\nDein Team besteht aus 5 verschiedenen Schauspielern, die du Anfangs noch \u00e4ndern kannst. Jeder Schauspieler verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber Boni oder Mali, die durch ihre Filmrolle noch weiter spezialisiert werden. Schlussendlich hat man dann 5 Spezialisten mit unterschiedlichen F\u00e4higkeiten, \u00e4hnlich wie man es aus dem klassischen Rollenspielen kennt.\n\n\n[b]Aller Anfang ist schwer...[/b]\n\nDenn steht man zum Beginn des Spiels noch vor einigen Startproblemen. Das Studio ist klein, die Outfits und Requisiten bescheiden, von Marketing kann keine Rede sein und irgendwie fehlt es an Spezialeffekten.\n\n\n[b]Kommt Zeit, kommt Rat...[/b] \n\nIm weiteren Spielverlauf schaltet man zus\u00e4tzliche Funktionen f\u00fcr deine Produktionsfirma frei, die dir helfen werden, deine Serie noch erfolgreicher zu machen. \nEinerseits gestatten sie dir coolere Outfits und Requisiten herzustellen oder zu kaufen. Hergestellt wird nat\u00fcrlich stilecht mit Dingen wie Plastik, Klebeband, Glitzer etc., wie es sich halt f\u00fcr eine richtig trashige TV-Produktion geh\u00f6rt. Man kann allerdings auch einfach Outfits und Requisiten im Shop kaufen, dieser steht von Anfang an des Spiels zur Verf\u00fcgung. Diese Outfits wird man dann in einer spektakul\u00e4ren Squad Transformation anlegen, nachdem man innerhalb einer Folge genug Einschaltquoten gesammelt hat.\nAndererseits hat man das Marketing und die Abteilung Mecha, die dann in den ersten Folgen freigeschaltet werden. Das Marketing kann zum Beispiel f\u00fcr mehr Geld, bessere Einschalt-quoten oder mehr Fans sorgen. Geschenkt bekommt man nat\u00fcrlich nichts und um diese Erweiterungen freizuschalten musst du deine Fan-Power einsetzen, welche die Summe deiner Fans ist. \nMit der Mecha-Abteilung kommen dann die ultimativen Spezialeffekte hinzu. Das ist die Funktion, die dich deinen riesigen Kampfroboter modifizieren l\u00e4sst. Verbesserung werden auch hier, nat\u00fcrlich stilecht, anf\u00e4nglich mit Pappe und Klebeband hergestellt.\n\n\n[b]Die Folgen und Staffeln...[/b]\n\nDie Staffeln sind in Folgen unterteilt, wie man es aus TV-Serien kennt und folgen meistens dem gleichen Muster. Trashige Spr\u00fcche, Minions besiegen, Squad Transformation, Trashige Spr\u00fcche und den Boss besiegen. Gek\u00e4mpft wird rundenbasiert in einer isometrischen Perspektive. Sobald der Endboss der Folge besiegt wurde, folgt noch ein weiterer Bosskampf mit dem selben Boss, blo\u00df in seiner vergr\u00f6\u00dferten Form gegen euren Mecha. Dieser Kampf ist auch rundenbasiert, er-innert von seiner Aufmachung her aber eher an ein beat em up.\nDie Orte, an denen die einzelnen Folgen spielen, wiederholen sich ab und an, aber wie es scheint, war es wohl Absicht der Entwickler, denn es wird sich selbst ein klein wenig auf die Schippe genommen.\nMit der Beendigung der Staffel bekommen deine Serienhelden immer weiter Eigenschaften, deine Produktionsfirma mehr Geld und weitere Werbevertr\u00e4ge im Marketingbereich werden angeboten.\n\n\n[b]Klingt langweilig?![/b]\n\nIst aber dank der Story, die durchaus unterhaltsam ist und ein paar unerwartete Wendepunkte aufweist, auch mehrfach spielbar. Denn es gibt insgesamt 3 unterschiedliche Storyendings. Au\u00dferdem ist es auf dem einfachen Schwierigkeitsgrat ein Leichtes bis zum Ende der Story zu gelangen und bleibt dennoch bis zum Schluss eine spa\u00dfige Angelegenheit.\nDie verschiedenen Bosse und Minions mit ihren schr\u00e4gen Designs und die Gute-Laune-Musik tragen dazu bei, dass einem nicht langweilig wird. \n\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\n\nChroma Squad ist sicher nicht jedermanns Ding, aber f\u00fcr Liebhaber des Trashs, Kinder der 90er und Pixelromantiker durchaus ein Blick wert. Mich hatte vorab der Preis abgeschreckt, doch habe es dann g\u00fcnstig erworben und war sehr \u00fcberrascht von den Inhalten und der witzig gehalten Story, obwohl ich die Serie als Kind nie geschaut habe!

Each episode you play has optional objectives that when completed give you lots of fans(this is your way of making more money and getting better marketing perks). The first 3 seasons these were important to get as many as possible.

It even has choices you make by email which will give you either in game rewards, like money, fans, materials or weapons or just the satisfaction of responding to a fan or person in need. Some even choose what bosses you fight so you won\u2019t fight all the game\u2019s bosses in one play through.\n\n[*]The game even has 3 different endings where the last season of the game changes depending on your choice; you have different rangers you can pick at the start of the game (which you can name) along with the email choices above give a good replay value.\n\n[*]Now the TV show management side is very easy and isn\u2019t hard to understand. You have marketing team which you can pick from a lot with new ones each season offering different benefits, like more money, fans damage, item drop and more depending on who you pick. \n\n[*]You have crafting which is cool, offering more variety of armor and weapons that the shop doesn\u2019t have. The shop and items you craft are both viable with neither being the obvious op choice. \n\n[*]Next are the mech battles, you customize your mech by the 5 parts of the body (head, torso, 2 arms and legs). These you craft and once start leveling up your parts to high tier it\u2019s going to be hard to get the materials to swap if you want to. Now the battles themselves are simple, your main attack with every hit you gain a combo but lose in accuracy, so there is some luck involved there. You get abilities depending on the parts you picked for your mech. Overall these battles are short, flashy and fun to mix up the fights\n\n[*]I played the game on the middle difficulty and failed about 3 episodes (there is a penalty for doing this). So it\u2019s not that hard. Playing on the easy mode would be a cake walk if you\u2019re worried about how difficult the game is. The game even though it\u2019s simple does require planning and synergizing your team\u2019s abilities and timing when played on the higher difficulties\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1]My Score:[/h1]\n[b]A[/b]\n\n[b]Paid:Included in $1 Humble Bundle[/b]\n[b]Completed in:14 hours[/b]\n\nGames similar: \n[list]\n    [*]XCOM\n    [*]FTL\n    [*]Battle Brothers\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1480137882, "timestamp_updated": 1499433375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27583265": {"recommendationid": "27583265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106152056", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511482021}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "MUITO BOM !!!!", "timestamp_created": 1480126440, "timestamp_updated": 1480126440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27580693": {"recommendationid": "27580693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145869171", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468253597}, "language": "english", "review": "Chroma squad is a great nostalgia trip back to the good old days of power rangers and other sentai games, it contains fun and interesting enemies, a plot you would expect to find in power rangers but with a added twist that the heroes start off as stunt actors for a sentai show but eventually begin to make their own.", "timestamp_created": 1480124720, "timestamp_updated": 1480124720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27577639": {"recommendationid": "27577639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047225625", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491581396}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo muito bom, hist\u00f3ria interessante e a arte muito bonita", "timestamp_created": 1480122814, "timestamp_updated": 1480122814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27577127": {"recommendationid": "27577127", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975953805", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480122224}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed the humor of Behold Studios last game \"Knights of Pen & Paper\", you'll love Chroma Squad.

Every 'battle' is one episode, so you go through the setup and fundraising for the studio and costumes and such, and then enter filming, which is essentially the episode.  Failing to win the battle causes you to get bad ratings on your show.  \n\nIf you have positive feelings towards Power Rangers from your childhood, and you like lighter-side story centered RPG strategy games, you'd probably like this.  \n\nIts strong points are numerous; it has item crafting, a good story, challenging but not overly brutal strategy, combat is fun, good humor, likeable characters, nostalgia (without leaning on it too heavily), etc.\n\nWeak points might be that some mechanics can be a little tedious.  Kaiju battles never got boring for me (there's like 8 or so in the game) but they're all pretty similar.  Also, some people don't like pixel graphics, so if that's not your thing then move on.  Also, the game tries (and succeeds) in capturing the campy nature of power rangers style shows, so if that's going to make you cringe then you could consider it a weak feature.", "timestamp_created": 1480109449, "timestamp_updated": 1480109449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27544717": {"recommendationid": "27544717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254609395", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517866342}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Oq falar sobre Chroma Squad n\u00e9?\nEste jogo \u00e9 AWESOME!!!\nE o melhor de tudo....

I think it really helps if you're a fan of Super Sentai shows. Even a reasonable knowledge of Power Rangers will do. But even without that, I think what really shines through with this game is how self-referential a lot of the writing and humour is. Fake emails from viewers asking when the Kickstarter backers will get their copies, sidelong references to how similar all the enemies look, pokes at bad spell-checking of the narrator.\n\nAnd the pop-culture references go beyond Power Rangers. If you look closely enough, there are littered references and parodies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Teletubbies, Robocop - even The Devil's Advocate!\n\nBehind all this is an extremely solid and varied strategy game. Chroma Squad comes in for a lot of criticism for being shallow - and I think this was my first impression, too. The first \"season\" of the game provides very limited flexibility and differences between characters and especially on normal difficulty it's easy to simply punch your way through most battles. But the action is driven by the Director's Instructions which push you to complete battle with a certain style and a certain way, which makes a difference to audience size, fans and of course studio income. Characters get an additional ability slot unlocked per-season, so by the third or fourth set of missions it's possible to really customise your squad's abilities and maximise your performance. \n\nArguably the weakest element is the Kaiju fights, in which you take turns trading blows with a giant enemy. I personally like them and I think they're a really satisfying end to an episode, from a narrative point of view. BUT, if you choose upgrades which give you boosted attack and hit % then there really isn't much to do apart from gamble with the decreasing hit % and occasionally defend. However I recently went for a Mecha build which game me a choice of four special abilities to choose from and this gave me a lot of flexibility, expression and interest in these fights - but that route is optional, so the devs may want to consider what needs changing for these in - dare I wish!? - a sequel.\n\nBut it's definitely one of those games where I think \"ahh, one more episode\" and before I know it, it's two A.M. Really fun turn-based combat, great humour and stories and I love the low bit graphic style.", "timestamp_created": 1480081345, "timestamp_updated": 1480081968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27432513": {"recommendationid": "27432513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108461096", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521536184}, "language": "french", "review": "Un tr\u00e8s bon jeu sur le th\u00e8me des Super Sentai et des Power rangers. \u00e7a fait longtemps qu'on a pas eu de tr\u00e8s bon jeu depuis Mighty Morphin Power Rangers sur M\u00e9gadrive.

And guess whos back to make crap reviews. LET'S A GO:\n\nPostives:\n\nMusics pretty good, although if your expecting instruments, look somewhere else. Its Bit-Music, but its very catchy regardless.\n\nThe gameplay is Similar to Fire Emblem and whatnot. You have a few skills to choose from, and you get 5 classes:Lead,Tech,Scout,Support,and Strength. You can choose who has what role, and each character has Boosts, and disadvantages to some fields. \n\nThe story is similar to Power Rangers, execpt with a pretty decent twist at the end. Why would i say who it is? :3\n\nNot many glitches atleast that i saw, so its polished.\n\nNow for some Bads:\n\nGOOD LUCK. This game is HARD sometimes, brutal even. Some bosses are just ridiculous with how hard they are,dare i say unfair. Although this usually isint the case,so thats good.\n\nTammy is broken to hell n back, trust me.\n\nThe crafting system is a little meh, its hard to get the materieals you need for some stuff. Once you play a stage its gone, so thats why its difficult to say good about this. However you can get boxes of the materieals you need, but thats random with whatcha get.\n\nThe games Mecha battles,while you have a Crutch, are still sometimes INSANE with unfairness. Go watch NicoB's lets play for example. But heres one from me:Multiple times, i have missed the second punch. Its a luck-based thing, where the higher the combo,the lesser the chance of it hitting. There is nothing like this outside Mecha,so dont worry.\n\nThe upgrades to your studio should be a One-time buy, and not allways cutting into your paycheck. I belive thats how it works, but i could be wrong,it wasent explained very well.\n\nOverall,its a 4/5. (Its because theres 5 party members.

The plot is rather tongue-in-cheek and \"dorky,\" but with a fun tone and some pleasant music along the way. The gameplay is a bit like the Shadowrun turn-based strategy games on PC if those were all about melee combat instead of ranged. You might say \"oh, like Banner Saga?\" but I would reply \"No, this is actually kinda enjoyable, so it's not that much like Banner Saga.\" As with Shadowrun, you have abilities with cooldowns that give you a nice edge in combat, and the further into the game you get, the game shows you that there are higher tiers of skills to unlock, making things more interesting than just \"run over and punch a dude\" each turn.\n\nThe game has three difficulty levels: one intended to just get through the game without challenge, one to get through it with a little challenge, and a tough version. I played the middle of these three options and found it to be a nice experience that does a good job of teaching you the basics. In between missions (\"episodes\"), you can buy new equipment for your team, as well as upgrade your studio to incur running costs that give you bonus attitbutes on missions (worth it, from what I experienced).\n\nI personally lack the interest in the narrative and the gameplay hasn't fully hooked me in enough for me to want to really continue, but this game has the rare condition of being one I'm stopping playing that I would actually recommend. I could totally see myself playing it through to completion and liking it if I had more time to spend on games that don't pull me in strong. It commits no grave offenses against the player, seems well-balanced, has a lot of heart, and seems fully intended to be a fun and different experience for gamers.

Yes it is as good as that sounds to the ten year old inside you thats been bludgoned to near death by the cynical you of today.\n\nThe plot of the game is simple. Five stuntmen quit their job at a sentai tv series studio and decide to make their own. From there, the plot thickens in the same way watery milk turns into tasty cheese. In other words, the plot starts out weak, but gets stronger the further on you go, just don't expect anything other than pure cheesy sentai goodness.\n\nThe game is split into two parts, base management and combat. The base is your studio, from here you can buy new gear for your heros, craft new stuff for them, build new parts for your mecha, view your heros and change their equipment and abilities, upgrade the studio, check emails, and lastly, hire a sponsor. Upgrading your studio gives benefits in and out of combat, from HP boosts, to shop discounts. None of the upgrades are Game changing, but they are all useful. The sponsor however does change things up. Each sponsor can be hired, and you can only have one at a time. Each one offers various benefits, with additional benefits being added on top of those by spending fans (i can only assume its their tolerance your expending). These can have positives and negatives. for example, one of them will cost you alot of money each episode, but give you a big conversion boost. Overall, you want to check what kinds of episodes you'll be shooting during the season before you hire them on. The emails are also worth checking, as you make choices in them that can effect the game. some of them provide no options, others allow you to possibly change the plot or gain more fans and items.\n\nCombat is square grid tactical turn based. during your turn you can move and do one of four things with each individual hero. Attack, weapon attack, activate an ability, or engage teamwork mode. Each hero has an entirely different skill set and should be used appropriately. For example, the techie is good at long range combat and a solid support, while the lead is the guy you use to set up team moves. Each ability has a certain amount of cool down time, that can be decreased by using specific bits of equipment. Weapon attack is exactly what it says on the tin, your hero attacks with the weapon they have equipped instead of their fists. Certain weapons can only be used by certain cheracters, and once used they go on cool down. The ability to use teamwork abilities is what makes this game different from others. When you set a character into teamwork mode, their turn ends, but you can still move your other heros around. You can do three things with two team members when one of them is in teamwork mode. Joint attacks, acrobatics and joint weapon attacks. attacking an enemy that is next to hero in teamwork mode causes both of you to attack at once, causing a greater amount of damage. Weapon attacks do the same thing, but both characters must have their weapons off cool down in order to pull off. Acrobatics are a little different. Each character can only move a certain amount (unless you equip them with gear that increases the distance), but, they can extend the distance by being thrown, allowing them to reach beyond their movement. They do this by walking over to a hero in team mode and then getting thrown higher than a crack addict on a spring board.\n\nThe combat is simple at first, but after each season it gets more and more complex, adding on new abilities, new gear and new options at the base. This prevents it from getting stale, always adding in something fresh. \n\nVisually the game isn't all that impressive, certain areas are reused several times, the sprites aren't extremely detailed and you can really see each pixle. But, the number of different sprites there are for the heros is impressive, as it changes with each helmet you wear and each outfit you put on. There are in total about five basic enemy types, two of which get three different sprites. However, the game has alot of bosses, each one is rather different and challenging, save for a few who were rather lacking. The final bosses are really challenging and require you to really plan out your moves, they don't feel unfair though, more like a reward for getting that far, given how much fun they are to fight. The music of the game is limited to a few tracks, none of which are particularly memorable, but they aren't bad by any means and serve their purpose well enough.\n\nThe game does allow you to change the names of your characters, your studio, your mecha and pretty much everything else that your in game studio owns. Nothing felt better than seeing my dudes yell \"taste the rainbow motherfucker!\" before shooting a guy with a traffic cone on his head with a laser powered by crappy special effects and friendship. \n\nThat little moment sums up the game, its charming, and it allows you to add your own spin on it to an extent. Its obvious this game came from a place of love and it really does shine despite its flaws, the few complaints i have with it don't outweigh the number of good qualities this title has and i would recommend anyone who loved, or loves power rangers get this. Anyone who likes Xcom, but wants an easier experience, this is for you.

And Then Things Get Weird. The game itself plays out through 5 \"seasons,\" each containing 6 episodes - an opener, a closer, and 4 stages that can be done in any order. Each episode consists of one or more turn-based scenarios with several optional conditions - for example, your goal in a stage might be beating the boss, but you get a bonus if a particular character hits them every turn. People familiar with the Disgeae series will be pretty comfortable here. Outside of battles, you spend the income you earned thanks to your legions of adoring fans to buy upgrades for your studio, actors/costumes, and the mech suit, hire advertisers, and respond to fanmail. \n\nThe controls are nice and solid, though you will be occassionally frustrated that a throw doesn't pan out the way you want (the rules for when one person can assist another by catapulting them across the field aren't clear, though they are consistent). There are also a few occassions when there is a mechanic that isn't well explained - for example, during a giant mech/monster fight, your audience can save you if you run out of life - but nothing mentions this effect. \n\nThe graphics are fun and clear, with a pleasantly pixelated presentation, and while the results aren't exactly spectacular, they are very firmly in line with the source material.\n\nThe music and sound effects are pleasant if not particularly memorable.\n\nThe story is interesting, if incredibly silly, and not terribly written (or, rather, it's terribly written in the way sentia series are, so, good/bad writing). \n\nThere is some replay value - there is clearly a fair number of alternative routes to take, for example, and multiple levels of difficulty. I will certainly play through at least twice more.\n\nTLDR: 8/10 light fun turn based strategy with a solid sense of humor and a nice degree of self-awareness. It isn't trying to be an epic blockbuster AAA, and it certainly doesn't need to be.

Game is split up into episodes (where you do battle) and in between episodes you spend your cash/craft upgrades. It has a silly story with silly enemies and plot. Story is mostly told through dialogue so doesn't get very deep. A lot of 'just because' reasoning so you have to go with the flow. Things that happen outside dialogue are often just quickly summed up by the narrator to set the scene. Graphics are good enough and sound fits well.\n\nEpisodes are often split up into 1-3 tactics battle segments and sometimes finished off with a mecha battle. The tactics system is pretty standard and simple. There are only damage and status effects, no damage types (no physical vs magic attack, no elemental resistance/weakness). The mecha battle is a regular RPG slugfest where you take turns attacking each other. You can do multiple actions in your turn and each action builds up your combo meter (which increases the effect of your next action but decreases the accuracy). In normal mode, the enemy mecha usually just does 3 regular attacks one special attack. You reduce damage taken through a timing minigame (there's a bar that fills up, stop it at the right time and you block more damage).\n\nIt feels like you want mecha battles to be over as soon as possible so it feels better to go for as many 50%+ accuracy attacks as you can rather than ever defending. It seems like enemies usually do 3 attacks of ~5k damage each and defending (maybe unless you go for max defense) only blocks a total of ~5k of that. It feels like a race against the clock so the less turns you take to defeat the mecha, the less turns the enemy has to deal 15k+ damage.\n\nHowever, it does get a little frustrating when you miss your 2nd attack (~85% accuracy) twice in a row, which is brutal because of your missed damage output (especially if you're holding onto your finisher for a high combo) and it means you take free rounds of damage. But I guess that's why there's the mecha audience meter (DBZ spirit bomb-esque gathering the energy of your fans). When you lose all hp in a mecha fight, your hp meter refills with audience points (though losing hp from then on doesn't seem to affect audience score later). Assumably, the more fans you have the more HP you get.\n\nIn tactics battles, your performance is calculated by an audience meter which goes up through combat actions and by following the episode's director's instructions (which are bonus objectives like 'win in 5 turns' or 'keep all members above 50% health). In normal difficulty, clearing missions wasn't too hard but clearing them while following the director's instructions was sometimes pretty challenging. However, you don't need to do every instruction to max out your audience meter and it doesn't seem like failing them matters if you fill the meter anyway.\n\nBoss enemies sometimes have line attacks but they feel unpredictable. The attacks don't hit a standard grid-based area (not clean 45 degree directions) so it's more realistic but you can't tell what it'll hit. One boss has a burst aoe (starting from himself) that usually hits allies hidden behind other allies but there were rare times where it didn't (only the one in front got hit). Sometimes the cubes served as cover, sometimes his attack hit despite the cube being in the way. Maybe there is no such thing as cover and it just randomly misses without showing the 'miss' text. He burst twice in the same spot on one turn and hit 2 on the first and all 5 on the second.\n\nThe only real indicator I could see of how much damage you'd do is the enemy health bar (which shows how much remaining hp would be left after the attack). It can be a little tough to see if an attack really finishes it off or if there's a pixel left. It would've been nice to see an obvious indicator (like the bar turning gray) to show the attack should finish off the opponent.\n\nAlternatively, you could check your attack stat for how much damage you'd do (only for single attacks; I'm not sure how teamwork attacks affect damage).\n\nSeems to let you retry missions relatively easily (via abandon mission) so if you like to retry there's no need to quit/restart the game. If you don't, then you can personally choose to make your own hardcore mode by accepting whatever result you get. It's pretty nice for me because you go into episodes without knowing what you're really up against so you can abandon and customize/upgrade as necessary so you can beat the mission. Also, some director's instructions (mission goals) can be ruined by unfortunate events outside your control.\n\nIt allows you to fast forward through cutscenes which is very nice. However, it sometimes speeds through the first text bubble even when I didn't intentionally click or skip through. It may have captured a click several seconds before during a cutscene or something. It would be nice to also have animation speed options in settings to make quicken actions and be able to fast forward in-battle quips.\n\n[Side note: why is 'go' and 'fas' blocked by steam? Wanted to type 'go' and 'faster']\n\nOther thoughts:\n[list]\n[*] One tactic is to pull back and give a turn to let the enemies chase you, often clumping together for aoe skills.\n[*] Audience bonuses from marketing may not count towards the audience meter cap (meaning if you max out the meter it still counts as a bonus towards the cash/fan conversion). Would be nice to have that cleared up in-game.\n[*] Mostly polished but there are some quirks. Dialogue bubble gets cut off in one sewer scene, breath->breathe typo.\n[*] Seems like some e-mails don't deduct the right amount of cash? I know some options say they'll cost a certain amount but are reduced but those mention it in the reply.\n[*] At hotdog stand battle, it feels like there's a minion that comes in on the left side that doesn't get placed on the map?\n[*] When you have a flat +fan modifier at end of battle, it still shows as per 100 in the tooltip (you have +175 fans per episode but it shows as 175 fan conversion per 100 audience)\n[*] Seems like you're supposed to lose audience when a party member is downed but it either doesn't work properly (audience bar visually is reduced but actual number isn't) or there's a hidden buffer you get by overfilling the audience meter.\n[*] Seems like [spoiler]Tammy[/spoiler] is supposed to get into the mecha (and sometimes she teleports with the rest) but they didn't make a new cockpit image, still only 5 people.\n[*] Although normally fine, sometimes I had a little visual lag/frame skips when blocking in a mecha fight, making it hard to time blocks properly.\n[/list]\n\nWorth a try if you like the theme (a studio making episodes of Power Rangers) and are fine with simple tactics games. I don't think I would like it as much if it were a generic tactics game (the combat system isn't very deep) but I think they play up to the theme very well.

For me, Chroma Squad really shed a new light on what a modern pixelated video game can achieve. The title I\u2019m reviewing today is a far cry from your run-of-the-mill 2D Simulation Role Playing Game (SRPG, for short) since it incorporates a well planned economic component to it. You have to supervise  a team of stunt actors looking to promote their own studio and projects. And that is no easy task, given how cutthroat the show business is in general terms. You control everything from the production of the shows and even the advertising and human resources department of your firm. It\u2019s not just a faux Power Ranger simulator in which combat takes center stage. \n\nYou need to carefully manage your total funds and some compromises shall be made when hiring actors or sacking older ones which contrary to their skill sets, lack any appeal towards the audience. And you will certainly have to entertain your public. That is where the core tactical side of the game, comes alive. You have a surprisingly complex turn-based battle system that relies on literal teamwork between the squadmates you control, since boss fights are never easy. This really is a rare case of a title that can be used to demonstrate independent creativeness and show the gaming industry that you don\u2019t require an overinflated budget in order to create a fun and captivating game.\n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Beautiful pixel graphics and equally pleasant soundtrack.\n+ Clever use of pop culture references and humor.\n+ Unique type of gameplay.\n+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- Some elements get repetitive over time.\n\n[b]Rating 9/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews]Imperial Reviews[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Cubbes]Cubbes[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1477908299, "timestamp_updated": 1483475082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690090", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26327175": {"recommendationid": "26327175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057093748", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477892279}, "language": "english", "review": "An overhyped mess. It rides on the nostalgia train but crashes ingloriously when it comes to gameplay.\nThis is written after haven finished the highest difficulty.\n\nIn essence it consists of 4 core elements: Tactical RPG, economy / money management, crafting, and bugs.\n-On the tactics side we have a squad of 5 actors / heroes fighting enemies in turn based combad on a planar field. During the first few levels it works perfectly. You have your classes like assault, support and scout who each do different things. But the more you play the more a mess it becomes. Suddenly everyone has heals, buffs, damage, etc. It lacks imagination. This is even more emphasized when it comes to enemies. You have to face melee, ranged, healers and coloured variations with more hp / damage. Even the bosses play the same way (almost) every level. They each mainly use the same attacks / abilities. It makes for a very tedious gameplay experience all the way to the end.\n\n-Economy. The better you do the more money you get. That's the premise. It falls apart very early in the game when it becomes clear that it's almost impossible to miss the mark. Probably due to the very easy difficulty even on the highest setting. Same with director instructions during missions. Basically sidequests that make you do something. Mostly it doesn't even affect the gameplay and furthermore the boost they give becomes negligible the further you progress.\n\n-Crafting is a big part of the game. The more this hurts. It is horrible and completely missed the point of crafting.\nYou get materials from slain enemies or you can buy random packs in the shop. So good so far. But crafting is a lottery. You pick your base and it adds random properties. That's not crafting, it's lottery. When you want a defined outcome. That's crafting. It makes sense very early in the game pretending that your actors are improvising. But when you suddenly deal with high tech components the immersion falls apart. It doesn't hel either that most of the game the shop sold items are just far superior and don't have you hurt yourself through the atrocious interface.\n\n-Bugs. This one is really dissapointing. We are talking on an Ubisoft level of bugginess. Nothing so far has been gamebreaking, but considering this whole thing rides on tropes and the passion for the genre one would think the devs would put more effort into this. Originally I would list the bugs here, but I simply lost track of them and at one point didn't bother to write them down. From economy, to battle, loot drops. Hell, even the basic text bubbles have a minor word wrap bug. It really becomes a joke when you realise there is a permanent bug report button on the top right.\n\n\nThis is a very sad case. I really tried to like this game, it's not bad, but it is below mediocre. It became painfully obvious during the game that all they cared about was the athmosphere and design. They got that perfectly and then stopped doing anything else. Don't get me wrong, most of the things I mentioned are very minor, but they are so numerous you wouldn't believe the devs actually played their own game (and those peeves are not even all).\nFor the price tag of 15\u20ac I cannot recommend this game. Too short, lackluster gameplay. Even fans of the genre are better of just buying a DVD of their favourite series.", "timestamp_created": 1477873926, "timestamp_updated": 1477873926, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26326140": {"recommendationid": "26326140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033995360", "num_games_owned": 1470, "num_reviews": 267, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487026212}, "language": "french", "review": "S'il \u00e9tait sorti en bo\u00eete il y a une quinzaine d'ann\u00e9es sur Playstation 2, Chroma Squad aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un jeu adul\u00e9 des gens qui alors s'autoproclamaient [i]de bon go\u00fbt[/i], l'os pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 d'une niche, balanc\u00e9 comme un missile dans tes gencives au milieu d'une liste de tirets prouvant que le jeu vid\u00e9o m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre jou\u00e9 sur ma console et pas sur la tienne. [i]Tu vois, il n'y a pas que Disgaea et Phantom Brave sur ma b\u00e9cane.[/i]\n\nColor\u00e9 et idiot, Chroma Squad d\u00e9tourne les codes du jeu de r\u00f4le \u00e0 la japonaise dans le but de nous amuser de sa loufoquerie plus que de nous passionner de son gameplay. Son game design simpliste, bourr\u00e9 de petites id\u00e9es sans cons\u00e9quences mais assez nombreuses pour nous donner l'illusion que ce squelette a du corps, a juste ce qu'il faut de muscles pour porter l'enthousiasme du joueur pendant les dix \u00e0 quinze heures de jeu que nous co\u00fbteront son aventure. S'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus long, on aurait pu s'en rendre compte et s'en ennuyer. Mais les meilleurs des mensonges sont ceux qui savent quand s'arr\u00eater.\n\nIl faut dire que dans Chroma Squad, tout est fake, jusqu'aux affrontements qui ne sont que des chor\u00e9graphies de cascadeurs. On s'y affronte pour de faux, sans rien prendre au s\u00e9rieux, le sourire toujours aux l\u00e8vres, pas vraiment d\u00e9sol\u00e9 d'avoir frapp\u00e9 un peu trop fort le pauvre bougre dans le costume d'en face. On s'amuse beaucoup de l'originalit\u00e9 de son concept (on incarne une bande d'acteurs rat\u00e9s qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre en main leur avenir et de monter leur propre show t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 inspir\u00e9 des Power Rangers et autres Bioman) qui a des cons\u00e9quences directes sur le syst\u00e8me de jeu : un peu comme dans La Porte Mill\u00e9naire mais en beaucoup moins bien (TOUT sur cette Terre est beaucoup moins bien que La Porte Mill\u00e9naire), il faudra combattre avec la mani\u00e8re pour gagner le coeur des spectateurs ; on se bat pour s\u00e9duire le public plus que pour vaincre son ennemi. Les cascades, les attaques sp\u00e9ciales et les combos \u00e0 plusieurs sur le m\u00eame vilain-pas-beau seront r\u00e9compens\u00e9s par des bonds d'audimat. Il faudra aussi se soumettre aux exigences du r\u00e9alisateur (sous formes d'objectifs annexes) pour optimiser l'impact visuel de nos combats et faire grimper en fl\u00e8che la popularit\u00e9 de la s\u00e9rie.\n\nChroma Squad a un autre atout dans sa besace : son rythme. Il est rare que les sc\u00e8nes de bagarre durent plus de vingt minutes - aussi, on les commence souvent en denim jean et en t-shirt, ne se battant qu'avec de simples coups de poings et de pieds comme des civils \u00e9meutiers ou des zadistes en col\u00e8re. Il faudra attendre un ou deux tours pour se transformer en guerriers sentai, marquant ainsi une rupture et une progression dans le combat, en r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rant nos points de vie et d\u00e9bloquant les armes et les attaques sp\u00e9ciales de nos personnages. Les sc\u00e8nes de Mechas qui viennent conclure les affrontements dans la d\u00e9mesure la plus carton-p\u00e2te, pas super int\u00e9ressantes \u00e0 jouer, ont le m\u00e9rite de renforcer cette sensation de progression et de vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des combats, pas tr\u00e8s riches tactiquement mais, du coup, jamais lassants.\n\nPour s'a\u00e9rer l'esprit, ces batailles sont toujours prises en sandwich entre deux dialogues, jamais tr\u00e8s bavards - et c'est tant mieux car au-del\u00e0 de son aspect parodique, le jeu n'a rien d'int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 raconter. Apr\u00e8s et avant chaque \u00e9pisode, on retourne au studio d'enregistrement, le camp de base depuis lequel on s'ach\u00e8te de nouveaux jouets. On s'en servira plus tard comme d'armes et d'armures, aussi on s'adonne aux joies du crafting pour en fabriquer d'autres, r\u00e9pond au courrier des fans, change les costumes et les coups sp\u00e9ciaux de nos acteurs ch\u00e9ris, enfin on g\u00e8re le marketing de la s\u00e9rie en se satisfaisant de voir grossir notre fanbase. D\u00e9bloquer et acheter des am\u00e9liorations pour addicter le joueur est une astuce vieille comme le monde mais toujours aussi efficace - et totalement justifi\u00e9e dans le cadre de la mont\u00e9e en puissance d'une s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e tenue par un petit groupe de jeunes adultes qui d\u00e9marrent la vie sans-le-sou jusqu'\u00e0 la conqu\u00eate d'Hollywood.\n\nEntre ses costumes sentai, son style graphique fluo et ses attaques sp\u00e9ciales en \u00e9toile, Chroma Squad a une petite odeur de Super Mario RPG m\u00e9tiss\u00e9 avec Viewtiful Joe. Sans jamais vraiment atteindre le g\u00e9nie ni de l'un, ni de l'autre : si son gameplay a su maquiller ses d\u00e9fauts aussi efficacement que cette jolie fille qui cache ses volcans de pus derri\u00e8re des tartines de fond de teint, Chroma Squad a du mal \u00e0 nous faire oublier qu'il est un jeu un peu vain qui n'a rien \u00e0 dire. C'est un copain attachant mais l\u00e9ger qui n'a que des blagues pas toujours g\u00e9niales qui lui sortent de la bouche. Maladroit quand il essaie d'\u00eatre l'all\u00e9gorie de l'ind\u00e9pendance dans le jeu vid\u00e9o, il est carr\u00e9ment lourdaud quand il passe le plus clair de son temps \u00e0 s'auto-r\u00e9f\u00e9rencer en tant que jeu Kickstarter. S'il est marrant de briser le quatri\u00e8me mur et de voir un jeu dire \"je suis un jeu\" une ou deux fois, on commence \u00e0 saturer \u00e0 partir de la dixi\u00e8me occurrence. Aussi, les backers les plus riches seront s\u00fbrement tr\u00e8s heureux d'\u00eatre incrust\u00e9s dans l'histoire d'une fa\u00e7on si appuy\u00e9e. Pour ma part, j'ai juste \u00e9merg\u00e9 de l'aventure \u00e0 chaque fois qu'un nouveau guest \u00e0 la peau blanche albinos, au bidon rond et aux lunettes \u00e9normes apparaissait de nulle part en me r\u00e9citant son nom. Ces [i]invit\u00e9s[/i] sont non seulement trop nombreux mais aussi, comme il n'y a pas de qu\u00eates annexes dans lesquelles ils pourraient vivre, envahissent la trame principale. Si bien qu'on retrouve en moyenne un m\u00e9c\u00e8ne toutes les deux ou trois missions.\n\nA trop s'auto-r\u00e9f\u00e9rencer et se f\u00e9liciter d'\u00eatre pass\u00e9 par le crowdfunding, Chroma Squad donne parfois l'impression d'\u00eatre plus une blague entre potes qu'une oeuvre autonome. Rien d'assez g\u00eanant pour nous g\u00e2cher ce tr\u00e8s bon tactical RPG dr\u00f4le, color\u00e9, assez malin pour en avoir l'air sans l'\u00eatre.

Needless to say fact I beat it in under three days after I actually began playing should tell you I was way off that mark.\n\nYou create and assume the roles of your five-strong Super Sentai group, process which is done through choosing which character will assume each role (Lead, Assist, etc) and there are quite a few cameos ranging from actors to pop icons you may recognize. I had fun naming my totally-not-Weasley-Snipes \u201cEyes-Open\u201d, but that's beside the point. After that's done and over with you find out they're disgruntled stunt actors on a related show who decide to create a new studio and show of their own. These are the humble beginnings game presents you with and it's customizable down to Ranger colors, studio name catchphrases team will employ. Far be it for me to say that's ALL there is to this story, and oh boy does it escalate, but it never loses that sense of \u201cwe're running a show here\u201d which is further enforced by character's comments, episode setups and constant camera crews on the set. \n\nThis illusion is never broken because no matter what happens you're still making a show which nets you fans and money. Both are important for keeping your studio successful because it lets you craft gear from materials your enemies drop; things like tape, cardboard and glass, or straight up buy new stuff from the store. You will also want to invest in your studio for things like HD cameras which net you more audience per-episode, better health insurance for HP bonus, etc. It's definitely sensible and tongue-in-cheek with the mood of the game. As befitting a Super Sentai team you will also acquire a wise MENTOR and Mecha at your disposal, latter which also gets its own separate upgrades and is used in 1v1 fights against giant opponents. \n\nAs far as actual meat of the game goes, that being combat, you'll quickly discover your team of five is constantly outnumbered usually 3-to1 if you're lucky and keeping your gear up snuff is a good idea. As each of the five seasons go by your characters unlock another tier of skills you can choose form so you're not just brute-forcing it. In fact, I'd argue game is somewhat on the easy side unless you really want to do all of Director's Instructions aka specific set of objectives in each episode which may be on the tricky side but are also a great way to get more audience, except in the very last part when that difficulty spike becomes too real. It does make for a fitting conclusion, but also drags down what should've been a way more intense end game. I will say that send off itself is amazing and no game that plays the theme track can do wrong by me in that regard. It turns out your show is pretty radical and watched worldwide. \n\nIf there are any negatives they are very few, mostly on the side of some Unity engine shenanigans like some scripts not being timed correctly which leads to some delays, hang ups when game has to display things like a ton of audience bonus gained from healing and alike, but I would probably point out overused Mecha fights in the last episode or so as the worst offender for me. You don't have to end each episode like that and especially not because you'll notice hit percentage is still RNG-driven so it'll eventually turn on you. I also wish game was longer, but you can also have too much of the good stuff.\n\nSo, did I like Chroma Squad? I loved it. Really got me motivated to play some more SRPGs when I get the time and had me grinning like a maniac at times. You gotta accept it is, well, episodic at times because that's the source material it draws from, but stellar soundtrack really kicks in at times and does wonders for overall impression.

Even though I don't have a lot of playtime, I will say that it was worth the sale price for sure and would be worth full price too. There are hours of entertainment that can be pulled from this game.

It probably helped that I grew up on Power Rangers so my appreciation for the setting and tolerance for its issues might go a bit further than some. You can expect around 12 hours of playtime on the normal difficulty if you engage a bit with the crafting system and take time to equip everyone optimally.\n\nI\u2019ll start off by going over Chroma Squad\u2019s problems. This game is weighed down by its boring mecha fights and gameplay repetitiveness. The mecha fights are 2D encounters where you take turns beating each other up instead of taking place on a grid. Imagine missing attacks with 80-90% accuracy against monsters that need to be KO\u2019d three times and you have the early mecha combat experience. The fights become more tolerable later as you can equip different mech parts that increase accuracy (a must), other stats, or grant new abilities. Still, they\u2019re too long and not mechanically interesting. I also didn\u2019t enjoy the timing mini-game when you defend. \n\nThe gameplay repetitiveness comes from the pacing of acquiring new abilities and the common enemy variety. The bosses are fine and some of them have interesting gimmicks. New abilities are unlocked at the start of a new season which felt too long since you can only have one active out of the two or three choices at that tier. Some choices felt obvious, but I did do some switching around later in the game. What helped me was playing in short bursts of 1-1.5 hours. Otherwise, the gameplay might wear you down since you\u2019ll often be using the same strategies against the same baddies. I noticed areas being reused often too. I recommend deliberately setting out to acquire the Rider path for season 5 to experience some very interesting gameplay changes relative to the rest of the game.\n\nChroma Squad allows for some silly customization. Since the theme is that you\u2019re running a TV studio, you\u2019re able to select your actors, name their characters, name the studio, customize catchphrases, name the mech, and more.  I highly recommend personalizing everything to have more fun with it. I went with Friendship Squad and named the mech Big Friend. The power of friendship can overcome all, don\u2019t cha know.\n\nThe gameplay itself involves recording episodes (going out on missions) and managing your team in-between shoots. Episodes involve combat and following the Director\u2019s Instructions as best as you can since you want to have a high audience rating for more money and fan conversion. The combat involves you making squad members move twice or move and then attack (attacks end the character\u2019s turn). You can use certain abilities that count as free actions so that you can still attack and/or move. The Teamwork ability that any class can use lets you gang up on an enemy or toss teammates around which lets them move farther. The gameplay becomes more interesting later with more abilities unlocked while the start is a bit slow.\n\nAn example I can give is the having the Assault use Teamwork to toss the Lead away from danger, then using the Lead\u2019s Join Up ability (free action) to gather everyone without making them use any actions, followed by the Support\u2019s AoE heal, using the Lead\u2019s Lasso ability to rope in a weak enemy for a kill, and then making the Scout cloak for something sneaky-sneaky.\n\nThe team management aspect involves crafting gear with materials found in episodes or from crates, deciding on what studio upgrades to buy, deciding which marketing agency to hire (income buffs, combat buffs) so that you can spend fans on even more buffs, buying gear from the shop, deciding on what abilities to use, and reading fan mail. Crafting can be a little time consuming considering that some stats are RNG which leads to multiple attempts if you have a poor roll.\n\nWell, that\u2019s it.

You are to gather Audience during each Episode (mission), so alongside trying to make sure you win (which on the medium difficulty I never felt too pressured about), you are also to coordinate team attacks and acrobatics, fulfilling the optional objectives of that mission, trying to get the last blow on the boss to be a Finishing Move, and whatever else will excite your audience, and thus gain you Fans and Money.

I will proceed to karate kick that child in the face, and as he reaches for the ice cream again (mint chocolate drizzled with galaxies of cake sprinkles), I will remove my plastic helmet to let him gaze on my dreadfully expressionless face as I level a long gentle stare into his brilliant, innocent eyes, grinding his delicious confection into the pea gravel with the heel of a nylon boot.\n\nI came to Chroma Squad for obvious reasons. Chroma Squad begins with what we are to take as the stunt actors from the actual Power Rangers set staging a revolt and opening their own studio to shoot their own martial arts children's show, or in other words, to do everything exactly as before but with a rigorous simulation of creative control. The thing that really drew me to it, though, was the rumor that it was a Final Fantasy Tactics-esque Tactical RPG with a splash of XCOM flavor, full of cheek and wit and heart-warming hilarity to bring home to the whole family.\n\nI'm going to have a total XCOM-snob conniption right now, so be sure to click the 'not helpful' button if those words don't mean anything to you at all. This game's combat is wearing tactical RPG clothes for what appears to be no reason apart from the fun of having made a game that aesthetically resembles a turn-based tactical RPG ala Disgaea or FF Tactics. Battles are much more comparable, however, to those of Diablo or Torchlight, in which you click somewhere on the screen, your little fellows amble (or here, cartwheel and cheer-lift one another) in a direction, swing their fists around, and that's it. This, of course, places Chroma Squad on the tactical combat spectrum nearest to \"something you idly click through.\"\n\nIt's all about positioning your team just right so they can perform the same finishing move again. And again. And again. All for the entertainment of the type of children Chroma Squad must think we all were at a certain age: the kid who got up early every Saturday morning to sit at the TV with eyes pressed directly to the glass. Combat is shockingly boring, special abilities don't really synchronize, and there's basically no reason to attempt to play \"tactically,\" because the experience is much closer to being babysat by a kind teenager who thinks she's way cooler than she is. You are given a laundry list each mission of little hoops to jump through, such as \"defeat 3 enemies in the same turn,\" \"keep all your heroes alive,\" or \"attempt to figure out how to do that same team attack again,\" but all of these come off as suggestions on the level with \"wouldn't it be really cool if you brushed your teeth and went to bed at exactly 8 PM per your parents' instructions? We're really on the same side here.\"\n\nI found myself cranking the difficulty down from its highest setting midway through, not because I felt particularly challenged, but because I just couldn't bear the thought of spending more time seeing this thing through than I had to. Yes, sometimes you'll get so bored watching each reskinned enemy type spawn in one-at-a-time and run into positions that will have no effect on how you'll fight that you phase back into paying attention to learn that your healer is dead, and things get a little bit tricky. Then you can halfheartedly attempt to survive the mission or suffer some consequences featuring a number that represents your supposed fans, who have opted, instead of watching your onscreen incompetence, to get stoned and watch Godzilla vs Megalon again, which is about 1/4 as stoned as I'd need to be to enjoy this game or find it compellingly difficult, a state of I mind imagine as a hypothetical level of brain-myopia in which I lose the ability to read or control my bowels.\n\nWhat you'll never see in Chroma Squad, at any rate, is any indication that the AI knows that it's supposed to try to win. Chroma Squad is every bit the tactical RPG that Battletoads & Double Dragon was way back when.\n\nThe game's interface is by far the worst enemy--not much is communicated clearly, and features stand a very real chance of remaining hidden in plain sight well into late game. The explanations of some abilities don't make sense--one has you dealing damage to enemies along your traveled path, but the ability doesn't path through enemies, so I never figured out what the hell that ability is supposed to be doing.\n\nOne could argue the game is challenging given that you'll feel underpowered most of the time. But I'll counter that by saying that making a sloppy, unresponsive mess of a studio management screen does not tactical gameplay make. Your resource management screen seems wilfully designed to confuse you--you'll spend money in an attempt to get at least one aspect of your television enterprise functioning competently, but little seems to help. You cannot sell equipment and are instead forced to reduce items to scrap materials you'll probably never use. Everything is a one-way street to a sort of long suffering.\n\nSomehow, the novelty of the game's customization options wears off extremely fast, and even turning your heroes' \"morphin time\" catchphrase to HAIL SATAN fails to drum up much enthusiasm when you know more deadening combat is coming.\n\nTHAT'S THE WHOLE JOKE, you say. It's all LOW RENT and also DID YOU NOTICE that EVERYTHING IS A REFERENCE. Yeah. And it's extremely hilarious or something. Don't get me wrong, there are some sensible chuckles strung throughout in the form of a draconian director barking Backstreet Boys lyrics as stage prompts, an anonymous \"biggest fan\" innocently emailing the studio to ask if Halliburton had any involvement in the design of the Megazord, or the sudden run-in with the star of Colin's Bear Animation, who unaccountably transforms into a send-up of Yakra and Heckran from Chrono Trigger.\n\nBut when I start to sense that the game's wit is wringing itself raw with the exertion of transmuting \"Nick Fury\" to \"Rick Anger\", or naming a large sentient iPod enemy DOPi, or reaching -just- -one- -more- -time- for another Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shoutout, I start experimenting with how much mileage I can get out of the handy fast-forwarding key. I swear to god, nothing tells me more about how quick this game's lights and camera went up around its ramshackle production than having a character recite the Taken monologue verbatim and the villain responding with \"Hey Sentai fans, did you catch that that comes from somewhere else?

It's a strategy RPG with a unique concept that is pulled off extremely well. It's the perfect application of crafting mechanics, too. The graphics are beautiful, and the music is impressively good. The concept of going from small-time to big time is a brilliant idea for a game of this manner.\n\nThere is a lot of attention to detail in the game, with secret things to find both graphically and plot wise. It's easily worth the MSRP, and is one of those things you don't know you want until you have played it for yourself.\n\nProtip: Don't try hard mode on your first playthrough. It's really unbalanced hard.\n\nThe cons:\n\nThe programming is so glitchy the game feels like a beta version. The textboxes overflow when people are talking and transitions are often jarringly abrupt, just cutting out and flickering when a level ends instead of having a proper \"you win\" screen. The controller controls need major work as they just operate the mouse cursor instead of having true controller support.\n\nThe writing is mediocre, with very poor grammar that could have used major proofreading. Some of the scenarios are sort of nonsensical due to the writing. The appearances of numerous Kickstarter backers break the immersion of the game, it would have been better if they didn't have to awkwardly say their full names every time someone appeared. The backer characters all look like the same nerdy white guys, and dont make sense in the setting.\n\nWith the lack of characterization you'd think there'd be some kind of character creation for your team, but instead there is very little in the way of choice if you want a decent team, I wish you could choose from more diverse appearances and just assign certain personalities to them, instead there are kind of obvious \"best characters\", so if you didn't want a cartoon beaver on your team youre flat out of luck.", "timestamp_created": 1472385675, "timestamp_updated": 1472641504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25188697": {"recommendationid": "25188697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078143828", "num_games_owned": 937, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471971059}, "language": "english", "review": "Great indie tactical RPG (think pixel art XCOM with Power Rangers theme).

Ever since then, the TV show, and vitrually any other kind of Sentai, held a special place in my heart, and you can imagine how I felt when I saw this game on Steam. This game mixes strategy with the over-the-top action, spandex, robots, and explosions of any episode of Power Rangers, and does a phenominal job of invoking the inner child who was too young to  see sucky special effects.

By season 3 or 4, the scarcity of new and interesting mechanics turns the combat into a dull grind, full of reskinned enemies that you've fought again and again and again.\n\nI played through the end of season 4, on the highest difficulty.  The game balance seemed reasonable but not overly challenging at first, but by the end, it felt like I was constantly underlevelled and underequipped.  Even though the game has no concept of experience (season number does function as a sort of \"level\") and my gear was the best on offfer.\n\nAs a result, the game became a tedious slog of repeatedly sending 2-3 people after each enemy (for multiple turns, if it was the defensive type), keeping everyone's health up, and the occasional weird \"because the director told me so\" goal to get more audience.  The strategy varied *slightly* depending on the exact configuration of enemies, whether you could hit a few with an AOE, and if there was a boss.  For bosses, the standard procedure was to ignore them until you killed the enemies, then repeatedly wail on them with 2-3 people and heal up from their inevitable \"knock one or all nearby people back, move, attack again\" attack pattern.  And with a boss in most episodes (stages), even that became completely routine.\n\nThe end boss of season 4 was particularly dull.  Every few turns, he summons two enemy-summoning portals.  The portals have about as much health and defense as a normal enemy, and they spawn an enemy every turn (except the turn when they are spawned).  So you spend half or more of your time cleaning up the portals, rather than handling the boss.  The boss also has an assistant, who (for plot reasons) the game suggests not killing.  The assistant heals the boss periodically.  I ended up killing the assistant eventually, because it was taking far, far too long to win when I kept having to go kill portals and watch the boss get healed.  I had even tried letting the portals spawn for a few turns and just focusing on the boss, but had to regroup and clear them out, as the ever-spawning enemies were threatening to overwhelm me.\n\nThe mech battles similarly stagnate.  The first one is neat, and the next few are also cool as you customize your mech.  But by the end of season 2, you're mech has basically reached its final form, and it's just a matter of making numbers go up to try to keep pace with ever-stronger enemies.\n\nI liked the game.  It had charm, an amusingly-cheesy plot, and solid mechanics.  But while the plot progressed and got better, the mechanics didn't,  I don't regret buying it, but I do find myself saddened and disappointed that it couldn't follow through on the solid experience it started.", "timestamp_created": 1471316480, "timestamp_updated": 1471316480, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643907", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24825292": {"recommendationid": "24825292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045965375", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462175902}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny characters and story.

Their omage to Power Rangers clearly comes from a place of wanting to laugh with the fans, not mock source material. The turn-based battles aren't the most complex system around, but there are some choices you can make towards your actors skills that can certainly allow for differing strategies. I think the part that made it so good and easy to get into for me is how the game is paced. It's wisely broken up into seasons and episodes, which really solidifies the setting, and the episodes themselves never take a huge amount of time to complete with most coming in at 30-45 minutes. It makes it really nice and easy to play a small portion and then come back to it later. The one aspect of the game that doesn't deliver as well as the rest is the Mech vs. Big Monster battles, but they don't happen every episode.\n\nGreat game with great humor and well designed gameplay, definitely great for fans of strategy RPGs and a good trek down memory lane for watchers of shows like Power Rangers.", "timestamp_created": 1468969614, "timestamp_updated": 1468969614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503532", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24398199": {"recommendationid": "24398199", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985604447", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468287708}, "language": "english", "review": "That was 20 hours that I don't regret. \n\nCreating your own \"power-rangers\"-team, and playing them through meta-scenarios while making a studio and buying plastic swords was a great ride.

Additionally, there is very little information on what the different audience stats and numbers mean in terms of gameplay and what the different stats from the advertising agencies actually do to affect that.\n\n2. Movement and combat\nEach character can generally perform two actions per turn (outside of certain free action abilities marked as such). This is fine, but the implementation is quite annoying at times. You first move action, regardless of whether you moved the full distance or not, takes up a full action. So if you moved closer to use a ranged ability and found yourself one tile too far away but still had enough movement range to do it with your first action, you have wasted the turn since to move the one additional tile will take the full second action and you will not be able to use your ranged ability.\n\nIt's also hard to see where to position squad members to use abilities and teamwork without actually moving them and seeing what they can do next, compounding the frustration from the abovementioned issue. I would like to see some kind of move planner that lets you plan out all the moves for a turn (with an undo) to queue up all the actions, and when you're done setting it up, it all happens at once when you end the turn.\n\n3. Crafting\nRandom item drops might sound good on paper and work alright in a game with infinite random monsters to farm to eventually get what you need, but in this game it pretty much means that you'll generally be buying most of your equipment, especially since crafted items have random stats that may or may not be what you actually want/need. Save your resources for upgrading the mecha.\n\n3. Snowballing failure\nBecause of the story structure of this game, if you don't have the right equipment to do a mission and don't have money to afford it, you're stuck. If you do poorly on an early mission, you'll be short on cash for later missions, leading to a snowball effect of frustration with no solution other than starting over. The game is long enough that this could become rage inducing, especially given the difficulty spike at the very end. Thankfully on casual difficulty the game is easy enough that this isn't an issue at all, but could become a major problem on higher difficulties.\n\nRelated to this is the major difficulty spike for the last mission, especially the final mecha battle. Tactics and equipment that worked just fine earlier in the game suddenly become useless since you're now faced with lots of new enemies and abilities. The final mecha battle has no rounds where your mech can recover, so if you didn't equip your mech with an active heal ability, you will lose, even on casual since you won't be able to heal at all, but the boss can and has a lot more health than you.\n\nOverall though I had a lot of fun playing this game in spite of my enthusiasm being dampened by the difficulty spike of the final mission. Easily recommended, especially if the devs keep working on this game and address some of the aforementioned issues.", "timestamp_created": 1467659644, "timestamp_updated": 1467659644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24086487": {"recommendationid": "24086487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042265756", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 3027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468906736}, "language": "english", "review": "Behold Studios does it again...

This game is too much fun. For anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy RPGs, with plenty of customization, cheesy chiptune music and intricacies that are easy to learn but difficult to master... Pick this up, even at full price.\n\nHere we have a game where you manage a crew of actors/actresses of your choosing, filming a television show with a brand new studio. The two big elements to this game are when you're in the studio (business management mode), and when you're recording (combat mode). Both are fleshed out quite well--when you're in the studio, you *will* spend a while making tactical decisions as to what agency to sign with, what to craft/buy and for whom, and how to gear up your mech for the upcoming fight.\n\nCombat is a whole 'nother beast. It isn't *terribly* complicated on the surface, but the addition of being able to enter a \"Teamwork\" state where you can either combo with others or, more importantly, catapult off them to gain some extra movement and set yourself up, that's where it gets interesting. It's a little reminiscent of throwing people around in Disgaea (similarly, the whole game has a Disgaea-ish feel to it). In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd think this was a direct offshoot of the Super Sentai-esque characters from Disgaea, but that's just because this is also a tactical RPG and it's a common trope.\n\nIn addition, adding a layer to combat, in each scenario you have a pair of \"Director's Instructions,\" which net you bonus points (referred to as \"audience\"). These are tallied at the end to give you money and \"fans\" (which are effectively points that allow you to benefit from more of your chosen agency's bonuses). \n\nPROS:\n* Though it's not for everyone, and can get a little repetitive, the cheesy, chiptune, over-the-top music is great. \n* Also subjective, but I find the combat to be just plain fun, and hard difficulty will provide no small amount of challenge for the perfectionist. Mech combat is no exception.\n* Very deep game overall. Seems like something I'd give another playthrough.\n* It's funny and cheesy without pushing either of those too far.\n* Nicely animated for 2D sprites.\n\nCONS:\n* Some of the stats are a little unclear, and there seems to be no in-game explanation for most of them. Some of them are self-explanatory, some aren't. This might not really count as a con, but the UI could have used some cleaning up.\n* Can't undo accidental misclicks in combat. In fairness though, that can be chalked up to human error, it's not like it's easy to misclick.\n* No toggle to see the tactical grid, which has led to some poor choices in gauging how far away I've been from an opponent (another reason I wish there was an undo function).\n* This may just be me, but my computer stutters at least one or two times during those crucial timing-based defense moves in the mech battles. Probably just me since I run so much in my background, but the game continues and I'm left only to guess when to click. I've run much higher graphics games with zero issues like this still running everything in my background, but I will say the game is otherwise technically sound.\n* My last minor gripe, I wish I could fire an actor and replace them. So fair warning, you can't change your characters mid-game.\n\nPick this one up if any of that appeals to you, it definitely put a smile on my face.", "timestamp_created": 1467594458, "timestamp_updated": 1467608052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24064871": {"recommendationid": "24064871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118982132", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507597336}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um dos melhores jogos que ja joguei, valeu a compra \n", "timestamp_created": 1467589256, "timestamp_updated": 1467589256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24053026": {"recommendationid": "24053026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141279894", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506722284}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best indie tatical rpg\n.\n.\n.\nGO GO POWER RANGEEEERS", "timestamp_created": 1467562304, "timestamp_updated": 1514484181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24021671": {"recommendationid": "24021671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115767701", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468458737}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, light, and quick.", "timestamp_created": 1467478628, "timestamp_updated": 1467478628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24019963": {"recommendationid": "24019963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103211549", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511559251}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, with charismatic characters, nice history and MECHAS!!! /o/\nThere is a nice combination of tactical RPG and studio administration n.n", "timestamp_created": 1467474914, "timestamp_updated": 1467474914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24017004": {"recommendationid": "24017004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118805863", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482896491}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Sci-Fi, superheroes, comics, tokusatsu, Old Fashioned TV/Cinema schlockiness, and/or fun Turn Based RPGS;\n\nPlay this game.\n\nSrsly, it's freakin fun. \n\n\nAnd it's pretty well balanced too, looks great, and even has a little tinge of management style games in it.", "timestamp_created": 1467468446, "timestamp_updated": 1467468446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24007122": {"recommendationid": "24007122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080262997", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489086458}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "J\u00e1 vou avisando logo de cara: se voc\u00ea ainda tem preconceito com jogos nacionais, \u00e9 melhor abrir sua mente e dar uma chance \u00e0 esse t\u00edtulo! \nChroma Squad \u00e9 um RPG t\u00e1tico dos mesmos criadores do excelente Knights of Pen and Paper, que simula um seriado de Super Sentai, bem aos moldes de Power Rangers.

Stuff like MAD TV. If you remember that one, then you're an old fart like me and you probably just missed the super sentai-craze of the mid-90s, because you considered yourself too old and prefered mature stuff like those XTREME era IMAGE comics. You know... the ones where superheroes hat 5000 pouches. But I digress. Gameplay-wise, CHROMA SQUAD is really nifty. There are three difficulty levels and the middle one is just right in my opinion. I'm too old to get really good at any game - once you pass the magical 30, you come to find that life won't allow you to play video games for ten hours a day. And when I say \"life\", I mean \"spouse\", you know what I'm sayin'? Not that I'm complaining! Just saying it like it is, yo. Droppin' knowledge. Yo, yo.\n\nThe thing I like best about this game, is its sense of humour, though. Really. Usually, I find games that try to be funny annoying. There is something so endearing about CHROMA SQUAD that I just can't bring myself not to chuckle. You can see that the makers are not trying to make fun of POWER RANGERS and the like, they are paying hommage, but in an oddball way that really has heart. As referential as the game is, its references are never ham-fisted and they don't pander to geeks moe-stlye. They're actually quite cute.\n\nSo. There you go. If you were to ask me \"Gaston, shall I buy this game\", I'd answer: \"Go for it.\" And then I'd add that if you remember MAD TV, you should google it, because there is an online version of it that you can play in your browser.\n\nPeace, out.", "timestamp_created": 1467065617, "timestamp_updated": 1467065617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23870123": {"recommendationid": "23870123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052884684", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495901112}, "language": "french", "review": "Nostalgiques des Sentais et Power rangers, voila un chouette jeu rendant hommage \u00e0 un \u00e2ge d'or des combinaisons en latex fluo et des combats titanesques de robots et monstres g\u00e9ants dans un d\u00e9cor en carton. \nUn grand coup de coeur \u2665 pour la musique qui est mythique \u2665\u2665\u2665 !\nLe c\u00f4t\u00e9 nostalgique est grandement marqu\u00e9 par l'aspect graphique qui est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able \u2665\nJe ne suis pas une amatrice de tactical \u00e0 la base mais j'ai vraiment bien adh\u00e9rer au syst\u00e8me.", "timestamp_created": 1467053373, "timestamp_updated": 1467053373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23848914": {"recommendationid": "23848914", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983605739", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467854963}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is adorable and feels like a SNES classic that flew under the radar.

It has an interesting twist where you run a TV studio filming a \"sentai\" style action show. For those unfamiliar, that means it's a Power Rangers style show. You get to make a few personal touches as far as Squad name, transformation name, Mech name, and a few other options. You're also in charge of upgrading your studio, some basic marketing options, as well as purchasing or crafting new equipment.\n\nIf you've ever played a tactical-RPG, you know what to expect. You get a movement and an action, or two movements. There are free actions which are the exception. There's also a teamwork feature. A member of your squad can throw you further increasing your initial movement. If they are adjacent to an enemy and you attack with another member, they combine their attack and do increased damage. There's also a finishing move if you have 4 members using teamwork and you attack with the 5th. \n\nThe pixel graphics are actually well done. Most of the sets look very nice. The details in the character models are nice, as well. Some of the suits look cool. The retro soundtrack is also nice, but you can mostly just play it with the sound off as it gets rather repetitive. Of course, graphics and sound aren't the important part of a game like this so I'm sure you won't be drawn to get this game just because they're not amazing.\n\nThis game supports a controller, but it thinks my Xbox controller is a Playstation controller.

Hard enough I have to pay attention to what I'm doing and think out my actions, and most episodes I'm barely scraping through.

It's not bad by any means but it's more decent and fits the game well, then anything truly memorable.\nThe visuals I really appreciate however, it's simple retro pixel graphics but the combat animations, movement, and even the special attacks are all very well animated and look quite nice. Lots of extra frills like a fast forward effect reminiscent of an old VCR on a CRT TV fit perfectly with the atmosphere.\n\nI can happily recommend this to anyone who wants a lighthearted RPG, or just looking for something unique and different.

Take so long to play it, but I've played it with the same feeling of a goty release.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Gameplay\n2D game based on fighting in shifts. Chroma Squad has a unique and fun structure. At first it is even a bit overwhelming with the amount of attributes and differences that each character has, to summarize, you command a studio that is producing a superheroes serie, each actor has their skills and has something to more. It can be played only with the mouse and the gameplay with the control is a little hard to adapt.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Graphic\nPixelated, needless to comment on it. The market of games has proved that a game can be amazing even with simple graphic. Chroma Squad is no different, full pixel graphic is purposely nostalgic, with a palette of bright colors, the game reminds older movie titles, drawings and heroes series.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Plot\nYou and your friends are stuntmen in a studio commanding by a terrible director, he explores your services, don't give the deserve value to you and block you creatively, where the actors are just watching you work. Tired of it you decide to create your own studio. The fun on Chroma Squad is that each \"episode\" can be seen as a stage in the game, in the episodes you fight with several enemies through shifts, combining strategies, individual or cooperative attacks with the other members.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Soundtrack\nImpressively nostalgic, they had success producing original tracks without losing the essence of the old songs. Hit that childhood longing to hear the opening song, the rest of the songs refer to 8bit style, they are instrumental and made an incredible treat. I leave here the link of the opening song, which was the most striking to me:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkrfCSyugnM\n\n\u2714 10/10 - Flawless game in all aspects, you feel quality in gameplay, graphics, music and plot itself.

Pour info, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un bug qui m'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de continuer le combat final. La phase \u00e9tant tr\u00e8s longue (sans \u00eatre difficile), j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de passer en facile pour r\u00e9essayer et voir si le bug \u00e9tait encore pr\u00e9sent. \nApr\u00e8s quelques mises \u00e0 jour dont celle des langues ajout\u00e9es, j'ai pu voir une des fins. Le jeu est simple \u00e0 comprendre avec un niveau correct d'anglais. La VF a l'air assez bonne pour le peu que j'en ai vu ( La fin en somme).\n\nPour en revenir au jeu, c'est un tactical RPG avec de la gestion dans un univers senta\u00ef par le biais de la parodie. Un groupe de cascadeurs d\u00e9cident de monter leur propre studio pour faire une s\u00e9rie type Power Rangers. Le sc\u00e9nario est bourr\u00e9 de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, souvent dr\u00f4le m\u00eame si je trouve qu'il se perd un peu quand le c\u00f4t\u00e9 cheap et s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9 s'efface pour un propos un peu plus \"s\u00e9rieux\".\n\nLe gameplay se d\u00e9compose en deux parties : La gestion et les combats. La gestion suppose de s'occuper de son studio, son \u00e9quipe et son m\u00e9cha. Il y a du craft, des possibilit\u00e9s d'acheter directement de l'\u00e9quipement et prendre une agence de marketing qui offre divers bonus. \nCette partie est assez simple et permet de customiser pas mal de choses. Je conseille fortement de miser sur l'agence qui vous donnera le plus d'argent par \u00e9pisode.\nLes combats sont du tour par tour assez classique et facile d'acc\u00e8s : des pouvoirs, du cooldown (temps d'attente pour certaines attaques) des cases et de la coop\u00e9ration pour se d\u00e9placer plus loin ou faire des super attaques.\nLa partie en m\u00e9cha est la moins r\u00e9ussie m\u00eame si sympathique. Le fait d'appuyer au bon moment pour encaisser les coups en prenant le moins de d\u00e9gats possibles est trop redondant. Sur cette partie, les d\u00e9veloppeurs sont tomb\u00e9s dans la facilit\u00e9 et le trop grand respect du genre emp\u00eache ses phases d'\u00eatre int\u00e9ressantes sur le long terme (La premi\u00e8re ressemblera \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re). \n\nLa dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu est d'une dizaine d'heures et la difficult\u00e9 va en s'amenuisant parce que les Chrom Squad deviennent surpuissants rapidement. Pour pallier \u00e0 cet \u00e9cueil, les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont eu la tr\u00e8s bonne id\u00e9e de mettre des d\u00e9fis \u00e0 chaque \u00e9pisode (Le jeu est d\u00e9coup\u00e9 en saisons qui contiennent des \u00e9pisodes) pour gagner de l'audience (donc de l'argent pour les am\u00e9liorations). Les d\u00e9fis consistent \u00e0 respecter les consignes du r\u00e9alisateur ( Dans chaque niveau, on peut voir l'\u00e9quipe de tournage). Ils ne sont pas toujours simples \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser, mais apportent un vrai plus.\n\nGraphiquement, c'est du pixel art de tr\u00e8s bonne facture et la direction artistique respecte les codes du Sentai.

Eventually you'll realize that maybe not everything is just a special effect but the game rarely abandons its humour and will keep throwing references your way. You'll also have to manage your studio by buying upgrades and deciding which contracts to sign for marketing: while studio upgrades are a straightforward \"more is better\" story ad agencies all provide different bonuses to fights/ audience/ money gained letting you customize your experience a bit.\n\nMost fights feel fair and some can be easy as long as you upgrade your equipment and play decently but, at times, you might end up making a bad decision due to not being able to see whether an enemy'll be in range of your rifle or how far you'll be able to throw teammates before you actually move: this is where an undo button'd have worked wonders in case you misjudged a distance-which is not as hard as it sounds- or just misclick. Mecha fights are enjoyable at first but they get dull quite fast as you're basically just chaining a combo, doing the \"click to defend\" minigame on enemy turn, and unleashing a special move when needed: it's not bad per se but the number of fights and the repetitive gameplay make the novelty value fade fast. Last but not least the crafting system is a bit of a chore as you'll be using materials dropped from fights or bought to build new costume pieces and weapons, sadly they come with random properties so it's mostly luck based whether you'll be getting something decent or useless: in the end you can either reload your save and try again or just buy some all around decent stuff from the shop directly.\n\nChroma Squad offers a good amout of fun, if limited in variety, gameplay enriched by an amusing story and narrative: it's good entertainment made even better if you have even just a passing knowledge of the sentai genre.", "timestamp_created": 1460546650, "timestamp_updated": 1460709877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22387627": {"recommendationid": "22387627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079731784", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479091788}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "A tactical rpg game with sentai theme.

But I do know the tropes quite well and have heard more than enough about them to get the gist. Chroma Squad is a love letter to those shows, and you should expect them to follow those standard formulas. I found it to be an absolute blast, especially as an SRPG lover. Take a look below to see all the reasons why.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*]While I like SRPGs in general, this one hooked me and wouldn't let go. The gameplay is addicting. Every episode has different objectives and maps, and it is a lot of fun to figure out how to best impress your audience while winning the fight. It keeps the core gameplay strong while adding enough variables to make the on-foot fights fresh.\n[*]There is a crafting system that  works well. You can make some nifty equipment with materials that randomly drop. Sometimes the shop equipment will be better, and you always receive gold after each level. So even if you bomb during a crafting session, you have good resources to fall back on.\n[*]Grinding does not exist. There is no experience present, and the only thing you can earn from each level is randomly dropped items, which cap off at eight per level. I approve of the levels all being scaled by equipment per season, rather than by level. You can even mix up the order you play groups of episodes in!\n[*]You have a lot of freedom with your characters. You can select different designs for the squad of five, name them, choose their skills, equip them accordingly, and make some great set-ups while utilizing a \"role\" structure. As a bonus, you get to name your studio, catch phrase, and robot, among other things.\n[*]The story starts off a bit standard, but it evolves into a fun plot. The build-up is excellently done, and the development your characters get helps a lot. I grew very fond of my squad and was sad to finish their story, though happy with how it ended.\n[*]There are three endings, and while I have only gotten one of them, I get the feeling they are each very different. Along with this, some choices come up throughout the plot that have an impact on the battles and story overall. It is great to have a reason to replay it beyond simply wanting to play it.\n[*]Very good graphics all around! The characters look distinctive and have well-done designs, the giant robot and enemies look hardcore, and the TV screen openings/endings/loading screens are nice touches. It is a colorful game that is pleasing to the eye.\n[*]The music is fan-ta-stic! The opening theme alone made me go, \"Oh heck yes,\" and the rest of the game kept that quality. You can buy the soundtrack for $3.99, which is more than worth it. I know I'll pick it up when I have some more funds to spare.\n[*]Of course you get a giant robot to fight in. Why wouldn't you? I like the way it works overall. Defending requires precise timing with your clicks, which is of a fair difficutly. But trying to hit the kaijus multiple times is problematic. I missed far more 70% opportunities than I hit with. Bad luck? Most likely, but it can be frustrating. I still call the robot fights a plus due to their epic feel and most of their mechanics, yet unlike the on-foot fights, there is not a whole lot of variation. The developers mentioned they want to strengthen this part of the game, which would be great.\n[*]Speaking of the developers, they are very friendly people who take fan comments and suggestions into account. They are constantly striving to improve Chroma Squad. Having people like them as the creators of this game makes me think it will become even better. That is incredible to consider, given that they already have produced an amazing piece right here. Their tribute to sentai shows is masterfully executed, and I love their dedication to that.\n[*]There are 43 achievements that you can get, and most of them are not too difficult. As a bonus, if you beat the game on a higher difficulty level, you get achievements for that level and all of the ones below it. I wish more games would do this instead of insisting you play on easy mode after beating hard mode, all for the sake of an achievement.\n[*]Okay, look. You control a group of people in colorful suits fighting evil cupcakes, lawyers, irons, badgers, and television sets with martial arts, wacky weapons, and a giant robot made out of cardboard boxes. What else do I need to say to get you to buy this?[/list]\n\n[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b]\n[list][*]The analog stick movement with the PS3 controller seems a bit floaty. I am not sure how it is for other types of controllers. Using the mouse keeps the movements sharp. Thankfully, this is not a game that requires quick analog movements, so it is not a big deal.\n[*]Speaking of controllers, you can't use the controller for the kaiju fights. Again, not a big deal, especially since there are not many commands used in them. It is somewhat bothersome to have to set the controller aside, but the store page does say it is only partial controller support. My PS3 controller actually worked in every other situation (besides typing out the names for my heroes/studio,) so that was a pleasant surprise given that I wasn't sure how well it would respond.\n[*]There is no New Game+. Some games are not suited for New Game+, but this one begs for it. The good news is that the developers have acknowledged the lack of a New Game+ and are trying to implement it. I would be very happy with that addition!\n[*]What this game does have are multiple save files. I like this feature. The problem is that there is nowhere in the game that makes it obvious this is possible. I thought I would be erasing an old file when I started a new one, and only then learned it keeps multiple files.\n[*]This game does have trading cards. They look nice and are a good addition for collectors.[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*]If you have more than a certain amount of weapons or armor in your inventory, you can only see a handful to equip. You can't scroll through them to get an older item if you want it. Since I like to have one copy of each item in most of my games, this drove me bonkers. You can still recycle the old items, you just can't get to them on the equip screen. Ugh!\n[*]When using the keyboard controls, the mouse pointer shows over the game pointer. I don't know if there is a way to disable that. If there is, I couldn't find it. That is the main reason I used a controller, as when you are using the analog sticks instead, the mouse pointer vanishes.\n[*]There are some spelling and grammar errors scattered throughout the game. Most of them are not that noticeable, and they do not interfere with the story, but they are worth mentioning. The oddest one I saw was weapons that you craft saying \"any role\" can use them, when in truth some are limited to certain roles.[/list]\n\n[b]Overall experience:[/b]\n\nI was excited to play this game, and it surpassed even those expectations. It satisfied me not only as an SRPG, but as a stand-out tribute to a great genre. It is charming, fun, and has fantastic spirit. I've beaten it once, but I plan to play it at least two more times. It's too good not to!\n\n[b]Rating:[/b]\n\n9/10. I was leaning toward 9.5/10, but there's a few issues that drag it down a little too much for me to give that precious half of a point. That being said? This game is awesome and playing it will make you feel more awesome as well. Join in on the sentai love and pick up Chroma Squad now!\n\n[quote]Looking for more great indie games?

It hooked me in for the first playthrough, and I'm going back for a second and third because there are alternate endings(though the lack of any option to keep multiple saves DOES mean you need to replay the entire thing... which is kind of a shame). The soundtrack is unbeatably enjoyable and a lot of the jokes are just plain good. \n\nIt's clearly a first-time product from an indie studio, it has rough edges, but you can feel that it's full of love despite it, and that makes you love it too.

The game has some rough edges, but is a solid all around tactical RPG.\n\nLong Version:\n\nIf you're into tactical RPGs like X-COM, then this is a fun 10-15 'light' experience.  The angle (you're stuntmen from a Power Rangers-esque TV show that get in a fued with the director and decided to start a new show) is original and can be pretty amusing.  For better or worse, you can fast forward through most the story.  I wish there was an in between, where you could read the cupious amount of story text quickly without reverting to warp speed, but it's either painfully slow or hyper speed.  The other thing holding the game back is a bit of UI/tutorial polish.  The game, especially in the beginning, rapidly unlocks new features, but never really even tells you they're there, let alone what everything means.  It's not a deal breaker, but I could imagine going through significant chunks of the game without realizing some suped up ability or item was available.\n\nThe other drawback of the game is the QTE Mecha mini-game that ends many of the episodes.  You basically are given a % chance to hit on a punch, to continure your combo, and have the option to switch to defense or lay a power move on.  Needless to say, you will feel the burn of the RNG when you miss 3 or 4 consecutive ~75% swings, each time taking massive damage because you can't properly defend when you miss.  You thene have a little bar that you have to click when it's in the right zone to deflect as much damage as possible.  I only 'lost' 3 or 4 times playing through the game, and every time it was in the mecha game.  Kudos for trying to mix it up with a different paced bit, but it's too rough around the edges, especially compared to the relatively tight tactical RPG play.\n\nSpeaking of the 'RPG' aspect, they are definitely on the lite side.  No XP, you just unlock the next level of the skill tree when you complete each season.  No mana points either, everything is done on a x-com style cool down system (also, there is no ammo, everything can be used as many times as it cools down).  There is crafting, though it's not very well explained.  The advantage of crafting is that the gear has a few set attributes, plus a few random attributes to it that MAY make it better than the items you just buy outright.  But you never know until you craft it, and you can't compare a craft item to your current gear until you actually make it.  You also have to combine lower craftable items into better items, and then better items again, to be able to craft the good stuff.  This, again, is never really explained and buried on a submenu - I didn't know I could do it until Season 5 (of 6), and until then, I was confused on what the point of a crafting system was when you never got the materials you needed to craft.  Turns out, I had plenty, but I had to combine my 75 rolls of regular tape into 15 rolls of silver tape, and then those 15 rolls into 5 rolls of gold tape...which I could then use to buy the pimp stuff.\n\nIf tactical RPGs are your thing, this is a nice light experience.  I imagine it has pretty low system specs, so it would probably be good on a laptop, though the Unity engine chugs occassionally, especially during the mecha scenes.  Definitely worth picking up for a few bucks or in a Humble Bundle.", "timestamp_created": 1456993671, "timestamp_updated": 1456993671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21574757": {"recommendationid": "21574757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091682568", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471211801}, "language": "english", "review": "I friend gifted me this game so I just wanted to shout out a big thanks to him!\n\nThis game... is awesome. I love the concept. Created by Behold Studios, Chroma Squad is essentially a Power Rangers management sim. You get to make your own squad and customize your team to fit your desires of having one of the best or lamest Sentai teams ever!\n\nThe story is that a bunch of stuntmen quit their old job because they believe their director lacks creativity and want more creative freedom. The plot really goes off the rails later on but it's fun to watch. The dialogue of your team is super corny but I loved it however if that's not your thing then it might be something to consider if you're planning on getting Chroma Squad. The dialogue is filled with puns, references and enough fourth wall jokes to make Deadpool blush.\n\nVisually it looks nice, it's some nice pixel graphics. I don't think they use it as a lazy excuse since it's nice good to look at and there is detail in the game. Not the heaviest but enough to distinguish everything easily. The music is personally one of the best parts of the game. This is some really good chiptune music, it has some great soundtracks that get you pumped up for a boss battle and my personal favourite \"This is Cerebro\" is so campy and so catchy. \n\nThe gameplay itself, when fighting is a tactical RPG. A pretty fun one, the game has an emphasis on team attacks which is pretty cool and works with the theme. You got abilities and cool weapons for the different classes to play around with and a cool chunk of bosses. You also get finishing moves for them which is pretty sweet as well. One thing that does bother me a bit is that a lot of the time the game can be too easy but then there is a huge difficulty spike in the last level. What is that all about?\n\nWhen not in normal combat you're doing one of two things. The first is managing your studio, it's fun as you have to upgrade the studio, buy or craft new gear, hire agencies to promote your show, check emails and all that managment sim stuff. The other is the mech combat. It wouldn't be Power Rangers without a giant mech battle in almost every episode. It can be fun but really it just comes down to chance whether attack or block attacks. It looks cool but it's pretty shallow.\n\nTo conclude my mad ramblings I of course like this game a lot! It's one of those games I wished I played earlier when it came out last year. If you understand the basic core material you'll have a lot of fun with it.  If you've never heard of Power Rangers AT ALL or know exactly ziltch about it then I wouldn't reccommend this to you.

There are also some RPG elements outside of combat, such as allocating skill points, crafting and buying upgrades.\n\nAfter completing most maps you join together and go into a giant mecha to fight the boss of the map again, with a different combat style which is focused on timing the hits and using a limited number of different abilities. This is a nice addition for the first few times, however it is not nearly as fleshed out and feels like an after thought. And seeing as how you have to do a bunch of these fights I'm quite sure everyone will get tired of them before the end of the game.\n\nThe story is reasonably entertaining, although it can become tiresome to follow since it is delivered solely through text boxes of the main characaters, and you have to wait for each one to finish scrolling in order to move on to the next one. So if you read much faster than the game scrolls then you're going to have to do a lot of waiting. There is an option to fast forward through everything, however it is not really useful if you still want to follow the story since the fast forward skips everything.\n\nAnd the game does go a little overboard with the pixel artstyle, I certainly would have liked more definition and fluid animations. Also the overall design starts to become stale with time, especially since this is quite a long game.\n\nI would easily recommend Chroma Squad to any fan of the tactical turn based combat style.\n\n7 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1454806070, "timestamp_updated": 1454806070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20999807": {"recommendationid": "20999807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062992404", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475339606}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00d3timo jogo.

Each \"class\" has their own unique set of skills, with customization diverse enough so that there is very little repetition. A lot of this game's achievements can be accomplished on the first run, but to get them all you will have to play the game at least three times. And if you get stuck, the community has already figured them out. After you beat the game, I reccomend sticking around after the credits for each run, and you will be pleased by what comes after, but stick around until you get forced out of them to get information that will complete the story more and more.

There aren't many ways to mitigate damage during combat. It feels like enemies can attack at arbitrary ranges and move across the map at will. All-out attack is usually the best option, tempered only by the games scoring system, which encourages drawing fights out longer. Even seven hours in, I only have access to one crowd control skill, and very limited area attacks.\n\nThe crafting system seems expansive, but the game is very stingy with crafting materials, which is a problem for the mech combat minigame.

Parece que at\u00e9 o detalhe do gr\u00e1fico ser \"16 bits\" acaba remetendo a essa nostalgia. O jogo \u00e9 bem colorido, cheio de vida e piadas realmente engra\u00e7adas. Tudo tenta ser bem \u00fanico e com aquele estilo e detalhe pr\u00f3prio.\n\nA trilha sonora, que excluindo a m\u00fasica do menu, n\u00e3o conta com m\u00fasicas instrumentadas ou cantadas. Tudo remete a uma decada onde os poucos bits for\u00e7avam os desenvolvedores a trabalhar em sons com \"ritmos digitais\". De certa forma, a trilha do Chroma \u00e9 muito show, a musica do vil\u00e3o, principalmente, gruda como chiclete... ^_^  O detalhe gr\u00e1fico do jogo \u00e9 muito bacana, por mais minimalista que tenta ser, os detalhes em coisas que muitos nem ligariam est\u00e3o l\u00e1. Acho que o pecado s\u00f3 fica pela roupa do Squad, que independente se o personagem for mulher, homem ou \"ser\", o sprite do her\u00f3i fica igual. A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 muito boa, sem dar spoiler, voc\u00ea come\u00e7a achando bem boba e engra\u00e7ada, pra n\u00e3o dizer uma par\u00f3dia completa dos sentais, por\u00e9m da temporada 3 em diante o caldo come\u00e7a a engrossar e o tom fica mais s\u00e9rio, n\u00e3o abandonando o humor completamente.\n\nDas coisas que n\u00e3o gostei, foi a diferen\u00e7a de dificuldade. No modo F\u00e1cil, as coisas v\u00e3o seguindo naturalmente sem esfor\u00e7o at\u00e9 o chef\u00e3o final. No Normal, s\u00f3 dificulta mesmo na \u00faltima temporada. O Dif\u00edcil \u00e9 extremamente injusto. Eu fiquei com a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o que o dif\u00edcil do jogo \u00e9 a continua\u00e7\u00e3o do normal, porque a dificuldade j\u00e1 come\u00e7a mais elevada que no Normal, o que dificulta a curva de aprendizagem significativamente. Senti falta tamb\u00e9m de epis\u00f3dios que ficam de fora conforme a dificuldade. S\u00e3o poucas mudan\u00e7as, mas que acabam deixando o jogo mais curto. Tratando-se de um jogo t\u00e3o divertido, chegar ao final sem ver tudo \u00e9 um pouquinho frustrante.\n\nO jogo realmente cativou meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o, a nostalgia foi acertada em cheio. Acho que Chroma Squad tem tudo pra receber continua\u00e7\u00e3o, a criatividade os desenvolvedores tem, s\u00f3 faltam polir mais a experiencia para ela ser mais divertida e nada frustrante.

They are unhappy with their director and with the studio where they are taking the show, so they make their own, Chroma Squad! The story might have few surprises for you but the main thing are the references and jokes, you'll find many of those.\n\nGameplay is classic for turn-based action games, with exception of acrobatics - a character can hold a position so another character can ricochet himself farther (closer to your target enemy). You can expect about 30 levels (split into 5 \"seasons\"), with repeating basic enemies but original bosses, which will make you laugh and, some later ones, might make you a little angry. You have to try hard.\n\nBut I don't want to scare you, I've played on \"Interesting\" difficulty (take it as normal) and I think it was perfectly balanced experience. I had times where I've almost didn't beat the level (last [strike]man[/strike] Power Ranger standing!) and I've never felt the game was too easy, so I always felt motivated to do my best.\n\nAnyway, Chroma Squad would totally suck if they weren't able to form into a huge mech. And guess what, you will have a mech action too! But don't get too excited for that, mech fights have completely different fight rules, there is no positioning strategy and your attacks are based on your luck.\n\nVisuals are presented in neat pixelart style, combined with nice sound effect and soundtrack, which contains even a Japanese theme song! Everything gets you to the right mood pretty fast, so you can enjoy everything developers made - and there's a lot of content to see.\n\nChroma Squad is definitely worth recommending, I've enjoyed it for more than 10 hours and might even try to play it later again on higher difficulty for another endings. If you are looking for  turn-based RPG, pixelart and want many pop culture references, you'll love it!\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n- [b]Extensive system of skills, upgrades, items and crafting[/b]. You'll spend minutes in management windows between fights and you won't mind it at all! \n- [b]Well-made turn RPG and strategy gameplay[/b]. \n- [b]Funny dialogues[/b] that perfectly fits into the silly story of stuntmen running a TV show, that changes their lives.\n- [b]Specific unique tasks for every single battle[/b]. So if you think it's too easy, try to do something more and complete them - you'll be more popular, if you can do it.\n- [b]Fair pixelart graphics[/b].\n- [b]Doesn't get repetitive[/b]. There are many mobs that are getting reused pretty often but you can (on most levels) expect a new and original boss with his unique skills. Also, every season, each of your characters get a new skill!\n- More difficulties, more endings.\n- Good sound effects and soundtrack.\n- Steam achievements.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- [b]Kaiju fights[/b]. They are too much based on luck, you just see your % chance to hit your enemy... and hope you'll hit it.", "timestamp_created": 1452985316, "timestamp_updated": 1466837667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20554922": {"recommendationid": "20554922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141366492", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444684291}, "language": "english", "review": "A Love letter to 90's sentai series and tactical rpg fans.

Came into the game with pretty \"meh\" expectations and was blown out of the water.\n\nAs someone who watched Power Rangers when I was little, this game is an absolute nostalgia trip, while at the same time parodying a lot of the tropes of the sentai genre. The game starts with the protagonists getting a tutorial from their overbearing boss before quitting to form their own sentai studio. You get to name all your rangers, choose their colors (Even if the palette is rather limited), their mecha, their catchphrases, etc. Though this has no impact on gameplay whatsoever, it adds nicely to the fantasy of running your own show. \n\nGameplay is a relatively simple TRPG where you can only have one of each class, Assist, Tech, Assault, Scout, and Lead. This prevents a lot of the cheese strategies that are common in TRPGs like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. This game's difficulty in actual fights is usually pretty low. Instead the difficulty comes from getting your Audience meter filled up and then keeping it filled. The best way to fill it up is by doing flips, team moves, special attacks, and Director's Instructions, which are special submissions that can range from \"Don't lose any of your team members\" to \"win in 5 turns\" to \"Defeat the boss before defeating any minions.\" The gameplay, despite being turnbased, really does a great job of showing how a sentai show usually plays out, and its very easy to see how cool everything would look to the eyes of a child watching the show at home. The only major gameplay flaw is that my scout always felt useless. Next to the rapid-fire skills of the Tech, the massive healing from the Assist, the raw damage and acrobatics bonus of the Assault, and the tankiness of the Lead, the Scout... moves an extra space every turn. This would be alright if his damage were anything special, but either my choice of actor or gear for my scout meant that he was consistently doing less damage than the healer. Though the scout does get several crowd control abilties, they all require him to be in the midst of battle, and the Scout's frailty means that these are very risky to use past Season 3.\n\nGraphics are psuedo 16-bit, bright colorful and cheery graphics with some great sprite art. Not quite on the same level as Undertale's sprite art, but its all still very appealing. Boss designers are all unique and, with a few exceptions, creative. Though you'll be fighting in th same 7 or so locals a lot, I'm willing to write that up as part of the parody. Besides, the locations are all great looking and have enough functional differences from one another to keep you on your toes.\n\nThat's not to say the game is perfect. While the game is generally humorous, there are more than a few spots where I felt as though the game was expecting me to laugh and I didn't. Mecha fighting is pretty boring and one dimensional, and is usually the worst part of any mission its included in, which is a shame since a lot of its moves and parts are references to Mecha anime like Gurren Lagann and NGE, references I would appreciate a lot more if it wasn't part of the most boring part of the game. There's crafting, which is already a very played out mechanic that seems to pop up in every game nowadays, but at least here it fits the fantasy of everything on a sentai show being handmade and crappy looking. There's also multiple things that seem to ride the line between satire and unironic crapiness. When you reach Season 3, most of that season's plot revolves around your Lead growing an ego, which is a trite and boring plot line used in every sentai show ever. Are you trying to make fun of these trite and boring plots, Chrome Squad, or was your plot for Season 3 just trite and boring? Or did I just answer my own question?\n\nDespite those flaws, I'd be wrong if I said this game was bad. The game just has so much heart and dedication put into it, the gameplay is fun, the visuals were colorful and the plot is meta-tastic goofiness. While the game didn't make me burst out laughing or bawl my eyes out, it was just so delightful I can't help but recommend it.

Como eu tinha dito, metade de Chroma Squad \u00e9 um jogo do estilo Tycoon, onde voc\u00ea se torna respons\u00e1vel por organizar e controlar um est\u00fadio indie de um Super Sentai. Isso envolve desde reunir materiais como massinha de modelar/fita adesiva para \"craftar\" os equipamentos dos personagens, a fazer upgrades no estudio, como comprar lanternas melhores, fazer contratos com ag\u00eancias de publicidade etc. e tal.\n\nQuanto \u00e0 outra metade, Chroma Squad \u00e9 um jogo de RPG Estrat\u00e9gico. Voc\u00ea tem controle de 5 personagens de um Super Sentai, cada um com suas pr\u00f3prias habilidades e estilo de jogo. As batalhas ocorrem em torno de um sistema de audi\u00eancia (afinal, \u00e9 um seriado), onde as a\u00e7\u00f5es dos personagens aumentam a audi\u00eancia do epis\u00f3dio, que no final entram como f\u00e3s e lucros para o est\u00fadio para compra de equipamentos e upgrades. Como o mesmo visa emular um seriado, o gameplay \u00e9 dividido em epis\u00f3dios, e assim como nos Super Sentais, quase sempre ter\u00e1 um \"Boss Monster\" no final de cada epis\u00f3dio. \n\nEm alguns epis\u00f3dios tamb\u00e9m haver\u00e3o as Mecha Battles, nas quais os her\u00f3is \"pilotam um rob\u00f4\" para lutar com uma vers\u00e3o gigante do monstro. O rob\u00f4 em si tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 uma parte do estilo Tycoon, visto que voc\u00ea pode equipar diferentes \"partes\" com diversos efeitos nele. Apesar de ter uma boa proposta, \u00e9 uma parte do jogo que ficou um tanto mal executada, pois \u00e9 altamente baseada em RNG e se o jogador n\u00e3o tiver sorte pode acabar tendo mais dificuldade do que deveria\n\nAl\u00e9m disso tudo, o jogo tamb\u00e9m segue rotas. Em v\u00e1rios momentos do jogo o player ter\u00e1 que fazer escolhas e essas escolhas podem afetar negativa ou positivamente o est\u00fadio, e inclusive alterar a hist\u00f3ria do jogo. O jogo em si tem 3 finais totalmente diferentes os quais os jogador pode conseguir, de acordo com as escolhas, apesar de que n\u00e3o d\u00e1 pra considerar nenhum deles \"Good Ending\" ou \"Bad Ending\" pois todos os finais s\u00e3o \u00fanicos a sua pr\u00f3pria maneira.\n\nChroma Squad al\u00e9m da \u00f3bvia refer\u00eancia ao mundo dos Super Sentais, tamb\u00e9m possui v\u00e1rios easter eggs e refer\u00eancias sutis (ou n\u00e3o t\u00e3o sutis) ao universo da \"cultura pop\", tornando o gameplay um tanto mais divertido pra o jogador que as entender.\nO playtime apesar de tudo n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito longo nem muito curto. Uma run na dificuldade normal, onde o jogador provavelmente n\u00e3o tem que refazer nenhum epis\u00f3dio, raramente passa das 20h, o que d\u00e1 por volta de umas 60h se o jogador quiser pegar os 3 finais poss\u00edveis.\nTamb\u00e9m vale mencionar que o jogo como se espera de um Tycoon, \u00e9 altamente customiz\u00e1vel, de forma que voc\u00ea pode escolher quem ser\u00e3o os personagens que ir\u00e3o compor o time, os seus nomes, o nome do esquadr\u00e3o, o nome do golpe finalizador do esquadr\u00e3o e at\u00e9 mesmo o nome do \"MegaZord\". Na minha opini\u00e3o isso incrementa bastante o replay value do jogo.\n\nNo geral\nPros\n-Gameplay estilo Tycoon\n-Gameplay estilo RPG Estrat\u00e9gico\n-Hist\u00f3ria envolvente\n-Escolhas que afetam o gameplay e a hist\u00f3ria\n-M\u00faltiplos finais\n-Alto n\u00edvel de customiza\u00e7\u00e3o\n-Valor de replay\n-Refer\u00eancias e Easter Eggs\n-Gameplay divertido e fluido\n\nContras\n-Batalha de Mechas um pouco mal executada\n-Sistema de Crafting um tanto dependente de RNG\n\nVisto que o jogo tem muitos pros e basicamente nenhum contra que me venha a cabe\u00e7a, minha nota final \u00e9:\n9.0/10", "timestamp_created": 1452584102, "timestamp_updated": 1452584102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20478901": {"recommendationid": "20478901", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983700258", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452492025}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked up Chroma Squad on a whim during the winter sale because it looked interesting and reminded me of my childhood with the power rangers theme.

Lo que parece divertido y simp\u00e1tico las primeras horas, acaba por convertirse en tediosa rutina, sobretodo los mal balanceados combates con el mecha. \n\nEsperaba divertirme mucho m\u00e1s, bien fuera por los combates o su humor, pero a poco que avanzan las horas, pierde toda la chispa y se queda en una mera curiosidad para la posteridad.", "timestamp_created": 1452266953, "timestamp_updated": 1452266953, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488565", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20377615": {"recommendationid": "20377615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031901172", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 7454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503020095}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted Final Fantasy Tactics in Sentai suits and was not disappointed!\n\nNo seriously, I'm calling [b]Chroma Squad[/b] a must-buy in terms of tactical RPGs. At worst, the scenarios get kinda samey, the mecha battles are more luck-based than anything, Scout class needs work in terms of role within the team and the meme-based humour might get under some delicate skins. Never mind the details; as a tactical RPG, Chroma Squad gets everything right and even dares some neat ideas concerning character statistics, combat and the money/audience system.\n\nWhat I'm saying is there's a deepness to the game despite the apparent simplicity of the setting, with clear character roles and a certain leeway in how you want them optimized. The love for the genre is genuine and goes a long way in enhancing your experience; it's more than just shooting aliens as in X-Com. Building an audience to gain money and better toys is a welcome change from XP grinding. The grid movement can be unforgiving what with the inability to take back a move but I feel as this just adds to the challenge factor.\n\nIn short: the core of the gameplay is great and the further you get from the tactical RPG, the worse it gets. I can't fault a game for false notes when it's just being overly ambitious. An original backdrop for an RPG, multiple story paths, clever insertion of Kickstarter backers into the story and the fact I've encountered no game-breaking bugs despite a Report button makes me want to heavily endorse this product.

The game's main difficulty is based on if you choose to the the mission objectives, from hit the boss every turn, win in 5 turns, or finish the boss with a finisher. The game is filled with references that just comes and goes from video games, to pop culture the games has cheesy diologue. The crafting system is somewhat of a mess so I just stick to the shop. The mec combat is bare bone with realy no differences with attacks just the animation that happens. But even with thous complants it acctualy makes the game more true to how a noraml Power Rangers epiosode happens, (story, simple fight, transform, beat boss, boss gets bigger, mec battle, end episode). Overall the campyness and the gameplay make me suggest this game if you have the money and a week end to waist. \n\n\nP.S.

The concept of former stuntmen making their own TV studio that you control mixed in with strategy RPG combat was a fresh idea in a landscape full of zombie survival games and minecraft clones. But having just finished the game, it failed to deliver on so many levels.\n\nPROS:\n- Great overall concept.  Run a TV studio while having your stuntment meet certain criteria in strategy RPG battles.\n- The art style is interesting and has character.  The costumes pay homage to the various costumes seen in shows like Power Rangers.\n- The music works well enough for what it is.\n\nCONS:\n- The studio management aspect of the game is very under developed.  Most of the choices, from the type of camera you use to the marketing agency that you hire, are shallow and don't offer more than slight bonuses here and there.  For example, you can have your marketing agency put up your actors for an award, but all that will do is increase your fan power, which is used to activate marketing agency policies.\n- Objectives in battle could have been more varied.  As it is, there are 3 primary objectives that you'll see:  1. Kill X amount of enemies, maybe with Y time; 2. Kill the boss with a team member/team attack/finishing move; 3.  Keep everyone alive/above 50% health.   This is disappointing because, being a TV show that you make, you could have gone with more interesting objectives, especially if you the player could set them.\n- The writing is not very good.  The story seems to be unsure on whether it wants to play a particular scene straight or comically, and so flip flops between the two extremes awkwardly.  In addition, the story progression is very clunky and poorly executed.\n- The game is unfunny.  Most of the \"humor\" comes from blatant references to pop culture outside of the genre (such as a Robocop/Tiger hybrid.  That's it, that's the joke), with a smattering of poorly constructed puns to tie it all together.\n- The localization is not very good.  The game was clearly translated by somebody that does not have very good command of the English language, as much of the text and dialogue just reads wrong to a native English speaker.

But I also know that graphics shouldn't be a reason to determine whether to buy/play a game at all. The worst that can happen with a good game of which you don't like the graphics is that you might think \"well, it could look better\". And as we all know, if you have to say that it's just [i]the worst[/i], right?\n    [*]It has an 8-bit soundtack.\nWell, technically it's not 8-bit at all. Ultra fakebit, I'm telling you. Everyone who's ever listened to chiptune should notice immediatly. Noobs.\nFor me it was the same as with the graphics at first - I just can't hear it anymore. And still, the soundtrack is super catchy + fits the game perfectly, although I feel like it could contain a few more tracks. Then again, the theme song is not just catchy, but also funny.\n    [*]Speaking of which, the game itself is pretty punny.\nYes, it's definitely one of the funnier games you'll see. Not necessarily the funniest, because it's not Portal. However, although I've always been looking forward to seeing new boss monsters, because of their funny names or puns they came up with, I felt like the humor was innocuous. Of course humor doesn't always have to be ironic/sarcastic/critical - I just feel it wouldn't have hurt sometimes.\nOh, hold on, there was this one situation where they were directly referring to Anita Sarkeesian's Tropes vs. Women in Videogames series, which I found absolutely hilarious, very well placed and well executed. [b]Good job Behold Studios![/b]\n    [*]Although it's not a very long game in and of itself, it felt unnecessarily prolonged after around season 3 in the game. It was basically the same thing over and over again, until the game ended. Most episodes you make go like this:\nFight minions, fight minions and boss, fight mecha battle against same giant boss.\nThat's probably the weakest part about the game and the one thing I would personally hold against it. Still, I managed to beat the game just yesterday and right now I'm actually in the mood to play it again, with different actors.\n   [*]The fighting system is tactical and has it's own profundity, while remaining simple. It's really a good balance.\nAlthough, of course, I personally would put the fighting system and the game itself into the more casual corner with the other more casual fighting systems and the other more casual games.\n[/list]\n[b]\ntl;dr\n\nWhen trying to summarize my experience, I would absolutely recommend anyone (meaning all of my friends and you) to buy this game and at least play the first two to three seasons (the game progresses in seasons) of it, to see if you'd like to continue or stop.

It's very appealing to look at.\n - The soundtrack is decent, albeit forgetable.\n - Changes in armor and weaponry are actually shown on the sprites, which makes equipping new gear feel much better.\n - The Teamwork function is pretty neat. It allows for some pretty interesting tactics in combat. Having one character toss another character in order to move them closer to an enemy is a cool way to move around the map. I just wish it was more fledged out. I feel like this would be a great feature if it was just developed a bit more.\n\nCons\n\n - The game is very easy. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I'm having no trouble so far.\n - Customization feels pointless. It doesn't matter what you call your crew, your show, your attack names, etc. It's just there for the sake of having it as a selling point.\n - The writing is terrible. It actually has smileys - :) - written in speech bubbles. As though the characters are somehow able to pronounce \":)\". Furthermore, not an hour in and the game blatantly tries to push an agenda down your throat by (poorly) criticizing the \"damsel in distress\" trope. A character mentions that his sister would like to appear on the show in respone to them needing someone to play the role of hostage, which another character immediately says they cannot allow, and they find a male person to play the role of hostage instead. It's never explained WHY having a woman in that role would be bad, they just say it's bad.\n - You cannot influence the episodes in any way. How you take out enemies, how many of your crew members go down in battle, how long it takes, etc... All of that only influences how many fans your show gets, and it's all completely arbitrary. (A hero falling in battle for any reason will cause you to lose viewers, while something as simple as moving a hero around on the map can cause you to gain viewers.)\n - Mecha battles are insultingly simple. You have the option to either attack or defend. You can attack as many times as you want, but your chance to hit decreases with each succesful strike. Defending ends your turn and gives you a bonus to defense, which increases the more times you've hit your opponent this turn. On your opponent's turn, you just click the mouse button at the right time to reduce damage. Eventually, you gain access to a finishin move, which deals high damage and ends your turn instantly. That's all.\n\nI came into this expecting something like Agarest mixed with Game Maker Tycoon. I have to say, I'm very disappointed. Even if you're a huge fan of Sentai shows, I imagine the cringy dialogue, boring story, and shallow gameplay will start to rub you the wrong way eventually.\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone, and it is certainly not worth the asking price.

It's simply awesome. Fun, light-hearted, cute, self-aware and full of references - most of which I probably didn't get, but hey! How fun this game must be for people who love Power Rangers and similar TV series! But fear not! Even if you know almost nothing about this sort of stuff, you'll still find something for yourself :).\n\nPros:\n+ choose your own team - Want to have all female squad? Here you go! Or maybe men only (men dressed as panda by any chance...?). Why not! But how about... A robot? Or an alien? Or maybe even a beaver? \n+ crafting, managing your own studio, buying upgrades, fan mails... Don't you have a feeling that sometimes game developers give us just \"naked\" game, without any substance besides main action? Well, you won't have this feeling here.\n+ graphic - I cannot imagine better graphic style for this game.\n+ music - simply awesome. I think Lord Gaga's theme will stay in my memory for pretty long time. \n+ tons and tons of references! \n+ funny, self-aware, full of intended cliches. If it won't make you laugh, it'll at least make you smile.\n+ awesome, hilarious enemies.\n+ challenging but not frustrating - I finished game on medium difficulty. It can be pretty challenging when you try to fulfill all goals, but still it's not that hard that you want to throw your PC out ;).\n\nSadly, there are also cons:\n- too long fights. Not all of them, of course, some are very quickly, but there's tons of fights that just take too much damn time and it's not because player don't use proper strategy. No, no. It's because there are fights with tons of enemie's minions and each one of them need to make a move, EACH turn, and sometimes it really takes forever. And if you add mines/sprouts to that... It's just hell. And I don't think there's a way to skip it. There was a time, when I literally step away from my computer for a few minutes and when I get back, last enemies were still moving.\n- mecha combat - it breaks my heart, but it may be one of the weakest points of this game. Of course you need to have huge robots and huge monsters with the game heavily inspired by Power Rangers. And don't get me wrong, crafting upgrades for your Mecha is pretty interesting, but fight itself... Boring and repetitive. If Mecha battles were reserved only for final episodes/bosses then maybe I wouldn't have this opinion, but they are a regular part o game. And they look exactly the same. You make combos, that ends with special move/defense or just because you didn't manage to do another attack. Then your opponent attacks - always three times (and sometimes there's a special move). You defend yourself by clicking in the right moment. And then the process continue. Regular fights are fun (if they don't take too long), because you have different enemies, with different skills, minions, attacks, goals etc. Here, no matter who your opponent is, fight ALWAYS looks the same. There's no much strategy involved.", "timestamp_created": 1450195066, "timestamp_updated": 1451283564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19702488": {"recommendationid": "19702488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999820149", "num_games_owned": 965, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450132165}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought game on sale, would buy at full price.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1450134344, "timestamp_updated": 1450134344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19700768": {"recommendationid": "19700768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204547120", "num_games_owned": 1335, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450126281}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Spiel ist eigentlich sehr gut und w\u00e4ren da nicht diverse Bugs g\u00e4be es auch einen Daumen hoch.

I was thoroughly satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you enjoy retro pixel graphics, role-playing games (RPG), squad-based tactical combat, superheroes, kaiju, and management mechanics (television studio), then you will absolutely adore Chroma Squad.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in every model and object is very high. The sound effects and music are good and add a lot to the retro feel. You can even fast-forward cutscenes and it will appear like a VHS (if you were alive to remember what those are lol) tape. The story is funny and decent, and there is a very good twist that recaptured my attention. Admittedly, near the end-game I would just fast-forward through any of the cutscenes. There are a number of choices you will encounter, changing the story and encouraging multiple playthroughs. I love how equipping different armor (helmet, boots, etc) and weapons actually changes the look of your characters - I have always been the biggest aesthetic whore. A nice detail is how newer seasons introduce better equipment (like transitioning from handmade/cardboard equipment to plastic) - and the appearance of each item reflects the quality level. You also have a giant mech, and end-game mechs look so much more badass than the starting one. These aesthetics accurately capture your gameplay progression from a low-budget mom & pop company to a AAA brand.\n\nControls are easy to learn and typical of turn-based tactics games. The tutorials are very informative and every element of the game is explained well enough so that you won't have to look up guides (unless you want some extra tips). The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with turn-based tactical games - the most challenging part of the game is maintaining your entire studio (specifically, your equipment) properly match the enemy's prowess after each episode. Each season is split into multiple episodes, and new seasons introduce new enemies, equipment, and other things.\n\nGameplay begins in the studio, where you can craft/buy equipment for your actors/mech to use, upgrade items in the studio for bonuses, and purchase marketing teams (which provide further bonuses). You can customize your actors and actresses' names and the catchphrases they use - like when they transform or summon their mech. As you progress through the TV show seasons, you will unlock more items to craft, buy, and upgrade. There are crates you can buy that provide random crafting materials in different tiers - crafting your own equipment is better in most cases because you also gain random attributes to your new items. Marketing teams you select will grant you bonuses depending on how many fans you have (gained after each level/episode depending on how well you perform and if you complete secondary objectives). Emails are answered in the studio hub, and some of your choices will affect future storylines and opportunities.\n\nWhen you are finished outfitting your team, you can select from different episodes to act out - some will feature mech vs. kaiju battles, others may have a guest ally appear. Secondary objectives may include defeating x enemies before transforming (once you select \"transform,\" your team will move close together and switch to their Power Ranger-like forms), executing x team moves, or winning in x turns. Completing these tasks will grant you a bonus to fans, but missing them will not deduct anything; however, you lose fans whenever a squad member is downed (brought to 0 health). In order to transform, you need to gain enough audience power (think of it as active viewers) to fill your \"transform\" gauge. There are marketing companies that give you a starting boost to this gauge, accelerating how quickly you can transform.\n\nDuring combat, you will issue orders one-at-a-time for each member - once you are finished, the enemy's phase will begin, followed by the next round. You can have your characters use \"teamwork,\" which allows you to chain together team attacks and increase the movement range of other actors/actresses. You will execute a special attack if every member of your squad attacks the same target, and you will perform a super attack if every member uses a weapon. Episodes are usually split into multiple parts, and subsequent parts will have you continue with refilled health. For some episodes, you will end with a mech battle mini-game.\n\nThe mini-game is my most favorite part - you and the enemy kaiju take turns attacking. Whenever you attack, it reduces the accuracy (but increases the damage multiplier) of the next attack. Furthermore, chaining a long attack increases the multiplier for anything you decide to do, so a good idea is to balance offence and defence - if you \"defend\" with a high multiplier, you will negate much of your opponent's damage. Your multiplier also affects any special attacks you have. If you get greedy, however, your turn will end once you miss an attack. When the enemy attacks, you have to defend at right moment, and your timing will determine how much damage you receive.\n\nAt the beginning of each new season, your characters will level up, gaining a new set of skills (you may only choose one if two are offered, however, you can swap them at will in the studio). Build/role types (ex: full healer, crit scout, glass cannons) help immensely if you plan accordingly, as the equipment you can buy/craft (and the skill types) really encourages focusing on specific playstyles for each character.\n\nCrafting - at least until the mid-game - presents an interesting challenge because the materials required to upgrade your mech are usually a higher/different tier than the items needed to upgrade your squad. There have been many times where I had to choose between upgrading all/most of my team or my mech. When you craft, you can also combine lower-tier materials to create better ingredients, however, the recipes are different depending on whether you are focusing on your mech or characters. I noticed that in the end-game this wasn't as much of a problem because I had a lot of excess money and could just buy a bunch of boxes (or items from the store).\n\nOverall, the gameplay is a lot of fun and replayability is high due to possible character builds/roles and branching storylines. If you are interested in turn-based tactical gameplay and transforming into superheroes, then you must try this game. You will love it.\n\nABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/djsfsroguereviews]@DJSF's Rogue Reviews[/url]\n\n[url=http://theroguereviews.com/]My Website[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1449825981, "timestamp_updated": 1449826175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19626098": {"recommendationid": "19626098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025304381", "num_games_owned": 691, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449815656}, "language": "english", "review": "...", "timestamp_created": 1449815724, "timestamp_updated": 1449815724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19623794": {"recommendationid": "19623794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104214670", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449958429}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game to play on steam link.

What that means is I didn't go out special to find it and buy it.[/h1]\n\nI hated the Power Rangers. I really and truly did. To this very day they make me cringe. I'm not sophisicated by any means; but I enjoy being entertained like the next person does; and watching robots continue to fake explode for like three minutes at a time simple isn't my cup of tea. The Power Rangers are so fake, so chinsy, and generally awful.\n\nBut if you make a game about dudes aspiring to be them with an 8-bit art style and tight controls; what you get, is an enjoyable experience.\n\nI like to imagine this is what the team behind Power Rangers had to actually go and do. Like, at one point, they all were just wearing rain boots and could craft plastic and stuff together to make a spiffy top hat; and then they all did shots of vodka and did an episode.\n\nIts got a crafting system that'll allow you to make better weapons and costume parts; thus improving your stats and killing the dudes faster and easier.\n\nThis game also takes a few pages out of recent Fire Emblem game's playbook in a good way and will let you use teamwork to get farther ahead in the map; or you can use them to pummel foes. Its just a bit annoying having to constantly tell them to use teamwork; and it  can ony be used once per turn. Also the game is kinda like a game of chess where you can move all your dudes and attack maybe in one turn; which again; takes me back to FE. I know FE isn't the only game that does this; but its the only one I can think of.\n\n\nThe Story is basiclly what you'd expect; its not lack-luster but its not awful; the battle system isn't creative but its also not overused and they do it well. They give you objectives that can provide bonus' if completed; and you gotta complete them. Cuz if you don't you'll just run out of money.\n\nYou can change actors for certain benefits if you want, it tries to be funny and doesn't succeed for me, everything you buy will take money from you after you buy it which I feel is quite needless; why not just let us have the buff.\n\nSo.\nIs it fun?

The tactics you implement in fights like the team acrobatics and team attacks are true to both this genre of game and the TV shows Chroma Squad draws inspiration from. There's so many different play styles you can try thanks to the no-penalty selection of skills. By no-penalty I mean that if you want to change a character's skills alter their strengths and weaknesses you can do total 180s. The freedom to experiment with different strategies really add a lot of replay value to this game. \n\nThe crafting is very thought out with different tiers organized so that there are no useless crafting items and none of them are too hard to get. The studio upgrades, mecha upgrade, shop, and agency stuff are all great inclusions that all players to go wild with improving and powering up their characters. I also love being able to make my own power rangers  including their names, colours, catch phrases, and all that other cool super hero stuff.\n\nThe visuals are pixelly, but in a good way. Behold Studios did a great job using an old-school graphics style in a cinematic and modern way. Even though everything is a clearly made from little squares, there is detail involving perspective, lighting, and various other aspects that gives this 2D world a bigger feeling. This style is similar to games like Hotline Miami and Party Hard, if you need an example.\n\nThe music is awesome, once again capturing the vibe of those 90's shows we all remember so fondly, but being modern and pleasing to the ear. The theme songs for specific characters are all tailored quite well to who they are paired with. The story at first made me think \"meh\", but after a couple episodes I was drawn into being a squad of stuntmen trying to make their way in the world independently of The Man. And even more drawn in when the stakes get raised and the stuntmen squad must become genuine heros.\n\nThere are minor quirks here or there, but none worth mentioning since they've probably already been fixed as I'm typing this. \n\n\nTL;DR: if you like incrediby well made tactical RPGs and have a nostalgia scratch to itch, then you should really play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1449109291, "timestamp_updated": 1449109291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19417207": {"recommendationid": "19417207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018046933", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448990360}, "language": "english", "review": "This game man, if you lived in the 90s and watched the power rangers on tv every sunday well... you are in for a treat.

It sounds complicated, but they kept those two elements at the simplist form. So,  the developers pulled it off nicely.  I played on the easiest difficulty because I am atrocious at both genres, but this title kept me interested.  There are a few branching storyline choices to choose from, so that's a plus as well.\n\nThe storyline is hit or miss...so I'll try to keep the spoilers to a bare minimum. Note the word try:\n\nIf you read the description, if Chroma Squad, the player runs its own Super Sentai studio/show.  The actors who decide to start their own show are all best friends who got tired of their former show's director. So the player runs the studio, and the action(Turn based strategy) is the episode being filmed. \nI wish it was that simple.  It begins to get confusing, because everyone begins breaking the 4th wall(from the show to their audience), sometimes the actors don't know if what's happening while on set is scripted or really happening, and then soon they begin to 'Morph'/Transform for real and fight real battles while its still being filmed.(In other words, the actors became real super heroes and saved the world). I sometimes got mixed up with what is real or what isn't real.  At one point, a developer comes on screen and tells the actors its all just a game and he made a glitch by mistake, is that the 5th wall being broken????\nThe gameplay was fantastic, and the retro style graphics were beautiful too.  I liked the idea of naming my studio and all the catch phrases, so the only thing I didn't like was the story, I pretty much hated it.  I wish it was either one or the other, either a Super Sentai game(Where I name the characters, catchphrases, customize colors/armor), or the same studio simulation/turn based strategy where it was kept JUST A TV SHOW without a confusing storyline.\n\n6.5/10\n\nI know alot of people love the story, and that's okay.

It has a lot of references to Sentai shows like Power Rangers and even other super hero based things like Marvel and DC to random things like Little Mermaid and Barney the dinosaur. This helps it to an extent because after a while the references were getting kind of old and repeptitive. Also on some levels the number of enemies on the field at a time is crazy and I feel as though that the game kept making more and just had a bunch in the corner standing around till more died.

Many games this generation are essentially creatively bankrupt, but Chroma Squad realizes this and challenges the standard of games today. A tycoon game with rpg gameplay and tons of customization has been completely unheard of. Fun humor and fun character designs, the game doesn't take itself seriously at all and knows its limits. It is literally self-aware of the tropes and cliches it uses. For example, in one point of the game, a girl needs to be rescued. One of the squad members questions if it should be a guy just to avoid using sexist tropes. The game knows the stupidity of generic hero-saving-the-day tv shows and utilizes it to bring out the fun that is in them easily. \n\nAlso, if you are a fan of super sentai, you will laugh your ass off at these references. I promise you.\n\n\nSubjective:\nIt's obvious just from the start of the game how much customization there is. You can customize everything- from your squad name, the names of your members, the attributes of the members, the weapons of the members, the abilities of the members, your mecha, your mecha's name, your transformation name, and way more. In theory, it sounds great, but when you get right down to it, it get's annoying. Have you ever felt the feeling of, \"Ugh, I can't choose between these great abilities/weapons! I wish the game didn't even give me an option!\" Well, half of the game is like that. It's so customizable to the point where it may ruin the enjoyment factor. Should I craft this? Should I buy this? Should I equip this? There's way too many choices. Me personally, I had only a few problems with this, considering how much I love customization in games. This is a pro or a con depending on the player.\n\nCons:\n\nRepetitive. Incredibly repetitive, to the point where you say to yourself, \"Really? This again?\" The game is oozing with creativity but unfortunately the gameplay is designed so that almost all of the fights are entirely the same. Some enemies are different, the map layout is sometimes different (and other times copy pasted), but the game throws at you the same fights over and over again just to reach the conclusion. This is easily noticeable after getting through the start of the game. \n\nNo effect on overall plot. Nothing you really do changes where the game is going. Sure, occasionally you get fans praising you for doing x or shunning you for doing y, but it doesn't really do much in the long run from what I've seen.\n\nLittle strategy. Unless playing on the hardest difficulty, you only need a bit of strategy to complete the levels. \n\nDialogue. The dialogue is sometimes humorous and creative, but really? It can be written by 5 year olds and probably be the same. The writing is pretty awful and the characters have little depth. This I get it; that's the whole point of the game. It doesn't take itself seriously and is SUPPOSED to be immature. It isn't that big of a deal, but the game could easily be better with more engaging dialogues and more clever jokes.\n\nMecha fights. Fun the first time you launch it and the first time you use a new ability you got, but otherwise? Not engaging at all, and anti-climactic a lot of the time. Incredibly repetitive. \n\nOverall though? Do I have to go through a bit of repetitiveness and subpar dialogue to enjoy a game with tons of replayability, nostalgic design/soundtrack and a unique experience? Definitely.

With that sweet, sweet 90's pixel-art nostalgia and the general \"have fun\" attitude of the game, I couldn't help but enjoy it! Not to mention that awesome music. The Nintendo/Sega-esque 8-bit style battle music is soothing to my soul.\n\nFor a Tactical-RPG it's pretty minimal in its actual \"tactical\" gameplay. That was something I personally loved, but I could easily see others hating. Differen't strokes for differen't folks. If you were looking for a hardcore, strategy heavy game... then this game most likely isn't for you. If anything, as far as strategy goes it's mainly about what you [i]build[/i] more so than what you actually [i]do[/i] during the battle sequences. I played on intermediate difficulty and not once did I have to consciously think about how I was gonna move/attack 'X' turns ahead like a game of chess. But I did have a moment where I consciously thought (and was surprised) at how captivated I was into what's basically an 8-bit power rangers rip-off with a \"behind the scenes\" twist. I think it's because of factors like the minimal strategic gameplay (as well as the storyline) that I was able to just relax and have fun with it. If you want something a little more hardcore then you'll definitely want to turn the difficulty up.\n\nThe story is easily where this game shines the most. A story that really makes you feel like you're progressing from the point of being stunt actors playing fake super heroes to becoming actual ones that [spoiler]end up saving the entire planet (and I think universe?)[/spoiler]. Another thing to note about this game is it's very satirical, emphasizing mainly on the process that goes in to shooting the episodes and production in general. The bosses are sometimes pretty ludicrous in design (and name) but this game's humor is just that, ludicrous and out there- So it fits the theme nicely. There's also multiple endings- something that I was unaware of until randomly checking out the achievements (lol). That's a pretty big bonus and adds a good bit of replayability. The story is also much longer than I expected it to be, so thats a huge bonus\n\nThe dialogue became... interesting... at times. But the rest of the game as a whole easily makes up for the questionable dialogue. When it's bad dialogue- it's intentional. It's not like it's bad because it was an earnest attempt at something that just came out wrong in translation, or something that just flat out didn't work at all. It's definitely all intentionally placed bad dialogue. Things like the game's [i]constant[/i] breaking of the fourth wall was forgiveable... but intentional typos for a laugh and putting emoji's into my game dialogue?! NO. Just, NO!\n\nThe music was fantastic and hit all the right spots. I'm considering buying the soundtrack for $5 just to make a good review for it that would probably rival this one in length. Nuff said.. It's probably what hooked me the most (next to the story) being how important music in general is to a guy like me, but I digress.\n\n[b]All in All, it's a fantastic game. I highly recommend if you enjoyed anything 'Power Rangers' related when you were younger, and just feel like having a few laughs with it now that you're older.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1444574224, "timestamp_updated": 1512010618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579051", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18426300": {"recommendationid": "18426300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098078763", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468205804}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome!

I just finished it as I type this review, their were very few things ultimately that bugged me however, nothing really that bad that I'd give it a negative recommendation, but still it bugged me.\n\nFirst you don't have one of each pieces of armor and each weapons at 'Legendary' quality, you got a pistol & a sword, I guess so those can be wielded by everyone however if you got used to wield class specific weapons its a let down that you can't have a unique Legendary weapon for each classes, also while you got one armor and two helmets for your characers armor, I found it lacking that you couldn't have boots and make a full Legendary armor, which would have been nice for the finale, but from what I seen you can't sadly, it would have been really a great idea for the very last mission at least to be able to have all your team in full Legendary.\n\nNext is New Game +, I saw the narrator after the credits mention that, it would have been great to finish your game on a level than be able to New Game + to the next difficulty level. Now the game has been out for a few months and still no  sign of that sadly. If not for a New Game + one thing that would have been great would have been to be able to replay any mission after the end or after having done them, so that you could fight again any battles, sure their might not be able to alter the storyline path you took, but just replaying the missions would have been a pretty good idea, give the game a bit more longevity. Right now the game feel limited in what you can do, since ou can't continue into a New Game + with your stuff or you can't continue in that game either , when its over its over, whatever you like it or not. I did see their is a mention of some sort of 'Episode Editor' program that would allow us to create custom episodes for endless gaming, I can't wait for it to come out.\n\nOtherwise maybe the selection of potential characters is a bit limited too, I went for a all female team and I was just able to do it, you have barely enough characters of each genders to fill in a full team, without accounting I think for the backers special characters which are... peculiar... one is an weird animal thing, one is a robot, another looked like a lazy bum, and the last is some guy with a shop discount.... but it would have been nice to have a few more picks, if I want to play a new all female team I'd be forced to go with the exact same team and the only way to change things up would be to shift whom is what... so yea, a bit lacking on that part.\n\nStill when all is said and done, this game is great, it was worthwhile for me to get it and I hope it will be expanded upon, maybe get a sequel in time, since the scene at the very end imply their could be a sequel to it, I really want it to be true, hopefully one that would correct the few issues and build up to a even greater game, but that is something we'll have to wait and see about, I really wish for it to happen, if not at least another Tactical RPG of that quality would always be welcome.", "timestamp_created": 1444419700, "timestamp_updated": 1444419700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489910", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18392395": {"recommendationid": "18392395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026220208", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444102205}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is almost the spiritual successor of Freedom Force, the tactical RPG with comic book superheroes.

No other compensation was given.\n\n[b]Introduction[/b]\n==========\nBack in the old days there were a flood of Sentai TV series: Power Rangers, Sailor Moon, Beetle Borgs, Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills, Samurai Cyber Squad, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc etc. The list goes on for quite a while. Sentai translates to \"Task Force\" or \"Squadron\" and is usually a team of heroes wearing color coded outfits or uniforms. Basically superheroes...Japanese style! Generally they come with a range of personalities/roles that usually follows some variation of the Five-Man Band. Known for their synchronized posing; also, a standard powerup pose is often used in many Sentai works during the transformation sequence. A key concept is that the collective team are more important than the individual, and that more can be achieved by working together. Chroma Squad is directly inspired by Saban's Power Rangers, and capitalizes on most of these concepts from the Sentai genre but takes it a bit further in that you are actually managing the studio shooting the TV series!\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n==========\nStarting up the game you are introduced to your team of actors/heroes, as they are in the middle of a shoot for a TV show, taking a lot of crap from their director in the process. By the end of the shoot, the actors decide to ditch their jerk of a director and start their own TV studio and sentai hero show! One of the actor's has an uncle that lends you an old warehouse where you setup your new studio. \n\nAt the start of your new career, you get to customize your team of actors, choosing what color their suit will be, the actors themselves, and change their names. You are then able to choose your studio's name, and some various phrases that will you used throughout the game, such as when your actors \"morph\" into their hero suits (\"Chromatize!\"). As a studio manager, it's your job to choose which episodes get aired and in what order. At the main screen, you can choose to buy equipment/props for your actors that boost their stats in battle scenes. You can also check yoru fan mail, which you will recieve regularly and are able to choose differents responses to. Sometimes depending on your responses you will lose or gain money and/or items. Items can also be crafted using materials you find in combat, such as duct tape and cardboard. \n\nThe main draw of Chroma Squad is in the action scenes - combat. Chroma Squad utilizes a very simple tactical RPG system in which you can move your team across a grid on the battlefield. During your \"Phase\" you can direct any of your actors in any order you choose until they've all had an action, then it's the Enemy's \"Phase\". Each character has access to a limited set of skills, and the number of skills you can use increases as you shoot more episodes and as you wrap up more seasons of the show. Your team is able to use special \"Teamwork\" actions, which can be very, very useful in dealing damage or traversing the battlefield. For example, one actor can toss another one, enabling them to cover more distance. Another example is having 2 or more adjacent actors attack the same enemy in a team attack. Lastly, if all 5 of your actors are adjacent to an enemy, you can use a Finishing Move, dealing massive damage to your target! FEAR THE POWER OF TEAMWORK! Each scene also has special challenges in the form of Director's Instructions. These can range from reaching an objective within a specfied number of turns, or defeating a certain number of minions before attacking a boss. Completing these orders rewards you with extra points that are converted into fans and money at the end of every episode. Most sentai shows had giant mech suits...such as Power Rangers' MegaZord. Chroma Squad has a similar feature! \n\nPerhaps one of the best things about Chroma Squad is the enemy designs. Early on you meet a fellow named Transitmancer -- a mage wield a staff with a traffic signal attached to the top of it. You will also meet enemies like \"The Boxing Box\"...which is literally a cardboard box with arms, wearing boxing gloves. There's way more creative ones and even some cameos, but I don't want to spoil too much of the fun!\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n==========\nIf you have played Behold Studio's previous game, Knights of Pen and Paper, you will be familiar with the art style used here. It's slightly more advanced than KoPaP, with even more details on each sprite. Combat animations, movement, and even the special attacks are very well animated and look really nice. Props look great, and like I said before character designs and enemies look amazing.\n\n[b]Sound and Music[/b]\n==========\nThis game has one of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in quite a long time. The best tracks are the battle tunes by FAR. Just let a battle start and leave it there for a few to take it in. They really get you pumped up for any challenges you are faced with! I have added most of it to my YouTube playlist reserved specially for great game music! The soundtrack is available for purchase on the Store Page for $4.99. Well worth it! Seriously, just give this a listen:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYnd0uRCkCk\n\nThe sound effects are pretty minimal, but they do their job. I can't fault the sound direction here, as it's pretty well done despite being fairly minimal. The soundtrack more than makes up for any shortcomings!\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n==========\nChroma Squad runs like a dream. No crashes, stuttering, framerate drops, or any weird glitches were encountered during my playtime so far, and I really don't expect to see any. Behold Studios is usually really good about the quality of their games, as we've seen so far. I didn't think to test the game with my controller, as mouse and keyboard worked extremely well. Probably best for this type of game anyway.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n==========\nIf you are looking for a fun tactical RPG that's a bit different and has a ton of humor, Chroma Squad fits the bill perfectly. Such a great little title, and a complete joy to play. You should not hesitate at all in buying this, it's quite the gem! The soundtrack alone is enough to justify the purchase. \n\n[b]Gameplay Demo[/b]\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/XMmY3uRXmvM\n\n[b]Nerd House Verdict[/b]:\n==========\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1442359606, "timestamp_updated": 1485057092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808706", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18034677": {"recommendationid": "18034677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048703323", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463198441}, "language": "spanish", "review": "This game is so fuckin good specially if you are a power ranger/sentai fan 420/10", "timestamp_created": 1442258145, "timestamp_updated": 1442258145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18013613": {"recommendationid": "18013613", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982025644", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442142264}, "language": "english", "review": "Cardboard and Duck Tape rangers, very enjoyable game.\n\nManage your studio and your poor rangers.

Changing difficulty settings also ruins which ending achievement you get, if you care about that.\n- You can't lose the last boss fight.

This game also has a few different possible endings, so that gives it some replay value, and since this game lets you choose different characters at the beginning as well as have your own play style, you shouldn't really be bored out of your mind replaying the game like I usually am with some other games. The price isn't really too much compared to what you get out of it, because there are a lot of ways you could customize your team to work with your play style (At least 3!.... Probably more, though...).

With that, however, a love of those fanchises is felt through the effort and minor details scattered in the stages, dialogue, and backgrounds. For instance, the statue of JAKQ's 'Big One' in the convention stage or the reference to Doggie Kruger in one of the post-stage tweets. What about the game play? Well, it plays like the tactical RPGs I love (FF Tactics, Disgaea) while still have it's own take and original elements to it. I do wish there was a big more clarity in know what can and can't be done. For example, I didn't know until Episode 3 that I could customize more then the chest of my mech by clicking on the seperate parts. There are some small nuances in the game like that that take me out of the game for a moment as I may have spent my materials differently.

You don't need a review from me. Wait, you do? Well... alright then.\n\nPros:\n+The dialouge: It's just amazing how many jokes they can state considering the setting is litterally being an indie studio group filming power rangers.\n\n+Stradegy: There's a good amount of it. I'm basing it off of just finishing Season 1, but basically you are given director tasks to appease audience, such as defeating X amount of Y monsters in Z amount of turns, or pulling off finishers on bosses which are very satisfying (when you Chromatize)\n\n+ THE MUSIC: My lord is this the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time. Kudos to the music makers for making such an amazing soundtrack (looking at you A little break from saving the world)\n\n+ Graphics: The graphics is a very vast and colorful pixelated style, and it's very appeasing to the eyes\n\n+ Fan System: Considering it's about an indie group trying to run a show, fans play a major role. They determine how much money you get, and that money goes to upgrading equipment which is the only way (as far as I can tell) to increase your stats.\n\nCons:\n-Crafting Equipment: I'm not knocking off the crafting system, I like it. The only thing that pesters me is that you don't get to see the stat increase or decrease until after you craft it, and once you craft it, you have to hope it does increases with hopefully small decrease in other stats, otherwise you have to recycle it and so far my rng of recycling has been pretty poop.\n\n-Options Menu: Totalbiscuit would probably sue me for doing this since that's his thing.. but the option system is kind of lacking. Sure the requirements would allow even my pc which is viewed as being powered by a potatoe could play it, but the resolutions are kind of hard to navigate and change.. for some reason, you have to let the game go full screen, change the resolution (for me I had to click alot to figure out how to make the slider work), then uncheck full screen, and then it'll save the resolution you want (though for those that play full screen all the time it might not be a problem). But hey at least it has a seperate audio slider for both volume and sfx. ^^\n\nThat's about it. The cool thing is that the company is now doing the long task of fixing many bugs... so it's good that they'll keep updating this game. Heck there's even a button to report bugs.

For example in one of the later levels I had to kill the boss with a certain character (\"A\") - 4 of the 6 team members were knocked out, the 2 survivors only had a few points of health left and were surrounded by powerful enemies - but the medic was *just* able to run inbetween A and the boss, so that A could leapfrog across the screen and give the boss one last punch, which was enough to win. The game is entirely set-piece scenarios, but the whole thing was like that: if someone scores a critical hit in a round all the tactics have to adapt. The other good thing is that the combat system rewards you for using sentai-hero logic, rather than X-Com logic. It's not about finding a weakness and exploting it, it's about trying and failing and returning again in a stronger form.\n\nThere are some downsides. Only 1 gamesave. There aren't any random levels which I think is quite a bold decision: the bosses and stage layouts are little works of art: I can see that just bashing randomly-placed waves of minions would get dull. But I'd still have liked to try it - some games have a horde mode where you survive as long as possible, even if it didn't work in practice it would have made me appreciate the scripting more, I think.\n\nA side effect of everything being tightly scripted (except what actually happens in a battle) is that you can't build up or replenish resources (money and crafting materials) so if you wanted to go back and try a different character build then you couldn't (not that there are many, it isn't RPG-ish, just that you can select a couple of types of equipment for each of the 5-6 set characters). The writing is a bit odd: the overarching plot is somehow *even more* disjointed than Power Rangers, and they have tried to make *every* *single* *line* into a joke: but the layer of abstraction inbetween and the way they set each episode up to satirize the genre is ingenious - almost worthy of Charlie Kaufman at points. The stunt actors are on the way to film a scene, but monsters kidnap one of them, and when the others rescue her the first thing they ask is whether she has brought any food back (on the story's logic she was off the set).\n\nThe mecha battles are both disappointing and an excellent rendition of kaiju battles. Round 1: you win. Round 2: they win. Round 3: it's really close but you power attack charges up again just in the nick of time.

The attendance machanic in general seemed a bit easy to abuse to an extent, should have a negative factor if either is overly used.\n\nHaving different characters to choose from at the beginning for each role is a really nice touch. It allowed to add in variety to characters with the abilities that affected the gameplay. This allows the player to choose how they would like to play their games, and not have a stagnant gameplay with fixed characters for the storyline only.\n\nStoryline progressed at a decent pace and was well thought out in respect to what Tokusatsu's usually revolved around. But also adding in a bit of flare by blurring reality with fiction.\n\nOne thing that was unimpressive after a few levels would be the minion's designs.

Hardest difficulty is a real BITCH!\n- Managing, beside the tactical RPG side of the game, you need to manage your characters by crafting, teching their skills, upgrading your mech, marketing, responding to e-mail where choices matter (not heavily), upgrading your studio and buying items.\n- Achievements, well done compared to most indie games.\n- Comedy & awesomeness, this game gave me laughs and goosebumps. Comedy is based on parodies of modern memes, Power Rangers and other silly stuff. I got goosebumps in the final fight, where I just got blown away by the story and momentum of it.\n- Story is well done and original.\n\nTL:DR\nChroma squad is an original indie game which has two sides of gameplay: tactical RPG and managing your party.

Everything is controlled by mouse and things like the the teamwork mechanic and skills you can switch out are things I've seen in other games, but this is one of the better ones in recent memory. Teamwork is more than just an extra person to help you attack, you can also use teamwork to get to spaces much farther on the field and pull off specials using it. This really helped me when trying to accomplish the special requirements. The game never felt imbalanced, too, which is awesome because it's the easiest trap to fall in with strategy RPGs.\n\nWhen you start a new game, you're given the option of picking your team. While I wish there was more options for party members (DLC/Chroma Squad 2?), what characters they do have are very diverse and I think they have just a right amount of options for character selections. The plot itself is the exact same regardless of who you pick, so the main reason to do this is to decide your character's starting stats and which ones you would like to see for the rest of the game, which I really like a lot. The easy way out would have been to just always have them in the suit and choose their stats, or just have your five chosen for you. It even allows there to be a possible lesbian romance later on in the game depending on what gender you pick a certain ranger. Your main five are completely customizable.\n\nAs for the story itself, it's not like a mind blowing story or anything like that, but it does it's job of feeling like the power ranger/super sentai shows the game is based on. The end goal is defeating a big bad guy, and on the way, you defeat a ton of different monsters ranging from ridiculous to...well, more ridiculous. There's also trophies, multiple endings, storyline branches, and three difficulties to add some replay value.\n\nThere's one place this game falls flat for me, and I don't think it's major, because it only really started to bother me nearing the end. The humor in this game can be funny at times, and then at other times can get a little groan worthy with the memes. I don't mind a lot of the refernces. The non-comedic ones for sentai fans in the weapons/equipment/skills that referenced a bunch of different sentai series all made me smile when I realized the references, and certain jokes work really well. At one point, they reference the \"What has science done\" image with the Seagull with massive biceps, and jokes like that and the backstreet boys/lady gaga references work really well, but when it's just meme, after meme, after meme, it starts to get a little grating, not unlike being in the presence of an middle aged person who goes on Reddit.\n\nStill, I would recommend this to anybody looking for a fun and quirky little RPG. It's definitely worth the price. I still have two more ending paths and minor storyline branches to get, so I may update this in the future, but having just completed my first playthrough, I just wanted to share my thoughts on it.", "timestamp_created": 1435853514, "timestamp_updated": 1435853514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16844123": {"recommendationid": "16844123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139716553", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466255742}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "jogo muito produzido por brasileiros mistura bem rpg tatico e graficos 16 bits sons muito bons eu q n sou f\u00e3 de rpg adorei o jogo e piadas bobas mais engra\u00e7adas", "timestamp_created": 1435846589, "timestamp_updated": 1435846589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16839438": {"recommendationid": "16839438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095435153", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478025523}, "language": "english", "review": "Just beat it for my first time, it is a fun few hours of gameplay and since they're are multiple endings and diffrent routes I will be playing it once or twice soon to see them.

I had to take some time out today to write a review for Chroma Squad, though, because this game is pure awesome. This game is a 75 on metacritic and thats a clear under-rating.\n\nYes, I'll acknowledge that Power Rangers/tokusatsu fanboyism is strong within my heart, but you do NOT have to love Power Rangers to love this game. If you can appreciate a creative tactical RPG with fun, geeky dialogue and story lines, you'll be happy with whatever they are charging for this nowadays. Oh, and choices matter!\n\nGameplay\nThe combat system is inventive and really lets the player decide how the battles will go. It's not very complicated, but its still satisfying. Think X-com. You can play with a very basic, methodical approach to the fights, or you can open up and fully utilize all the various weapons/skills in the game. Each of the characters has a particular specialty (like most RPGs) and sunergy is key. Between fights, you'll work on upgrading your characters, equipment, base; this aspect of the game isn't particularly deep, but the developer has adjusted to make it more interesting, in terms of viable options. I would say the Mecha fights are lame, however; good thing there isn't really many of them.\n\nGraphics/Music\nI'm not really a fan of pixel graphics and all that, but many people seem to love the pixel art. These are easy to judge for yourself. For this type of game, the graphics aren't important to me. But to be honest, if the game wasn't so much fun, I would probably complain about the character models. I think the environments looks pretty great, though.\n\nThe music is pure excellence if you are looking for a fully immersive experience. I tend to turn off music on games and listen to my own stuff, but this is one of the few games that I rolled through using the actual game music.\n\nStory\nIf you are a Sentai/Power Rangers fan in search of nostalgia, you don't even need this section- it's epic.\nIf you are not as obsessed with sentai as myself, you will still enjoy the hilarious dialogue and story overall. There are some complaints in this aspect because of the imperfect English (dudes are Brazilian), and also because some of the jokes are dated internet-meme jokes, so if that would annoy you then I suppose you'll need to skip through some dialogue? People who complain about the dialogue have maybe forgotten what the dialogue was like in the shows this is modeled after. The plot will surprise you, even if you don't care about sentai at all.\n\n\nTLDR\nSimplified X-com + Power Rangers + loads of content + multiple storylines = FREAKING AMAZING\n\n\nBest $15 I have spent this year, and I'm about to buy gift copies for some friends even if they don't wana play it.", "timestamp_created": 1435721638, "timestamp_updated": 1435721638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16817834": {"recommendationid": "16817834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119134358", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470337863}, "language": "english", "review": "Created myself to be the perfect lead.

I was impressed right out of the gate as the game incorporates several different genres very well and even adds several new elements that I have not seen before.\n\nThe tactical combat of the game is very enjoyable and there is much more to it than I had initially assumed.  Each episode begins with your heroes arriving on the scene and battling their enemies in their plain clothes.  While in this form you don't have access to your equipment and abilities, though you are formidable enough to go toe-to-toe with the villains all the same.  Once you transform, however, you get your costume and the previously stated abilities unlocked and you can really do some impressive things.  \n\nThe aspect of combat that really caught my attention and made this game stand out, though, is that your goal is to make every fight as cinematic as possible.  For example, every battle has two Director's Objectives that give a massive boost to the points you earn for putting on an exciting fight, your Audience.  You also gain audience for performing special skills, defeating enemies, using teamwork to give a teammate a boost (the boosted character performs an acrobatic maneuver to move additional spaces that turn), and most of all for performing unified 'team attacks' where you set your squad up in such a manner that they all focus on and attack the targeted enemy at once,\n\nThe music is enjoyable, the battles challenging and fun.  Did I mention that you get to customize the look of your gear, colors of your outfits, specializations of your stats and skills, and actors who you use for your squad?  Oh right, and you get to customize and do battle with your own mech!\n\nI can not put into words how highly I recommend this game.

For my childhood it was Power Rangers\u2026 This multi-cultural love-letter to nostalgia took over many homes in the 90s with force. Its flimsy morals and clunkily scripted acting were apparently exactly what most of the world was looking for, as we stumbled out of the cocaine-fueled haze that was the 80s. There are very few shows today that manage to galvanize fans in such massive numbers. Maybe Spongebob comes close, but he\u2019s a crossdresser who lives inside of a fruit. Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG about a tokusatsu show similar to Power Rangers. Each character has a specialized role, but are able to be slightly customized to your liking depending on the actor/equipment you choose. Chroma Squad does have a few blemishes, but is an overall amazing experience. Will it hold up for those who aren\u2019t wearing nostalgia goggles? Let\u2019s find out as we look deeper at Chroma Squad.\n\nFantastic retro style coats Chroma Squad, from the graphics to the music. While the gameplay starts out feeling extremely simple, it quickly deepens as the odds are stacked ever-higher against you. After moving you can attack, move a second time, or prepare for teamwork. Teamwork is an awesome aspect that allows your characters to toss each other around in fantastic acrobatics, or prepare a combo attack on an adjacent enemy. Teamwork attacks are an absolute necessity, as later enemies take multiple attacks to defeat. Aside from fantastic agility and teamwork, the Chroma Squad doesn\u2019t have much in the way of firepower when they\u2019re in their 28-year-old-teenager form. However, once per fight though, you can Chromatize. Transformation not only fully heals all your characters, but also unlocks a variety of special abilities. Every season you will unlock a couple of new skills to pick from, and this extends the replayability of Chroma Squad greatly.\n\nThe fights take place in a variety of sets. Some are fantastic to look at, with a variety of hazards. Others are completely stark with nothing on display except for a couple lighting guys and key grips using their bellies to knock bowls of mac\u2019n\u2019cheese off of the craft service table. At least that\u2019s what I like to imagine. The gameplay grows even deeper as you realize there are a variety of director actions you will need to follow during the combat in order to maximize your audience and gain new fans. Chroma Squad isn\u2019t all about high-flying action though. Between episodes you will need to craft equipments and gear up your heroes, choose between a variety of marketing agents with tons of different boosts, and assemble your mecha to do battle when your enemies go super-size. The management aspect is extremely interesting, and while praying to RNGsus while crafting for a decent upgrade can become a bit frustrating, it again does wonders to extend the replayability.\n\nI\u2019ve sung so much praise for Chroma Squad that I am loathe to point out the low points, but it is about that time in the review. The majority of the controls are point and click, which can be a bit of a drain when sitting for extended play sessions. The less-inspired set designs seriously break my heart, as there is much more potential than a big empty room. The story does alright, aside from some pretty blatant SJW messaging in the beginning. It might be tongue in cheek. I can really only hope. Overall I think Chroma Squad is an experience worth having, especially if you were raised on Power Rangers or Big Bad Beetleborgs or VR Troopers. There really were just a plethora of these shows on in the 90s. This is why it\u2019s pretty obvious to me why this game was so easily kickstarted, and I am positively overjoyed that Behold Studios was able to bring Chroma Squad very close to its full potential. I really do hope to see a sequel sometime in the future.\n\nGameplay:\n\n    Controls- 6/10\n    Fun Factor- 9/10\n    Difficulty- 8/10\n    Replayability- 7/10\n    Innovation- 10/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\n    Graphics- 9/10\n    Music- 10/10\n    Sound FX- 8/10\n    Story/Lore- 7/10\n    Level Design- 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 80/100 for innovation, graphics, and fun factor.\nSummary: Fantastic tactical RPG infused with humor and deceptively-deep gameplay.\nVerdict: Amazing fun. Not as replayable as something like Final Fantasy Tactics, but still worth a look.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-chroma-squad/\nFull review video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5JHWQLc0zo", "timestamp_created": 1434138947, "timestamp_updated": 1434138947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16332538": {"recommendationid": "16332538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198720235", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451325375}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00d3timo jogo,proporciona v\u00e1rias horas de divers\u00e3o!!", "timestamp_created": 1434125964, "timestamp_updated": 1434125964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16319884": {"recommendationid": "16319884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079796379", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499627139}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

After 10,000 years I'm free! Not only from the infernal hellfire of school, but from that god awful writer's block! Time to conq- write; write a review. Sorry. It's on Chroma Squad, so strap in.\n\nREVIEW\nChroma Squad\n\nGENRE\nTactical RPG\n\nSTORY\nThe year is 20XX probably. Five stunt actors with attitude are recording their parts in the most recent episode of the hit sentai show sensation: Super Rangers! The show stinks though, and so does its director: Dr. Mi Ah. [More like MAMAMiAh, amirite?] No cool monster fights, no struggles against the higher ups, and most of all; no giant mecha fights! Our heroes are fed up and, immediately after finishing the recording session, quit Super Rangers to start their own sentai show. The gang sets up their base of operations in Blue's uncle's warehouse; unsure of where to begin. However, in the center of the room stands a large object obscured with a large bedsheet. Pulling the sheet off, our actors find the start of their new journey,  and after signing a contract or two; they're ready to Lights, Camera, Chromatize!\n\nGAMEPLAY\nChroma Squad is very unique in its gameplay, fairly simple, but unique nonetheless. You control your units on a grid, taking turns moving your units and allowing your enemies to move. Simple. You can utilize a teamwork mechanic to not only group up on an enemy, but launch your rangers to spaces they couldn't normally reach. Unique. Each of your units has specific passives and abilities tailored to their class. Simple. These abilities may come into play for completing 'director's instructions'; secondary objectives that will give a healthy boost to your audience. Unique. Every mission features a big boss monster that has its own special attacks and abilities. Simple. Just like in Power Rangers though, the monster becomes gigantic after you beat it; bringing you into a risk-vs-reward kaiju fight minigame. Unique. You get the jist. \n\nOutside of combat you can upgrade your gear, improve your studio, answer e-mails, sign marketing agencies to your show, and upgrade your mecha. Upgrading your gear not only increases certain stats, but visually changes the look of your heroes for hire. Improving your studio provides you with an advantage while recording your episodes; though you really shouldn't think too hard about them. I'm not rally sure how upgrading your light fixtures makes enemies less likely to dodge attacks, but I also don't get how so many people burn their meals while watching my show. E-mails range from heartfelt to crazy and everything in-between Sometimesyou get fan-mail about aliens and tinfoil hats, and other times you get companies asking you to buy a 'sword enlargment kit.' Marketing agencies provide temporary bonuses in and outside of combat depending on which agencies you sign your brand to. Personally, I always chose Toys-R-Fans because I like money having money; lots and lots of money. Upgrading your mecha simply gives it small bonuses during the kaiju fights, such as increased hit chance or a chest beam. Y'know, little things.\n\nVISUALS\nThe visuals are nice, not too complex, but very charming. The pixelated aesthetic compliments the game nicely; and this especially shows in the exemplary boss design. You'll start out fighting monsters like Boxing Box; a cardboard box with boxing gloves. [You're on a tight budget okay?] Eventually however, you'll be fighting intergalactic evildoers such as Tengu, a Japanese demon with cloning capabilities. Either way, the game was pleasin' to my eyeballs and I think it'll please yours too.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nHot diggity dog, this is a good soundtrack! Featuring 31 unique tracks composed by a variety of artists; you couldn't ask for anything better to accompany your multi-dimensional misadventures. Each track fits its respective scene beautifully, with the timing on some of them being downright god-tier. [That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.] Personally, my favorite track has got to be the main theme. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted on the main menu listening to it. I probably need help.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nIt takes quite a bit to make me buy a game based off of impulse alone, and Chroma Squad happened to have that special something. It was charming, enjoyable, and just challenging enough from start to finish to keep me wanting more consistently. In a way, I got hooked on Chroma Squad the way you get hooked on a show. My first thought after beating an episode was 'Man, I can't wait to see what happens next!'. Being able to choose my actors and their names was a great touch, and the ability to modify the catchphrases and names of aspects of the show took it to the next level. I don't think I'll ever get tired of a wise, robed monk yelling 'Prepare for dank justice!' before turning into a spandex clad superhero. The gameplay is simple, but brings a unique twist to just about every aspect. The dialogue is... cringe-worthy at times to say the least. At the same time though, it reminded me of the horrible dialogue in my favorite shows as a kid. I love the look of it, and I don't think I'll ever quite get over how fantastic the music was. This game is by no means perfect, but for what it's worth; I'm willing to say that this is everything that I've ever looked for in a videogame. It panders to my inner-child, it indulges my unhealthy addiction to customization, it scratches that tactical gameplay itch, it gives me goosebumps when I listen to the music, and most of all; it makes me remember why I love video games. Thanks Behold Studios, I needed something to get me outta this rut.\n\nOhheytherealsomayormaynotbeanactualalienthreatthat'sgonnadestroytheplanetifyoudon'tstopitsogoodluckwiththat.", "timestamp_created": 1433993932, "timestamp_updated": 1452285672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16296574": {"recommendationid": "16296574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118355414", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433276647}, "language": "french", "review": "Terrible si on aime le genre et l'univers, en revanche, pour les habitu\u00e9s du genre, je vous invite \u00e0 d\u00e9buter en mode hard tout de suite", "timestamp_created": 1433967378, "timestamp_updated": 1433967378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16292685": {"recommendationid": "16292685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087227606", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472180979}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely amazing.

Brilliant references to 90's culture and an interesting tactical RPG combat system make this game very enjoyable. The scenario is you are stunt performers of a super sentai show who decide to make it on your own by kickstarting your own, the plot then twists from what is a tv show with stunt actors to then turn into something alot more real. The game gives you full control over your cast, studio and many other things which makes this game very interesting and different from the norm. With your team of 5 unique classes you can take down foes with a variety of unique moves or work together and form devastating combo attacks. The fact each character is a certain class is a great idea keeping you thinking about what form of attack you will make that will benefit the battle in the long run. Your characters strengths can also be upgraded with an interesting upgrade system, with a shop you can spend program revenue with to buy stronger equipment or a crafting system in which you can create equipment with drops or purchased materials to help make your characters or mecha stronger. As far as the mecha is concerned it is perhaps the weakest part of this brilliant title, although it feels incredible the first couple of times it happens the tactical tile RPG suddenly turns into a 2D fighting mechanic that feels as though it relies on luck far too often. Your accuracy ratio reduces the number of successful hits you make in the same turn, there were times however where i would hit once have an 85% hit chance and miss finishing my combo. i understand it can happen sometimes but it happened alot more than it probably should have. It made it more frustrating given the fact the enemy monster had the same attack pattern which never missed and then could also do a super attack every few turns made some of these duels long, repetitive and rather frustrating. I feel if the mecha combat was still a tile combat system where you fight in the city it could be made a lot more interesting, whats to say your viewer rating could go down based on the number of detroyed buildings via combat, or using the environment to your advantage. It would certainly make the currently bland mecha combat into something a bit more interesting. The story structure is set in a number of series in which the goal is to increase your fanbase and revenue by putting on an awesome show. You are also in charge of advertising and the studio which can be upgraded to help with the show. The idea of seperate series is great and makes the game into more bitesize chuncks that open up possibilities of extra content later on. With multiple endings the game does have replay value and the episodes in each season can be played in any order desired. The enemy designs are fantastic and some of the stories are great but perhaps more of a mixup with different scenarios would only benefit the game more, party members could be missing or sub objectives could be more diverse with perhaps saving civilians or dealing with environmental scenarios. This does happen sometimes but maybe not enough.\nThe soundtrack is a pleasure to listen to and keeps the tempo going. it plays very well along with the artistic style of the game.\n\nOverall the game is a great experience, especially if you are a power rangers/super sentai fan with some great story and combat design and an interesting yet simple upgrade system and tle based RPG combat. More diverse storylines and some work on the mecha battles would only do this game good! If they bring out more content as well this game could be played long into the future.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1433800245, "timestamp_updated": 1433800245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16263558": {"recommendationid": "16263558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135508228", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465860802}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty cool, it's pretty much like chess but with a Sentai theme, which I love.

The fights never over stay their welcome in the easy mode, the challenge of the higher difficulties are fairly noticable (though they need to stop fixing what was already a good game), and it's just fun to make up your own power rangers team name and special lines. the upgrading system is all based on the items you buy or craft so you be really tanky or deal ALL the damage. my only issue is the craftable armours and weapons aren't as good as the shop items thanks to RNG-ness deciding if the weapon has an attack buff at all and lator shop items tend to be weaker in weapon but not in attack base making more about using your basic attack then anything else but it's sad saying even THAT is better then hoping to get a good weapon via craft...

O v\u00eddeo promocional deixa claro a proposta do jogo: administrar um programa Sentai, aqueles seriados japoneses de grupos de super-her\u00f3is fantasiados que ficaram populares aqui no Ocidente, principalmente por causa dos Power Rangers. Na mesma hora eu pensei: meu corpo precisa desse jogo. Mas como lados de dois im\u00e3s de mesma polaridade que se repelem, cada dia que passava, o jogo se afastava de mim. Antes previsto para o final de 2013, o jogo foi adiado para o final de 2014, sendo somente lan\u00e7ado em abril de 2015. Parte do atraso se deu por um bom motivo, pois com o lan\u00e7amento do beta para quem comprou o jogo na pr\u00e9-venda ou para quem o financiou pelo Kickstarter, os desenvolvedores puderam receber um feedback dos jogadores e assim aprimorarem o jogo. Por outro lado, o est\u00fadio teve que enfrentar uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o delicada com a Saban, detentora dos direitos de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da marca Power Rangers no Ocidente, que amea\u00e7ava impedir o lan\u00e7amento de Chroma Squad, em virtude de direitos autorais. Por fim, ambas as empresas chegaram a um acordo e o jogo pode ser lan\u00e7ado. \\o/\n\nA jogabilidade se divide em tr\u00eas etapas:\n\n1) Gerenciamento do est\u00fadio: Nesse ponto, cabe a voc\u00ea a administra\u00e7\u00e3o do programa que consiste em  v\u00e1rias a\u00e7\u00f5es como contrata\u00e7\u00e3o dos atores, compra de melhorias para o est\u00fadio, marketing e aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de uniformes e armas. Neste \u00faltimo quesito, existem duas op\u00e7\u00f5es: comprar os itens na lojinha ou fabric\u00e1-los utilizando diversos materiais como caixa de papel\u00e3o e massinhas de modelar que s\u00e3o dropados pelos inimigos durante os epis\u00f3dios. Essa improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00edvel cospobre,nos lembra muito os seriados sentai/tokusatsu em que tudo era ou parecia ser de baixo or\u00e7amento. Outras situa\u00e7\u00f5es que emulam esse esp\u00edrito mulambo s\u00e3o as caracteriza\u00e7\u00f5es de muitos vil\u00f5es, como o Boxing Box, ou a conversa dos personagens durante a hist\u00f3ria. Com o passar do tempo, o est\u00fadio vai melhorando, tornando as coisas mais profissionais. O jogo possui dois medidores: Dinheiro e Quantidade de F\u00e3s que s\u00e3o diretamente influenciados pelas a\u00e7\u00f5es durante a grava\u00e7\u00e3o dos epis\u00f3dios e pela quantidade de audi\u00eancia conquistada, bem como pelas pol\u00edticas de marketingadotadas.\n\n2) Grava\u00e7\u00e3o dos Epis\u00f3dios: As fases s\u00e3o organizadas em temporadas que por sua vez s\u00e3o divididas em epis\u00f3dios (Ah, antes que voc\u00ea pergunte, tem epis\u00f3dios gravados na pedreira). Durante as fases, deve-se lutar com uma onda de inimigos e um chef\u00e3o, seguindo a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do diretor para ajudar a aumentar a audi\u00eancia. O combate possui o estilo RPG de estrat\u00e9gia em turnos como visto em X-com e Final Fantasy Tatics. Uma novidade trazida por esse jogo chama-secoopera\u00e7\u00e3o em que permite coordenar a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e os golpes dos rangers. Caso todos os cincos ataquem ao mesmo tempo, uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o surge na tela e nos lembra aqueles ataques finalizadores executados nos seriados. Cada ranger possui habilidades diferentes e, \u00e0 medida que as temporadas v\u00e3o passando, h\u00e1 o desbloqueio de novas. \n3) Luta  de rob\u00f4s: Ap\u00f3s a derrota do monstro-chefe,um bom e velho clich\u00ea dos sentai ocorre: o monstro aumenta de tamanho e o Mecha \u00e9 invocado. A jogabilidade muda novamente, passando a ser de RPG em turnos em que a cada golpe desferido pelo rob\u00f4 aumenta o multiplicador de dano, mas diminui a chance de acerto e, se errar um golpe, o turno passa para o monstro e incube ao jogador a defesa no momento certo. Apesar de simples e rolar um fator sorte, planejar bem os golpes torna-se importante, combinando golpes simples com os especiais. Se porventura a vida do mecha chegar a zero, o jogador recebe uma segunda chance chamada \u201cPoder de F\u00e3\u201d, em que ganha-se uma nova vida baseada na quantidade de telespectadores.\nA hist\u00f3ria do jogo \u00e9 simples e divertida, com algumas reviravoltas e tr\u00eas finais diferentes, pois, em certo ponto, dependendo da escolha tomada, um determinado personagem \u00e9 desbloqueado e a narrativa segue um rumo diferente. Os gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o belos e pixelados e a trilha sonora impec\u00e1vel, apesar de um pouco repetitiva. \nCaracterizar o jogo como somente \u201cum jogo inspirado na s\u00e9rie Power Ranger\u201d, tradu\u00e7\u00e3o livre do subt\u00edtulo exigido pela Saban, \u00e9 subestimar a carta de amor que esse jogo escreve para as s\u00e9ries tokusatsu/sentai. Al\u00e9m disso, notamos influ\u00eancias de outros elementos da cultura nerd e pop que rendem grandes risadas, momentos WTF e explos\u00f5es de nostalgia. Jogo recomendad\u00edssimo para quem gosta das coisas boas da vida.

Not many games that want me to feel nostalgic can do it like this game, the next best thing for nostalgia would be Shovel Knight, but this takes the cake\n~Simple , yet extremely fun RPG mechanics. Ok lets get this down, 5 base classes, the lead, support, techie, assault, medic. Each class is equipped with each special ability of course, but then there becomes another layer, with the inclusion of different characters with each their own respective stats and weaknesses, this can dramatically effect the way you can fight a boss. An example would be, my lead, who i chose to be the Panda Guy (Forgot his name!) has reduced movement speed, because of this one of the episodes required me to kill the boss with my lead (This is also known as Director Instructions, although not required, it gives you a boost in \"audience\" which helps you use a few Studio options which will be explained later) My lead was way too far from the boss and there was no way to get to him before the boss dying from my techie's amazing counter-chance. Thus causing me to feel the want to restart the level and do it again to 100% it, and I did, I had to dramatically change the way I play by having the Lead always stay close to the boss while the others protect him. Now I would explain the skills to you, but they are fairly simple and standard RPG mechanics (Use them and then you have a cooldown, the usual)\n~What it wants to introduce to you though is it's \"teamwork\" mechanic. This mechanic allows you to have one of your well....heroes...can sacrifice their turn to say instead of using a skill to kill an enemy they switch to teamwork mode so that another one of your team can go to them and be launched farther than they can usually move, you could also do a teamwork attack. Which consists one or maybe even all of your team to attack a single opponent, which does become very useful against harder minions.\n~Music- Goddamn the music is so nostalgic, it literally brings the heart of 8-Bit RPGS and Super-Sentai series and puts them together to make just an amazing soundtrack\n~Story - To me, the story is the important part of a game (If it offers a story, it better be damn good *cough cough Call of Duty Ghosts cough cough*. Now at first the story may seem pointless, but after maybe the 2nd season if i recall, it gets just a huge jump in drama and everything just starts to mold into place. Each character is given their own little \"arc\" or little segment focusing on them and their personal problems, and by the end of them season you feel satisfied and you just want more. Although I won't spoil much of the story, I can tell you that the dialouge includes many pokes and jabs toward internet memes and commonly uses smiley faces (Which too me is very refreshing) Now in terms of story itself, you start off as very ticked off actors that leave the studio they are hired at and buy/create their own. As you progress you are given \"choices\" through \"fan mail\" which people send you, although it may not seem significant, these fan mail choose the path you will be taken on and how your fans will react, also be warned there is no voice acting so get ready to read.\n~Bosses- Each boss is super memorable and actually are pretty damn funny when intended, each skill set makes sense for each boss and are actually pretty fun to figure out how to fight against. Now after certain fights, you are allowed to what some people may call MECHA FIGHTSSSSS!.....now these are simple but are actually pretty fun and poke fun at the *ahem* Power Rangers mecha fights.\n~Stuio/Crafting Etc. - In the studio you can buy stuff from the shop or look and change the skill sets of your characters. Inside the shops you are given the ability to buy Armor and Weapons. Now most of these items are basic and the best usually come from crafting (DUH) but are still useful. Now crafting, simple, yet not the best or even my favorite, so ill explain my dislikes of it later. You can also go to the \"Studio\" options which allow you to spend money generated from episodes to upgrade certain attributes (Health Care gives your actors +Health and HD Cameras give you better Audience Conversion Rate). Next up is the Mecha Screen, basiclly upgrading the parts of the mecha to make it better as the story progresses. Not too overly complicated, but could be a lot better.\n-Cons\n~Crafting- Because you cant replay episodes, you better hope you get those crafting items by luck OR you can spend considerable ( A LOT ) of money from episodes you did to buy Material Packs and because of this you may be out of luck for the first few seasons or you force yourself not to buy better Armor/Weapons/Studio Upgrades. \n~Agency Buying- I held off talking about this because I'm more or less biased toward this, but as you progress thorugh the story you can hire agencies to promote your show, this gives you special boosts to a certain amount of episodes (1 or 3) and of course it tells you the boosts but it doesnt tell you how much fan power it costs (You earn fan power during episodes) which left me bummed out because although there were 4 boosts I liked on the agency, I could only get 1 of them for 3 episodes because I didnt know the fan power was so high. Leaving me a lot of money down the drain.\n\n~All in all this is a great game, it achieves what it wants and does even better than certain rpg's. I would give this game the Indie Game of the Year if i could\n\n9.4/10", "timestamp_created": 1433302589, "timestamp_updated": 1447253738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1,

I spent a good ten minutes trying to come up with my own team name and catch-phrases. The tactical RPG aspects are simple and enjoyable, and I like a more streamlined approach to gearing the squad. What I really love about the game, though, is its consistent charm; from my characters yelling my ridiculous catch-phrases, to the Assist character constantly using emoji's in dialogue, to some of the ridiculous bosses you face (shout-out to Transitmancer), I often had a wide grin on my face while playing.\n\nAs for gripes, well, the Kaiju battles got repetitive; spam Punch until you were at about 60% accuracy then pop Defense, Defend self against enemy's attacks, repeat. It'll probably be harder on higher difficulties, but I found myself getting somewhat bored during a battle between a GIANT ROBOT AND A GIANT MONSTER. Also, there were a couple bosses who kept doing knockback abilities that kept me from doing a Finishing Move, which happened to be a side-objective for that Episode, so I spent maybe twenty minutes trying to get into the correct position.\n\nThat said, though, this is perfectly viable nostalgia fuel that manages to be fun, engaging and lets you have a beaver on your superhero team.

What is the story, you ask? Well, essentially, the story of the game goes like this: You have a bunch of stunt people who recently quit their jobs because of a director who was, shall we say, demanding and is overall being a complete douche and they all decide to start a studio of their own! From the beginning, they don't have much to work with, using cardboard, duct tape, and third-rate costumes to get by, eventually, they start having an audience to work with.\n\nThe gameplay is quite fun, you kit out your actors in the best gear that cardboard and duct tape can buy and record new 'episodes', essentially maps, for the season, each with their own bonus objectives that don't punish you much for failing them but the extra fans and cashflow you can get from maxing out your audience each episode is a nice incentive to do them. Every actor has their own special abilities that are accessible as soon as they suit up which can be sometimes impossible to do at the start of the episode as you need to build audience power first before chromatizing. The phrases said throughout the game such as \"Chromatize\" and \"Mecha Power, Activate!\" can be modified in the studio to your liking. Yes, this means you can be as silly or as creative as you like... or creatively silly.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is strange at times, some episodes are easy, others are pretty difficult, even with the best gear for the season's tier equipped, and others still are fairly difficult. You'll end up curbstomping half the time if you're playing on the normal difficulty if you know how to play tactical RPGs, well, tactically, and I'm fairly certain hard mode is pretty challenging but I can't quite say that for myself. I'm not going to say that this game is too easy but it feels too easy at times, especially when you have an assault one-shotting everything they touch that isn't a boss monster or a shielded enemy.\n\nHowever, despite the odd difficulty curve, I absolutely adore the presence of the game and I absolutely love the feel and the gameplay of Chroma Squad, it kind of reminds me of XCOM, in a way, with all the aliens but minus the permadeath. Oh, and the music's damn good too, I will admit that the title theme may have dug deep into my brain and has implanted its melody into my brain and it won't get out. Although, there's not really much replayability in this game apart from the acheievements and, well, I can't say all that much without spoilers.\n\nIn short? Fun game, even if you're not very familiar with the subject of the game, although most references may fly over you since this is an homage game, after all. Worth a buy? Sure. It's a good game for its price although it tends to be lacking a bit in the replayability department, it's fun for what it's worth and that is what matters.", "timestamp_created": 1432865006, "timestamp_updated": 1432865006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16044569": {"recommendationid": "16044569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144044528", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497721512}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the idea as a concept as well as a narrative.

The games story and graphics are fantastic. Upgrading is satisfying and also takes a lot of thinking. Combat takes strategy and is near flawless, for the most part aside from the Mech battles difficulty spike.\n\nLengthy-er Review: Combat is great, it takes a lot of strategy of what combinations of teamwork, and skills to boost your audience meter. The game lets you customize what your squads name is, transforming motto, and actor names. This makes the game feel way more your own and adds a lot of depth. The story is silly and over-the-top enough to feel very Sentai-like. The \"hub\" where you buy upgrades and items is another fantastic aspect of the game. Buying new items and mech parts, along with buying new marketers who can bring you special benefits depending on which person you sign a contract with. Replying to fan emails was also a joy to do. Now onto the cons. Mech fights are incredibly challenging even on normal mode, it took me NUMEROUS times to defeat most makes in the final 2 seasons. Mech fights also lack strategy and ends up mostly being dependent on luck. For example, for each punch you start off around 90% chance to hit, then goes down to around 80% for the next punch, and so on. Problem is healing skills require you to get around a 4x combo of punches to do any real healing, and so does the +Def move. It is nearly impossible to get consistent 4x combo, myself rarely even getting 3x combos. Even with that decent sized flaw it doesn't take away too much from the game, it is still fantastic and charming.

Even if Power Rangers (or Super Sentai if you INSIST) isn't necessarily your jam, it hits all the right notes for making a good gaming experience through that Triple-A seems to have forgotten; It's fun. Fun. You remember that? You know, when you get giggles or smile? When you get drawn into the experience not because of the spectacle, but because the game directly involves you and lets you make it your own, that's how you make games fun.\n\nThrowing down on some details, here's some specifics of why it's already made my top ten for 2015 -\n\n-Turn-Based strategy, not RPG. Think XCOM: EU, but with goddamn Power Rangers.\n\n-Customisation and upgrades for pretty much EVERYTHING.\n\n-Resource management that's more give-take than just your standard subtraction. It reminds me a lot of how the economy worked in Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries, a type of economy system I feel got left by the wayside in favour of simpler/easier things that don't add any weight to your decisions.\n\n-Crafting, a system that is notorious for earning my ire by basically being utter bullshit roughly a million per-cent of the time, actually makes some sort of sense in how components are named/what goes into what. It's also not needlessly complicated, which is a gigantic tick in my \"yes\" box.\n\n-It's got good moments of humour in it. It's not a comedy game, per se, but it knows not to take itself too seriously, and the humour it employs has a nice spectrum, from subtle pointing out of tropes, tongue-in-cheek, to bad puns, to breaking the fourth wall, and even some nice.... \"meta\" moments.\n\n-The art is nicely done, and consistent. While I can't say I have any particular love for the \"retro\" style that just about every indie game is doing, this one has really nicely animated sprites with a lot of good character to them as well as fun and well-done environments.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're one of those indie-game wads that just can't get enough of retro-styled graphics, crafting and whatever, you should have already creamed your free-trade, locally sourced shorts just by looking at the game's trailer.

Once it's fully bug tested and no longer freezes during the interminably long last mission (which I finished after 7 attempts and two weeks), this game is a 4/5.

These make the in game dialogue awesome at times. (No, Bill, of course you're as important as anyone else in Sakura and the Rest!) I'd like more costume choices, but what's there is fine. \n\nNegatives:\n- The mecha missions are incredibly dull, since it always comes down to the same exact fight (punch punch punch punch special. Click to lesson damage. Click to lessen damage. Click to lessen damage. Punch punch punch punch block.) A few of the enemies have very slow animation that makes the battles even MORE interminable, especially the Barney parody. I changed the mecha summoning catch phrase to \"Let's Get This Over With!\" I seriously dreaded them every time. \n- Glitches. These are the game's current biggest issue. They seem to be clearing up, but they kept me from finishing the last mission for two weeks, which destroyed the game's momentum and my interest in pursuing the other alternate endings. Buyer beware. \n- The last mission. There's a plot twist in that last mission that changes who the villain is that makes it less satisfying.

Sure the effects were cheesy and the plots formulaic, but there was a special magic when you were younger to seeing a team of colourful heroes take down hordes of nameless aliens and monsters. Hell, Marvel Disney seems to know what\u2019s up. With the help of Kickstarter, Behold Studios launched their tactical RPG based off Saban\u2019s hit franchise with amazing results. Get your suit ready, it\u2019s time to Chromatize.\n\nFor such a lighthearted tone, the storyline is legitimately captivating. In what almost seems like a metaphor for the formation of Behold Studios, the 5 stunt actors that do most of the work on their past Sentai show decide to quit out of frustration with their director\u2019s lack of fresh ideas. While building a studio from scratch, our heroes need to shoot episodes quickly and establish a fanbase to turn some revenue so they can keep the lights on, the actors paid, and the new season contracts coming in. The entire game is framed around this television production point of view, with missions gradually blurring the lines of reality into the realms of fantasy and superpower for the characters. Setups for conflict are playful with these ideas; an episode may require multiple reshoots due to on-set power outages, and other times you could be joined by unexpected ally rangers with their own personal vendettas against the alien baddies. Each level ends with tweets from your followers either praising or criticizing your work, and a fun email system helps to make you feel like you\u2019re actually interacting with your niche crowd. The brief tutorial on combat helps succinctly explain the flow of fighting without dragging down players with over-explanation, and it does a great job to tie into the introduction of the story. The whole game carries a consistently fun tone that\u2019s easy to enjoy. It\u2019s a cheerful and self-aware romp through the experiences of being an independent studio and crafting something meaningful to both the creators and fans.\n\nFor veterans of the genre it may feel slightly basic and on a smaller scale, but every element you\u2019d want in a tactical RPG has been incorporated here fantastically. There are 5 separate roles for each party member to fill. There\u2019s the lead that acts as a tank, support as a healer, a stealthy and mobile scout, an assault character as your heaviest damage unit, and a techie that specializes in ranged combat and item use. Each class has distinct capabilities and limitations for moving around boards and dispatching enemies, making your choice of team member just as important as what you want to do with them. Audience is gained by performing skillful moves and combos, and this metric dictates your overall fan count and income. Just like most Power Rangers episodes, the squad usually has to engage in some out of costume combat before having enough audience power to Chromatize and activate your powerful suits and abilities. Skilled players can be rewarded with bonus audience by following special director instructions in each episode shoot. Trying to setup tactics to fulfil every side goal can be challenging, but other times the objectives sort of complete themselves.\n\nPlayers can employ a variety of tactics to clear levels; strategies don\u2019t simply involve just hiding weaker units behind tanks. There are two phases to each character\u2019s turn, allowing you to creatively set up attacks with special weapons, abilities, and a unique gameplay element called Teamwork. Activating this ability sets up the character to help gang-attack enemies with subsequent Rangers, or catapult teammates across the board to reach distant foes. Setting up a Teamwork attack with all 5 members results in a satisfying finishing move that deals massive damage, but players who aren\u2019t careful to use this maneuver appropriately are punished with a loss of audience interest.\n\nOf course many bosses take on a second life after defeat, becoming Kaiju beasts to destroy with your giant mecha robot. These sequences handle similarly to piloting a World of Warcraft vehicle, but unfortunately for how common these parts are they lack the same amount of strategy that can be found in the rest of the game.\n\nPlayers that put in the time will find it easy to see the inspiration taken from the source material in a loving way, and the thoughtful game behind it. Your experience feels totally customizable from the start. You choose from a large variety of actors; characters with specific stats to fit into the game\u2019s 5 main roles for your squad. You can set the colour for each member as well, fully immersing your interest in your team. If you want the pink ranger to steal the spotlight with the lead role you can totally do that here, or maybe you don\u2019t want a red ranger at all, there really are no limits to team assembly. The unique T.V. production management system to your team\u2019s growth is a wonderfully creative way to explain the game\u2019s action and provide a narrative backbone to the accumulation of player wealth.\n   \nRather than gaining experience and levels, characters boost their stats through buying and crafting new gear. Creating new items from dropped material makes outfitting your team to be a more involved endeavour than simply spending money at a shop, and it motivates you to defeat just a few more foes in each stage to get those extra drops. Quirky item descriptions help keep a smile on your face while you click through these menus. There\u2019s a good emphasis on needing to understand how to get the most out of your cash and saved up materials in order to make your team the best it can be. There\u2019s also an interesting balance between managing your budget to buy your team these upgrades and to also spend on studio expenses, such as better lighting and healthcare, each adding their own statistical advantages. A variety of marketing companies can be hired for different perks in order to gain a larger audience and more income, and just like the items more of these are unlocked as you progress through the story.\n \nThe game\u2019s broken down into 5 seasons, with each stage acting as an episode shoot. Starting a new season unlocks the next tier on each character\u2019s ability tree, giving exciting progression to each of the distinct classes. Players can set their team\u2019s abilities to their preference and go back to tweak them later with no penalty, giving a level of freedom to experimentation on these trees that isn\u2019t in most role playing games.\n\nThe level of detail in the presentation truly creates a vibrant world to take in, all accompanied by a soundtrack that\u2019s honestly one of the most enjoyable we\u2019ve ever found in an indie game. Little touches like the plucky upbeat signature jingle complements the rest of the perfect retro groove that the music carefully weaves with its effects and scales. Seriously, they\u2019re some of the best bit-style tracks this side of Megaman. Art is so fine-tuned as to even include bent corners on menu screens to make you feel like you\u2019re watching from your tube TV. The familiar pixel art style is done expertly; there\u2019s a real level of character given to the sprites by the careful expressions and animations. The isometric perspective works extremely well for both the gameplay and the artwork.\n \nBehold Studios really hit all the right notes, giving us a great tactical turn-based action title that\u2019s a perfect game for fans of the genre or anyone looking to try it for the first time. You might spend some time wading through some new gameplay elements, but it quickly clicks and with enough skill you\u2019ll soon be taking down monsters just like they do on TV. There\u2019s no doubt that you should take up your offer to join the Chroma Squad.\nSCORE: 9.0", "timestamp_created": 1432150400, "timestamp_updated": 1432220861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15916820": {"recommendationid": "15916820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004430467", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431643539}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun game with simplified strategy mechanics.

No, se nos ha ido la pinza porque estamos muy locos, pero esto es Chroma Squad, el videojuego del estudio independiente brasile\u00f1o Behold Studios y la mejor carta de presentaci\u00f3n es la que te has encontrado: una ficha de IMDB. Porque con esta oda a los archifamosos Power Rangers de Saban es como estos chicos han querido rendirle homenaje al g\u00e9nero, el que espec\u00edficamente en tierras niponas se conoce como sentai.\n\nComo muchos proyectos independientes, Chroma Squad naci\u00f3 en Kickstarter y consigui\u00f3 el doble de financiaci\u00f3n de la esperada (casi 100.000 d\u00f3lares de los 50.000 que necesitaban). El que en su d\u00eda se plante\u00f3 como un RPG t\u00e1ctico de corte sentai donde el objetivo era crearte tu propio equipo de rangers ver\u00eda la luz con un poco m\u00e1s de retraso del esperado: el t\u00edtulo saldr\u00eda finalmente a la venta el pasado 30 de abril de 2015 (pese a que la fecha inicial era finales de 2013).\n\nTemporada 2: real e irreal como en la vida misma\n\nEl juego es un soplo de aire fresco porque, tal y como hab\u00edan prometido, lo primero que haremos ser\u00e1 elegir el nombre, atributos y color de cada uno de los rangers de nuestro equipo. Est\u00e1 cargado de humor y de s\u00e1tira a todo lo que es el mundo del sentai, con edificios de cart\u00f3n pluma, enemigos copia-pega, argumento muy pero que muy absurdo y explosiones de bajo presupuesto. No obstante, no hay que perder nunca de vista que esto es un RPG t\u00e1ctico al m\u00e1s puro estilo XCOM o similares.\n\nVoy a tratar de presentarlo de la mejor forma posible: hazte tu propia historia de rangers. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 digo esto? Porque creo que como mejor se disfruta este t\u00edtulo es metiendo a tus conocidos en toda esta vor\u00e1gine de estupidez tan terriblemente divertida. T\u00fa, como l\u00edder, tienes que montar desde cero un estudio de grabaci\u00f3n donde, temporada a temporada y si tus finanzas lo permiten, deber\u00e1s ganar audiencia para poder sobrevivir y firmar nuevos contratos de renovaci\u00f3n a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, hasta un total de cinco.\n\nComo en todo sentai que se precie, cada episodio es autoconclusivo y tus propios compa\u00f1eros de equipo ir\u00e1n construyendo la trama de cada uno sobre la marcha seg\u00fan las circunstancias de sus propias vidas van dando pie a ello. Por ejemplo: el secuestro de uno de tus rangers cuando en su vida real tiene que ir al dentista. \u00bfC\u00f3mo no iba a ser un motivo excelente para grabar un episodio? Pues b\u00e1sicamente en esto consiste Chroma Squad.\n\nTemporada 3: el tablero de juego\n\nComo ya dije unas l\u00edneas m\u00e1s arriba, es un RPG t\u00e1ctico de lo m\u00e1s simplote, pero es aqu\u00ed donde radica precisamente toda su belleza. No es un juego terriblemente complicado, lo que permite que puedas centrar tu atenci\u00f3n en todas las tonter\u00edas que van surgiendo cap\u00edtulo a cap\u00edtulo. Pero tiene un par de peculiaridades que lo hacen \u00fanico. Lo normal (salvo excepciones) es que empecemos cada episodio vestido de calle. Tenemos un medidor de audiencia que, seg\u00fan vamos realizando ciertas acciones o derribando masillas (los enemigos copia-pega, vaya) se ir\u00e1 rellenando. Llegado a un punto podremos elegir (si queremos) transformarnos. C\u00f3mo no, luces, efectos de sonido y mucha explosi\u00f3n chapucera y \u00a1voil\u00e0!, equipo de rangers preparado para darlo todo sobre el escenario de lucha de turno (croma verde del estudio, azotea, el parque de al lado o en la propia calle).\n\nTenemos cinco clases (con alguna que otra aparici\u00f3n estelar) y cuatro acciones b\u00e1sicas: atacar, utilizar una habilidad especial (solamente una vez transformados), movernos o colaborar. La acci\u00f3n colaborar, la peculiar en este tinglado, es que servir\u00e1 tanto para ejecutar ataques conjuntos como para catapultar a otro ranger m\u00e1s casillas de las que podr\u00eda normalmente. Esta acci\u00f3n es la que le da el punto de estrategia a todas las batallas, ya que seg\u00fan la situaci\u00f3n podremos aprovechar para tomar una posici\u00f3n m\u00e1s defensiva u ofensiva. Sumado a que cada batalla tiene un plus de bonificaciones si cumplimos determinados objetivos (mantener a todos los rangers vivos, eliminar a todos los masillas, etc\u00e9tera) la diversi\u00f3n est\u00e1 servida. Adem\u00e1s, si ejecutamos un ataque conjunto sobre un mismo enemigo con todos nuestros rangers, le asestaremos el t\u00edpico golpe final (el cual tambi\u00e9n tiene nombre, como pod\u00e9is ver en la ficha t\u00e9cnica) que nos asegurar\u00e1 la victoria sobre la batalla.\n\nTemporada 4: el estudio y los contratos, de algo hay que ganarse la vida\n\nNuestra base de operaciones, el estudio de grabaci\u00f3n, juega otro papel fundamental en Chroma Squad. De una forma progresiva, para no solt\u00e1rnoslo todo de sopet\u00f3n, podremos gestionar los contratos con la compa\u00f1\u00eda de grabaci\u00f3n, mejorar los elementos del estudio, comprar equipo para nuestros rangers, fabricarlos manualmente con los objetos que sueltan los enemigos cuando mueren y, c\u00f3mo no, mejorar nuestro robot de combate. No me gustar\u00eda detenerme demasiado porque hablar de estos puntos es destripar un poco la propia trama y las mec\u00e1nicas del juego, pero de la misma forma que la base del XCOM Enemy Unknown jugaba un papel fundamental en la forma de enfocar nuestros combates, aqu\u00ed el estudio de grabaci\u00f3n realiza una funci\u00f3n parecida, salvando las diferencias.\n\nCada temporada se divide en una serie de episodios que, aunque sean obligatorios, pueden grabarse en cualquier orden que nos convenga (salvo el pr\u00f3logo y la season finale). Adem\u00e1s, cada episodio puede a su vez estar subdividido en varias \u201cfases\u201d o combates, vaya, seg\u00fan la trama lo requiera. Y, c\u00f3mo no, llegado el momento nuestro jefe final cambiar\u00e1 de tama\u00f1o y para poder enfrentarnos a \u00e9l en condiciones el estudio pondr\u00e1 a nuestra disposici\u00f3n nuestro propio robot de cart\u00f3n y cinta adhesiva totalmente modificable. De la misma forma que en los sentai el combate del robot era espectacular, aqu\u00ed no se quedan cortos y dando un cambio de g\u00e9nero casi, casi de 180\u00ba, nos plantan en un escenario con dos barras de vida (la del robot y la del enemigo) donde tendremos que darnos to\u00f1as hasta hacer explotar al bicharraco rival casi como si se tratase de un juego de peleas (salvando las distancias).\n\nTemporada 5: conclusiones y semejanzas con las series de verdad\n\nChroma Squad es un puntazo de juego y me lo he pasado como un enano. Me he re\u00eddo mucho no, lo siguiente, y aunque en l\u00edneas generales es un juego sencillo tiene momentos donde lo pasaremos francamente mal para cumplir los objetivos o acabar los episodios. No obstante, de la misma forma que algunas series por motivos puramente econ\u00f3micos se alargan innecesariamente, me han sobrado un par de horas de este fenomenal t\u00edtulo de Behold Studios. Ojo, porque jugando a mi parecer bastante a saco, me ha durado la friolera de trece horas. Una vez llegamos a la temporada 3 ya se nos ha desplegado todo el abanico de posibilidades que nos da el juego y, bajo mi punto de vista, habr\u00eda sido m\u00e1s inteligente cortar en la temporada 4 en lugar de alargarlo una temporada m\u00e1s innecesariamente. Lo cual resulta ir\u00f3nico y te hace pensar si el propio estudio hizo esto a prop\u00f3sito o es otra de esas simp\u00e1ticas jugarretas del azar.\n\nEn definitiva, si eres un amante del g\u00e9nero, Chroma Squad es todo un acierto y un must have en toda regla y si encima est\u00e1s familiarizado con toda esta movida de sentais, pasar\u00e1 de ser un must have a un juego que recordar\u00e1s con much\u00edsimo cari\u00f1o porque todos y cada uno de sus detalles (como por ejemplo tuits de los fans con comentarios y hashtags al final de cada episodio) se han programado con much\u00edsimo mimo, empezando por el botoncito de la esquina superior derecha de la pantalla que te permite avisarles de cualquier bug mientras est\u00e1s jugando.", "timestamp_created": 1432104684, "timestamp_updated": 1432104684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648262", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15908251": {"recommendationid": "15908251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153070615", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515973564}, "language": "english", "review": "Named all my sentai rangers \"buttcheeks\"\n11/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1432081434, "timestamp_updated": 1432274629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15908193": {"recommendationid": "15908193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081912190", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440431798}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Genial,Joguei ate o final (At\u00e9 o Final Mesmo),Chega a ser Repetitivo em algumas partes mas no geral o jogo e foda, 9,0.Faltam algumas coisas mas oque esta no jogo e perfeito...", "timestamp_created": 1432080983, "timestamp_updated": 1432080983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15906582": {"recommendationid": "15906582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044385269", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484202304}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played many Tactical RPGs but this game is very enjoyable, both in its gameplay and its satire/parody.

There's some really good ideas and bit and pieces that work well together, but then the game quickly remembers it's an indie title so it immediately breaks the fourth wall with some dumb meme joke and poorly placed rants about sexism. It wouldn't have been so bad had the dialogue actually followed what sentai/powerranger shows were like, but it isn't ; it's completely about these random, pre-made characters that always spew the same lines regardless of their gender/race/species. Why even let people choose the visual appearance of them if you've already created characters for them? It would have been better just to create a premade team that apes the original show's archetypes rather than blandly change the visuals.\n\nThe game also suffers in that there's too much fluff and not enough depth. You have weapons, crafting, a store and various upgrades - but they all feel meaningless. Nothing really excels and feels like it was tacked on because all rpgs must have crafting now, rather than it was something important to the game play.\n\nLastly, the art can be downright confusing or poorly imitating at times. For some reason my blonde female support character won't stop rubbing her nipples in her idle animation. It's kind of disturbing and is weirding me out. Just, standing there all day, rubbing away.

In the game you control a group of people that run a live-action power rangers rip off show where they fight evil baddies and have huge mecha fights. \n\nBefore you start one of these levels though (referred to as episodes in game), you have to micromanage your money at your studio (It is a t.v. show after all), in this section you purchase upgrades for your studio and purchase equipment for characters and such and it is surprisingly engaging how much thought I personally put in to figure out where to put my resources, did I want to put more money towards purchasing materials to craft cardboard box equipment, or did I want to invest in marketing agencies to increase my fanbase and reap extra benefits for a few episodes? It gives you enough to manage without overwhelming you. \n\nThe combat is your typical tactical rpg with skills and classes and such,however there is a nice little temawork mechanic where if you set a character to teamwork mode you can assist other teammates in team attacks and acrobatics for more movement adding a little extra depth to the combat. Mecha fights play differently as when you're fighting bigger monsters you play a sort of risk-reward turn based game, you basically have hit chance and damage multiplier, whenever you attack and hit the monster you get to keep combo-ing them with attacks and other abilities and as long as you land hits, for every successful hit your damage for the next attack goes up, however it has a lower chance of hitting and when you miss it becomes the monsters turn, this also employs a decent amount of strategy but can ultimately feel like luck sometimes, its still enjoyable and doesn't detract from the main game\n\nWhen it comes to customization this game handles that aspect very well allowing customization of not only characters, but even the customization of the company, you can name the super hero squad whatever you like as well as the mechas and what they shout when they suit up, heck if you wanted to you could even theme the whole thing around butts! Butt Squad! Mecha Butt! Butter up! There is a great amount of customization in the game!\n\nOverall it comes down to this:\nDo you like Power ranger esque tactical rpgs with funny parody writing, lots of customization, and fun gameplay, while micromanaging your own butt studio?\nThen Chroma Squad is for you\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1431833793, "timestamp_updated": 1431833793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15864651": {"recommendationid": "15864651", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991945435", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433130504}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall: 9/10\n\nCombat:  8/10:  Combat system consists of move and attack phase with the additional options to go into teamwork mode or use free actions.  You gain audience members as you defeat badguys, achieve mission objectives, and do special moves or use teamwork.  The common enemies are just that - common, you will see the same enemies throughout the game though they upgrade in power and stats (as do you).  The bosses are great, as with most of the game they are made with humor and they have unique skills and play styles.  There is another type of combat you go into, I dont want to spoil it but if you watched power rangers you probably know what it is.  Generally this mode of combat has you fighting and gaining combos which power up special moves.  During the enemy attack phase you play a mini game where you try to click at the right moment to minimize damage.  I give combat 8/10 because the difficulty scales weird.

They deemed it too violent. Mind you, they're telling this to a guy who is chronically addicted to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and tuned in every Saturday to watch the Spiderman and Batman cartoons. Power Rangers were much too violent though. When my folks finally gave up on controlling my viewing habits Power Rangers quickly became a guilty pleasure and I watched it until Wild Force. Enter [i]Chroma Squad[/i], a retro style turn based tactics game that puts you in control of a squad of power rangers. It is every bit as fun as going round your parents' back to just watch cardboard robots beating up rubber monsters.\n\n[i]Chroma Squad[/i]'s premise is very catchy hook to begin with. A group of disgruntled stunt actors are fed up with their boss and quit their current Ranger season to start their own series. With buckets, old shirts and cardboard boxes your crew assembles a set of costumes and backdrops and the battle against evil can begin. Along the way you'll find that there is a little more to playing Power Rangers than just making cool poses.\n\nThe game's real kicker is the ability to create and assemble your own team. You can possibly recreate every Ranger team down to the letter with the game, or engineer a squad entirely your own. Did you like Mighty Morphing Power Rangers? Just pick the five colours, three boys, two girls and be on your way. Fed up with the patriarchy? Pick five girls, colour them all in shades of purple and kick some ass. Feeling grimdark and edgy? Pick five depressed kids, paint them black and act like Batman. Everything is up to you. Each Ranger has its own role. Lead is in charge and gets additional hitpoints, while the tech rangers does bonus damage with weapons. The colours are up to you, so you can make the Pink ranger be the boss this time round and let the snooty Red bastard be the butt of the Megazord this time. \n\nAfter you tune your squad you record your episodes. This is a turn based tactics game where you fight minions and monsters on a grid. The real selling point here is positioning and teamwork. One ranger can kick a mook for sure, but positioning your squad in such a way will allow you to vault your rangers straight into the bosses face on the first turn to deliver a juicy team attack. It is key that master the acrobatics and abilities to chase down the shifty bosses, or that you weaken and wear out the brawlers without losing a Ranger, because no one likes it when the good guys lose.\n\nYou performance isn't measured in money, or experience; it is measured in audience. Since you're recording a TV show your audience is your life; and you cannot survive without loyal viewers and fans. Every episode gives you a hand full of objectives to clear to make your episode a bit better. More audience, means more fans, means more money, means better suits, means better TV, means more audience, etc. It is a simple, yet fun system, because it invites you to think of other ways to approach a problem, rather than to look for the one tactic. \n\nThe entire game is booming with references to the Power Rangers and its Japanese original: Super Sentai. Finishing moves, focus on Red, giant robots, believing in your friends, mystery helpers, talking jars, it's all part of the experience. During your downtime you have time to craft new weapons from arts and crafts materials as well as answer fanmail and hire marketing groups to propel your show to the next level of hype. You'll quickly fall in love with the familiar and sometimes clich\u00e9 traits of the series that round out the experience.\n\nAll in all, the game presses so many right buttons, it's hard not to like. Though the sometimes lazy writing rips you out of the game, the desire to know what kind of crazy thing the devs have cooked up for the next episode will have you coming back soon. The branching storyline also helps to draw you back in after beating it once.

It's extremely addicting, and while the story seems to start out at a good pace, things escalate quickly later on, providing great plot twists that keep the story immensely interesting.\n\nWith those opening comments out of the way, let's list the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n~A great level of customization with a plethora of actors, colors, and equipment to choose from, heck, even the mechs have a good level of customization.\n~A great soundtrack. I persoanlly am a big fan of the 8-bit/chiptune style of music, it reminds of the days of arcades and gameboys. Any chiptune lover would listen to the soundtrack over and over again. If you like the music, get the reasonably priced soundtrack. Not only does it help support the devs, but you get to listen to your favorite groovy tunes from the game anytime you want.\n~Cool graphics. if you like these kinds of pixely games or pixel art in general, this is a game for you.\n~The storyline. I've said it before: It's interesting with a great pace.\n~The play time. It took me about 22 hours to get through my first playthrough of the game, on the normal difficulty setting. And that's just for one of 3 endings that the game has to offer. Depending on the difficlty level you're playing and the time spent jamming out to the music, the time to get all the endings can range from 50 hours to 70 hours. Great amount of gameplay.\n~The achievements. There's not hundreds of them like their are in other games, and most of them are pretty easy to get, you just need to play the game accordingly. I got over half the achievements on my first playthrough. (Though I guess they could add some ones in the future that require DLC.) If you're not an achievement hunter, that's all right, it could just be a fun side quest. This game has enough play-achievement balance that you don't need to dedicate hundreds of hours to get all of them.\n~Difficalty settings. This is always a great feature to have in a game. The difficulties are casual, interesting, and challenging, ehich translates to easy, normal, hard respectively. If you're new to this type of game and/or want to focus on the story, play the game on casual. If you've played these games before and like a nice balance of story and challenge, interesting's your cuppa joe. If you like a challenge, like good planning, and you aren't afraid to lose a little to win a little, challenging is just the right fit.\n~Nice balance of battle and management. Not only do you fight with your heroes, you need to check and maintain their gear in order to beat the enemies that get more difficult as time progresses, as well as answer emails from fans, manage production companies, and upgrade your small warehouse studio as time goes on.\n~A great price. This game is relatively well priced, and will provide hours of fun and enjoyment that for most of you will be the best entertainment you've had in a while. At 15 American dollars for the game, with 5 additional for the soundtrack DLC, 20 dollars is a great price for this game. (Without DLC, the game is about 10 British pounds, 13 with DLC, for those of you in the UK)\n\nCons:\n~Though the customization is great, it would be a little better if there was more actors to choose form to play your characters.\n~Though it has a great storyline, playing it for the second time, at first, can seem kind of repetitive, and I found it hard to emotionally invest myself into the second set of characters. If you feel the same way, I advise taking a break for a month or two, so the shine of this game doesn't get burnt out.\n~Dr. Mi ah\n\nOtherwise, this is a great game, and if you were a fan of the Power Rangers when you were a kid, you're going to love this, although prior association is not required for this to be a great game. I personally thought ths was an amazing game.\n\nI give Chroma Squad a 9.7/10\n\nHappy Chromatizing!", "timestamp_created": 1431495658, "timestamp_updated": 1431495658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15808033": {"recommendationid": "15808033", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980616081", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480918316}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally finished the game (after having to re-start because my previous save bugged out due to having start a day before official release).

They take old ideas, revamp them, and put fun twists on them.  And they come out great.  The 8-bit graphics are awesome, so if that's a concern for you, don't let it stop you with this game.\n\nThe game is basically about your team, who are stuntmen, making their own TV studio to make a Power Rangers-esque show.  You have the 5 roles, and you pick which \"person\" is in each role, all with their own bonuses, so there's a lot of customizability in that. You pick colors and names, too, but that's pretty simple stuff.\n\nAnd then the fun starts.  The combat is turn based, grid strategy, and your characters get powers (more as they progress into each \"season\") so you start of with not a lot and end up with a plethora.  You can use teamwork to add to actions (like throwing a team member at the end of the movement range to get that guy who's JUST too far away or comboing for bonus damage on the same target).  It takes some time to fully understand, but it adds a level of depth that's VERY enjoyable.\n\nThere's a lot of customization, but I won't spoil that part, as it's hysterically funny once you find what you can actually change.  The gear is cool, too.  You have a shop, that you can spend money upgrading occassionaly, that sells gear.  It's pretty basic, but you know what you're getting.  You can also craft your own, but that leaves the effects randomly generated, so you could get something awesome (like a pair of boots that give you crazy high dodge and counter chance, fuck yeah!) or something absolutely terrible (like a helmet that gives 2% dmg increase to pistols, which you stop using pretty early).  You don't sell gear, you break it down for crafting components, which I feel was on the devs part a way to motivate you to craft stuff.  It does actually change the characters looks, so fun lil bonus there.\n\nThe story is pretty awful, but in a fun way.  At first you're filming episodes just to get viewers and fans, and no, they're not the same in this game and they have very different effects on your studio.  It gets downright hilarious, and they make a TON of references to other \"sentai' shows.\n\nAll in all it's a great game, and the guys at this studio really need to keep coming up with more games, because you're that breath of fresh air in this industry that they've desperately needed.  It's not going to leave with you a deep message, nor is it a game with a gripping storyline or gameplay that leaves you begging for more, but it's highly enjoyable, easily understandable, and wildly entertaining.", "timestamp_created": 1431325699, "timestamp_updated": 1431325699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15783422": {"recommendationid": "15783422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035191747", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432581084}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall this is a fun game. You have several different way to customize your characters and your studio. I am having a blast with this game but the problem is that I am running into two very annoying bugs:\n\n1. Being unable to do anything if an actor or enemy dies in a chain of counter attacks. Killing on a counter attack is fine but if the counter attack is countered and something dies, that is when the game locks up.\n\n2. The final mecha fight outright cashes the game when you launch an attack after a specific point. I am unable to get one of the endings because of this.

A Power Rangers rip off game?  What the fruity pebbles is this doing on steam?\"  Well, I will tell you what the fruity pebbles this is doing on steam, It is being one of the better games on steam as of this moment.\n\nIt is quite literally a parody of power rangers, because it was quite literally inspired by the same show.  The combat system revolves around the turn-based combat system, but with tactical movements and everything.  You have your basic healer, fast person, tech person, heavy hitter, and balanced fighter.  Using these five (or less) characters, you spend actions fighting an enemy squad of minions which would be followed up by a boss.  Since the characters you are playing as are \"actors of their own Sentai Show,\" a lot of their armors, weapons, skills, and enemies would look studio-made (or for lack of better words, artificial).  Also, if you have a vast knowledge of puns, jokes, or can catch onto references or parodical-cameos of other characters of the past 15 years, then you will chuckle at all of the things Chroma Squad throws at you.\n\nThere are also SUPER ROBOT VS. KAIGU {Sorry if I butchered the name} battles, where you go into your own Power Ranger-esque Robot that would fight giant sized versions of the bosses on top of the cities.  And you can customize even your own robot...  OH, and speaking of customization, you get to customize your squad (appearance AND names AND species AND ranger color), your studio name, the hero group's name, the robot's name, and a whole lot of other things!  Meaning you can make the squad as personal as you want :3!\n\nAlso, this game's soundtract is very addicting, as I would catch m.yself not playing the game as I just enjoy the amazingness of the soundtrack that plays in the battles.\n\nAnd this game is very replayable as there are three seperate endings...  as of this moment, I haven't seen any of them, and I have only heard of one of them and I hate one of my friends who spoiled a little bit of that ending for me >:(...  But since I hope you haven't been spoiled yet either, I assure you that if all of the endings are as good as what I heard one of the endings was going to be, it will be amazing!\n\nIn conclusion, this game should be on the top of you MUST BUY RIGHT NOW lists, as it is addicting, has a great soundtrack, has SO MUCH CUSTOMIZATION, and has laughs from the start of the game AAAALL the way to the end.

No. However Chroma Squad does capture the magic and feeling of its inspiration. The jokes, winks, and nudges are all done hilariously and authentically. Poking fun and at the same time honoring the source material. Being a fan just maximizes your enjoyment and lets you in on some of the jokes. \nThat doesn't stop Chroma Squad from being a very deep, rich, RPG. From customization of your Cast(Party) to choosing what weapons(props) to craft. You will mold your team into what you see fit. Battling minions, bosses, kaiju, and a budget. No two save files will be alike unless you want them to be. Not only do you have that turned based tactical combat. You also must manage your own studio. Choose upgrades to boost ratings, and what ad agency will represent you. All these choices and options can deeply affect the flow of combat, crafting, and if you succeed or fail. \nAll of this seamlessly blends together in this over the top and humorous RPG.

I could end this review here and now by saying/typing \"Buy this game, NOW!\", but I won't.\n\nWhat kind of game is it? A Tactical RPG. Most of the time you have five characters to control in turn based battles, each characters may move once and then hit an enemy or use some ability, or it may move twice but not do anything else. The characters are like clones of the Power Rangers and you may name them and also choose their colors, but not how they look... per se. There's some identities with different stats and looks that can be chosen for each \"Ranger\", but that's it. But speaking of customization, you may name your studio and also different catchphrases that your team will use during battle - for when they're using their finishing move, when they transform into the alter egos etc.\n\nThe battles in itself are really good and gets progressively harder as the game goes on, the final battle was for me really challenging, mostly due to the fact that I tried to keep everyone on their feet and I tried to meet every goal. Oh, right, the goals. For each battle you get two \"Director's Instructions\" that could be \"Defeat x enemies\" or \"Win in y turns\" and other things. These goals keeps the game interesting and also, if met, generates more money and fans to the studio.\n\nGraphics wise, it has a retro style, more 16 bit era than anything. Obviously it is modernized and polished to look a lot better. I liked it a lot, but then again I mostly like this graphical style. Sound though, the little I heard (mostly played it muted due to playing music meanwhile playing the game) sounded great but can't say much more than that.\n\nIn the end, if you're a fan of Power Rangers (which I'm not, so no requirement) and Mechas, you'll love this. Also, if you like Tactical RPGs you will probably like this, but the lack of depth in customization may put you off.\n\nLike I said/wrote in the beginning of this review: Buy this game, NOW!\n\nSequel, please?", "timestamp_created": 1430994012, "timestamp_updated": 1430994012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15721123": {"recommendationid": "15721123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097972599", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431386612}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game for that people who don't expect a hardcore RPG.

De mon point de vue, le vrai challenge tient surtout \u00e0 la relation avec les fans qui se fait essentiellement pas mail. Il faut dire que les otakus ne sont pas avares en critiques mais aussi en suggestions, et certains ont un poids consid\u00e9rables dans la petite communaut\u00e9 des fans de senta\u00efs.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 combat, il s'agit ici d'un tactical RPG relativement classique et assez simple \u00e0 prendre en main.\nLe tout se joue au tour par tour, avec une phase de d\u00e9placement et une phase d'action pour chaque personnage, h\u00e9ros comme ennemi.\nNos h\u00e9ros disposent tous de comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cifiques (un syst\u00e8me de personnalisation de l'\u00e9quipe permet de cr\u00e9er sa propre escouade en d\u00e9but de partie), lesquelles sont \u00e0 la fois li\u00e9es aux cascadeurs mais aussi \u00e0 leurs classes. On retrouve donc le leader qui est le plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9, l'\u00e9claireur qui peut se faufiler dans les rangs ennemis, le technicien qui utilise de nombreux gadgets, le gros bourrin qui ne combat qu'au corps-\u00e0-corps et le soigneur. Chaque personnage peut \u00eatre \u00e9quip\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment de ses coll\u00e8gues, y compris au niveau des armes. A cela s'ajoute des comp\u00e9tences que l'on peut d\u00e9bloquer tout au long des tournages, avec des effets divers selon l'\u00e9quipement utilis\u00e9.\n\nEnfin, une commande permet de r\u00e9aliser diverses actions sp\u00e9ciales telles que des transformations, des cascades permettant d'atteindre une zone \u00e9loign\u00e9e, d'effectuer des attaques combin\u00e9es ou de poutrer tous ensemble un ennemi bien retors. Reste que si l'on peut effectuer ces actions \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s n'importe quand, leurs usage est avant tout conditionn\u00e9 par la jauge d'audience. Celle-ci indique en temps r\u00e9el le nombre de personnes qui suivent la s\u00e9rie. Ainsi, il est n\u00e9cessaire de ne pas se transformer n'importe quand ou d'utiliser une super attaque de groupe alors que le combat contre le boss vient \u00e0 peine de commencer. Sur ce point, le jeu propose au joueur un ensemble de challenges \u00e0 remplir en d\u00e9but de chaque tournage. Ne pas les remplir ne fait pas perdre les combats pour autant, mais la chute de l'audience est garantie. Et sous un certain seuil, les fans partent chez la concurrence, menant \u00e0 terme le studio \u00e0 la faillite.\nIl faut donc combattre non seulement pour remplir la victoire, mais aussi pour faire plaisir aux fans, quitte \u00e0 ceux que leurs souhaits mettent parfois gravement en danger l'ensemble du groupe.\n\nLa plupart des \u00e9pisodes sont sanctifi\u00e9s par un combat de boss, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en deux temps. En premi\u00e8re partie, un combat plut\u00f4t classique o\u00f9 des monstres souvent ridicules sont accompagn\u00e9s d'une arm\u00e9e de minions qu'il va falloir latter sans concession. Ces combats sont plut\u00f4t costauds voire carr\u00e9ment bal\u00e8zes, les boss disposant de techniques qui ratissent large et font bien mal, sans compter que les conditions pour les vaincre sont parfois assez vicieuses.\nDans la deuxi\u00e8me partie, on dirige le robot g\u00e9ant qui, comme \u00e0 l'habitude, combat le boss \u00e9galement g\u00e9ant au c\u0153ur de la ville. Cette phase qui peut para\u00eetre simpliste dans les premiers combats se r\u00e9v\u00e8le finalement assez fine car elle repose en partie sur la bonne utilisation de telle ou telle comp\u00e9tence, lesquelles n\u00e9cessite souvent plusieurs tours avant de pouvoir \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 nouveaux. C'est aussi \u00e0 ce moment que le nombre de fans impacte directement le combat puisque ce sont eux qui d\u00e9terminent la vraie jauge de vie du robot. Autrement dit, si l'on a pas respect\u00e9 les conditions des combats \"classiques\", le manque de fans se fera cruellement sentir. C'est d'autant plus vrai que selon la fa\u00e7on dont on \u00e9change avec ses fans, certains guests peuvent nous venir en aide sur des combats d\u00e9licats.\n\nPour ma part, j'ai beaucoup accroch\u00e9 et j'en redemande volontiers (j'en suis \u00e0 la cinqui\u00e8me saison pour 12h00 de jeu). L'humour fait souvent mouche, comme lors de la troisi\u00e8me saison o\u00f9 le leader prend la grosse t\u00eate, persuad\u00e9 que les fans n'aiment que lui, ou cet \u00e9pisode o\u00f9 les vraies forces du mal d\u00e9barquent \u00e0 une convention otaku. C'est \u00e0 la fois tr\u00e8s r\u00e9f\u00e9renc\u00e9 (contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'indique le sous-titre, le jeu ne fait pas uniquement \u00e9cho \u00e0 Power Rangers, loin de l\u00e0) mais aussi tr\u00e8s accessible, en particulier tout ce qui touche aux relations humaines au sein du studio. On retrouve cet aspect gentiment d\u00e9lirant y compris lors des combats o\u00f9 les h\u00e9ros mais aussi les ennemis dialogues entre eux \u00e0 base de punch-lines volontairement moisies.\nLa difficult\u00e9 est aussi tr\u00e8s progressive. Il n'est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00eatre familier avec le genre pour prendre le jeu en main. En sus, chaque \u00e9pisode peut se jouer en 15-20 minutes max. Il est donc tout \u00e0 fait possible de jouer par petites sessions.", "timestamp_created": 1430892654, "timestamp_updated": 1430892654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15708361": {"recommendationid": "15708361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003048262", "num_games_owned": 848, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516388221}, "language": "german", "review": "Alle die die Power Rangers geliebt oder verflucht haben, werden Chroma Squad lieben!

Chroma Squad is a love letter and a tribute to decades of Japanese superhero shows such as: Super Sentai, Kamen Rider and the Metal Hero series. \n\n=STORY=\n\nYou start off as a five-people  team of stuntactors who decide to make their own Sentai-themed TV show in which they become a Sentai team themselves and fight against all sorts of monsters while managing their resources and fan-community behind the scenes. The first two seasons start very tame since you\u2019re still an indie Sentai studio with a low budget, but from season 3 onwards the plot becomes more serious and fascinating.\nDepending on your choice during the finale of season 4, you might either end up doing the Rider route, the Metal Hero route or the Sixth Ranger route. I won\u2019t spoil much, but each route has their own scenarios going on with interesting mini stories that contribute to the game\u2019s lore. The finale of the game itself is amazing, and is something to behold and be amazed at \u2013 I\u2019ll try not to spoil it, but it\u2019s definitely \u201cempowering\u201d.\nMind you, the game developers have suggested to implement more alternate endings or routes  within future DLC or updates, so this review might end up dated and not give a complete overview to what the story system of Chroma Squad offers.\n\n= CUSTOMIZATION =\n\nThis is arguably my favourite part of the game, \u2018cuz who doesn\u2019t want to make their very own Sentai dream team? You can customize your team by choosing out of approx. 20 actors, each with their own appearances and bonuses. You can also name them and decide which suit colour they wear, i.e. if you always wanted to make an all-Red ranger team, well here\u2019s your chance! \nThroughout the seasons, the game offers various types of helmets and suits that not only give certain statboosts but also visually alter the appearance of your hero. Unfortunately, the amount of actors and visual-altering equipment you can choose from is quite limited, so you\u2019ll have to either wait for future DLC or step up your modding skills.\nYou can also name your studio, your team, your giant robot, your transformation and lines of dialogue that call forth said mech, transformation and team attack. While it doesn\u2019t give you the ultimate customization possibilities like customizing your own hero costume or actor from scratch, the game offers a decent amount of customization which will hopefully be expanded in the future.\n\n= GAMEPLAY =\n\nWhile the game is a turn-based tactical system, it\u2019s not as complex or multi-faceted as Super Robot Wars, but neither is it overtly simplistic. You generally control five characters, each with their own stats depending on equipment, actor, role and bonuses you\u2019ve activated through studio upgrades or siding with the more favourable marketing agencies. Each role offers a variety of skill, the Techie and Support role are for example more oriented on long-range and healing skills, respectively. \nYour characters can generally do two actions per turn \u2013 in most cases you\u2019ll (1) move to the enemy and (2) perform an attack or (1)(2) move to the other end of the screen. Your heroes can wield weapons which not only increase attack damage but also provide with an extra skill. Last but not least, there\u2019s the Teamwork mechanic in which you can make two or more of your heroes pull off an combined attack at an enemy they\u2019re both facing.\nThe giant robot vs giant monster battles have a more mini-game feel to it, but it can still be one heck of an intense battle. It\u2019s a sideview turn-based battle in which you can hit the enemy multiple times until your turn is ended through missing the opponent, ending your combo with the defend options or ending the turn with a super attack. During the enemy\u2019s turn you must step up your reaction game to minimize the amount of damage your mech will receive.\nOutside of missions, there\u2019s also a light Studio Simulation system going on \u2013 i.e. you\u2019ll get to read and answer fan letters, upgrade your studio for additional bonuses, upgrade your giant robot, buy equipment, craft equipment or materials and side with the marketing agencies that give you the best bonuses or help you earn and gain more money and fans.\n\n= OVERALL =\n\nIf you\u2019ve longed for a game in which you can make your own Sentai team and fight against hordes of enemies with the help of unlikely allies and your trusty giant robot , then look no further because Chroma Squad is arguably the best Sentai game if not one of the best Henshin Hero games up to this point. The story, several dialogues and fan letters will make you laugh and smile \u2013 and perhaps, even give you the feeling that you\u2019re being a true hero of justice. Gameplay-wise, Chroma Squad is a very accessible game but not without a challenge for those who want to step up their game. While the visuals and soundtrack aren\u2019t AAA-tier, they\u2019re still pleasing and amazing to see and listen to nonetheless. This game is definitely made with love, and it shows. I can\u2019t wait for the future updates and potential-DLC this game has to offer.

The mecha fights are all the same, your hits are die rolls, and missing a 95% hit is infuriating when they pummel you 3 times in a row after. The saving grace for Mecha battles is that you can hold Enter to fast forward them like cut scenes.\n\nThe dialouge is pretty funny and the story riddled with pop culture references, this makes for a special kind of humor.

Multiply that 5 and you'll be doing a lot of strategic thinking each round of combat. \n\nThere is an actual strategically meaningful decision to be made between performing actions that are tactically sound and actions that make for good television. Because this game is not *actually* a set of heroes saving the world, but rather about a television show about heroes saving the world, your 'audiance meter' is of serious consideration. Often times the director's instructions (which, if completed, greatly helps your audiance meter) run counter to what one might do otherwise if thinking in a pure strategic manner.

Chroma Squad me deu uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o parecida com a que tenho quando passo horas jogando jogos como X-COM ou o mais recente The Banner Saga. Essa combina\u00e7\u00e3o de administra\u00e7\u00e3o com batalha para mim \u00e9 fascinante.\n\nO problema do Chroma Squad \u00e9... Todo o resto ele n\u00e3o faz muito bem. \u00c9 divertido demais as lutas, os golpes, a colabora\u00e7\u00e3o entre personagens, tudo, eu adorei matar cada monstro, mas quando o jogo sai dali, ou antes, quando o jogo vai para a batalha entre \"kaijus\", ele perde muito do brilho.\n\nA batalha final, o \u00e1pice de qualquer s\u00e9rie \"sentai\" que o jogo presta homenagem, \u00e9 fraca demais. Clique no bot\u00e3o, tor\u00e7a pela porcentagem, clique para se defender, use o golpe especial (ou qualquer vari\u00e1vel que voc\u00ea ganhe com o tempo), repita o procedimento. Os monstros as vezes possuem uma vida muito alta, o que acaba deixando todo esse processo extremamente mon\u00f3tono. Eu acredito que poderia ter sido colocado um pouco mais de esfor\u00e7o nessas lutas, afinal, elas s\u00e3o extremamente importantes dentro do conceito que criaram. Visualmente elas s\u00e3o divertidas, mas na pr\u00e1tica \u00e9 meio chato, simples assim.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o \u00e9 o ponto forte tamb\u00e9m. Mais para a frente, a hist\u00f3ria fica tamb\u00e9m desnecessariamente \"complicada\", tomando rumos que n\u00e3o me agradaram tanto. Acredito que a tem\u00e1tica permita a inclus\u00e3o de tramas simples, mas isso n\u00e3o deve ser um substituto para uma escrita boba, \u00e9 dif\u00edcil fazer o simples, eu sempre acreditei nisso. Fica mais uma prova dessa constata\u00e7\u00e3o. Mas, sendo mais justo, os personagens s\u00e3o bem caracterizados, cada classe possui sua personalidade pr\u00f3pria e ela \u00e9 bem evidente durante o jogo.\n\nA parte admistrativa \u00e9 visualmente interessante mas tamb\u00e9m se torna enfadonha, criar seu est\u00fadio, fazer suas roupas, contratar uma ag\u00eancia publicit\u00e1ria, tudo isso, acaba sendo s\u00f3 uma desculpa para conseguir mais pontos na hora da batalha, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o se sente t\u00e3o recompensado ao fazer essas coisas.\n\nBugs. Existem v\u00e1rios, alguns dele eu considero graves. Eu n\u00e3o sei se isso \u00e9 comigo, se fiz algo de errado, ou qualquer coisa do tipo, mas meu jogo foi prejudicado ou interrompido v\u00e1rias vezes por causa de um problema ou outro, como na batalha de rob\u00f4s, que mais de uma vez meus \"upgrades\" n\u00e3o foram aplicados, outras vezes que eu cumpri as \"ordens do diretor\" mas n\u00e3o foi contabilizado pelo jogo, me fazendo \"falhar\". \n\n[b]\u00c9 um jogo divertido, mas poderia ser bem melhor.

There are plenty of positive reviews regarding story and sentai fanservice.\n\nThis is based on playing the highest difficulty:\nThis game is a decent turn-based game in it's own right. There isn't much strategy to it. A bit of planning is involved to complete the director's instructions, but in the end it all comes down to luck. The most important thing to making equipment, materials, all based on luck. \n\nI have one save file where a certain material I obtain in abundance, and really dont need it as it's mostly for the starter equipment, and another save file where the only material I've been obtaining is the make the same pair of gloves. If you dont keep your equipment up to snuff, your rangers are as good as dead or too weak to complete director's instructions as the episodes difficulty increase.\n_____\n\nNow for the actual gameplay. Here is wear luck becomes absolutely infuriating. Let me give some examples:\nNow, remember, you control a squad of 5 rangers.\nThe director wants you to kill all of a certain enemy within, say, 3 turns. There are about 10 enemies on the field, and you need to focus on 3 specific ones. Those specific ones need to all be dead in 3 turns. Sounds simple enough, plan out how you'll position your rangers to catch them and take them out. \nNow, let's get to the problem:\n\n- Most of the squishy enemies, unless you luckily score a critical, can't be killed by a single ranger. This means it will take two of your rangers attacking to guarantee that kill. After a ranger attacks, they're done for that turn. This means it should be no problem for you to kill 3 of the weak enemies within 3 turns. Let's not get into details about some rangers having to use up their turn just to move around and get close to these enemies. We'll just presume you'll probably be spread thin and only have a kill average of 1 enemy per turn.... wait, change that from 'kill' to 'chance to kill'. You have a 'chance' to kill 1 enemy per turn. So if you happen to miss this chance, you can kiss that director's instruction goodbye, and restart the episode. Let's type how this will play out if you're unlucky:\n\nFirst turn: you manage to kill an enemy.\nSecond turn: you manage to kill another enemy.\nThird turn, your last turn to complete the instructions, and you're only one kill away: you order your rangers to attack and... the enemy dodges. Well, you're screwed. Time to abort episode and try again.\nThis is how many of your games will play out. This may not be too bad when it's just the start of an episode. However, there are times when an episode has 3 parts and you can spend an hour of your time going through the episode, completing all director's instructions only to have some unlucky crap happen at the very end and have to restart from the very beginning. \nThat's a lot of time to be wasting over something that's completely out of your control, luck.\n\nI'll give you one of my recent episodes as an example, there are three parts. The first two parts are simple enough, the third part involves a boss that can heal itself and many enemies around that heal. You have to kill the boss within 10 turns and finish it with a finishing move. A finishing move requires all your rangers to be next to the boss and attack together(use Teamwork). \nTechnically, you have to kill the boss within 9/10 turns, since he will stun your rangers(making you unable to use the finishing move on the 10th turn, as it requires all of your rangers) on specific turns... one of those specific turns being the 10th one. Now, that seems like a pretty decent time to take out the boss. That is, if you're lucky. Let's play this out:\n\n(We'll skip the small details and say you manage to get rid of the healing minions within 3 turns. You now have 6 turns left to take out the boss, who will also heal himself for pretty hefty amount. If you're lucky, he wont heal too often. If you're unlucky, he might heal twice in a row, making all your damage done to him in a turn, null. You still should have no problems as long as you manage to keep hitting him every turn and wittle him down. Given you have proper planning, you'll be just fine!)\n\nTurn 1/6: You manage to quadruple the boss, and dealing enough damage that will allow you to outdps his heal.\nTurn 2/6: You deal enough to outdps his heal again.\nTurn 3/6: He dodges, completely wasting a turn, and heals himself. That's okay, you see that you still have a chance to take him out in time.\nTurn 4/6: He dodges again... okay, it might  be close, but just maybe you can make it.\nTurn 5/6: He dodges again, and heals. He's now at full health again, it's game over. Time to abort and do the whole episode again, taking up another hour of your time.\n_______\n\nLet me give you one last situation. In this one, YOUR luck can be your downfall in completing instructions. Let's say you need to kill 4 enemies in a single turn. Well, remember how it can take two rangers just to kill one enemy? You have 5 rangers, it takes 2 to kill one. Simple math, you can't kill 4 in a single turn. Unless... you plan ahead and simply soften them up to kill at once later. You're so clever. A tactical genius in the making. This shouldn't be a problem, you've got the plan and the means to execute it! What could go wrong?\nNone of the enemies dodge, you manage to soften up 4 of them enough to where any single ranger can finish them off in your next turn. There's absolutely nothing that could go wrong. Unless... <.<\n\nIt's the enemy's turn: The weakened enemy attacks your ranger, it's super effective! At least super effective against the enemy, because your ranger decides that of all times he's going to choose this time to do a counter-attack. The softened up enemy dies. Now you only have three softened up enemies, maybe you still have a chance. You'll have 3 rangers kill the 3 softened ones, and your other 2 rangers can double attack some other enemy. Unless... <.<\nIt's still the enemy's turn: Another of the weakened enemies attacks another ranger. You couldn't possibly be so lucky you counter attack again, could you? I dont think I need to say where this is going. You know you're screwed, abort episode and try again.\n\n\nThe game could also stand to give some actual info on the stat points. There seems to be no info on the usefulness or effective amounts for Cooldown Cost and Skill Regen. There are other stats as well that have no explanation in the game, and you just have to guess and hope they're worth investing into.\n\nIf they cut out all of the luck crap, it would be an entertaining turn-based game that actually rewarded you for proper planning. Instead, it's always a roll of the dice.\nI dont know how many hours Steam will say I've played this game, but my first save file is 11 hours. My second save file says 3 hours. So any beyond that was just wasted time from having to abort episodes.", "timestamp_created": 1430771692, "timestamp_updated": 1430784393, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479118", "comment_count": "15", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15689153": {"recommendationid": "15689153", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980326592", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430955188}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't generally write steam reviews, but I felt compelled to do on this case.\n\nI'll keep this short. First of all, if you're looking for gameplay, Chroma Squad has a semi-decent system going for it. In fact, it's quite fun. Not overtly complex, but it gets the game moving. Figths have some interesting mechanics to them, and you generally won't find yourself being bored. Gameplay wise, it's fine. A Seven out of ten, generally.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this game a negative review however, are these two.\n\nFirst of all - and, I suppose, the less important one. The writing. It attempts to be this cheesy script played for laughs, but all it does is give you cringeworthy references that batffle you at just how badly they are handled. The kickstarter backer appearances are laughable and ham fisted. I'd actually feel embarassed for backing this and being put on it as it was.\n\nIt says it's an affectionate parody/homage to Sentai, but it instead feels like it's trying too hard. \n\nNow, you might say that you don't give a crap about the writing and that's fine. It's a videogame. So what's my second complaint?\n\nHow awfully BUGGY the game is, and in the worst ways imaginable. It has a tendency to constantly shut down, crash ,or simply not do anything after a certain sequence of events happened. I've gritten my teeth and bore it for most of the game, but the last straw was, infact, at the very last mission of the game, composed of two long boss fights - the last one being especially long, lasting possibly hours. The game proceeded to crash on the first one, making me lose all progress. It then crashed again at the end of the second one, meaning it put three hours of gameplay to waste, as the game did not foresee it crashing, for whatever reason. That managed to make me give up on the game and not want to finish it. The fact that the bug report icon is ALWAYS there on the top right corner should actually tell you just how unstable this game is.\n\nIt's a fun game. It's an embarassing piece of writing, and an awfully coded mess that's unreliable at the worst moments.\n\nUPDATE\n\nAfter replaying the game post-patch, performance has indeed increased. I've encountered so far only minor visual bugs that did not break the game nor make it crash, so one can assume the stability of the game is indeed being improved. Previous complaints still apply, and the game still has a couple visual glitches, aswell as issues with the achievement unlock system, but right now, it's properly playable. With that done, I shift my opinion to a careful recommendation - if you're a fan of Sentai, you can probably buy it.

You take over the role of 5 spandex wearing Super Sentai Actors who grew tired of their old director and start their own studio.\nThey use Blue Rangers Uncles warehouse to shoot their first episodes and find a prop from a huge Super Hero thing - which their old director finds out himself... From there on he starts plotting and you start raking in fans, money and cardboard to make awesome costumes.\n\nFirst of all - the Episode stories are HILARIOUSLY terrible! But then, looking back to when Power Rangers was a thing in my life... WHo cared about story? I dont want to see those 5 people at school! I want to see them beat up those evil bastards! Come on, make an entrance and beat the crap out of those Baddies! And thats what those episodes are about \n\"F**k Story, lets kick some ass!\"\nthe fighting feels like its fitting into a SUper Sentai series, with acrobatic jumps, multi hit combos and dreadfully colorful Team Attacks, and at times, I feel less like a twenty-something years old dude playing a strategy game, and more like the 6 year old kid, watching those spandexed Actors beating the crap out of other spandexed actors, Striking poses myself and being the Blue Ranger in Kindergarten.\n\nBut I have to do some critic here as well. As first - the tutorial covers the basics. and only the basics. It covers moving, acrobatics, Team attacks with basic attacks. But thats it. Okay - other things can be found out within play, like that you can start a Team Attack with a Weapon Attack, instead of a basic attack and that the Weapon musnt be on Cooldown as well.\n\nSecondly - Weapons. Your main weapons are your - gloves. You can buy and craft swords and Guns but they never seemed to use them in battle. just... punching the enemy. Until I found out that those weapons are Active Abilities, with Cooldowns and all.\n\nThe Amount of customisation is overwhelming in the beginning, and sometimes you may end up not knowing what to pick. But you'll come to understand.\n\nHowever, overall the game is awesome, and if you are a fan of old Super Sentai Series and in need of a little nostalgia fix, get this game!\n\n\nRandom Fun Fact : When Haim Saban first bought the US rights for the Power Rangers Series, he only reshot the \"Everyday Life\" scenes with US actors and took the Fightng scenes from the japanese original series and re-dubbed them.

I'd like to clarify that I'm a big fan of both management/sim games, SRPGs and Sentai, so I fall right into the game's key demographic.\n\nThe game is spoiled by poor writing throughout the gameplay experience - I understand the developers are working against a language barrier, but this means that much of the dialogue has no flow or substance. Tonally, the dialogue never seems whether to indulge in the action fantasy of sentai, or provide a narrative about the stunt crew pursuing their own career. The result is that the characters are constantly breaking the fourth wall which is not only tiresome, but spoils the atmosphere the game's (very good) graphics are depicting.\n\nThe game has been designed without level ups: where this might seem beneficial to some, they've replaced this tried and tested mechanism with a bolted-on crafting system. You become dependent on crafting gear from items dropped by enemies - worse, you have to hope that the 'random bonus' is actually worth having. The removal of level ups takes away a sense of stable progression, and replaces it with gear-dependence, which, for me, sucks the fun out of the game.\n\nThe management aspect is not developed or interesting enough as a worthwhile distraction, and the two gameplay modes (simulation/SRPG) don't mesh with each other in a satisfactory way.

Some focus too much on choice leaving you with a mountain of options and a hard time deciding what actually works for you.  Others are far too focused on the story and ignore a good tactical format for combat.\n\nChroma Squad hits alot of good notes:\n\n-5 classes, all with tie-ins with character archtypes in shows like MMPR\n-\"Actors\" that give different stat boosts to the class you slot them into, or to your progress as a whole, depending on choice.\n-Solid combat that feels good, without a mountain of stats and rules to learn\n-Various mini-goals for each 'mission' (part of an eppisode) that are typically not too hard to complete and net you more money to spend on upgrades\n-MMO style gear levels (White/Green/Blue/Purple) that help you determine which gear is better (not to mention easy to understand stats)\n-Alot of comedy moments before/during/and after each fight.  There are more references to pop culture, source material, and strange happenings than I can even begin to list.\n-Great badguys, even when they are repetative it's still funny to see the dialog that tries to explain why they are there.\n\nNow some negatives\n-Crafting system can turn out garbage gear.  You can break said gear down and try again, but it's a losing system.\n-Some of the 'mini-missions' don't work with everyones playstyle, there have been a few so far that I found irritating to try to complete.\n-Sometimes the 'jump' feature doesn't seem to want to fire for no reason.  This makes positioning annoying at times.\n-Music gets repetative, but not really a big issue, mute works wonders.\n\nI love me a good tactical game, and one filled with humor and references to some of the best (and cheesiest if I'm honest) shows/movies is awesome in my book.

The game clocks in about 15 hours (give or take) to complete one play through and is loaded with a ton of fan service and pop culture references that keep you constantly hyped and laughing throughout your journey. The blend of simulation and RPG is where the game truly shines and feels unique. You aren't only creating your dream Sentai team, you are a part of the show!\n\nOn the tactical side, the game does not get very complex, and I found the game to be quite a breeze on Normal, but honestly, that's okay. A game does not need to be hard as hell in order to be fun. However, I will note that as hype as the Mecha battles are they are pretty one sided and easy to complete most of the time. From the perspective of a fan of Sentai it makes total sense and you feel awesome beating up Kaiju for the sake of justice, but the above mentioned simplicity is why I couldn't recommend the game to someone just looking for a Tactical RPG fix. Though I would say at the very least look up some footage and if you are open minded enough you might really enjoy it anyways! Might even get you interested into Sentai etc.\n\nChroma Squad as it is may have relatively simple combat, crafting and business simulation but I strongly feel like that's the entire point of the game. The game doesn't just want you to create a Sentai show, it wants you to be the hero! So what are you waiting for? Get out there and deliver some justice!

Chroma Rangers!\n\nIf you grew up, like me, watching the Power Rangers or any Japanese Super Sentai, it's probably worth a look. \n\nThe game use a nice pixel artstyle with a lot of color... lot of chroma!\nAs far as I know, it's the first Super Sentai Simulator and the two years wait since the kickstarter was worth it.\nThere is a story to follow so it's not a sim per say but you have some freedom with the customization of your squad and studio.\n\nThe game fit perfectly in the Super Sentai genre with crazy weird monsters, lots of weird poses and a good amount of friendships and conflicts. There is also some references to other games or memes that can be hit or miss but most of the game is spent in battle or getting ready to battle in the studio. Only a few story scenes are long, most are short unless they are important to the main plot.\n\nThe Teamwork mechanic is interesting and add a good amount of strategies to the tactical gameplay. On the normal difficulty, you can go all in like the Rangers usual do and barely win or take your time and overwhelm the baddies. Only as few battle may force you to pick a more specific strategy.\n\nMy first playthrough took me about 14 hours on the normal difficulty and, at this time, there are 3 different endings with a few different stages depending on the path taken. Except a few specific choices, the game is linear.\n\nOh and there are Mecha/Kaiju battles! They are pretty simple but you can't have Super Sentai without monsters growing with those slow battles full of sparks!\n\nThis review was inspired by Chroma Squad that was inspired by Saban's Power Rangers that was inspired by Toei and Bandai's Super Sentai Series.", "timestamp_created": 1430681289, "timestamp_updated": 1430681289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501837", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15674729": {"recommendationid": "15674729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008015955", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492449033}, "language": "english", "review": "Much more fun than I was expecting.

It is so suffused with character and charm as to reach points of ridiculousness. It pairs down the infinite complexity of many tactic games to a small team of characters, which allows each to have their own personality. The storyline, though I'm only a few hours in, is the perfect blend of clich\u00e9, kitsch, and nostalgia that somehow comes together to be more than the sum of its parts.\n\nI can say wholeheartedly that I really wish I had seen the kickstarter when it was up so that I could say I had done my part to make this game possible.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention a few things I would've like to have seen, after all this is a review. I went in expecting to be able to make small graphical reprentation of my friends and I, but when selecting characters you select them as a whole character. So you can't choose what they look like without also choosing their stat bonuses. So, while there is character customization it's not as indepth as I would've liked.\n\nDuring gameplay you'll get access to crafting. I would've liked to have seen a slightly more informative UI and perhaps an indication of how deep the crafting tree goes. It would also be nice if there was more options at each tier. As it is, it seems to break down to two options, either straight HP or HP with some added utility. But, as I said, I'm only a few hours in. (Half way through Season 3)\n\nIf those two points started to scare you away from this game, please don't let them. I have not had this much goofy fun in a long time, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on it because of my whining.\n\nI unreservedly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1430677493, "timestamp_updated": 1430677493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15673423": {"recommendationid": "15673423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226830924", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433646380}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is much better than masterbating with sandpaper.", "timestamp_created": 1430675852, "timestamp_updated": 1430675852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15673279": {"recommendationid": "15673279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091615295", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431189857}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Vale Cada Centavo!!!", "timestamp_created": 1430675211, "timestamp_updated": 1430675211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15673157": {"recommendationid": "15673157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026688471", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490195377}, "language": "english", "review": "A neat game for Power Rangers and sentai fans.

Gameplay is nicely balanced between managing a budding hollywood studio, planning show episodes, gearing out your team, and actual filming (combat events) of the show.  The storyline is well written and kept me wanting to find out what happened next, combat is varied with all the different things you can do (teamwork, using items/weapons, skills, morphing (\"chromizing\") vs fighting as nomral people, and of course all the wonderful abilities that come up through gameplay.   Let's not forget the mini-goals you can choose to complete during each scenario and managing your fan base (answering emails...etc).\n\nI appreciate that you have a casual mode for people who want to build a studio based on purely asthetic decisions vs. the harder modes where you need to manage stats that items give production.\n\nMy favorite part is when building a team I can name them anything I want (I can name the squad anything I want too) and you get to choose the people on your team INCLUDING a loveable but useless animal mascot....well he wasn't so useless once I armed him with guns!  mwhahahaha!", "timestamp_created": 1430664421, "timestamp_updated": 1430664421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467950", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15670660": {"recommendationid": "15670660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978639219", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430662797}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever want to make pretend and create your own 'Power Rangers' inspired TV show while actively fighting your way through the story? Well with Chroma Squad you get that chance! \n\nChroma Squad is a tactical RPG inspired by the 'Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers' where you get to buy all your set equipment, outfit your heroes with new cardboard armor and weapons, and fight evil villains. All with the help and guidance of CEREBRO! (Cerebro is a floaty brain much like Zordon!) \n\nI played through the tutorial and the first \"episode\" of Chroma Squad and it was delightful and full of nostalgia. \n\nYou are a group of stuntmen(and ladies) that leave a show much like the Power Rangers and decide to go off on your own to make your own show! So you are given access to a warehouse which you use as a studio to try and create a better show.\n\nWith tactical rpg elements like upgrading your actors skills, costumes and weapons, you increase their stats like a regular rpg. However, you are creating a TV show. So you must also spend the money you earn to upgrade your studio, lighting, cameras and a number of other things.\n\nThe goal here is to keep your fanbase happy and create the best show you can. \n\nHere's my first look! (Still uploading it's so fresh)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNAKacig2dA\n\nIf you are looking for a fun, saturday morning cartoon inspired tactical rpg, then Chroma Squad is on point.(I mean I know you weren't actively looking for a saturday morning cartoon inspired tactical rpg.)\n\nThere is a lot to like here - great music, pixel art, and enjoyable gameplay. \n\nFor more reviews and podcast about Early Access and Indie games check out EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast", "timestamp_created": 1430664342, "timestamp_updated": 1431549230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15670346": {"recommendationid": "15670346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035067210", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431271926}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent, fun, and creative.", "timestamp_created": 1430662977, "timestamp_updated": 1430662977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15669813": {"recommendationid": "15669813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071861083", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431440812}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "the game is awesome but still have some problems\nuntil now there's one message we receive from the fans that has a problem\nthe message that is with a problem is: HEY DON'T DELETE OK READ PLZ!?\nso if you could fix this with a new update \n", "timestamp_created": 1430660694, "timestamp_updated": 1430660694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15669449": {"recommendationid": "15669449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035377458", "num_games_owned": 1699, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430651369}, "language": "english", "review": "A turn based make your own Power Ranger series.

We can buy alcohol, drive and get on all roller coasters.\nI mean I pretty much watched Power Rangers and the likes whenever I could, because well [strike]I have had smaller siblings so I had an excuse[/strike] ... err I mean I was forced to watch it.\n\nAnyway you don't have to be a fan of Tokusatsu and Sentai to fully enjoy this game. I mean it doesn't hurt if you are it probably makes everything just so much better but all you need to fully enjoy it is a sense of humor.\n\n[h1]Now on to the review. Retsu go![/h1]\nChroma Squad is a Tactical-Management-Business-RPP about running your very own sentai show.\nYou slip into the role of five stuntmen which basically got fed up that they do pretty much all the work while the actors are just sitting in their chairs most of the time. One comes up with the idea to create their own studio and so they quit their jobs to set up their own sentai studio.\nThis game is filled with jokes and references to the tv shows or to memes and it's overall a very good laugh.\n\n[h1]Now we get to the management/business part.[/h1]\nYou now have to setup your studio and buy props like mics, lamps or a better green screen. Those items will give you all special bonuses but also come for a price. You don't only have to pay once for those items well for some you do and others cost something like 25 bucks each episode. So you have to choose wisely on what to upgrade. Also you have to hire actors, choose an agency to help you reach a greater audience and make sure you're fans are happy since hey this is tv show!\n\n[h1]Onto the RPG part! Retsu go![/h1]\nIn case it wasn't obvious but you take the role of five actors and the director of your sentai tv show. You have to read and reply to fan mail which can grant you bonuses depending on your actions and then there's crafting.\nDuct tape, play dough, card boxes and many more stuff you'll need to craft your new items like swords, guns, helmets and so on. You can buy several materials and you can also recycle your old and unused gear for materials. You only have a % chance to get certain materials but hey atleast you have the chance to get some materials back.\n\nYour goal is to record five episodes for a season. Meaning you have to record and fight five different scenarios before you reach the season finale aka end boss battle. While recording the shows you see the directors instructions on screen which you should follow in order to get the max amount of audience.\n\n[h1]What else can I say?[/h1]\nIf you enjoy tactical and/or rpg games you should definitely give Chroma Squad a try.\nIf you like the good ol' Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger you will probably drool all over this game.", "timestamp_created": 1430656714, "timestamp_updated": 1451655882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615767", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15668677": {"recommendationid": "15668677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107786055", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502562435}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing need I say anything but game dev tycoon with power rangers!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1430655673, "timestamp_updated": 1430655673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15668012": {"recommendationid": "15668012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086253968", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431698663}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun!

It has action, comedy, interesting writing, and anything you would want from a PR game. You start out as 5 stuntmen who have recently quit their jobs doing sentai stunts to form their own studio. When you get into the studio thats when the real magic begins. Once there, you're able to design your own suits and mechas, something I'm sure any PR fan has dreamed of. \n          \n   You're also able to respond to fan letters and control your fan market to some extent by choosing from a wide selection of advertaisment firms. When you go into battle this game is a mix of an RTS and Turn Based RPG ala Pokemon. The RTS side is used for your simple ranger battles where each class has a variety of skills at their disposal, which grow as the story progresses. You're also able to do showy finishing moves on the bosses in true sentai fashion. My only problem with the RTS board is that sometimes you can't see parts of the grid because they're blocked by objects on the field. \n      The game then becomes much closer to a TurnBased RPG when in mecha form where you're allowed to hit your opposing monster a certain number of times before a hit misses and they hit back. But, all is not lost when they hit back theres a system that if you time it correctly and click in the white area of the bar you can block some of the damage. Think Gears of War's reload system. Everyonce in awhile though this bar lags causing you to get hit by the full blunt of the attack without a chance to stop it.\n\nTL;DR:The Story and writing are amazing and are VERY PR like. The RTS combat while fun has some issues with grid square blocking, nothing gamebreaking though. The mecha combat is far slower than the RTS combat but still quite fun\n\nScore: 8.6/10", "timestamp_created": 1430645020, "timestamp_updated": 1430645020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15666688": {"recommendationid": "15666688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022622803", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430676841}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "Best Super Hero Game Ever\nMore special character please!", "timestamp_created": 1430645017, "timestamp_updated": 1430645017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15666088": {"recommendationid": "15666088", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963362656", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511651264}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich bin dem Spiel schon jetzt verfallen.

Tactical RPG combat flows well and the team-up system leads to some fun things to do even while abilities are on cooldown.  Branching story paths make for some good incentive to play through multiple times.\n\nMecha battles are a little one-note, but still fun.  Crafting system seems to have bad drops, but with proper marketing choices and investing in some of the material packs you can make it work out.\n\nMy only complaints: YOU CANNOT UNDO ACTIONS, which is so frustrating sometimes, oh boy.  That's the number one problem for me.  Also there is not enough cool stuff to spend money on in the in-game store, as each tier boils down to \"defense armor\" vs \"offense armor\".  Crafting has one or two interesting items (the Speed boots and the Team-Toss gloves) but there isn't a lot of variety outside of the gimmick items, when there could be a lot more going on.  More actor choices (and the ability to recast them mid-series) would be nice too, it feels like a very small pool of options.\n\nThe game also ends right when you start feeling very powerful so I'd like to see a 'New Series' mode (where you do a new team with a new storyline but keep your studio) or some sort of extra seasons.  Some way to keep going.  The game feels a little short.  A 'mission creator' and some sort of endless mode with escalating difficulty as seasons keep going on could fix this, and I believe the developers are looking into these sorts of ideas.\n\nIt's off to a great start, it's an awesome game for anyone into tactical RPGs or sentai/power rangers stuff, and I hope it keeps improving over time.", "timestamp_created": 1430635383, "timestamp_updated": 1430635560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15664831": {"recommendationid": "15664831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093090120", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494520361}, "language": "english", "review": "I can make a full black/white team.

At the same time, if you step outside what the game celebrates you're left with an honest and simple Strategy RPG with map and encounter designs that genre veterans will find uninspired. The Episodes of the game are filled with colorful characters based on classic Sentai villains and antiheroes or pop culture and it is their presence and strength of personality that bring flavor to each individual Episode. So if you're prepared to be charmed, prepared to fall in love with the idea of being a team of costumed heroes, or prepared to be entertained by a campy throwback to how Sentai captures the hearts of children, Chroma Squad is absolutely the game you're after, look no further.", "timestamp_created": 1430616567, "timestamp_updated": 1430616567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15662030": {"recommendationid": "15662030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100911990", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487987539}, "language": "spanish", "review": "IT'S MORPHIN TIME!!!!!!  <3", "timestamp_created": 1430613215, "timestamp_updated": 1430613215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15661615": {"recommendationid": "15661615", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988522878", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431349007}, "language": "english", "review": "This game overall falls far short of what it should or could have been. I was getting more and more disappointed as I played further into the game. First a few key points of the game that are off.\n\n\"Hire Actors\", \"Cast actors\" Sorry but this is a once off near the start of the game you pick your 5 heroes which you can't change and must be in the 5 roles forced upon you. There is also no choices in villains or henchmen appear in episodes.\n\n\"Customize your TV studio\" No you get to pick from a small list of improvements that improve your heroes statistics, drop rate and fans per episode or unlock a skill rank that can only be used from certain seasons onwards even if purchased before that season. You don't get to choose what your sets look like.\n\n\"upgrade your gear\", \"craft weapons\" Upgrading does not happen you replace for better gear and in my play through all bought gear was better than anything that could be crafted except a few utility gear that increases throw distance or movement. \n\nAs for the rest of the game each hero only has a choice of 3 weapon to equip either a one handed sword, a pistol or their role's specialty weapon with a very limited selection of skills. During the episodes you play them out with no choices in what you do except for the very few times you change the ending path you are on. Even during a cringe worthy talk about not following sexist tropes I thought I would finally get a choice of rescue a boy or a girl but the game forces their decision on you. I really would have liked to have many choices that would affect what type of fans, how many fans you get and what the media is saying about your show. The game also has quite a repetitive feel to it doing pretty much the same each episode.\n\nAs for bugs I have had some random freezes where I can't continue the battle but can access the menu and quit out and reload my game. I have also seen directors orders not being completed where you need to destroy x amount of a boss specially summon (Bombs and Clones) but if your team does enough acrobatics and flashy moves the directors orders don't matter.\n", "timestamp_created": 1430610645, "timestamp_updated": 1430610645, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591254", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15660930": {"recommendationid": "15660930", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993178361", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430686872}, "language": "english", "review": "A must for Super Sentai/Kamen Rider fans that enjoy tactical RPGs.\n\nStory gets much better as the seasons go on ;)", "timestamp_created": 1430606844, "timestamp_updated": 1430606844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15660923": {"recommendationid": "15660923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071945188", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460417707}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "bom demais, recomendo fortemente", "timestamp_created": 1430606814, "timestamp_updated": 1430606814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15660801": {"recommendationid": "15660801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069468270", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475893315}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've ever daydreamed about forming your own Power Ranger-esque super hero squad, or if you enjoy charismatic and humorous Tactical RPG's, buy this game now.

Dabei greifen die Mechanismen auch gut ineinander: durch Aufr\u00fcstungen des Filmstudios oder basteln von Requisiten f\u00fcr die Schauspieler erstellt man quasi Gear f\u00fcr seine Helden f\u00fcr den RPG-Teil oder sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass in K\u00e4mpfen bestimmte Buffs wirken. Das wirkt wie aus einem Gu\u00df und macht, kurz gesagt, einfach nur Spa\u00df. \n\nDas einzige, was ich zu bem\u00e4ngeln habe - und das im wesentlichen weil ich es aus einem anderen Spiel besser kenne - w\u00e4re der Einfluss den man auf die einzelnen Folgen die man 'dreht' hat. Knights of Pen and Paper ist ein gutes Beispiel, wie man es einbauen kann, dass man zB bestimmt, gegen welche Gegnertypen man k\u00e4mpft usw. Etwas \u00e4hnliches h\u00e4tte ich mir hier in Chroma Squad gew\u00fcnscht, einfach ein paar kleine Optionen um die Folgen zu beeinflussen, die man dreht. Sei es, durch Handlungsstr\u00e4nge, Minibosse oder eine einfache Auswahl welche Gegnertypen man denn bek\u00e4mpft. Das h\u00e4tte Vorteile gehabt, wie eben die M\u00f6glichkeit die Schwierigkeit anzupassen und das zu belohnen (mehr bzw schwerere Gegner geben mehr Zuschauer als Beispiel). Trotzdem ist Chroma Squad ein sehr lohnendes Spiel.\n\nDazu wird keiner der beiden Parts langweilig, weil es immer wieder Pausen gibt in denen man sich um andere Dinge k\u00fcmmert. Das st\u00e4ndige planen der Finanzen, Marketing-Budget, Kost\u00fcme usw wird durch die K\u00e4mpfe in denen man die Folgen dreht aufgelockert - und umgekehrt.\n\nMeiner Meinung nach ist Chroma Squad ein charmentes, belohnendes Spiel welches zwei Genres verbindet, gut erg\u00e4nzt und eine Menge Potential hat.", "timestamp_created": 1430585387, "timestamp_updated": 1430585807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15655275": {"recommendationid": "15655275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996450743", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435169467}, "language": "french", "review": "7,5/10\n\n+\nThe best sentai game ever created\nNice RPG elements\nFunny story\nGreat music\n\n-\nCrafting system needs improvements\nMecha fights are boring\nBugs, bugs everywhere\nFinal battle is a bit lackluster\n", "timestamp_created": 1430582475, "timestamp_updated": 1430582475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15652609": {"recommendationid": "15652609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069180243", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499653384}, "language": "english", "review": "!!!!!!!!

Its one of those things where you're very easily amused by grinds and futile mechanics things will work for you, or if you thrive in the badness of things. Like naming your squad the Peepee patroller and naming your mech the WOBBLY SAUSAGE, caps mandatory. Its stupid, really stupid, not really lucid gameplay sort of fun, play it if you're tired, bored, and its priced at the fiveish dollars its worth. Man, it's 4 am RIGHT NOW AS I'M TYPING IT, I'm exhausted and my friends are asleep  after a night of enjoyment, I'm actually having fun while gorging myself on brownie bars. Still not reccomended, but, eh, if you're a sad little man and you know it, buy Chroma rangers, cue jingle I'm outies.\n\nTL;DR: Power Rangers (but not really, its more a side detail to people cracking dank memes), dull mecha maymays, some people are mad about Social Justice, but the game itself just isn't as thrilling as it promises to be. RIP in Pepperoni. \n\nNot really as great as its touted to be. It seems for half a second it would be tactically challenging but then you realize everything you fight is just an issue of placement, which at times could be avoided if you were allowed to pick your path rather than autorouting. The item system relies a little too much on you getting lucky, and only really serves to make you irritated wih things. Squad customizations are funny for a while but you really get tired of what you see soon, and its a bit annoying when you realize into the game you put the wrong person into the wrong role. Humour is forced. Good lord is it forced, not even mentioning the heavy handed shoehorned stupid SJW messages (which really don't make sense by the way), which, really, I understand given the market of tumblr being so easy to reel into guaranteed sales, but... the humour itself gets really worn out really fast. Audience system is mostly pointless since just running a lot and using the positioning system will top you out easy enough and it just serves to drag fights on if you're going for all of the pointless little guys. Not to mention, a lot of the skills look cool! Then don't really do anything compared to the normal punching action, combined with a lack of many real skills, its best to just stick to passives save for the one starter heal move and punch things to hell. Mecha battles are excruiatingly bland and don't really carry the oomph you're hoping for, its more of a rock paper scissors game but without any chance of losing unless you somehow hit ALT+F4.", "timestamp_created": 1430553779, "timestamp_updated": 1430734002, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15649321": {"recommendationid": "15649321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026617860", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430678419}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome. buy it now , 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1430553402, "timestamp_updated": 1430553402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15649312": {"recommendationid": "15649312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049194179", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432580680}, "language": "english", "review": "You can do a even better job than Haim Saban. 10/10 It's morphin!", "timestamp_created": 1430553351, "timestamp_updated": 1430588691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15649264": {"recommendationid": "15649264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970662806", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430978554}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not a fan of Power Rangers or any other shows of the genre but so far I've really enjoyed Chroma Squad.

It's a lot of fun to play, and the developers clearly have put their heart into it. I highly recommend getting it, though at the time of this writing it still has a number of bugs to iron out.\n\nThe game is challenging. It may be possible to resolve an episode quickly, but going straight to the finish line without doing anything interesting doesn't attract an audience, which you'll need if you want fans and money. Figuring out how to build your audience efficiently while keeping your squad standing is difficult and very satisfying.\n\nBetween episodes, you produce your show at your studio. Here, you manage your squad's equipment and skills, purchase studio upgrades, answer emails, hire advertising agencies, and choose which episode to shoot next. If you've played X-COM, you'll be familiar with this.\n\nThe customisation options really let you craft your own super sentai. You can choose your squad members, pick suit colours, name the mecha (the mecha's colours reflect the team's colours), write catchphrases, and of course, name the squad. The personal touches aren't \"cutting-edge\" but they make the game more immersive and playing a lot more fun. At least, I get a kick out of it.\n\nLeading my Cuddle Force is a man in a panda suit named Blossom. Squad members Make Love (yes, the button to suit up is labelled \"Make Love\") and they yell \"Cuddles conquer all!\" after transforming.

There there was the whole mess with release dates and stuff? Yeh? No? Well I don\u2019t. I just heard about Chroma Squad a few days ago. This game is proof that there is just too many cool game concepts out that, while I may not have time for them all, are way too under my radar. I\u2019m now realizing why indie developers always link other Kickstarters in their emails.\n\nChroma Squad is a tactics game based on the concept of the Power Rangers\u2019 show. The literal making of a Power Rangers\u2019 show. Chroma Squad, at its heart, is a TV show simulation game. You start out as the five stunt-people (of your choosing from default characters and Kickstarter backer-based characters) that get tired of taking orders and decide to start their own show. You make your way into one of the stunt-person\u2019s uncle\u2019s warehouse (in my case \u201cThe Fro\u201d) and find that it has a giant-floating-spikey brain in a jar (which isn\u2019t creepy in the least) and decide to use it as their own personal Zordon.\n\nNow it was listed in the video for Chroma Squad that you\u2019ll get a better reviews for the episodes you record with better and flashier moves you\u2019ll do during the show, but I wasn\u2019t totally convinced of this until I just went around one-hitting the baddies in the second episode. (Let\u2019s just say the tweets were bad for that one.) This part is right up my alley because my favorite moves and/or characters are usually the ones with the flashiest move sets because I am a visually stimulated person and things look cooler with explosions! That\u2019s where teamwork comes in. If you set one of your people to be in the \u201cTeamwork\u201d mode and another Chroma warrior attacks, the ones waiting in that mode will join in for extra damage and a bonus to viewers added. The more surrounding a bad guy, the more damage you\u2019ll do. If all of your buds are waiting around the same bad guy and you\u2019ve put on your Chromatic suits you\u2019ll do a super-special Chromatic finishing move complete with a catchphrase, light beams and power stances\u2026 good stuff all around!\n\nIt gets even deeper when you start crafting with drops from the level. Upgrades to your armor and your eventual mech are all done with common items like DuctTape, leather and cardboard boxes. I recently upgraded my mech with a cardboard box and silver duct tape and that just made me laugh. I have to admit that playing five stunt people who started their own studio and are making ends meet and working with what they\u2019ve got is pretty stinking interesting and also kind of cool.\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nChroma Squad is a solid title. It\u2019s good as a tactics game, but excellent as a parody of the making of a Power Rangers show. The option to upgrade your armor, weapons and mech with common items like play-do and cardboard is hilarious and fun. It definitely sets itself apart from most RPGs in that aspect, but still it\u2019s an RPG. There is humor and humor based on nostalgia and I enjoyed both! However, at its core it\u2019s a TV show simulation and so it all comes down to money and fans attained by the end of each episode. Maybe it gets a little easier at the end game with more things to defeat or something, but the same issue bothers me now. Since you obviously want the most viewers and money, I find myself dragging fights out to complete achievements/goals and to max out that bar. Is it necessary? Probably not too much, but it also feels like it is. Maybe it easier for some, but that meter is not my friend at times. On another note, that may not bother me as much as it does here if I could take this game with me on the go\u2026 say on my Nintendo 3DS? That would be pretty sick!

Along with some movement animations seeming awkward. Some maps will look really beautiful while others seem boring and bland.\n-The game saves between each episode/stage but if you do anything after that in the studio as far as purchases, upgrades, or crafting goes you have to manually save in a tiny as heck hidden button which brings the pause menu up on top of the hub menu. The game only auto saves once you beat a stage, forgetful upgrades beware. Or you'll have to waste a few minutes on redoing your upgrades if you forgot.\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, it's a great game.

This development team has sucked me in many times with the premises of their games but they never follow through with this premise.\n\nI certainly would have loved a game about making my own Sentai series where my decisions determine not only how popular the show is with the combat being real tactical battles with impressive \"fakey\" special effects with many of its comedic moments being just the sort of crud a studio would pull to save money. Yet that isn't how the game works.\n\nBasically to understand the game you take the role of several stunt workers who have decided to make their own \"power ranger\" type show. You achieve this by having random fights at which you are given goals that you must succeed, there is a story but the characters involved mostly speak entirely out of character at all times.\n\nIn fact that is probably my biggest gripe about the game's comedy is that it has absolutely no grounding. The game makes no attempt to even pretend like there is a show actually being recorded because characters almost never say their proper lines and cannot shut up for a moment about their own special effects or plotting. So some jokes, such as the characters not being able to transform because their costumes are in the cleaners out of show, fall completely flat because it never feels like this is interfering with the show because it just feels like a Larp. Another joke that falls flat is their constant references to their cheap teleportation effects, which would certainly be funny if they didn't constantly refer to it. The comedy could have been this game's saving grace, the nectar that would sustain me through the simplistic combat.\n\nOutside of this the vast majority of the game's comedy are references. The majority of them are \"references for reference sake\" rather then folding them seamlessly in the game's comedy.\n\nWhat the game really boils down to is a tactical RPG nothing more and nothing less. The studio runs itself and your decisions are just buffs, you are not the one writing the plot, chosing the opponents, deciding on the scenes. Yet what is there is just the barest of a tactical RPG, in fact if they didn't give you the ludicrous goals at the start of every episode the entire game would be too easy.\n\nYet even in this there are some genuinely good ideas there. Viewership, which you will max a little too quickly, depends on how you fight. Boss monsters for example must be defeated by your finisher otherwise you get a stiff viewership penalty (for obvious reasons) and if you waste a finisher on a boss and don't defeat it? You also get a penalty. Yet even this can come off as forced when you cannot even transform until your viewership is high enough (what is this viewed live?) instead of just allowing the player to carefully contemplate whether taking a penelty is worth it.\n\nThese goals are usually things like \"defeat all enemies before hurting the boss\" which are decent ones. Yet as you go on they become quite complex requiring you to carefully map out the field. The issue with these isn't that they are difficult, and they are, but that they are the only source of difficulty in this game.\n\nYou then collect crafting items from ordinary enemies which you can craft into weapons that are usually \"comedic\" so expect a lot of \"Bucket helmets\" and \"Tinfoil swords\". They have their own stats as well as randomized bonus stats based on how good the item is. These are equipped like everything else and to the game's credit all the items show up on your characters.\n\nYou can get studio upgrades and even marketing using the money you earn on each episode. Marketing for the most part effects the money and viewership of episodes for a small fee. You can also use your viewers to activate additional powers unlocked by that marketing campaign which can easily turn the tide in a fight from easy to rediculously easy. Studio upgrades amount to buffs and bonuses to shooting or to crafting as well as unlocking more items.\n\nTo shoot you are given a selection of fights you must do, and you will do all of them so don't worry, and then you get into a fight. That is what it amounts to. All the shoots are usually fights with usually the characters chiming in, out of character, about what this episode might be about (as said earlier they barely keep up appearances that they are actually shooting this show).\n\nI think what this ultimately boils down to is that this game is a disapointment in every level. It wasn't the game I thought it was going to be. Yet when I tried to like the game, the game actively hurt itself. Its comedy is forced, its tactics bogged down and simplistic, and the game is as linear as heck!\n\nFor those who are going to buy this as a comedy game, I should state that the trailer for the game is much more funny then anything you are going to find in this game. So watch 30 minutes of an hour of a letsplay and base how \"funny\" it is on that.\n\nGet this on sale for 5 bucks! If I could get my money back I would in a heart beat. Also feel free to say this is unhelpful because this review is negative, especially you production crew.\n\n-Edit: playing it a bit more, the \"acting in character\" does improve but the comedy still falls flat.

It kinda resembles new XCOM games.\n \nIts main meat, the tactical strategy, part is quite fun with couple of interesting mechanics. Things like doing combined attacks with your team members and or making acrobatic throws. Management part offer quite different choices. Such as transforming your viewers into either fans or cash. It has satisfying amounts of options in character customization and in RPG elements. There five roles and you hire different actors with different bonuses for each role and each role has small skill tree in itself. You can equip your characters with crafted gear with random properties. Even the mecha fights which are not the major component of the game has some fun mechanics. It uses combo mechanic where successive hit increase your damage but reduce your hit chance so you have decide when to use your finishing move. Have not finished it yet but according to the achievements pages it even has multiple endings so some replayability.\n\nStory and design wise i feels like a true old Power Rangers TV show. It has a kinda cheesy humor and characters it was to be expected from it's Power Rangers source and i personally found them funny. This cheesyness also includes popular culture references and memes. A small detail i really liked was that you can customize the color and look of your characters costumes and you can see these changes effect the looks of the effects and mecha and small things like that. You can also customize your warcries like when you finish a boss or transform or summon your mecha.\n\nOne last thing, if you do not like pixely art style that might be turn off for you.\n\n10/10, GOTY, would recommend etc.", "timestamp_created": 1430434489, "timestamp_updated": 1430434644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15629568": {"recommendationid": "15629568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041886057", "num_games_owned": 904, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464548909}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito Bom esse jogo principalmente para fans de RPG , Power Rangers , Super Sentai , Jiraya e outros tipos de tokusatsu.\nMesmo o grafico nao sendo aquela coisa o jogo consegue te prender por varias horas vc se sente o dono do estudio .Da pra personalizar as falas das transformacoes , quando vai chamar o MegaZord e quando da ataque especial.\nRecomendo esse jogo , a unica coisa que eu senti falta foi as faiscas que solta qnd eles tomam porr@da.\nNota:10", "timestamp_created": 1430434374, "timestamp_updated": 1430434412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15629422": {"recommendationid": "15629422", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981616554", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519611082}, "language": "english", "review": "Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG where you control suit actors for an indie tokusatsu (Japanese for \"special effects\") studio, directing them both in shooting episodes and budgeting behind-the-scenes. Your goal is to make the ultimate indie 'sentai' (Japanese for \"squadron\"; think Power Rangers) show by balancing fan acquisition and retention, and leveraging those fans for an extended budget.\n\nBrief plot synopsis: a group of stunt actors, tired of being pushed around by their short-sighted and creatively-deficient director, break off to form their own indie production team. They find a prop called Cerebro in a warehouse belong to one of the members' uncle, and make Cerebro the 'hook' for their new show. Unfortunately, they wind up garnering attention from more than just a growing fanbase...\n\nYour team is comprised of five members; you choose their suit actors (who each possess various stat bonuses and penalties), their roles (which determine what weapons they can use and what skills they unlock), and their colors (Ever wanted to have a ranger team without a red? Or maybe everyone is pink? Here's your chance!)\n\nThe meat of the game is the tactical combat - each episode plays out as a series of turn-based encounters. There is no 'initiative' stat, so you can move your characters in any order. Your get two actions, which you can spend moving and attacking (though attacking uses up all remaining moves, so move first), or you can use up the rest of your turn to use \"Teamwork\". The \"Teamwork\" move allows other characters to pool damage for a devastating attack, or to use the teamwork-using party member as a trampoline, bounding across the map in one move action. Each action builds up \"audience\", which acts as power meter and influences mission profit. Once you get enough audience, the \"Chromatize\" action unlocks, allowing your group to form up and transform into their super-powered alter-egos. Once in their hero suits, members unlock their special class abilities and weapons. Once you deal enough damage to a boss, a star and the words \"FINISH IT!\" will appear over their head. This is your cue to use a five-man teammate offensive and unleash one of your two finishing attacks (a standard melee finisher and a \"Form the Giant Five-Part Howitzer!\" weapon finisher that can be done at each weapons' respective ranges). Special \"Director's Instructions\" ask you to perform special tasks within an episode (like \"rescure the hostage in three turns\" or \"don't let any team member fall below 50% health\") for an extra Audience boost.\n\nThe first 'season' of play will end with you unlocking your giant mecha, which you'll use at the end a majority of the missions thereafter. Mecha combat hinges around stringing together punch combos - the higher your combo, the more damage you deal with your next punch, but the lower your chance of landing said punch. You can order the mecha to defend to end its turn (giving it a bonus to defense against the monsters' counterattack that scales with its current combo bonus) have the mecha perform a finishing move for massive damage (Giant bazooka arm? Energy saber? Chest-mounted laser? Take your pick, or take them all!), or use a defensive technique.\n\nAfter every mission, you're brought back to your studio, where you spend your hard-earned profit on new props and upgrades for your studio. The shop will allow you to buy a few choice weapons and suit parts, but nothing fancy; you'll have to craft the exotic items yourself. During each mission, you collect random materials which can be used to craft props for your heroes or parts for the giant mecha. You can put your fanbase to good use in the Marketing section, where you can hire different firms to grant an array of toggleable bonuses (Need a better drop rate? Go with The Green Team - alternatively, consider an Indie Marketing Gig if you want to improve your Audience-to-Fans turnover ratio). Go to the Studio to buy upgrades to your set (maybe consider some health care?) or mess around with your studio options (\"Lights, Camera, Chromatize!\" not cutting it for a transformation call? Why not try \"Powers Unite!\"?). The Mecha section allows you to outfit and upgrade your giant mecha for the kaiju-sized brawls. Finally, the Actors section allows you to review your suit actors' stats, change their special abilities, and mess with their equipment (You can't wear buckets on your heads forever, guys). During the course of the campaign, you'll make decisions through the in-game e-mail system, some of which affect which bosses you fight. While the plot stays relatively the same regardless of what you do (up until the halfway point, anyway!), there are multiple endings depending on the choices you make, and multiple playthroughs are necessary to see everything.\n\nI would recommend Chroma Squad to anyone who enjoys tactical RPGs, regardless if they're a diehard tokusatsu fan (but being a diehard tokusatsu fan won't hurt).

Nos anos 90 isso n\u00e3o mudou muito, pois muita gente brincava de Power Rangers... O que tecnicamente \u00e9 a mesma coisa, j\u00e1 que tudo n\u00e3o passava de uma desculpa esfarrapada pra batermos em nossos amiguinhos e eles ainda gostarem da gente.

E um jogo rec\u00e9m lan\u00e7ado nos d\u00e1 a chance de criarmos nossos pr\u00f3prios her\u00f3is. Falo \u00e9 claro, de Chroma Squad, jogo brasileiro que permite a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um Super Sentai... Ser\u00e1 que ele vale a pena?\n\nChroma Squad \u00e9 a nova cria\u00e7\u00e3o do Behold Studios, que voc\u00ea deve conhecer por causa do excelente Knights of Pen & Paper. Nele, voc\u00ea controla um grupo de dubl\u00eas de Super Sentai que insatisfeito com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de trabalho em Super Rangers, decidem largar o est\u00fadio e criar seu pr\u00f3prio sentai. A partir da\u00ed, eles precisam gerenciar os recursos e or\u00e7amento e elaborar os epis\u00f3dios com o que tiver. E conforme a hist\u00f3ria avan\u00e7a, as coisas se tornam cada vez mais elaboradas e incr\u00edveis. Eu n\u00e3o posso contar mais sobre o roteiro do jogo, que sen\u00e3o eu estarei dando spoilers.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 um mix de gerenciamento de est\u00fadio de sentai (de maneira simplificada, comparando com a vida real) e rpg t\u00e1tico. A parte de gerenciamento depende da dificuldade em que voc\u00ea escolhe, mas no geral as coisas se baseiam em constru\u00e7\u00e3o (crafting) de itens (recomendo que use o crafting para o mecha), gerenciamento de recursos (monet\u00e1rio e de f\u00e3s) e marketing. Al\u00e9m \u00e9 claro, de responder e-mails de f\u00e3s, que podem lhe garantir b\u00f4nus de pontos para usar melhor os recursos. Com o dinheiro conseguido nos cap\u00edtulos da s\u00e9rie (explicarei mais adiante), voc\u00ea pode comprar equipamentos novos, melhorar seu est\u00fadio (que lhe garantir\u00e1 bonus) e bancar a ag\u00eancia de marketing de seu show.\n\nExplicando parece ser complicado, mas fique calmo que tudo funciona de maneira tranquila e cada recurso novo que expliquei no par\u00e1grafo anterior \u00e9 introduzido gradualmente no jogo, de modo que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o fique perdido.\n\nA parte de combates \u00e9 dividido em duas partes. Na dos epis\u00f3dios normais, \u00e9 um RPG t\u00e1tico de turnos, com uma ressalva. Al\u00e9m dos vencer os combates, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio conseguir audi\u00eancia, ent\u00e3o \u00e9 preciso dar um show. Como se faz isso? Obedecendo as instru\u00e7\u00f5es do diretor, pontos extras de audi\u00eancia s\u00e3o dados. E no final do epis\u00f3dio, esses pontos se convertem em f\u00e3s e dinheiro. Cada personagem tem uma classe, classe essa que possui habilidades \u00fanicas que podem ser customizadas com o passar das temporadas.\n\nOs personagens podem trabalhar em equipe, e essa colabora\u00e7\u00e3o inclusive \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria para o golpe finalizador (c\u00eas sabem, aqueles que explodem coisas). Tudo funciona de maneira simples e intuitiva.\n\nAs batalhas de Mecha s\u00e3o bem simples de se executar, mas complicadas de explicar. Ela se passa em turnos. H\u00e1 um icone de ataque e um de defesa, al\u00e9m dos golpes especiais, que pode ter um ou mais icones na tela (dependendo dos upgrades de seu mecha). Ligado ao seu icone de ataque, h\u00e1 uma porcentagem (de acerto) e um multiplicador (de dano), quanto mais ataque, maior o multiplicador e menor a porcentagem (diminui 10% a cada hit), e esse multiplicador de dano tamb\u00e9m serve para o boost de defesa do mecha, e para o dano causado pelos golpes especiais. O turno acaba quando o seu mecha erra o ataque, o ataque especial \u00e9 desferido ou a defesa \u00e9 ativada.\n\nO turno de defesa \u00e9 simples, h\u00e1 uma barra com diferentes cores na parte inferior da tela e um ponteiro navega por ela, da esquerda para a direita. Voc\u00ea precisa clicar (em qualquer ponto da tela) quando o ponteiro estiver mais pr\u00f3ximo do centro, que vai definir a redu\u00e7\u00e3o de dano do ataque. E ap\u00f3s 3 ataques do seu oponente, retorna a sua vez. Cada monstro possui 3 barras de energia, e quando ele perde as tr\u00eas, fim de luta.\n\nGraficamente, apesar de ser 8-bits possui cen\u00e1rios muito bonitos (levando-se em conta a limita\u00e7\u00e3o da pixeliza\u00e7\u00e3o), e apesar de a princ\u00edpio eles serem um tanto repetitivos (quest\u00e3o de or\u00e7amento da meta linguagem do jogo, quanto maior seu est\u00fadio, maior a variedade de cen\u00e1rios), eles passam a variar mais nas temporadas finais. Cada personagem possui uma caracter\u00edstica visual \u00fanica e muitas vezes pode remeter a algu\u00e9m famoso, seja ator, esportista ou personagem fict\u00edcio. Quanto a disposi\u00e7\u00e3o das cores, quem cria \u00e9 voc\u00ea, sendo tradicionalista ou maluco (Sei l\u00e1, tem gente que quer fazer sentai com roxo, laranja, marrom, branco e verde) e isso se reflete no seu uniforme, que vai se alterando conforme os novos equipamentos v\u00e3o sendo comprados.\n\nA trilha sonora \u00e9 muito foda, s\u00e9rio, n\u00e3o tem outro adjetivo. \u00d3timos chiptunes que casam com cada momento do jogo. Seja ele tenso, tranquilo ou de reviravolta. O tema dispon\u00edvel n\u00e3o decepciona. E ainda temos dois temas cantados no jogo: O tema de abertura: \"Power of Love, Chroma Squad!\", cantado por Shuu Koyama (vocalista da banda japonesa Scoobie Do), e o tema de encerramento, \"Be Brave\", cantado por Hitomi Go.\n\nE caso voc\u00ea seja um f\u00e3 de longa data de Tokusatsu, espere ver um monte de refer\u00eancias a s\u00e9ries do g\u00eanero (e a outras coisas da cultura pop) durante a sua jogatina, al\u00e9m do que, h\u00e1 uma campanha extra inspirada por outro g\u00eanero, no caso o Kamen Rider, que extende ainda mais seu tempo de jogatina.\n\nFinalizando, Chroma Squad \u00e9 fant\u00e1stico.

This is an amazing game IF: You like Power Rangers or Super Sentai. This is the main reason I'm \"Not Recommending\".  I will still play for another 50 hours or so, but I'm a Rangers and Sentai fan. \n\n9/10 - Power Rangers/Sentai fans\n6/10 - Normal RPG, tactical fans\n\nChroma Squad has some mis-leading aspects, mainly that this is a simple tactical game, and not so much of a Manager/Studio Simulation, and it lacks any deep RPG elements. \n\nPROS:\n-Best Power Rangers game yet! No joke, easily the best. If you like Power Rangers at all- BUY THIS NOW! You will not be very disapointed.\n\n-Blend of tactical, rpg, and simulation aspects\n\n-Can customize team's colors, equipment, weapons\n\n-Crafting is available\n\n-Can upgrade the studio\n\n-Great retro music and art (some people hate that, I like it)\n\n-You do not gain levels. This is under pros and cons because to some this takes away from how much of an RPG it is. To others, this means no 'grinding'\n\n-Great GUI/UI. It looks very nice, and it's easy to use.\n\n-Contracts with different agencies. This is a really nice touch. I like this a lot. \n\nCONS:\n\n-The simulation/managing aspect is sort-of fake. You don't really become a fliming studio in the sense you get to create your own episodes. Nor does changing the 'actor' for your Rangers change their personality (a black guy with a mohawk has the same personality as an alien, who also has the same personality as a living beaver-man).  You DO get to choose the order of episodes, but this will only change the ending of the game (as of right now, when I write this). \n\n-Virtually NOTHING you do has an effect on how the story/studio/managing/episodes etc. Some things effect how many fans you get, and it will change these end-of-episode fake tweets (Twitter) \"Wow!  You ended with a finishing move! That was awesome\" or \"Lame, you need to change your gear! #OldGearIsLame\". This is a nice touch at first, but it becomes annoying. Especially when 'fans' want you to change your gear every episode, when there isn't any new gear avaiable.\n\n-Tactical elements are light: I did not feel I had to ever strategize to complete a level. \n\n-RPG elements are light: Very few RPG-like choices. When you beat a season, you get new 'Season Abilities', ultimately only allowing for 5 different abilities/powers/moves per 'Hero'/Ranger \n\n-Studio Management aspect is very light: Right now it only improves your heroes, and or Mecha. It can also give you more fans/money.\n\n-Mecha Battle: This is nothing more than a simple time-reaction game. It does not feel engaging, and also Mecha battles do not happen after every fight. So when it /does/ happen, it feels anti-climatic because of how shallow the fights are. \n\n-Crafting can be fun, but it also feels shallow. Instead of choosing the gear you like (like a damage suit vs a HP suit vs a magic suit etc) you just get scaling gear. So you end up re-crafting your old gear just so you can get the newest set. \n\n-Due to crafting the items in the 'Shop' are either much worse or much better in comparison. (Level 3 shirt from shop: 120 HP, Level 3 shirt crafted: 87 HP and +1 random property (likely of equal strength)\n\n-The story... If you buy this game for the story PREPARE to be disapointed. It's fully of tongue-in-cheek (aka humorous, funny, comical etc) elements. I am not a huge fan of this. The writing isn't very solid (Sorry Gui) and I never find myself wanting to know what happens next\n\n-There isn't a lot of gear/items/equipment etc. Half way through the game: 14 'equipment' pieces to craft, 17 to buy. Weapons: 14 to buy, 12 to craft. Remember, these only affect some visual looks and your stats. Weapons give you a new attack (which is nifty) but ultimately it's going to be a variation on the same thing (axe doing more damage than sword)\n\n-(Currently) no NewGame+\n\n-There are even fewer studio improvements to buy, making the studio/managing aspect even weaker. (I'm half way through the game and I have 10 available to buy) \n\n-Buying the \"bigger studio' doesn't actually change anything for the episodes. Nothing at all. (It provides stats, but does not change the episodes themselves) At least in Game Dev Tycoon the visuals changed to a larger studio and gave more options to do things. That is not the case here.\n\n-You do not gain levels. This is under pros and cons because to some this takes away from how much of an RPG it is. To others, this means no 'grinding'\n\nKnowing all of this: I will still end up playing quite a bit. And I don't mind posting this, knowing a lot of fan-bois will dislike my review. I still find the game to be fun, but very misleading. You don't really manage very much. (Unless equiping & crafting gear in any other RPG counts as simulation/managing aspect :P ) The studio improvements don't change much. The gear changes your looks and stats (like most games) but there isn't much choice, so everyone at a certain point will be wearing either A) Gear that was Crafted or B) Gear that was bought. You aren't going to use an old gear-set that has worse stats, and there isn't a choice between visuals (you get what you get, right now)\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1430427619, "timestamp_updated": 1430427619, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 290, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605488", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15627958": {"recommendationid": "15627958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017100620", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478235128}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Minha empresa \u00e9 a Zuera iLtda.\n\nMeu time \u00e9 Zuera Squad\n\nMeu grito \u00e9 A Zuera n\u00e3o tem limites!\n\n10/10 Huezaria de novo", "timestamp_created": 1430425896, "timestamp_updated": 1430425896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15627845": {"recommendationid": "15627845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037584410", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499532768}, "language": "english", "review": "theeey've got\na power and the force\nthat you've never seen befooore\n\ntheeey've got\nthe ability to morph\nand to eveeen up the scoore\n\nNoooooone will eveeer taake them doooown\nThe powaaah laaaaaaiies on their\nSayayayayaaaade\n\nGo Go Power Rangers\n(tururudururuu)\nGo Go Power Rangers\n(tururudururuu)\nGo Go Power Rangers\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers\n\nthey know\nthe fate of the world is\nlying in their hands\n\nthey know\nto only use their weapons \nfor defence\n\nNoooooone will eveeer taake them doooown\nThe powaaah laaaaaaiies on their\nSayayayayaaaade\n\nGo Go Power Rangers\n(tururudururuu)\nGo Go Power Rangers\n(tururudururuu)\nGo Go Power Rangers\nyou Mighty Morphin Power Rangers", "timestamp_created": 1430425336, "timestamp_updated": 1430425336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15627692": {"recommendationid": "15627692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044626433", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501132058}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game.

As such, you'll have to manage your money, buy upgrades to the studio, new clothes for your actors and hire people to take care of your marketing strategy. \nThe meat of the game, however, lies between these management sessions. Whenever you record an episode, the game becomes a tactical RPG: you start giving orders to your actors on where to move, who to attack, stuff like that.\nIt's an amazingly stylish game. The pixel-art is awesome, the soundtrack is pure chiptune bliss (plus a main theme with japanese lyrics!) and the game is packed with references to pop culture and super sentais in general.\nYou don't really need to be a super sentai fan to enjoy the solid tactics mechanics in this game, but it surely adds to the overall experience. I recommend this game to anyone who ever enjoyed a Power Rangers episode or is just itching for a new TRPG game.\n\nTL;DR: Awesome Tactical-RPG with stylish graphics, soundtrack and references.

Wer auf schnelle Action hofft ist hier nicht ganz richtig. Die K\u00e4mpfe gehen zwar flott von der Hand aber es sollte auch ein bisschen Hirnschmalz benutzt werden, da die K\u00e4mpfe schnell recht fordernd werden.\nNeben den K\u00e4mpfen muss man aber noch ein Filmstudio unterhalten, sich um die Ausr\u00fcstung k\u00fcmmern und wie in jedem RPG auch seine Truppe leveln. Ebenso muss Marketing betrieben und Fanpost beantwortet werden um die Reichweite der eigenen Sendung zu erh\u00f6hen, denn es muss schlie\u00dflich auch Geld verdient werden, um die Sendung zu finanzieren. Jede einzelne Folge der Sendung muss produziert werden und am Ende jeder Staffel gibt es ein gro\u00dfes Staffelfinale.

What is tokusatsu? It's a style of Japanese live action television featuring transforming super heroes, martial arts, and special effects and stunts.\n\nLet me first say this: don't let the \"Inspired by Saban's Power Rangers\" throw you or discourage you from buying it. The designers were forced to put that under threat of legal action from Saban, and there are a few subtle digs at Saban throughout the game. Tokusatsu heroes are much bigger than just what came to the West as Power Rangers. In actuality, many countries including Brazil and France got Japanese tokusatsu super heroes in the eighties and nineties before Power Rangers was a \"thing\", and that is inspired by the full range of Japanese superhero shows. Fans of tokusatsu heroes will spot references not only to classic Super Sentai, but also to Kamen Rider and Metal Hero shows such as Space Sheriff Gavan and Juspion.\n\nThere are two main portions to the game: tactical combat and studio management. In the tactical combat portion, you battle \"mook\" enemies and a \"monster of the week\" in a format almost identical to Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea in an isometric perspective. There are always \"objectives\" for each episode given by your show director such as performing a certain number of stunts or defeating the enemy in a certain way. Doing so will boost your ratings and improve the show's income.\n\nIn the studio management portion, you purchase and set up upgrades for your humble studio, investing in better cameras, hiring big name actors and skilled crew, and upgrading your special effects and costumes. While your costumed heroes may start out with a mop bucket on their head and bicycle pads for armor, with enough positive fan reaction (which you'll see after each episode is filmed via a sampling of tweets about the episode) you might eventually be wearing costumes on the level of a professional production! Additionally, interactions with other companies and fans might affect your production. What will you do when other studios start coming to you with their hands out? Take them to court or give them a cut? What will you do when overseas fansubbers start subbing your show? Let them on the chance it'll increase your merchandising, or drop the hammer on them?\n\nIn addition to this, you have a great deal of customization of your show itself. You can name your studio, name your super hero team, and even customize what they say when they transform or do their super attack. Want them to shout out, \"Henshin!\" when they transform instead of the default? You can do it! Want to pick your own colors instead of the default? You can do it! Want to have an Orange Ranger instead of a Yellow Ranger? Want them ALL to be red heroes? Yes, you can even do that!\n\nThis game follows the standard Sentai story elements: heroes battle foot soldier \"mooks\" on foot in their civilian clothes until they build up enough power (audience approval!) to transform -- and when they do, it boosts your audience approval even more. Once you defeat the monster of the week, of course, as any fan of the shows know, the monster has to grow huge. And what would Sentai be without giant robot battles? Purchase gear and equipment, assemble your giant robot and have a battle on a massive scale. \n\nIn addition, there is a motorcycle prop you'll receive later, and an option to shift the show into a \"solo mode\" featuring a lone motorcycle Rider hero with a flowing scarf that favors jump kicks as his preferred method of defeating monsters. So in case you are curious -- yes, you CAN be a Kamen Rider!\n\nThe graphics are 8-bit, but don't let that discourage you. The animations are great, the characters are big and bright with big cutscenes when important events happen. The music is catchy and reminiscent of classic Commodore chiptunes or Nintendo 8-bit sounds with a catchier sound.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. If you're a tokusatsu fan, you definitely will want to play this, but even if you just have a passing interest in superheroes, tactical battle games, or managing a TV studio, the charm and uniqueness of this game will certainly entertain you.", "timestamp_created": 1430407358, "timestamp_updated": 1430407358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684464", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15624049": {"recommendationid": "15624049", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975622942", "num_games_owned": 2151, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443883050}, "language": "english", "review": "First Impressions: Will Update as I play more\n\nChroma Squad is a pixel art tactical turn based Rpg. \nYou are a bunch of stuntmen and women that decided to strike out on their own and start a tv studio.\nYou take contracts, set up costumes and weapons,  battle it out in power ranger like episodes that lead to boss fights. \nAll in all its been good fun so far. \n\nSo far in my limited playtime i would most certainly recommend this game. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1430407235, "timestamp_updated": 1430407235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15623814": {"recommendationid": "15623814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012992219", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445664376}, "language": "english", "review": "When the game starts, its pretty obvious that the devs are big big fans of the source material.

Seeing this game progress over time was just amazing. Especially to see, how the developers sometimes struggled, but what they have now delivered is really big fun.\n\n\nYou play as a 5 people stunt crew that worked for a very mad producer but decide to quit and create your own show.\n\nThe game basically exists from 3 parts:\n- Studio management (Buying Props, handling Marketing, dealing with spam mails)\n- Episode recording (fights of your squad agains a bunch of enemies, kicking butts)\n- Mecha fights (mini game type 1-on-1 fights)\n\nThe mechanics of the game seem to be very simple, and I guess they really are. But the gags that have been hidden everywere are just great (I guess, a lot of people might miss a lot, as they are too young).\n\nThere is only bad thing I can tell about the game:\n@DEVS: Please add that the virtual keyboard pops up, when I play on a Tablet on my train journeys :)", "timestamp_created": 1430404862, "timestamp_updated": 1430404862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721102", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15623365": {"recommendationid": "15623365", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979940152", "num_games_owned": 1106, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459830183}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the love letter game to childhood heroes we need and deserve. \n\nThis game was made for and by Tokusatsu fans and you can really feel it while playing the game.

Each has a specific role ingame that makes one more awesome than the other. \nThe plot divides and intertwines between \"real-life\" and show which leads to funny dialouges between the characters and enemies.\n\nThe game itself is NOT a serious simulation and even makes fun of itself. Its mixed with a little bit of income managment and skill editing of the different classes by crafting and/or buying items.\nThe crafting menu is not complex and not too simple - you get new equipment to buy/craft every \"season\"(which can be compared to chapters) which require rare materials you can find during an episode(level) or craft/recycle out of lower grade materials.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be compared to other RBS - you move your characters a given number of tiles per turn and attack - or use a weapon - or use a skill - or prepare for 'Teamwork' to unleash the super epic ultra finishing move penta deluxe!!!\nWhile gameplay is kept simple the game gives you a number of goals you have to achieve (like: Kill [...] in 2 turns.) in order to gather more audience and get more money and fans for that episode(level) which get harder just like the enemies.\n\nWhile the enemies are sort of clone troopers its not getting boring since you will encounter a new enemytype or boss almost every level.\nThe graphics themselves are outstanding (my bar for this one is not set too high) - the looks of the actors are changing with the equipment they are wearing and animations are smooth and flawless. You can see every minute that went into the creation of every art asset in this game.\n\nI'm not quite through with the game but as far as I played I would say that since I saw it on gamescom 2014 it lived up to all my hopes I put in it and didn't waste any of its possible potential. I absolutely fell in love with this game.

Somehow, I missed the disclaimer on this originally.\n\nNot since Darkest Dungeon has an experience hit on as many levels as Chroma Squad has. There is a lot of wonderful design decisions made here, and the attention to detail is what shines here: Every detail seems to be thought out from the wonderful Tactical RPG that involves acrobatics and teamwork, to the detail of the story that plays to the strength of the nostalgia of the old Power Rangers. I had this goofy grin on my face the entire time I was playing the game, and this game is an early contender for Indie game of the year. It's that good.\n\n+:\n-Team based combat, especially on hard difficulties, rewards thinking and strategy in its teamwork based combat. Acrobatics (the ability to launch people further then they could run by themselves.\n-Strong detail payed attention to the details of each episode within the story, to make it feel like a old Power Rangers episode/series. \n-Customization of game takes things to new levels with catchphrases and squad names. Adds a whole level of immersion. \n-Little Details make the experience that much more immersive, such as punishing for using a finishing move that doesn't kill a monster. Audience gauge and Director guidelines help add challenge to make the episode more flashy. \n-Overall, the nostalgia that the game repeatedly hits works on almost every level, from the 8 bit graphics to the references to the series past. In addition, it's able to mix up the modern day media/internet culture into it as well. \n-Studio upgrades leave a lot of different options to play around with. Upgrades, Mech Upgrades, Studio Upgrades, etc.\n\n-:\n-Mech battles could be a little bit more challenging.\n-Some more information can be provided at times regarding teamwork skills (like the supports healing factor, for example)\n-Comes very close to copyright infrigenment in several cases.

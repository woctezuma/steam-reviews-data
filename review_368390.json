From the John Carpenter-esque music to the retro pixelated atmosphere to the pun-wielding duo of McQueen and Dooley, this game is nothing short of lovable. Throw in some dad-level nerd jokes that would melt even the coldest heart and puzzles that are not overly complicated but always satisfying and you have the recipe that, for me anyway, makes for a great little indie gaming experience.\n\nThe cases are rather short (even the longest will run you only about an hour in playtime) and I definitely wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for some really hardcore puzzling, but what I like about the structure of the game is that the puzzles are always varied and enjoyable. Sometimes you're just hunting for clues, but other times you'll be asked to play small mini-games (like tile puzzles, etc.) which keeps it interesting! Though the puzzles are fairly light, you will still run into small roadblocks here and there that may have you hunting for a guide after clicking every inch of the screen, but for the most part, I was rarely frustrated and never bored and it was the perfect balance!\n\nThat being said, where the charm really shines is in the writing. This game is rife with nerdy pop-culture references (everything from Twin Peaks to X-Files to Lovecraft to games like Mass Effect), but the story itself isn\u2019t necessarily focused on horror if anyone was worried about that. It does amp the level of enjoyment if you get some of the references, but I wouldn\u2019t call this game scary by any means because it\u2019s all embedded in a THICK layer of adorable humor that makes it all charming and fun regardless. This game will definitely make you laugh if you have any appreciation for puns (and even punnier references) and I highly, highly suggest you click Dooley everywhere you go because his dialogue with McQueen is pretty priceless. Those two have great back and forth (I can't be the only one who ships it) and Dooley is the most lovable kind of idiot you'll be glad to call sidekick through all your paranormal sleuthing adventures.\n\nCan\u2019t say enough good things about this perfect little game and am really hoping to see more soon! 10/10, would recommend!!", "timestamp_created": 1514519029, "timestamp_updated": 1514519229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38803109": {"recommendationid": "38803109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007009565", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1514503372}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastically a put together and well rounded point and click adventure with story elements split up into \"cases\", each case has its own unique story and mystery to solve. \n\nThat rolled in with the humour and puzzles makes for a very pleasing if somewhat short gaming experiance.\n\nThings that attracted me initially:\n-------------------------------------------------\n1. The pixel art is nicely done.\n2. Point and click adventures are the sh*t.\n3. Shpookyness.\n\nThings I like about it after playing it through.\n-------------------------------------------------\n1. The banter between the two main characters is very funny at times and made me fall in love with them instantly, the humour gives the game a lot of charm.\n2. The levels though sometimes at first appear small can be quite complex and interesting, a little like the tardis, this is goes for the puzzles too.\n3. Lots and lots of gaming / pop culture references.\n4. Tickles the nostalgia glands in a good way. \n\nAll in all I would recommend picking up this game as it can provide a few hours of well written story in bite sized chunks that you can play at your leisure and it is also fairly cheap.\n\nI had a lot of fun playing it despite it being rather short, I would love more cases to get stuck in too however what is there is brilliantly written and very well executed.\n\n10/10 for me.", "timestamp_created": 1514514365, "timestamp_updated": 1514514365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38798333": {"recommendationid": "38798333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406635994", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "last_played": 1514563406}, "language": "english", "review": "This is literally what I did on Christmas.

The main high point of the game is clearly the humour, to the extent that I don't think you're getting the full experience if you don't click on everything and read every line of text. I did thoroughly enjoy it, although you should probably know what you're getting into before you start playing. If you like funny point and click adventure games as well as meta humour, you'll probably like this. At time of me writing this, I believe one of the achievements to be bugged but I firmly believe that they will work to fix it as they have with other problems that have cropped up. I thought the final DLC case was pretty fun but there was some logic in it that didn't make too much sense to me. Maybe it just stuck out to me more because it's brand new and so was hard to find help for online. The game wasn't too long but it's episodic nature makes it seem like you can just put it down and then come back later and pick it back up. The cases aren't really related to each other so you can leave time between playing them if you so wish. That said, I did feel more motivated to play through than another episodic game that I bought this year which I shall not name. \nI'm writing this review just because, honestly, I don't think this game will receive as much exposure as it should and if I can do something small to help that, then here it is.

Unfortunately, in-jokes and puns are all this game has going for it.  Darkside Detective isn't very good.\n\nI enjoyed the graphics, and some of the jokes made me chuckle (the characters of McQueen and Dooley are goofy, but they make for a decent \"buddy-cop\" couple), but the core gameplay is too simple, and unsatisfying.  All of the puzzles have obvious solutions, and are of the \"add this-to-that\" variety - most of the puzzles in any one room can be solved by using a key item from the room just next door.  I suppose the gameplay's shortcomings could be overlooked if the story was compelling, but it's just a formulaic pastiche of tropes from supernatural television shows, horror movies and other, better adveture games.  There's nothing original here.  What's worse is that for a supernatural game involving a detective, the episodic stories in Darkside Detective don't have a mystery that ties them altogether at the end.  Each little story happens - and then there's a final story, and that's the end.  There's nothing nefarious, nor amuzing behind the Spooky Door - just some shlock about a zombie mobster.  It's Scooby-Doo stuff, but without the charm.\n\n\nI can't recommend anyone download this game; in terms of narrative and in terms of gameplay, this one is a letdown.

Very punny if that's your thing (it's mine, and I loved every one of them), if not this game probably isn't for you (or most games of this genre). It was kinda weird to me that it didn't go all out in either serious/dark or silly plot like most point-and-click adventures go (especially a paranormal one) but once I realized that I got into it more for what it was. I really enjoyed the two leads Detective McQueen & Officer Dooley. They have great chemistry and play off each other well enough to keep the cases fun and hold stakes at the end. The subplot about the darkside unit and it's origins and relationship with the city is very interesting and would be great to springboard off of if this game does well enough to do a sequel!\n\nThe game itself is kinda short given that each of the 6 cases isn't that long, but given the price and quality I'd say what I got was pretty fair. While short, each case (by my gauge) where mostly just challenging enough. I *tried* not to cheat and most of the logic is pretty sound, but still at least once a case on average I had to look up what to do, but that just might be my shortcoming, it all made sense. The music was pretty nice, as well as the art. \n\n*I DID initially play with my sister, but she quit by the 2nd case because there is a lot of flickering lights used for atmosphere (especially in the 2nd case) and it's migraine inducing if you'r sensitive to it (even with my brightness all the way down, it gave me a headache and I tried to avoid those rooms). \n*The only other sensory complaint was fly noises in two screens in the 5th case. They are REALLY irritating (to me personally, most people probably not so much) and I feel like they didn't really add to the camp vibe despite how (disturbingly) real they sounded. Neither of those things took my enjoyment away from playing the game per say (aside from not being able to include my sister), but I feel like they should still be taken note of.\n\nBUT those grievences took up a very small slice of the game, which I could tell was made with a lot of heart, and puns.

Not that watching the trailer didn't provide its share of warning signs. But I didn't listen to my gut feeling. First of all, the engine turned out to be to be much more crude and basic than I expected, and the puzzles (at least in the first 2 cases) provided zero challenge value. The art design, music and the graphics are, however, excellent, and probably the main reason people choose to ignore the game's staggering flaws.\n\nWhat could offset the pedestrian gameplay is the story and characters, of course, but the game falls terribly flat here, providing a pre-teen level of storytelling and characterisation, not to mention the insufferable forcing of continuously uninspired humour, whose painful delivery is placed completely above any attempt to provide a compelling story and characters. It's like an extreme case of Sword & Sworcery, where a brilliantly looking game with a wonderfully atmosphere and art design is in such a jarring opposition to the quality of its story and writing, it's tragic to witness it.\n\nI don't have a habit of writing reviews here, but this is by far the most deceiving ratio of approval in comparison with the product quality I ever experience on this platform, so I felt a need to compile a personal disapproval. Hopefully my review will make some people think twice before buying this without trying the demo.\n\nIt is definitely worrying to see this amount of praise and approval, Steam curators included (!), for such a dubious product.

Creo que la frase que m\u00e1s veces he repetido cuando alguien me ha pedido mi opini\u00f3n sobre un proyecto que estaban comenzando ha sido \u201cvale, pero no te flipes\u201d. Centrar el tiro en cualquier tipo de proyecto creativo es siempre de las cosas m\u00e1s complicadas, y el elemento interactivo del videojuego lo hace todav\u00eda m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil. Quiz\u00e1s por eso, o porque me veo completamente reflejado en esos t\u00edtulos que introducen elementos que no terminan de llevar a ning\u00fan lado (MI VIDA), valoro tanto cuando un t\u00edtulo es completamente consciente de sus puntos fuertes y trata que el resto de elementos se encarguen de resaltarlos. The Darkside Detective es quiz\u00e1s uno de los mayores ejercicios en este sentido que me he encontrado este a\u00f1o. Su posici\u00f3n es la de un francotirador invisible que \u00fanicamente levanta la mirilla cuando se dispone a disparar, aunque aqu\u00ed no ser\u00e1n balas, sino un mont\u00f3n de buenos di\u00e1logos y situaciones que lo elevan como un entretenimiento de lo m\u00e1s recomendable.\n\nThe Darkside Detective es un point & click can\u00f3nico. Nuestro personaje no se mueve y apenas hay animaciones m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las ambientales, sin embargo, se siente completamente vivo. Esto se debe en parte a una estupenda puesta en escena a base de pixel gordote y colores vivos a los que los acompa\u00f1a una estupenda banda sonora de Ben Prunty (FTL), pero sobre todo a un especial cuidado de personajes y di\u00e1logos.\n\nEn esto de los point & clicks y las Aventuras Graficas hay escuelas y est\u00e1n quienes anteponen los puzles a los personajes y viceversa. Yo me declaro de los segundos, y quiero pensar que si muchos recuerdan con cari\u00f1o al primer Monkey Island (pato + polea) es que hay m\u00e1s por ah\u00ed como yo. Aqu\u00ed tenemos el primer problema para el hispanohablante: The Darkside Detective no est\u00e1 traducido a nuestro idioma.\n\nEs cierto que no requiere un nivel de ingl\u00e9s muy alto y que debido a la sencillez de la mayor\u00eda de sus puzles creo que podr\u00eda terminarse sin necesidad de entender ni una sola palabra, pero el punto fuerte del juego son la mezcla de situaciones, di\u00e1logos y personajes, por lo que si se elimina el idioma de la ecuaci\u00f3n tenemos un grave problema. Si esto no supone un problema para ustedes prep\u00e1rense para conocer a Doodley, oficialmente el mejor personaje de un juego de este estilo en a\u00f1os.\n\nDoodley es nuestro Watson, aunque se trata de un Watson perezoso y descre\u00eddo para el que cualquier elemento sobrenatural \u00fanicamente significa que llegar\u00e1 un par de horas tarde a casa. Su presencia es ese \u201cvale, pero no te flipes\u201d en la cabeza de los desarrolladores que se encarga de relativizar cualquier situaci\u00f3n, destacando cualquier elemento incongruente que se encuentre en ella, aunque este vaya dirigido hacia el propio juego. El equipo de Spooky Doorway no tiene problemas en destacar incoherencias, referencias o incluso el sobreuso de escenarios reciclados dentro de la propia trama de cada uno de los cap\u00edtulos, y ah\u00ed estar\u00e1 Doodley para poner los pies en el suelo. \u00c9l est\u00e1 ah\u00ed para sacarse sueldo y a otra cosa. Un perfecto funcionario al que le da igual que se trate de fantasmas o un familiar del Monstruo del Lago Ness. Hace su trabajo y se va. Algo que es casi una provocaci\u00f3n en estos tiempos de persona=empresa.\n\nEl t\u00edtulo se encuentra dividido en seis cap\u00edtulos independientes. Los dos primeros son accesibles desde el principio mientras que el resto se ir\u00e1n desbloqueando seg\u00fan vayamos resolvi\u00e9ndolos. No es necesario que juguemos a los dos primeros en orden, pero s\u00ed conveniente, pues hay personajes que intervienen en varios cap\u00edtulos y se har\u00e1 referencia a ellos. La duraci\u00f3n de cada uno de estos episodios var\u00eda, pero podr\u00edamos poner una media de treinta minutos descontando el \u00faltimo, que es algo m\u00e1s largo y contiene m\u00e1s localizaciones que el resto. Al principio se podr\u00eda pensar que cada uno de los episodios corresponde a un homenaje velado a un cl\u00e1sico de la cultura pop como podr\u00edan ser Los Gremlins o Viernes 13, pero una vez m\u00e1s hay que reconocer al estudio irland\u00e9s su buena medida en este asunto. Hay gui\u00f1os, pero se entremezclan entre s\u00ed hasta formar una nueva historia que los descontextualiza del referente original, lo que ante la saturaci\u00f3n de ochenterismo que llevamos en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os es de agradecer.\n\nLo que tenemos una vez terminado The Darkside Detective es uno de esos t\u00edtulos que se disfrutan como si fuera un atrac\u00f3n de cap\u00edtulos de una serie emitida a trav\u00e9s de alguna plataforma digital. Habr\u00e1 quien eche de menos una mayor dificultad en los puzles o alg\u00fan cap\u00edtulo m\u00e1s, pero no es mi caso. Tanto enfoque como duraci\u00f3n me parecen perfectos, y el hecho de que apenas se hayan alejado del concepto original (el t\u00edtulo parti\u00f3 de una jam) me parece mucho m\u00e1s meritorio que si se hubieran liado a incluir elementos superficiales. The Darkside Detective funciona gracias a su simplicidad y unos di\u00e1logos que para s\u00ed querr\u00edan la mayor\u00eda de point & click.

Good use of refrences that are accessable to most players but don't feel pandering\n\n-Fun, casual point and click gameplay. You rarely have more than 3 or 4 objects at any given point and most rooms serve a only one or two purposes.\n\n-Uses an X-Files/Twin Peaks type setting which is rarely seen in video games.\n\n-Both main characters are really likable. Your partner (Officer Dooley) rarely actually helps you, but always has a joke or non sequitur to say\n\n-Looks and sounds really good, regardless of if you're into pixel art or not.  \n\n-Most objects are easily defined, and the game rewards you for clicking everything in the room with a joke anway. I only ran into one object that I really coulden't find during my playthrough\n\nCons:\n\n-Short. Without guides I beat the game in a bit under three hours, clicking and reading just about everything I could find. I hope the creator releases some DLC or similar in the future, I would really like to see some other paranormal tropes explored. This is the main flaw in the game imo.\n\n- 3/6 of the cases are about ghosts or spirits, and one has no supernatrual 'entity' at all. This isn't a universal problem, but personally I wish more supernatrual mumbo jumbo was used\n\n- You never really 'investigate' a scene. There's often a mystery, but you never piece together clues or figure it out as a player. This makes the game a little more casual which is fine, but it's someting to keep in mind if you're looking for a game that requires more deductive thinking. \n\n- There are some cutscenes in one of the trailer that aren't actually in the game. Again, this isn't an awful betrayal or anything, but it's something to keep in mind. \n\n\nOverall this is a really well made game in my opinion, I just wish there was more of it. It's listed at $13 at the moment, and I can see wanting to wait until a sale drops it to 50% off or so.

The dialogue is sharp, to the point and extremely witty throughout. Almost the entire game is written with humour. Sometimes silly, sometimes downright farcical and often clever. Peppered with smart linguistics and pop culture references, it was a real delight to read. It had me smirking in the very first interaction and that keeps up throughout and it reminded me in many ways of the Discworld game, which is a real treat since I\u2019ve been a hardcore Terry Pratchett fan for two decades.\n\nThis is a point and click adventure game, so we must work our way through a series of interactions and logical puzzles to figure out how to progress and solve all six of the Detective\u2019s outstanding cases. There were some moments of guesswork for me \u2013 but ultimately everything was entirely logical and made perfect sense, even if I didn\u2019t always quite get it until I\u2019d tried quite a lot of things. Through talking to folks, investigating items, combining things and a couple of simple puzzles, we progress through each spooky story. The gameplay is very minimalist and relatively fast; you don\u2019t control or move your character, only scene changes and there is very little animation. This does mean you move through it at a pace and the bite-size episodic cases make it easy to play in short bursts but still feel very satisfied with what you\u2019ve achieved.\n\nThe graphics are very much stylized block pixel 2D graphics, which won\u2019t be for everyone. My husband, for example, hates this graphical style and would never consider playing it \u2013 aesthetics is definitely a strong personal preference. I like the graphics and felt they fit well with the overall atmosphere of the game, which is also heavily reinforced by the appropriately spooky soundtrack. The music is serious and really creates the setting for the scene changes \u2013 this works incredibly well with the humorous dialogue and gives the game a more cohesive feeling. You are at the end of the day, solving crime here!\n\nThe game is short; taking me just 4 hours to complete all six cases (and if you\u2019ve played the demo, that will be five). I didn\u2019t find all the hidden achievements there so there is perhaps an extra challenge for hardcore completionists, but on the whole there is very little replay value so some may question the value. On the settings side this game is bare bones; there no resolution options, no window size options and the game is played in full screen mode which might frustrate those who are used to running multiple monitors and alt-tabbing. The only settings are for sound.\n\nI enjoyed every minute of this game though and would highly recommend it to fans of the genre, or newcomers who like amusing dialogue. A thoroughly engaging and entertaining game from start to finish. Need more!\n\n[h1]If you\u2019re not sure if this is for you, check out the demo which is the first case. Like right now.

I beat all six cases in three hours, so take from it what you will.\n\nThe Darkside Detective is a game about a detective investigating supernatural phenomena - here, it's called the Darkside. It's got its share of conspiracy theories, kooky monsters, ghosts floating everywhere, and the occasional hellish ritual. The game is divvied up into 6 different cases, and each plays like a bite-sized point-and-click adventure. Most of the puzzles are logical, with some hilarious outcomes (a certain junction box comes to mind), but you do have to look closely to progress through the game at times.\n\nThere isn't really an overarching storyline, save for a few common themes and characters, but it's a good romp. The characters are hilarious - you have the rivalry between McQueen and McKing (hah!), Dooley's bizarre interests and his adorable (if not slightly creepy) Bloodwolf camp. You even have a fusty old librarian who has a soft spot for awful chick lit.\n\nThe music is also fantastic, done by Ben Prunty of FTL fame. Pity it's not purchasable via Steam (only by Bandcamp), because I'd happily fork out more money to pick up the soundtrack! The graphics are nothing to write home about, but the pixellated style adds its own charm.\n\nThe only real downside is how short the entire game is. I finished all six mysteries in one sitting, and that was with me reading and investigating all the nooks and crannies I could get my hands on. Granted, I may have missed some parts, but I investigated most of the areas. I got this discounted, having purchased it at USD$10, so whether you think it's worth it is entirely down to how much you enjoy point-and-clicks.

Francis Mcqueen is an overworked and underpaid Detetive who's tasked with finding and stopping supernatural events, with Dooley, a well meaning consipiracy-theorist. Together the pair go through six cases that range from things mysteriously breaking in the office to a full scale zombie attack. The episodes are not really connected together and there's not really one overarching threat as I'd hoped, but It does fit in with the theme of the game overall (See: Monster of the week). My general rule of thumb is 1hr of fun playtime =$1, but with games like this, that doesn't exactly work. It's more about the quality of the the game when it is as short as this on is but It definitely checks out in the quality department. \n\nDialogue- It's solid, nothing really exceptional. Nothing that really made me laugh until I was crying but in a strange way that doesn't bother me at all.\n\nArt- One of the two best things about this game. I like pixel art when done well and this was definitely done well.\n\nMusic- The other great thing about this game, each track compliments the art. It really represents the tone of the game. My two favorite soundtracks are the one that plays after the resolution of each case and when you're using BETI. I'm almost tempted to buy the soundtrack.\n\nDifficulty- Not much of a challenge at all, so if you're looking for a difficult point and click game look elsewhere.\n\nPrice- I bought it during the sale when it was a bit under $10 but $12 doesn't seem so bad. If you're looking for something that will give you a lot of time you might want to wait for a sale, but if you're a fan of light-hearted point and click games, I'd give it ago. With Steam's refund policy you could play it for an hour and see if it's your kind of game.\n\nOverall- I'd like to see more content for this game, hopefully in the form of DLC (hopefully free but I understand the devs need to eat) to really flesh out the game. I'd definitely love to see more of Francis Mcqueen's adventures.

YES! the puzzles served its purpose not as a challenge, but as a context and delivery device for the hilarious joke. i think the game is really funny and that's where the greatness lies. every single lines are funny and well written, they don't take itself too seriously without being too intrusive and forced. \n\ndespite the absurdness, everything fell in place, no jokes ever feel forced, and they feel kinda relatively natural for such a wacky adventure. \n\nthe music is GOOD. Ben Prunty did a great job composing moody-spooky tunes-yet-not-too-gloomy that fits the overall theme of the game. the game itself probably worth it if you like moody ambient music. \n\noverall, my impression of this game is \"go ahead if you want a quality laughs and fun, but don't if you expect challenging puzzles and complex interactions\"", "timestamp_created": 1501419437, "timestamp_updated": 1501419667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33903551": {"recommendationid": "33903551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104477299", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501093515}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bardzo przyjemna, ale te\u017c niestety bardzo kr\u00f3tka gra point and click.

Your sidekick Dooley's love of rotten food and discarded adult magazines certainly made him one of my favorite characters as well throughout the game. Not to mention some Discworld references among many other nods to adventure games thrown in for good measure. \n\nWriting and humor can always be subjective. Yes some of the jokes can fall a bit flat. On the other hand there are quite a few good ones tucked about the game delivered in a pretty sly tongue-in-cheek manner. \n\nThe music is great and the game looks wonderful for the style they're going for. Anyone who has already played something like the Last Door will have a bit of an idea what to expect out of the interaction system. \n\nIt could have been a little nicer, had you actually been able to free roam and control your characters. Rather than only being able to interact with objects while your characters usually remain static. Perhaps some people might not mind this. Since it does save alot of time from having to walk back an forth through screens, by being able to instantly move into the next area with a single click. \n\nMuch more of a comedic adventure game than a dark sinster classic detective style game like you may imagine. It's less Gabriel Knight or Police Force and much closer to more light hearted games like Discworld or maybe even the Tex Murphy series in some ways. Of course it has alot of it's own original feel to it as well. \n\n For a first time play through might be looking at around 3-5 hours of play time depending on how much of an achievement hunter you are. In fact once you know all the solutions you can probably speed through the game in less than 30 minutes. Not a whole lot of reply value right off the bat, unless you missed some achievements. Given some time however I'm pretty sure it's a game you'd want to come back to just to relive again. \n\nI'd recommend picking this up if you're looking for a fairly short but rewarding adventure game experience.

At first I thought it was going to be a lovecraftian themed point and click, but instead got a sort of parody on the occult detective genre. However, it turned out not to be disappointing and fun in its own way. McQueen and Dooley are interesting, though a bit cliche in character. Their banter is written fair enough though that it was entertaining. Sadly it was quickly over since it only took me less than two hours to complete the entire thing including the demo level. Despite this, I feel like they built up the atmosphere very well for Twin Lakes. Recurring characters help make the city feel lived in and makes me want to see more adventures. Some might be turned off by the very short play time, but for me I look at it as an interactive movie. The last case file is especially dramatic and it was a good climax. The puzzles really weren't too difficult to hamper progress, but just enough that you could still call it a game.

So, this game is like a RPG character, while the beginning is bad to mediocre, the ending is almost as good as classical Lucas Arts games and some Phoenix Wright titles (the not so great ones), all of this is because the evolution of the developer team during the development process. \nThe investigation works well all the time, some solutions are tough and demand investment from the player, the mystery related to the Darkside is very good because it's something the player has to discover. The screenplay lacks substance, though, it could have more details and development. If compared to great classicals like Ghost Trick and Day of the Tentacle, it pales. \nMost jokes don't work, they are inserted in wrong situations and are mostly old jokes. The only ones that made me laugh are in the credits, and this is not a good thing. \nThe game has lots of references, maybe more than BvS. Some work well when they help the story in the minimum, however, some get too important, more than they should be, original concepts would work better.\nThe game also has its cliches: The grandfather's clock to create atmosphere, because every spooky atmosphere needs a grandfather's clock to be spooky. There's also the subliminal message of the 666, it made me remember of Final Fantasy VIII and that it wasn't really new by that time either. \nIn the end, the game gets much better, all bad things are left aside to focus on the investigation, there's even a specific moment where there's a split in the gameplay. The urgency feeling gets bigger as the game knows how to reach its climax and the writting gets a little better.

During the demo as with the game I actually laughed.. Out loud. All those lol's I've sent have been rubbish, this was packed full of actual belly wrenching laughter. The story is bulletproof, the characters develop nicely but you already feel like you know them or someone similar. The cases have been nothing short of good old fashion fun- another rare achievement, enjoyable puzzles! \nWe know the writing is mint, reviews are praising it as they should. But don't forget Paul Conway who delivered astonishing, captivating, mood filled pixel art, that I think is up there with the best in world right now such as Octavi, Ben and so many more.

Nuestro h\u00e9roe es asistido por el oficial Dooley, un polic\u00eda completamente delirante y amigo de McQueen desde la ni\u00f1ez, que no tiene mucha idea sobre lo que investigamos pero intenta ser \u00fatil de alguna manera.

That pays homage to old horror writers and paranormal TV shows like H.P Lovecraft and the X-Files respectively. There are six cases that each wrap pop culture references and comedic bits, light-heartedly taking the piss out of other point and click adventures and paranormal culture. With an additional seventh christmas case. Each case is separate to one another meaning that you can jump in and out of the game easily without losing the plot or forgetting where you were; like in most open ended games, such as Skyrim. Making it perfect for those who don\u2019t have a vast amount of time on their hands.\n \nThe cases themselves aren\u2019t naturally long. However can be drawn out depending on how fast you solve the puzzles in each case that are ingenuitive and always clear. What you would assume is the answer to solve the problem in reality is often the answer in the game. Each case excluding the seventh; which re-uses elements from past cases (breaking the fourth wall to make a joke to justify it), is completely different and gripping in different ways.\n\nYou play as Paranormal Detective Francis McQueen, a detective at TLPD. Much like Moulder in the X-Files his department is seen as a joke by other in the police department and relegated to a more dilapidated part of the station. With a dim witted sidekick called officer Dooley, who\u2019s there to act as comedic relief and in some cases a major character to the plot. There are also various side characters that pepper the games landscape; such as the rival detective McKing and Chief Scully (another nod to the X-Files). \nOverall the game is fun and accessible to all types of people. It\u2019s got good writing and well designed puzzles. However it doesn\u2019t have a great deal of repeatability, due to the cases being rather short, so unless you have a bad memory when repeating a case you\u2019ll most likely remember what to do. The game cost about ten pounds, which is a little steep for the game considering it\u2019s only about 5 hours long.

It follows a detective named Francis McQueen and his partner Dooley. They are sent on a series of 6 cases, each dealing with the paranormal. Each case has a unique story to tell and they take you to many different places around Twin Lakes.\n\nMy favorite case out of all of them is easily the second one. This one takes place inside a haunted library. All of the ghosts are of famous authors including H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, Douglas Adams, Mary Shelley and Terry Pratchett to name a couple. Most of them have an objective tied to them as well. H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe are fighting over who writes the best horror and you must find them a book that\u2019s scarier than both of theirs.\n\nThe game\u2019s best feature is it\u2019s excellent sense of humor. It relies on sarcasm, puns and references and it\u2019s nonstop throughout the game. It had me cracking up numerous times as I played through it. Even the credits are hilarious.\n\nFrancis\u2019 partner, Dooley, is easily one of my favorite characters in the game. His jokes are pretty amazing and his dialogue is incredibly witty and well-written.\n\nThe game lives up to it\u2019s mini-adventure title though and can be completed in 6 hours. It\u2019s well worth experiencing, just for the jokes, though.\n\nOverall, The Darkside Detective has been the funniest game that I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing in a while. The jokes were excellent and my motto is, if a game can make me laugh consistently, then it\u2019s a winner in my book. The Darkside Detective does just that, and it was a great journey. I hope a sequel is able to be made in the end though because it definitely deserves one.\n\nIf you're interested in checking out the full review, or would simply like to see my final score, you can find my review here: http://www.endworldgaming.com/adventure/darkside-detective-review\n\nThanks for taking the time to read the review folks, and happy gaming!", "timestamp_created": 1515097746, "timestamp_updated": 1515097746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38999012": {"recommendationid": "38999012", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981257993", "num_games_owned": 596, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1515353723}, "language": "english", "review": "You should play this, then maybe they'll make more cases!", "timestamp_created": 1514954036, "timestamp_updated": 1514954036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39537555": {"recommendationid": "39537555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271339221", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 457, "last_played": 1516636513}, "language": "english", "review": "This is such a great game, it deserves more recognition.

Heck, look at my avatar! They were well written, and a perfect way to spend my near-infinite free time exploring.\n\nToday, I'm an adult, and free time is at a sever premium. I have no patience for classic adventure games and their ilk, what with all the aimless wandering, opaque puzzles, and minimal payoff.\n\nThis is an exception. It's very much in the school of old adventure games: you combine inventory items and explore to solve puzzles. You also do some actual, literal logic puzzles, which I wasn't hugely into, but that's what walkthroughs are for. But the structure of the game, where you have discrete cases that take place in limited environs, makes all the difference.

Before you know it you'll be rewarded for closing a case by being whisked away to a new area with a whole new gang of misfits and weirdos to interrogate.  The puzzles in each case are simple enough to ensure it's unlikely that you will ever become completely stuck and frustatrated. I wouldn't say it's too easy though, I'd say the difficulty is just about right because really the puzzles aren't the main attraction here, knowing the game isn't going to be super-challenging you can relax and take in the plot and enjoy the real highlight, the witty dialogue on offer, of which there is plenty. The best of this dialogue is served up by the detective himself and his rather intellectually challenged companion Officer Dooley.

You gotta look around and interact with everything you see, as much as possible...\n\nWhich is also how the game hits you with its best jokes-  Entirely missable interactions that just make you laugh for being the unexpected. It's a clever game that gives you a sidekick who follows you around most screens, and makes his dialogue, none of which is particularly helpful with the puzzle solving, funny enough that I'm actively trying to remember to talk to him constantly, or fills a library with saterical book names and gets me to actually try to read all of them.\n\nI'm having a blast with it, and I don't even normally play point-and-clicks.

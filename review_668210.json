He's got even more fancy pants to show.\n\nThe game is really charming, it just feels like old newgrounds days all over again with some fresh new styles. It's still of course, an awesome painted world. As for the gameplay, it feels really nice and responsive, but it would be nice for some button configuration settings for some players. Fancy pants does keep his melee weapon from the old fancy pants adventure. Of course, with some new attacks, some of which are pretty neat, others may be a bit \"meh\" though. (I'm looking at you spinning attack >:C I WANT MY OLD SPINNING ATTACK BACK.)\n\nThere's a bunch of collectables too, in nearly every room there's a hidden door with a challenge room in it. Beat that and you got yourself some sick new pants, or even a completely new hat! \n\nThe story is nothing over-the-top, with very little dialouge makes it very interesting for you to figure out what happens. Sometimes scenes just randomly HAPPEN while just going through the next screen. ...That's kind of it though for the story, the final boss is pretty trippy though. \n\nThe game is uh... very short though, you could probably beat it in a few hours or so. You could always go back to levels and get the challenges, but if you are like me and just get every challenge in order.. there's not much else.\n\nLuckily, the game knew about this. They added an entire new update with the entire remix world 1! Now you can collect MORE things! There's also races and even a whole arena gamemode, I do wonder how multiplayer can work. I can imagine it being fun.\n\nMy only real biggest concern of this game is the price, 10 dollars may be cheap for some people.. but a somewhat short game like this with not much content at the moment.. It's best if you wait for a sale perhaps or something else. Though, I bet they will add more updates though. Currently, it does feel pretty short. \n\nOverall, it's a charming and fancy game that brings back old and new memories and the gameplay is downright fun, but the price still concerns me of it's current content. \n\nI'd give it a 7.5/10 for now..

I've played the Flash FPA trilogy, and saw a promotion on the site, which led us to get this game. I really liked it at first, because it has more sound effects, such as for walking and landing, that weren't in the Flash version. And generally, it's just a fresher game with new worlds, enemies, and ideas. But then I wanted to start the game from the beginning, and there doesn't seem to be an option to do so. Even more baffling is that in the first 2 FPA flash games, you can reset your data. That is baffling, especially considering the fact those are Flash games, not Steam applications. I would expect more, not less. A multi-profile interface, for example. Also, an update was released around Christmas in 2017. And when I installed it, I noticed the game was slowed down to like half of its normal speed. That is annoying and baffling. Why did that happen? Now, I know this is just my experience. So if you have the same problem reading this, that would make this more of a problem. I'm using a Mac mini made in Late 2014 running the latest MacOS, High Sierra. I've also made 2 videos on this game and the things I did to it by getting into its contents, and am planning to make a 3rd one this week, so check them out here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-kec4XzZkc&list=PLFbCE8Kkz-hm3ws_ammCIzWeWyVef6stY&index=8\n\nAlso, I was just about to post and was asked if I recommend this game.

The game is extremely short, and can be finished in under two hours, so, yes, you can refund this game as soon as you finish it unless you're incredibly slow. The only reason I didn't is because the developer, Brad Borne, is a nice dude, and I respect his work greatly.\n\nMobility features that greatly benefitted World 3, such as wallstepping and walljump direction jumping, are gone for seemingly no reason. I theorize that this is some sort of misguided effort to simplify the move pool, but you could've just had a short tutorial to explain it.\n\nFamiliar and fun enemies such as arachnids, mice, and ninjas show up for one or two levels before disappearing from the game forever, replaced by new antagonists, Inklings, giant gobs of goo, and here's where the game begins to shatter on the floor.\n\nInkies cannot be stomped on or slid into. Instead, you have to use the Fountain Pen, the new Pencil. While it greatly improves on the flaws of the Pencil, having to pull it out every single time an enemy is on screen instead of jumping on them and continuing on my merry way bogs down the game. Inkies are also the only enemy onwards from Level 3. There is no variety whatsoever, save for, like, one or two other types.\n\nLevel design has seen a significant downgrade. Once multi-routed levels with lots of depth are now standard, go-right until-it's-over levels. And by the way, there are five levels. That's not a complaint or anything, that's just a statement, seeing how Kongregate's description-writing is absoulutely horrid.\n\nBosses are an absoulute joke, too. Boss One is over in less than a minute, Boss Two is a little longer but still a joke, and the final boss is alright, but just easy, especially if you've gotten upgrades.\n\nAlthough there a lot of things I like about Super Fancy Pants Adventure, I like World 3 better.

All the abilities from 3 (the Flash game) are back, and new ones appear, such as an ink-shooting gun and a forward dash. Moves can be strung together into crevasse-crossing combos, launching you across maps in joyous ways. The game looks great, and runs amazingly for the entities on-screen, which is a necessity in a precise game such as this.\n\nThat being said, there is one glaring issue. There are quite a few areas, especially in the Volcano Entrace, where it's difficult to find your way or figure out what to do. Players, without the intuitive sense of direction that the level design should give, will throw themselves at obstacles, hoping to survive. There are also a lot of areas in which the objective is impossible to understand without first failing. This becomes annoying in sections with lots of enemies, where health is at a premium and death restarts you far, far away.\n\nOverall, this is a great addition to the series and one I intend to replay many times.\n\nP.S. I bet Brad Borne could make a hell of a Sonic game if he tried.\n\nEdit: [spoiler]When you beat the ink Fancy Pants Man, the game ends on a \"To Be Continued\" bombshell and kicks you back to the beginning.

To those of us who grew up playing games on Kongregate and Newgrounds, the Fancy Pants games need no introduction. This series is a staple in early flash games, so the addition of a new title is a very welcome rush of nostalgia. However, despite my love for the series, I must admit that I am a little disappointed with the length of Super Fancy Pants Adventure. While the core mechanics are better than ever, there is far too little content. \n\n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]If you spam the down button, Fancy Pants starts rocking out.\n[*]The platforming is as satisfying as ever. The Fancy Pants games do a great job with building up and maintaining momentum. I agree that it can be difficult to manage at times, especially when jumping on uneven surfaces, however, when you get it right, the game flows so beautifully. It\u2019s almost as if you can feel the wind flow through your hair as Fancy Pants rushes through a stage.\n[*]Movement feels great. For those who have never played a Fancy Pants game before, the movement is probably Fancy Pants\u2019 strongest suit. The running, sliding, wall jumping, etc all feel very responsive and fluid. I especially enjoyed the addition of the pen gliding. \n[*]Combat feels extra smooth compared to the earlier Fancy Pants titles, especially once you unlock some of the special moves. It is quite a shame that you can\u2019t slide into inklings though, since sliding is one of my favourite mechanics. It would also be nice if the ink storage bar could be upgraded \u2013 I often felt like my ink depleted very quickly. Though it was a nice touch that attacking inklings refills your ink. \n[*]Nice to see some of the old Fancy Pants NPCs - it really adds to the nostalgia. For example, I enjoyed seeing the pirates again and their dance moves are on point. Though I found it strange that you don\u2019t get to see/interact with them again after you save them from the ink. \n[*]Challenges were my favourite part of the game. I found that the regular platforming wasn\u2019t very difficult, so I appreciated the difficulty spike brought by the challenges. I also liked the minimalistic look of the challenge rooms, as it magnifies the players\u2019 focus on the platforming. Of course, it\u2019s great that you are rewarded with different pants or hats - wouldn\u2019t be a Fancy Pants game without fancy pants.\n [/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I think the checkpoints could do with a little more work. There are instances where falling off the map would take me really far back and in other situations I would spawn a little forward, on a platform I had not yet touched.\n[*]Unclear which platforms will move or not. I often ended up jumping off a moving platform prematurely because I didn\u2019t expect it to move. Maybe changing the colour of the platform slightly would help resolve this issue?\n[*]I enjoyed the final boss \u2013 both the fight itself and the terrain. However, I did not like that the background was so dark, as it made it difficult to see the boss when he jumped. I feel like this is an issue that could have easily been avoided.\n[*]Incredibly short, especially for the price tag. I mean, I managed to finish the game in approximately 2.5 hours (mind you, I was taking my time looking for all the challenges), only to be met with an unsatisfying \u201cto be continued\u201d. I hope this means Borne Games plans on adding more content to this game, rather than making a whole new game.\n[*]Very difficult to die. I find that the base health bar and the damage that enemies do to you is far too generous. I practically only died to the final boss, who does around a 1/5 of your health per hit. \n[*]Surprisingly little enemy variation compared to other Fancy Pants games, especially towards the end of the game. Mostly you just encounter ink blobs of various sizes. \n[*]It seems like the shooting and dashing mechanisms are just introduced and then forgotten. There are very few instances where you absolutely NEED to use the ink gun or the dash. I would have liked to see more of that incorporated in the platforming of the later stages.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 For nostalgia\u2019s sake[/h1]\n\nLike many fans of the Fancy Pants games, the Super Fancy Pants Adventure release made me giddy with excitement. As to be expected, the movement, platforming, and combat are all great. However, Super Fancy Pants Adventure feels incomplete. The \u201cto be continued\u201d ending left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I really hope that more content will be added soon, because as it currently stands I don\u2019t believe this game deserves the \u201cSuper \u2026 Adventure\u201d title. I enjoyed playing SFPA, but considering that you will only get 2-3 hours of gameplay out of it, I don\u2019t think it is worth 10\u20ac. Even if you\u2019re a Fancy Pants fan, I would only recommend buying this game when it\u2019s on sale. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

So when I saw that Brad Borne was releasing a fourth installment, naturally, I was excited. This game is AMAZING! The story is simple as it should be, the characters have charming dialogue and for the first time you get to see other stick people, nothing ground-breaking I know, but I always wondered in previous games why Fancy Pants Man was the only stick man around. \n\nThe gameplay is really fun, you can run at the top of your speed while slashing and shooting through enemies! And the combat system works a whole lot better in this game because you have more controll over where your character moves while fighting enemies. And the fact that they added a pen which allows you to shoot ink bullets introduced a whole new feel to how Fancy Pants plays, and to obtain more bullets you simply just kill more inklings.\n\nThe visuals, one of my favourite thing about the whole Fancy Pants series are the visuals, backgrounds can be sometimes abstract and sometimes there's a whole story going on that you can follow as you play throught the stage. But this game takes a step forward, now you can actually jump in the backgrounds and play the stage! The volcano level does this very well because it's all about telleportation and moving from one background to another. \n\nMy only complaint about this game: When beating the final boss a text appears on the screen saying TO BE CONTINUED!

The aesthetic is also really quite nice I like the hand drawn style that it has but this might not be for everyone. The basic game levels are really easy especially if you're somewhat experienced with platformers, but the bonus challenge stages that get you new pants and hats can actually be quite hard and require you to have a good grasp of the game's mechanics in order to complete them. My biggest gripe with this game is that it's short, really short, you wind up having a great time with it and then suddenly it's over and I felt a little cheated, I think that for the amount of playtime you're going to get out of it the price is a little steep.

I always liked the Fancy Pants Adventures series ever since I found out about it on the internet, so when the time came for Brad Borne (the developer) to make World 4, he worked on a new version of the Flash SDK (Action Script 2 to Action Script 3) and released the \"tech demo\", World 1 Remix! After that, Brad started the 3 year long developement of World 4 (the game you are currently looking at on this page!) and I was waiting for so long that time, it felt like a Half Life 3/TF2 Pyro Update/Portal 3(?)/Super Smash Bros for the Switch sort of situation. But then one fateful day, this game's announcement date to be precise, it was revealed that World 4 would be Super Fancy Pants Adventures and it would release on Steam. That was kind of a shock to me because I never expected the Fancy Pants Adventures series to end up on Steam of all places!\n\nWell, enough about that part. Super Fancy Pants Adventures feels like your typical Fancy Pants game, thanks to its brilliant soundtrack and excellent controls. The story is as basic as any of the other game's stories get. But overall, I really enjoyed it. [spoiler] And according to the ending, there's going to be more content in the future! [/spoiler] I really enjoyed every second of this game. I'd recommend it to Sonic fans (as that fact is how I got into this series in the first place), Mario fans too and anyone who's just looking for a quick game to play (yes, the game's quite short at the time of me writing this).

Controlling \"Fancy pants man\" has never felt so great, and while I do love how fluid and great the game feels, I just cannot recommend this game in its current state.\n\n(Warning: I\u2019m going to be referring to the console game: \"Fancy Pants Adventures\" a lot in this review)\n\nPros\n\n+Controls; very smooth and easy to control\n\n+Combat; although it simple, it\u2019s very satisfying\n\n+Parkour; running, jumping, and sliding all flow together perfectly (Con: why would you take out the direction/height you could wall jump off???)\n\n+Animation and Movement; looks and feels amazing!\n\n+Upgrading you character; adds an extra sense of progression to the game\n\n\nCons\n\n-56 levels; some levels actually last 2 seconds while other's usually last 5-10 minutes, honestly they feel more like screens, and it feels very deceptive that the dev(s) called some two second screens \"levels\". The console version and even the flash versions are perfect examples of what a level should be.\n\n-Enemies; at the first 20 minutes of the game you get so see a large variety of different enemies, but later on all you fight are ink blobs which are not at all difficult to defeat and are frankly boring to fight after a while. You also can\u2019t slide into the ink enemies (making the sliding mechanic feel useless). In the console game, you can battle pirates, ninjas, frogs, crabs, spiders, rats, and more! But here, you\u2019re fighting the same ink enemies throughout the game? (Side note: there are only 4 different types of ink enemies here).\n\n-Level design; compared to \"Fancy Pants Adventures\", the level design in this game feels very lazy. While in the last game you\u2019re going through a swamp, downtown, a beach, or a cave (and many other places). In this game you\u2019re just running along one color (either purple, orange, red, or green) for a large duration of it. The only place that actually looked different (in a good way) was the tree pirate village.\n\n-Difficulty; The game is way too easy, collecting points refill your health bar way too much and enemies do too little damage when they hit you. It is literally impossible to die in this game, I only died once and that was because I had to purposely jump off a cliff almost 10 times or more just so I can see the death animation. The bad part is that you can also upgrade your health, making the game feel like a chore to beat since there is no danger that can harm you.\n\n-Customization; only 20 pants and hats to collect which is almost nothing compared to the Console version of almost hundreds of items to change on your character including your weapon, pants, and head gear. The amount of customization here is just underwhelming.\n\n-Exploration; One of the things I loved about the console version was how you could take your time and explore the level you\u2019re in to find hidden levels because of how the levels were designed, and while there are hidden levels/challenges here, there isn't much exploring here to do. Unlike the console version, your just running though levels like it was nothing. You\u2019re not really rewarded as much as you were in the last game for exploring, like 100% levels\n\n-The Ending; not going to spoil anything, but the ending left me saying \"that was it???\".\nI really hope the dev(s) are not expecting another $10 for another 2 hours of content...\n\n-Duration of the Game; It defiantly did not last long at all, I spent x10 more time in the console game than in this game. I spent about 5 hours in this game but in reality, this game should take about 2 hours to beat and 3 hours to complete the game fully. There is almost no replayability here unlike the console game, which is the main reason why I really dislike this game.\n\n-Overall content; going to compare it to the console version here again :), the game falls short when it comes to content. The game doesn\u2019t last long to beat, it doesn\u2019t have that many challenges, and it overall just gets boring near the end of the game (which is really bad since it only lasts 2 hours). In \"Super Fancy Pants Adventures\" you had Bonus levels, Golf, Time Trials, Trick Arenas, King of the Hill tournaments, and HD remastered versions of the flash game (World 1 and 2). Yet here all you receive is a short game and small challenge levels with little difficulty.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game DEFINATLY does not deserve the name \"Super\" Fancy Pants Adventure, the only thing this game improved upon was the controls, combat, and animation. Content is very lackluster, little to no difficulty here, no replayability, it was just overall a disappointment from the last game. The developer did state that he will be updating this game and adding new/more challenges and even multiplayer (I was going to put no multiplayer as a con but it will be added later on) and maybe some new game modes, but I doubt it will reach the worth of the regular price it\u2019s asking for. I would not recommend this game for $10 at all.\n\nNow I wouldn't disregard this game altogether, the game is fun, just not $10 worth of fun.\nGet this on sale if you like, maybe for $5, but otherwise it\u2019s a no from me.\n\n(Side note: Paid $5 for a \"Fancy Key\" from the developers site that promised me extra content or something for future fancy pants games like this one on steam: http://www.bornegames.com/fancy-keys/ . Haven't received anything yet.

The new additions to this game are great, and I love the level designs, simple as they may be. The music is pretty good too, although a bit repetitive at times. As well as the great gameplay, the game is also very quick to load up and puts you right back in the area you were last in, so you are ready to go immediately without having to navigate a menu first.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, however, is that I have finished the story, collected every item and earned every achievement in just 3 and a half hours of play time. As much fun as I had playing it, I now feel like there is no replayability to it, other than to grind for more squiggles to buy the rest of the health and power upgrades, which isn't really worth it if there isn't anything else to play through.

However the game is pretty short and feels unfinished because of a few things.. \nit ends with a \"too be continued\", there's many things about the story and world that remain unresolved and unexplained and there's an area called the bathtub tower which seems to have been intended to be a central home area of sorts. it has 5 floors. early in the game you'll unlock a shop on the 1st floor that you can buy upgrades from. there's nothing to do on the other floors yet but certain things lead you to expect there will be, for example on the second floor there's an empty bar area and on the 3rd a bunch of blank arcade machines. the camera zooms into these areas like there's something to interact with but by the end of the game nothing changes. only level 1 of the tower serves a purpose. like i said the game is still fun, in fact I found my self replaying levels and challenge doors multiple times. it's fun just to roam around and play with the mechanics.

This happened to me on the Road to the Ink Volcano area, and it was quite a ways into the Section where you're going through Portals that take you into the backgrounds and into the foregrounds, and it's in this one small part where you're close to the screen, and you're like inches above the bottomless pits and THAT'S Where it Happens (and then you move on to the next level after that)\n\nSo if Those can get patched in the near future, I think we'd be good.\n\nOther than that though, this game is Awesome, Albeit short... (I'd say it's about the length of Sonic Mania, give or take)\nThis is DEFINITELY Worth your money, and I'm hoping to see more of these in the Future!", "timestamp_created": 1506830102, "timestamp_updated": 1506830102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35360787": {"recommendationid": "35360787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146096849", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512802003}, "language": "english", "review": "can u plz add an ability to fly and maybe others also can u make health and power ice cream unlimited", "timestamp_created": 1506824034, "timestamp_updated": 1506824034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35353005": {"recommendationid": "35353005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319760590", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516152057}, "language": "english", "review": "its a fun game, but it seems kind of short for $10.00", "timestamp_created": 1506802913, "timestamp_updated": 1506802913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35341550": {"recommendationid": "35341550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135106916", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506784548}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was extremely fun to play.

SPOILERS  ![/b]\n\n\n\n[list]\n[*][u]Level Design[/u]\nThe levels are very consistant, staying true to the original FPA design, while adding other interesting features for example bounching and, my favourite of them all,  \"dimention switching\", which is a very unique feature that I have personally never seen before. The only negative thing I think I can say is that it was quite short [spoiler]but there is a \"to be continued\" so I get my hopes up[/spoiler]\n\n[*][u]Game Mechanics[/u]\nThis new FPA game has introduced maybe my favourite feature in all the previous ones so far, the Ink Pen. I find the whole concept very smart, because it also adds and feels very nicely to the game. Platforming feels even better than before making parkour through levels an amazing experience. Although I still found glitches especially with the hard to reach platoforms there and then, it's not really an issue, and plus it can be fixed.\n\n[*][u]Graphics/Soundtrack[/u]\nOne of my favourite features yet are the animations and the background drawings. The animations as said by the developer are all drawn by hand, which has a very obvious impact on how the game feels (in a positive way of course). The backgrounds make the levels feel unique and memorable (when going back at them for example you know what the yellow level has into it). The soundtrack is also staying true to the FPA style with the interesting music it has always had. Although sometimes the music can get repeatitive (when for example trying to reach a certain platform) I don't find that a negative thing, as I do enjoy all the songs.\n[/list]\n\n\n\nOverall an amazing addition to the FPA series, and as a person who played it from the beginning I do get nostalgic and I'm glad there is more on the way.\n\n\nThank you for reading", "timestamp_created": 1506710883, "timestamp_updated": 1511599183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35286220": {"recommendationid": "35286220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266604137", "num_games_owned": 1746, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506517441}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you for publishing on Steam!

Buy now.\n\nMy pro list is shorter than my con list by a long shot, but only because I'm hard from loving this game. My pros make up 95% of what I experienced in all of my playtime, so most of my cons are just silly gripes.\n\nPros:\n-Movement and platforming is incredibly fast, smooth and fun.\n-Combat is satisfying and fluid.\n-Soundtrack and graphics blend very well together to create a very nice aesthetic.\n-There's a good sense of challenge, nothing cheap that I noticed.\n-No noticable bugs or preformance issues on Intel HD 630. This game is modern but a breeze to run on lower end hardware.\n\nCons:\n-As soon as the ink pen's shooting is introduced and the enemy variation changes, combat and shooting based puzzles halt the sense of speed and momentum that came with the fast paced platforming beforehand.\n-Checkpoint system is invisible and occasionally it didn't seem like I deserved to go back to the beginning of the room.\n-Environment and music varation is lacking. Every challenge room has the same visual style and the same song, same goes for almost every other area in the game.\n-Some features are absent in some levels: Hooks appear in the first and last levels only, the shell only appeared in the first level, and you find no NPCs in the Basement (Besides your sister), Ascent, or Volcano. I found with only a few in the Plains, and couldn't interact with any in the area with the tents just outside the Bathtub.\n-The ink enemy type selection is extremely small.\n-This installment is missing features from previous ones (swimming, snail golf, green squiggles that were worth 5, etc). You won't notice this if this is your first game in the series.\n-Grinding in a platformer (more on this later).\n-Beating the final boss reset my lives counter from 11 to 3 :(\n-The bosses are the weakest point IMO. They were short and sweet, but I can't help but noticed the missed opportunity with the new gimmicks (red/yellow rails, pen surfing). They were platformer based, but didn't incorporate momentum or physics, just combat.\n-Didn't care for the story at all. The only time I felt anything was talking to an NPC in the Plains who was having a rough time.\n\nCompared to the previous games in the series, this is the game to play if you want the best controls. However, it's very clear that this game will either see a massive update, or an \"Episode 2\" DLC. This game is short. At the time of writing, I'm 3 hours in and I've completed all the hidden challenge levels that unlock cosmetics, but I'm still working my way through all the upgrades. I'm replaying levels to max out the upgrades. I'm grinding in a platformer. It isn't THAT bad since this game is so fun, but I feel it still should not be there. \nAnother huge reason why this will get a huge update or DLC is that the Bathtub floors are void of features. There's a floor with 3 arcade cabinets. This is the 4th game in the series and the first on Steam, so it makes sense that there would be plans to port the first 3 games over in the new engine and have them playable there. But since I haven't technically beat the game 100%, I may not have unlocked everything yet.\n[spoiler]Not to mention the cliffhanger ending. The \"dark version of the protagonist\" trope is one I can ALWAYS get down with.[/spoiler]\n\nYeah, I know, it sounds bad when I focus on the negatives, but again. The bad is only 10% of what I experienced.\n\n9/10. Both as a sequel and a standalone game, it's a blast to play and is worth the price tag. It's not perfect by any means, and I am waiting eagerly for any next installment. But as much as I love the series nostalgically, I can't get lost in this game and its world for its length and minor design issues (AKA me being picky).\n\nP.S.: Anyone know when the health and combat upgrades cap out?", "timestamp_created": 1506576177, "timestamp_updated": 1506576177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35251859": {"recommendationid": "35251859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046075914", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519526072}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es uno de mis favoritos.

The 60 fps mixed with the tight controls. \n\n-Not too similair: This game takes what works from the originals and mixes it up with new combat and game machanics that make it feel fresh and new. \n\n-Beautiful: I love the hand drawn look of this game, the worlds are also very distinct. \n\nCons: \n-Short: I don't personaly think this is a big deal I would rather have less that is polished and fun, but I 100% completed this game in 3 hours so keep that in mind before buying.\n\n-Not enough bosses: This kind of ties into the length, but with the new combat the only boss that you really fight is the last boss and I really enjoyed it. Would have loved to see more bosses that had the same style of fight. \n\n-Too easy: If you want a more forgiving game than this is it, getting 100% in the game is still a challenge.

I played them while I was in school and loved them. That's why it pains me to tell you that, despite the fact that it's a really fun game, Fancy Pants 4, or whatever you want to call it, is not worth it at all. The platforming is smoother than any other game in the series, yes. The new abilities are really fun, I like most of the stages, the challenges are great, and I don't even mind the screen transitions. However, this game does have a lot of flaws, but specifically, it has one flaw so glaring, that I can't see how anyone can recommend this game over its predecessors. This game, if you play through at a normal pace and don't go looking for the challenges, is about an hour and a half long. It took me a little over two hours, and I was looking for challenges, and I'm not the best with platformers. I know that Brad is probably going to release more free content for it in the future, so my recomendation for this is to wait until he does. DO NOT BUY THIS NOW. You'll have an absolute blast for a few short hours at the most, and be bored retreading the same bland level design that you already went through looking for the challenge doors. My suggestion to you is to go play the original three games on a place like miniclip, or armor games, but leave this one alone for now. If you get it anyway and enjoy it forever, I wouldn't be surprised.

It was my first ever flash game and I thought the game was perfect back in the day. Great controls, great music and great level design. Then \"World 2\" came out and it was a huge improvement over the original. Even better controls, more levels, and an actual story (well kinda). After that \"World 3\" came out and it was even bigger and better than \"World 2\". A real storyline, better level aesthetics, a brand new weapon (pencil), new challenge rooms. Overall the original trilogy was perfect and if you want to know what's the best way to experience it, go buy \"Fancy Pants Adventure\", it has Remixed \"World 1\", \"World 2\" and \"World 3\", more levels, over 130+ customizations and more modes. So why am I saying all this? Because after 5 year long hiatus we finally got \"World 4\" and sadly, \"World 4\" or \"Super Fancy Pants Adventure\" is just ok. It's not great, it's not bad, it's just okay... \n\n\nPro's:\n\n\n- The controls are better than ever. they're much smoother and much more refined than in the previous games.\n\n\n- New gimmicks like ink riding, grinding, ink shooting are actually really fun.\n\n\n- New challenges are great. They're fast, they test your reflexes and most importantly - they're not boring.\n\n\nCon's:\n\n\n- The game is really really short. Like I beated it in 1.2 hours, how is it even possible that \"World 4\" is shorter than \"World 3\"? What did Brad say in the description of the game -- \"So many levels! - 56 brand new levels of parkour platforming\". More like 6 levels of platforming and 56 screen transitions. I think that is what he meant.\n\n\n- Do you remember all the old enemies like spiders, mices and bats? Well say goodbye to them because they only appear for one level, after that we're introduced to the new enemies - \"Ink monsters\". You can no longer slide or jump at them since you'll get hurt now. Instead the only way you can kill them is with the new weapon - the pen (which permanently replaces the old pencil). Which means you have to always stop just to destroy them and clear the path which is slow and tedious.\n\n\n- Where are the level themes? Back in previous games you had underground lair, islands, forests, pirate ship. In \"World 4\", you have only 2 level themes, and it's pirate forest and a volcano. Everything else is just a bunch of colorful platforms and blocks, like in some places it looks even more bland than \"World 1\". Brad also added the new layer mechanic in which you'll be jumping from one layer to another using springs and portals which sounds cool and it is. BUT sometimes (and sometimes means 90% of the time) the layers are either poorly rendered, created in a really low resolution, or have intense artifacting which makes them look really ugly.\n\n\n- The soundtrack is ok. In some moments it sounded good while in other cases it sounded like something you would hear in college ads. Also, no returning music except the pirate ship theme, but really who cares?\n\n\n- Where's the content, no really where is it? \"20+ items\"? \"Fancy Pants Adventure\" had 130+ items. Only hats and pants, but where are all the patterns for pants from \"World 1 Remix\"? Where is the weapon customization? Where's the skateboard gimmick? Where's the day/night mechanic? Where's is the remixed \"World 1\", \"World 2\" and \"World 3\"? Where's the multiplayer, \"Fancy Box\", the level editor, the hub-world like every single \"Fancy Pants\" game, the racing mini-game, the \"Smash Bros\" - like mode? Where is it?!\n\n\n\nIn the end, \"Super Fancy Pants Adventure\" is a good platformer, but not a good \"Fancy Pants\" game. I suggest you either wait for a pricedrop, or wait until Brad will add more content to it, and I sure hope he will, because this game has a lot of potential.", "timestamp_created": 1506352448, "timestamp_updated": 1506684215, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574217", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35204406": {"recommendationid": "35204406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011721622", "num_games_owned": 1733, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506274511}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved playing the Fancy Pants games all those years ago. It was such a fun sonic-esque game, with very fluid gameplay and smooth, fully-functioning mechanics. Once Super Fancy Pants Adventure on Steam, I was pretty hyped for a while. I picked it up several days ago, and it was just as I had remembered it being. It was fun, fast, and challenging when it needed to be. Now that I've finished it, I have a bunch of stuff to talk about, so let's get right into it.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Smooth gameplay - Everything is smooth as butter. The combat is responsive and very fun to do. The platforming/parkour is even better, being able to run and jump with little to no quirks, any mistakes that happen are on you and you alone, not the game, nor the physics.\n\n- Level Design - Every single level in here is beautifully crafted to emphasize speed and fluidity. Most levels consist solely on platforms and curved pathways, which synergizes incredibly with the fluid movement system. The scenery itself, however, is only okay at best (in my opinion)\n\n- Boss Fights - Honestly, I was having a hard time finding out if I should keep this as a positive, all because one specific boss seemed so out of place and not very entertaining. However, I had a ton of fun with the other bosses, the final one in particular was my favorite. So, I'll keep this as a good, rather than a meh. At least the boss I don't like can be beat quickly...\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The Length - Unfortunately, this is the biggest reason why I'm not recommending this game. I wasn't expecting something too long, especially considering the flash games could easily be beaten in under an hour. However, for the $10 price point that they're asking for, I'm having a hard time justifying the fact that it only takes 2 hours to beat the game. Maybe 2 and a half if you're getting every single collectible. \n\n- The Price - Yeah, I'm kind've complaining about the price twice now, and I can already hear people saying \"$10 isn't that bad, it could have been $20\", and yeah, they'd be right, but I'm still having a hard time believing that $10 for 2 hours of gameplay is justifiable.\n\n- Mechanic Introduction - So before I go into this, I should probably tack on that I haven't really played any Fancy Pants games past 2, but I have seen some gameplay on the third addition, and I can see some of the mechanics that have been brought over to this game (i.e. the actual combat instead of just jumping on things and kicking them). Top it off with all the new mechanics that were added, everything kind've fits in well. You'll get most of what you're able to do within the first or second lands, but aside from the basic stuff from the tutorials in the beginning of the game, you're not really told what you CAN do. It's only until they're arbitrarily forcing you to do a certain action to progress (and then never use that mechanic again) that they remind you that you had X ability all along.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI wanted to like this game, and in some aspects, I definitely do. It's a really fun game to run and jump around in, and I can kick some ass here and there too. However, the game's too short. There's only such a small amount of time to get used to everything, and by the time you've done that, it's over. You don't get too much of a chance to play around with some mechanics, and there's a few that are only really used once or twice (sometimes more if you count some challenge rooms, but most of them rely on the basic movements). If there were more content, or at LEAST a level editor, I would be able to recommend this game. But where it's sitting now, it's fun, yeah, but it's not worth the money. \n\nTL;DR:\n\nIf you don't mind the dissapointingly short 2 hour playtime, then consider this review a recommendation.

Usually it comes down to just one thing in the game that is a complete deal breaker. Sadly, for me, Super Fancy Pants Adventure falls under that category. \n\nSo, why the red, angry thumbs down? Quite simply, it comes down to game length. Yes, I had a lot of fun with the game; it played well, for the most part, and I can see a lot of love was given to the title. However, there just isn't much content there. I beat two bosses within the first 30 minutes of the game, which made me wonder just how much I had left. Based on what others have said, and a bit of digging on my part, I'm pretty much through the campaign already at the 77 minute mark. Granted, that's not finding all the secrets and unlocking all of the skills. So there's still a couple of hours left, but even four hours isn't that much for this price range. Unless you're really into the Fancy Pants series itself, it's just not worth it at this point. \n\nPerhaps, if the promised additional content comes out then it will be worth picking up, or when it's on sale. But, but it stands right now...

I mean it.\n- The combat system is pretty good, with Fancy Pants man being able to stomp and slide through enemies with his own platforming abilities before finishing them off with a selection of his pencil attacks.\n- The customisation is great, with the player being able to choose a multitude of pants and hats to wear\n- Throughout the game the player recieves upgrades to his pencil, first upgrading it to a fountain pen, then to the ability to use new attacks like dashing, spinning around like a buzz saw, and shooting ink from it like a machine gun among others.\n- The art style is very unique. It may looks bland, but it fits in with the whole theme of the game being set in a cartoon world.\n- The bosses require thinking in order to defeat them, unlike just running around slicing at their faces.\n- There are a ton of challenges in the game that start out relatively simple, but near the end get HARD. Not just from the amount of enemies, but in the changes in direction and speed you need to make, sometimes in mid air, and the reflexes you need. They are also pretty hard to find and get to, meaning you need to explore every part of the world and leave no stone unturned!\n- Great music that never gets boring! I especially liked the music in Squiggleville Plains.\n- The developer spends a lot of time squashing out the bugs in recent updates!\n\nCons:\n- Short. Like really, really short. The game is about 1-2 hours long, and some of the levels are about an entire screen long. Plus, at the end of the final boss fight, (SPOILER ALERT), you're given a \"To be continued...\" with not even anything to answer why you've been fighting those ink blob thingos the whole time. I'm hoping that the developer Brad Borne is going to add the rest of the story in a future update and not post it as another game.\n- The enemy design cuts back to ink blobs about 30 minutes into the game and that's how it stays. There's no explanation on what happened to the spiders and ninjas you've been fighting for the past few levels, and the ink blobs can't be stomped on or slided into, which turns the mid-air parkour fighting style you've been doing into a simple game of spam the attack button.\n- The game doesn't tell you what to do at the start of the game (In case your wondering the controls are arrow keys and A and S to jump and attack respectively.) I only knew that because I played the original games on the developer's website.\n- There isn't a menu. Every time you start the game it launches straight in. It's not really a con but I was a tad bit annoyed that you can't select level from a menu or choose to restart the level like in earlier games. About 3/4 in you get a map to go through earlier worlds, but it's not the same since you can't choose the exact place and find the challenge rooms you missed easily, although the map does tell you in which world you missed them.\n\nOverall though, I enjoyed the game but I think that it feels like an early access game since there's no ending to it, and things like a menu and a tutorial are missing from it. Hopefully these will be changed in future updates but for now, I'd give this game about 8/10.\n\n*UPDATE*\nAs of 23/12/17 this game has an Arena and race mode, plus you can play a new world (based on the World 1 remix flash game) via the arcade machines in-game with up to 4 players!

First off:\n\n1. I am a huge fan of the Fancy Pants Series\n2. I finished the game all the way to completion\n3. I hadn't played the game in a long time\n\nSuper Fancy Pants Adventires is a fun and exciting game to play, and it is something I think anyone from all ages can enjoy. The best way I can some it up is that it's a momentum platformer game, with Hack and Slash elements that build off of what was experienced at the end of Fancy Pants 3. Yes I said Fancy Pants 3, there are a lot of games out there already, and I recommend checking them out. The game isn't that long once you get the mechanics down, it's a very simple combo system, but the game adds new things throughout your playthrough that make it more interesting. There are hidden easter eggs, and challenges that allow you to collect fancy hats and pants. The challenges are designed to teach you about certain tricks when platforming, or attacking, which I think is pretty cool.\n\nI also want to say, from what I've seen of my playthrough, I don't think this is an entire game, as some parts of the map seem incomplete, or some things look like they are designed to be interacted with, but were never made to, mechanics wise, I think it's really worth it, as people can have fun for hours on end, even in a smaller area that the maps provide, as running through again, isn't boring, as once you have all the abillites, you can find new ways to make your way around the map, and sometimes find challenges you couldn't see before.\n\nTL;DR\nIt's a fun platformer, if albeit a bit short, I do think more content is going to be added at a later date though, which has got me excited for what's in store for the rest of the game. If you want to wait for more, then that's fine I totally understand that, but I do want to say that the gameplay is really worth it, even if the game isn't that long.", "timestamp_created": 1506208871, "timestamp_updated": 1506208871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35165514": {"recommendationid": "35165514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079900304", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512236137}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember a long time ago my dad and I were looking at different games online to play.

Then a few years later Fancy Pants 3 came out and we had so much fun (and game rage) playing together. I remember we were stuck on the second to last level for about 2-3 weeks until we finally did it. Now I am happy to see a new Fancy Pants game out with great, new mechanics and wonderful visuals for a 2D game. I definately would  reccomend this to anyone looking for whole hearted fun.

But for now it should cost only third or half the current price max.", "timestamp_created": 1506077799, "timestamp_updated": 1506077799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35123472": {"recommendationid": "35123472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063356780", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516089676}, "language": "english", "review": "Spoilers ahead, if you really care.\n\nIt was 2011, and one of my friends had told me about a browser game called 'Fancy Pants'. He said it was a really great game that he found on Miniclip, and so I soon gave it a try and enjoyed it heaps. I also played the sequel on Miniclip, enjoying that throughly. A year later, I discovered the iOS version which added a whole new world as well as the previous two for a solid $3 or $4. The amount of enjoyment and time I got out of it was well worth it, and I recently redownloaded it on my new phone and have 100%ed each world again, bringing back some nostalgia. I soon found out that a new Fancy Pants game was coming out on Steam, and I was pretty excited. However, I can't say that Super Fancy Pants Adventure really lived up to my expectations.\n\nOverall, I sort of enjoyed Super Fancy Pants Adventure. It was a fun addition to the series and has some of the smoothest and fast-paced gameplay the series has ever had. However, it is bogged down by an overexpensive price tag (even $10 is too much imo) in relation to its lack of content, somewhat repetitive nature and ending which left me feeling deceived, to a degree.\n\nAs stated, the gameplay is super fun, if the levels do feel a bit samey. I dislike the way that the pencil and pen are real jpegs in game as it takes away from the style I feel, but that's just a minor gripe. However, in other places when it comes to game design and graphics, it just is not very good. I was playing in fullscreen and you can somewhat tell this is not the game's native resolution. I remember in particular there was one run which looked like something you could run up, but was instead something you had to continously jump up. Why? There is also not much indication of platforms that you can actually move through and the consistency of walls for jumping off is lacking. Some other aspects of design are just flat out lazy, like when you increase your health bar and instead of continuing the pattern or colour, it would just be white next to the colour you've chosen. How did this make it to the final product?\n\nI could sort of get past all this though, if it weren't for it being grossly overpriced for a game that is, at most, 2 hours worth of largely unsatisfying content. The levels don't have the same charm and persona as previous games, particularly World 3 imo. Not only this, but the ending was legit fighting a dark Fancy Pants then falling into a white abyss and then the words 'To be continued...\" show up on screen. I felt cheated. Also, do NOT believe there are 57 levels. There are 57 sections of levels, but all the indiviudal areas are what I actually consider levels, and there is only 7 or 8 of these. They are all pretty samey but still fun to travel through due to the great gameplay, but still, World 3 had 13 or 14 levels and were infinitely more varied and interesting. I hope more comes as free DLC, because I won't be paying full price for another game if this is the level of content we will get. \n\nI wouldn't say the game is without value necessarily, but its value certainly does not surpass $5. The iOS version of Fancy Pants Adventures had more content, not only including a slew of original levels, but also bundling in Worlds 1 and 2, and the best part was that you didn't even have to spend $5. I almost wish the game were just that tad bit shorter so I could've refunded it. \n\nApparently there's some Fancy Key you can buy on Brad's website that gives you access to a bunch of Fancy Pants content that's yet to come. Why was this not advertised elsewhere? The one that's $5 includes a World 1 remix and future access to all other Fancy Pants games. Why is this one $10 then?\n\n(It's important to note I didn't do EVERY single challenge but I still did quite a few. Still, not everyone is going to intently do the challenges and they will finish it even quicker. You could probably speedrun this very quickly.)", "timestamp_created": 1506071009, "timestamp_updated": 1510643720, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35120931": {"recommendationid": "35120931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193070495", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2226, "last_played": 1521742979}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so great, it fixes almost all of the issues from the previous engine.

I'm gonna start with that one con: It's short. Like, really short. I blew through it in a couple hours. Granted, there are quite a few optional challenge rooms, many of which I missed, but still, I can't imagine it taking more than 3 or 4 hours to fully exhaust the content on offer if you know what you're doing.\n\nBUT, having said that, it's an incredibly fun game that I'm most certainly going to be revisiting over the years. It's got an excellent sense of inertia and momentum to the movement, it's not so much platforming as it is 2D parkour. The game isn't about landing pixel-perfect jumps, it's about managing and directing your momentum in order to get where you need to go. Additionally, the game is beautifully hand-animated; some of the assets don't scale exceptionally to higher resolutions, but the cozy yet polished art direction more than makes up for some technically lacking textures. \n\nWhen you combine the movement physics, the lovely, rolling level design, and the beatiful animation, the result is a game which flows beautifully and just feels incredibly smooth and fun to play, and this is only helped by the fact that it runs at a silky 60fps.\n\nThat's without even getting into some of the special mechanics that are unlocked over the course of the game, all of which are pretty well-realized and complement the core moveset. In particular, I like the pen-riding sections, which are sort of a microcosm of the swooshing, looping, momentum-heavy gameplay. \n\nThis is just an excellent game, the mechanics more than make up for the somewhat lacking length, and I think that your moveset lends it quite a lot of replayability due to just how sheerly, viscerally GOOD everything feels on a fundamental level.\n\nGranted, a good chunk of enjoyment for me also came from nostalgia for the expreiences of playing the early FPA games on various flash portals, but this is definitely a game which lives up to the nostalgia rather than being carried by it.\n\nI highly recommend buying this game.

This was a complete and total surprise, and I didn't even know this game existed until literally the day it released. But boy am I not disappointed that I found out.\n\nFirst of all, an admission- I am probably biased, because I played some of the older Flash-based Fancy Pants games. That out of the way...\n\n...this game is awesome. The Fancy Pants games have always been about smooth, and incredibly intuitive platforming. And some defying of the laws of physics, but that's par for the course in platformers. You don't get a double jump, but rolling, sliding, wall jumps, and all sorts of other things are available, and are very easy to grasp... although I'd strongly recommend playing with a controller rather than a keyboard unless you change the controls a bit. The default keyboard controls are a bit awkward.\n\nNew to this game (I think) is, well, a weapon. Starts as a pencil, then you replace it with a pen to let you essentially 'inkboard' around on giant panels, which is not only a lot of fun but also massively increases the possibilities when it comes to platforming, and it's later upgraded to shoot (a little wonky but it works fine for the situations it's required for), and then to let you perform ink dashes. Altogether, it's a pretty simple-to-use weapon, but there's not many things as satisfying as performing a home run with a spider.\n\nIt IS worth noting, it'll probably take you about 2-3 hours to complete the main story, so it's a touch short, but there's a lot of challenges to complete, and all sorts of hidden stuff to find- and you can go back for it pretty easily. The boss battles are a touch basic, but the final boss is actually quite fun. Not to mention, the platforming itself is also really fun in general. Ultimately, although the game overall is a bit short, I'd still say it's worth your ten bucks.\n\nEspecially with the music and incredible art. Seriously, I wish I could see how this looks in 4K.

Before we start, I just want to say I'm a huge fan of the previous games and especially the one on Xbox. Let's talk about the things the game advertises on the store page.\n\n-So many levels! - 56 brand new levels of parkour platforming\n\nThere is a total of about 8 \"worlds\" and each of them is divided up into like 6 rooms. None of the art really changes throughout the worlds and they are super short. To me it felt like there was 8 levels. It's like they consider every checkpoint a level. Some of the \"levels\" literally fit on one screen.\n\n-Collections! - Over 20 pants and hats to collect in brand new challenge stages\n\nThe last game let you collect hats, pants, and swords. There were 141 total items iirc. \"Over 20!\" wow that is really underwhelming. I didn't really feel incentivised to even collect them. I did a few challenge stages and then just avoided them the rest of the game.\n\n-Incredible Hand-drawn Style - Frame-by-frame animated worlds, enemies, and friends\n\nThe animations for fancy pants man were pretty good however the general enviorment art was incredibly lazy. Every level is just one or two colors (watch the trailer again) with plenty of reused assets throughout the game. Also, the main enemy was literally a blob, which I feel was only picked because it's so damn easy to animate. They also stripped down some of fancy pants moves which I feel could have just been to do less animating. It's sad that \"hand drawn\" is becoming an excuse for just not doing that much.\n\n-Hack-and-slash - Wield your mighty ink pen to take down new threats!\n\nNot much to say here. The combat was really bland you just tap attack over and over. Even the boss fights were super bland: you just press attack at a different time then usual. However, I will say the Xbox game also had this issue. It tends to just be easier to skip enimes throughout the whole game since you can literally jump over anyone.\n\n-New Moves! - Take control of Fancy Pants man with brand new combos and moves\n\nSo there is an upgrade shop where you can buy 3 different sword moves (one of which was a default in the last game.) They are completley unneccesary and I actually beat the game before I was able to afford any of them. They don't help, it feels like they only exist to give you a false sense of progression.\n\nSecret Challenge Stages - Scattered throughout the world are secret doors to incredibly challenging bonus stages, awarding awesome prizes\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, these are just so you can find pants. I started avoiding them pretty early on since they weren't fun.\n\n-60fps gameplay - Perfectly smooth running for a perfectly smooth platformer\n\nNice\n\nOther miscallaneous issues\n-Overall, just bad platforming. Sometimes the camera couldn't keep up very well, causing you to jump off a cliff. Lots of poorly telegraphed jumps or platforms that would move unexpectedly. The same color platform could move up or left and it cause a lot of dumb deaths. There is one room where you go bottom to top, but if you mess up you just fall lto the bottom instead of dying. It's really annoying. Lots of stuff like that, plus a few bad hitboxes on walls, cause you to miss easy jumps.\n\n-They completley ruined walljumping. You no longer choose what direction you jump off the wall. The tutorial says they did it because it is \"easier\" but it just gives you less control over the character and makes cheap deaths. How is it easier to NOT let me control where I go? This game doesn't let a good player be good.\n\n-No multiplayer ;/\n\nLiterally the game is worse then the old one that you can play for free online, AND you have to pay $10 to play this. If we are comparing them, this one has 60 fps and controller support. the online one has actual levels with actual art, 141 items, more then 10 lines of dialouge, and a ton more.\n\nI mean where is all the charm?? The old games had all those little jokes in the background and tons of things to do in every level. The old house has the litrtle animated celine fan and fish and pictures and stuff. This new house is literally empty. NOTHING. White walls.\n\n-Where is the swimming???\n\n-Awkward soundtrack with really awkward transitions\n\nAnyway, the best way to play would be on an Xbox 360, but 2nd best goes to playing the free online one.

The momentum physics are really fun, the new Inkboarding is a fantastic feature and the Ink gun is also a great addition. As I'm writing this I'm only roughly one and a half hours into the game and I'm already having a lot of fun.\nThe Soundtrack is no exception, really nice to listen to.\n\nOverall, I can recommend this game to everybody that wants a fun platformer.

I was also expecting a saving file system instead of it being all in one file...It makes it suck that you cant make a new file to start the whole adventure all over again, but i guess it might be a little unnessecary. The game also throws you in straight away. There isnt really a menu like the other games. where you enter other doors to go to different options. It feels...off. Also the ending...That ending man...I won't spoil it, but it felt very abrupt, it leaves me hanging with wanting more.

[b]No listing of controls anywhere[/b] outside of the new pensliding mechanic.\n[*]Pretty buggy. I softlocked more than a few times by accidentally grabbing corners of breakable blocks that couldn't be broken.\n[*]Overall odd [b]lack of polish[/b] in levels\n[*]Levels all feel the [b]same[/b]. As far as I have played, there are no real individual level mechanics or landmarks. I suppose those 56 new levels came with a price.\n[*]Mysterious lack of sounds for text boxes. Maybe it's just me, but it feels weird for it to be completely silent when you advance text.\n[*]Music all feels the same so far. When I saw the trailer a few days ago, I got a bit worried. I hoped that the song may just be an \"epic final level song\" or something, but the entire OST is in the same style. This [b]new style of music feels completely different from the other Fancy Pants games[/b] and (in my opinion) not to its advantage. The story and text is still just as \"random\", so this new \"epic music\" style just doesn't mesh, in my opinion.\n[*]Placement that's not very well thought out. Around 10 minutes into the game, there's a challenge door that's surrounded by breakable blocks. Unfortunately, it seems that whoever designed the levels didn't consider that when exiting the challenge, the player might want to hit up...if you do, you go right back in. Also the softlock issue. It feels like the game hasn't been playtested at all outside of the main mechanics.\n[/list]\n\n\nAs much as I respect Brad, this game might be a step down from FPA in terms of level design, even if there are more levels. There are a lot of great new touches (challenge doors, penriding, etc), but it's not worth the hit in level design. It's unlikely this will ever be fixed since it's a core issue, so I'd recommend this game only if this all sounds ok to you.\n\nEdit: There's no way to tell which platforms are \"jump through\" or not.

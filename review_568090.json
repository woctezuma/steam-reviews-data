this, but pretty much only when its daylight! \n\nIt's a cross between a puzzle and survival horror, you start by waking up near Christmas and decide to un-wrap your present early, the present is Tattletail, the potentially creepy talking fuzz-ball, and this is where your problems start, not with Tattletail, but with his MAMMA! she will chase you through your own house, following you by sound, and if you dont keep Tattletail fed, groomed and charged, he makes a racket and she'll be on you in a flash!\n\nAlso, once you finish the main game you can play the Kaleidoscope update, just incase the original wasn't scary enough, this time you go back through your own memories in a twisted version of your house with mysterious letters to guide you. Merry Christmas again everyone!\n\nJump scares /10, would hide from Mamma again and again!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0wUc85ip_U&t=23s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HouRBR9GWRE&t=26s",

Hope you enjoy.\n\nTattletail provides a wonderful experience for people who are looking for a quick horror game to spare your time. It even has some free DLC, which makes the game 10x better \ud83e\udd23. This is my review.\n\nI think Tattletail is a wonderful horror game. It bases off of Five Night's at Freddy's, a more popular game franchise than anything I've seen. It has five nights where you take Tattletail and do certain quests or tasks that are very hard and scary to go through. I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but it is a WONDERFUL game to try out. The ending does provide you with happiness, and it also leaves you on a cliffhanger.\n\nFirst off, the game is scary enough to make your chest bump. It gives you a sign of worry and fear, while also a huge sign of determination to get through the night. When you take the furbish toy, it talks to 1. Annoy you and 2. Make noise. Secretly, there's a devil Tattletail thing given the name \"Mama.\"When you make noise, she listens. And Seeks. She tries to stalk you and when she gets a hold of you...? Well, she's not letting go. \n\nSecondly, this game's DLC, named \"The Kalidoscope\" changes your mind about these furbish dolls. It's a pretty interesting DLC for a game this deep. Plus, it's for free. *In Mr. Krab's Voice* Who doesn't like free stuff? So yeah, I think it adds a pretty interesting feel to the game.\n\nI only did two today because I didn't feel like doing a third one and I couldn't come up with one. :/\n\nI hope you all enjoyed. A game like this...you better buy.\n\n-x_Nick300_x", "timestamp_created": 1515017027, "timestamp_updated": 1515017027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39000132": {"recommendationid": "39000132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323487824", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515220106}, "language": "english", "review": "its scary and fun \n", "timestamp_created": 1514957559, "timestamp_updated": 1514957559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38970684": {"recommendationid": "38970684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165162766", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520496906}, "language": "english", "review": "pros:\nfun\nscary in the start\ncheap\nfree dlc\n\ncons:\ngets less and less scary the more you play\nvery short\nnot much replayability\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514894462, "timestamp_updated": 1514894462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38965563": {"recommendationid": "38965563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389895334", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514798285}, "language": "english", "review": "Doesn't work properly on my laptop, mouse is really sensitive and the loading screens are a nightmare!

Even at $5 it's a nice cheap and enjoyable experience.  What I enjoyed msot about this game is the continued trend of \"cute...but something isn't right\" motiff that this and similar games have, which harkens back to some classic 90s Horror Movies, while Tattletail injects more 90s nostalgia with it being akin to Furbys which plagued Kids for years!\n\nThe game utilizes a fantastic ambience of being set at night, with MANY sound cues which trigger Adrenaline and Fear responses, the gameplay also makes use of the \"Fight or Flight\" drive, when having to deal with the game's Terror: Mama.

It uses the Five Nights at Freddy's model of horror...however it makes the deathly mistake of doing things that made FNAF 2 a chore to play. One of the great things that made FNAF 1 such a joy to play was its ultra creepy visuals, its innovative haunted house feel, and the jumpscares. OMG The jumpscares. This title does one better. It lets you roam around...which is something we've always wanted to do at Freddy's. (and were sort of able to do in a map on Garry's mod). And from the start of tattletail you are immensely creeped out. \n\nYou play an 8 year old child 5 days before christmas who gets out of bed and wanders about the dark house wanting to open his Christmas presents early. We ALL did that and it was an awesome premise. However the premise goes astray and actually starts to tick you off more than bring joy and actual fright. Your present is a talking toy called Tattletail, which is a parody of the 80s (scary) Furby toy that talked. Also TEddy Ruxpin. This name is immensely clever seeing as how the thing that constantly gets you killed is this toy that JUST WON'T SHUT UP! I guess that's the reason. That's the premise. You carry around this toy...and this is where the choices of gameplay borrowed from FNAF2 cause the game to take a wrong turn. In that game you constantly had to wind a musicbox to avoid getting killed by a jester doll...and this caused you to not be able to enjoy doing ANYTHING else (like enjoy the visuals or actually enjoy getting creeped out by the sound and visuals and tension that was there in FNAF 1.) Nope. You had to do what felt like work. Wind the box all game. In this game you have to do three things. None of which make any difference. You have to feed it, brush it and charge it. If you let any of them go too long without doing them, tattletail whines until you do. And this voice is of the fingernails on a chalkboard variety. It never shuts up. And even after you do these things, it whines about other things. It keeps talking. In the early levels you really aren't in any danger at all making you wonder why you have to be so quiet all the time. It never really explains why. Then suddenly you are afraid of another toy called Mama which it doesn't really accurately explain but rather you are instruced via an abstract little scene. Then it becomes like FNAF. Now strangely enough while I found the distant pinpoint eyes great I wasn't as scared by them like say when I saw them in the recent IT. Probably because they were used so much it ceased becoming a fear thing and was more just part of gameplay. And the jumpscare itself (which happens a LOT) never ever shocked me out of my seat like Freddy, Bonnie, and Foxy did. I don't know why. Maybe the music. Maybe the animation wasn't really spooky enough but more satire and funny looking? Perhaps if the shocks were scarier I would not have minded some of the plotholes. Like if this thing is getting me killed, then why don't I put it down. Why don't I call for help? Oh yes that reminds me that there is a door to your mother's room that you can pound on til your fingers bleed and nothing will happen. This smacks of comedy sure. This also smacks of a developer trolling us. No help will come. Where are the parents. We find evidence (I think ) that you are being raised by a single mother. Well the fact that an option says \"Knock on Mom's door\". But then the logic breaks down night after night, day after day. And is this toy really bullying you? There's fear in that. In fact I was scared from the beginning of this game when I was walking around in a dark house alone and once the furby I mean tattletail carrying started I wanted to shoot myself. Really the fear left because of gameplay and annoyance at that voice. Perhaps a different actor would have made that part more palatable. There is also an extension called Kaleidoscope which continues the story in quite a neat science fictiony way. More logical in its logic than the previous bits. I wanted to get through this game. I wanted better. I wanted more. Everything in my head about this game was scarier than the things that actually happened. And I was stuck doing night four for what seemed an eternity, constantly failing because of something out of my control. I think there's the rub. The game at least is cheapish and when on sale I'd suggest playing it. But there will be fingernails...on a blackboard. And the voiceacting in the expansion gets so much worse. And there's something else audibly irritating to add to all the Tattletailing. Whenever you are making noise, it puts a megaphone icon in the corner of your screen and beeps in a high-pitched, dog-summoning tone until you stop. Does this increase tension? Yes. Does this increase the irritation? Yes. It really feels like the game is nagging you to death.", "timestamp_created": 1509685116, "timestamp_updated": 1509921196, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36215259": {"recommendationid": "36215259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028724797", "num_games_owned": 936, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509623337}, "language": "italian", "review": "Voto: 7/10\n\nTattletail \u00e8 un gioco horror in prima persona.

The premise is very clever, and the visuals are well-done for a Unity budget title, but the gameplay feels very much like a more free-roam take on Five Nights at Freddy's, which I just don't find particularly interesting or scary. The core gameplay revolves around getting out of bed, finding Tattletail, doing whatever activities the game's objective prompts tell you to do, all while keeping your flashlight charged (which drops way too fast) and keeping Tattletail charged, fed, and groomed (those meters also drop way too fast). If you fail to do so, Tattletail will start making all kinds of noise, and the Tattletail Mama will find you and kill you (with a jump-scare right out of FNAF).\n\nBottom line, if you're the sort who thinks Five Nights at Freddy's is a neat horror series, and you want to try something new, you'll probably really dig Tattletail.

The Tattletails are spooky as well: they are somehow animated and they do things like playing hide-and-seek...

IF you miss ONE u dont get the good ending. there are 22. you do the match how many is in each chapter lol\n\n\nCons:\n- No difficulty selection. It's basically Easy for the 1st chapter, then the rest is HARD! Not very balanced. lol A dificulity mode would make this game better for beginners.\n- sometimes interaction can be buggy, delaying you, thus causing you to get caught by Mama like nuts... *shudder*\n- Lag between chapters.\n- Lighting is awful. if you make it the way perscribed its too dark to see at all, even in lit areas. When you make it brighter, anywhere and anything that is lighter already is blinding. Adjustment needed.\n- THE DAMN VOICES!!! lol BRUSH ME! GIVE ME A TREAT! MAMAS COMING....etc STFU TATTLETAIL!  XP while nessesary, it can be extremely distarcting..\n- Frustrating as it sends you back to the beginning of the chapter everytime you die. No CheckPoints except per chapter.\n- !!! SPOILER !!! when you get all the eggs you get a special item in the end.....another damn flashlight...are you kigging me...? \n- you cannot pause the game or you will be sent back to the menu. (probably better to use a gamepad instead of keyboard idk)\n- Short. Very short game. but i guess thats the point. Thankfully I only paid 5.00 for this game.\n\nyeah.... its not that great. but has potenital. If it was an easy game i guess it wouldnt be fun for some people. But at least have a difficulty selection... 3/10\nIt's more fun to watch Jacksepticeye or Markiplier play it.", "timestamp_created": 1507583924, "timestamp_updated": 1507584119, "voted_up": false,

Naturally, I fell in love with it, because I was 8 and easy to please. My poor parents, not so much. When the childlike joy and innocence drained out of me as the years went by, I began to understand why so many parents loathe any kind of toy that doesn't know how to shut the hell up.\n\nThis game is essentially owning a Furby all over again. You are tasked with caring for a shrill, fuzzy little machine that tries to be cute while demanding you perform menial tasks for it at an hour in which most people would prefer to sleep. At the same time, you are being stalked by a mother that wants to kill you for running around the house making too much noise when you SHOULD be in bed. You are ultimately just going through the motions to appease the jibbering little monster in hopes that maybe it will shut up and you can finally go to sleep. It's not fun. It's not scary.

Are you the type of person who thinks Five Nights at Freddy's is a good game? Well then this is the game for you! Tattletail is a game about scary furbies. You carry a furby around while it says things like \"I love playing with you!\", \"Me Tattletail!\", and, \"Give me a treat!\" If that doesn't scare you then don't worry, the game will play scary noises like the classic metal wire scraping, the more traditional random piano note, and the modern rythmic thumping to let you know that this is a horror game. This is to let you know that you should be scared, because if you're not braindead then you might notice how mind numbingly boring the game is. \n\nIn Tattletail you carry the furby around and do some objectives that have you running around the house. While you're doing this you have to keep the thing fed, brushed, and charged. If you don't it starts complaining and won't shut up until you satisfy it. Not sure why running out of batteries causes it to make more noise but whatever. You have a flashlight that you have to shake to keep it charged, and you have to shake it roughly every 15 seconds. It makes noise when you shake it. The furby also likes to make noise just for an added layer of annoyance. Occasionally the lights go out and then all these noise mechanics come into play, because the big furby will try to find and kill you. Now the thing can't actually move, it just teleports nearby so all you have to do is move out of it's line of sight and just move back if it teleports again. Supposedly noise attracts it, and at one point the game told me it only attacks if you make noise. So I figured if I just stood on my bed then it would never be able to get me. So I hop on and get into a corner and the thing teleports to the side of the bed, then after a few seconds it killed me. So I guess noise isn't what triggers it. That was the only time I died. \n\nAnyway I got bored around the 4th level or so. It's just another indie horror game to try and cash in on whatever scary thing is flavor of the month.

welcome to one of my first reviews  my name is halvernia and today im going to be reviewing a game called tattletail. now before we start the review lets talk about downloading price usally some people think that for a 5 dollar game it should be terrible but for this game that is not the case because when the pictures show for the game, because you actually get the quality of a 20 dollar game than a 5 dollar one so its a win win.Now the review, next up is plot now the game is basically a xmas version of slenderman you do 5 night quest with tattletail while trying to avoid mama tattletail after you open your present early. Next up is ending dependeing on how many eggs you find  will give you your ending, if you don't find all eggs your present will be empty and mama will kill you, but if you find all eggs tattletail will be in the gift snd reward you with a golden flashlight and then you wake your mom up, but for both endings credits will play and you'll unlock the kaleidoscope dlc wit brings us to our next part. next up is dlc the DlC the kaleidescope is basicaly tattle tail has changes from being sneaky to nerdy and 5 days back in time and he is still nerdy so you have no choice to go to the kaleidescope to fix him , after watch in the tape you fix him and then you leave but not before you are beeing hunted down by kaleidoscope momma after nearly escapeinmg you are back in xmas day 1998 to open a sneaky but fixed tattle tail afterresponding to a knock knock me joke tattle tail says what i think is the best Dlc ending on a happy side  because he says \"me love you *giggles*\" and the DLC ends with the credits \n\nSo that is the end of the review and I will see you at the end of the portal. \n\n\nThank you for reading this erichment center review activity goodbye *Tattletail giggle*", "timestamp_created": 1501985825, "timestamp_updated": 1501985825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34047466": {"recommendationid": "34047466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308803340", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502037642}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a game where a child opens a furby called a tattletail", "timestamp_created": 1501970764, "timestamp_updated": 1501970764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34037916": {"recommendationid": "34037916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242073876", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521587902}, "language": "spanish", "review": "this amazing game =3", "timestamp_created": 1501938823, "timestamp_updated": 1501938823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34032283": {"recommendationid": "34032283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235311456", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501917023}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved it.

game is fun and scary, very much so, but if i were to list some faults with it that would be with the checkpoint system, (in my opinion, there should be a checkpoint after you find each of the tattletails like when you checkpoint between the \"funny games\", it's very repetitive when you have to keep delivering the tattletails everytime single time you mess up, and if people agree with this maybe do that for the party run too?) mama's \"still-N'-kill\" strategy (what i'm trying to say is make it a little easier to escape mama, as there was a time where i was on a tarp lump thing and mama was looking at me and i couldn't turn around because she would without a doubt kill me, but i collected almost all the candles), and the ability to select a level if they started a NEW game but they're not on christmas day,(but I get it, maybe it's encouraging the player to double-check the place and get the good ending, but if you accidentally slipped your mouse and clicked new game insted of continue[this happened to me] then you have to restart the game over again, and not get the features that the finished players have gotten, which might cause the player to rage-quit and not come back to it again, just allow a system that says \n\"are you sure\" or maybe a select for people to the level that they haven't finished, and when they're finished allow them to go to any level \nthey can[like how it is now]). anyway those are my ideas, please let me know what you think. (i haven't even FULLY finished), thank you for the game, \n\nand to anyone who survived this long, remember to have fun and not get triggered(thats a mistake I made), goodbye and thanks for reading\n\n\nEDIT:I don't wan't thiss game to be so annoying that it's no longer scary", "timestamp_created": 1496223375, "timestamp_updated": 1496448322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32053071": {"recommendationid": "32053071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211922428", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496109494}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a good game!", "timestamp_created": 1496105651, "timestamp_updated": 1499063455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32050821": {"recommendationid": "32050821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367348180", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511121046}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a great scary game and would totally recommend it.

It has a great story for all those theorists out there, and it's got the best quality. Like every other game, it has its ups and downs, but I'll recommend for this one because there's only a few details that are bad about it and I'm not known to be a picky pete. \n\n\nIf you dont know what Tattletail is, well, here's the basics.\n\nYou are a 10 year old boy from Florida who lives across from the Waygetter company, the ones who make the toy Baby Talking Tattletail. This young boy, Thomas, is very impatient for christmas to come. So impatient that he can't wait five days or he'll burst! He wakes up in the middle of the night to go downstairs into his basement and find his Christmas gift. Surprise surprise! It's a Baby Talking Tattletail! But this Tattletail won't stay in his box. He goes out to cause mischief and Thomas has to wake himself up every day until Christmas day to make sure that Tattletail gets into no trouble. But Tattletail's mother, Mama Tattletail, is upset about Thomas messing around with her son. The bloodthirsty Mama Tattletail, after two nights of watching Thomas grab and mess with her son, finally lets go of her patience and begins attacking poor Thomas. Now Thomas has two goals: One to keep Talking Tattletail from telling and making problems, and to survive Mama Tattletail's teeth. On Christmas Eve, Tattletail and his brothers decide to tell Thomas to get a ''party'' ready for Mama. But when Thomas gets the finishing touch, the candles, he finds the Tattletail family in a circle, christmas lights strung out on the floor, having some sort of ritual, chanting ''No more mama!'' Still confused, Thomas puts down and lights the candles, rewinding the VHS. Mama tattletail is not impressed and steals the candles so the deed cant be done and hides them in vases. Now Thomas has to survive Mama, deal with the annoyance of Tattletail's voice, AND noisily break the vases to find the candles. Finally he does, relights them for the Tattletail Tribe, and observes their ceremony. But Mama isn't done there. She escapes the banishment by hiding in Tattletail's original box. She comes out right before Thomas wakes up the next day, sneaks up behind him, and gives him a piece of her mind.\n\nSorry if I just spoiled the game for you.\n\nAnyway, here we go.\n\n\n\nPros:\nThe 90's vibe is amazing.\nThe graphics are 10 out of 10.\nMama's design is on point, with all the rips and tears and the red glow in her eyes.\nTattletail looks so adorable <3\n\nCons:\nThe camera wildly moves around faster than a normal mouse should.\nTattletail's voice is a disgrace to humanity.\nMama's jumpscare isn't too scary.\nOn Christmas Eve, it takes you back to the start of the night, which I loathe.\n\n\nBut even with the cons, this game is great and I'd buy it for $20.00! That's $15.00 extra for what I payed for this game, but it deserves more than it gets! I just don't understand why people call it a '\n''fnaf rip-off'' because it has nothing to do with FNaF. People think that all horror games are linked to FNaF, and it's sad that games like this don't get enough love just because some kids think that every horror game has to do with sitting on your ass in an office looking at a freaking robotic bear for 6 hours straight.

The game runs well even on average computers. \n\nI liked the hide and seek aspect with the flashlight in the dark. I liked the sense of urgency to get Tattletail to shut up at critical moments. I liked the house exploration and hidden items to collect.\n\nTattletail now includes a free DLC, lengthening the story, and giving players even more reason to return for a second round. 10/10 satisfied with this product.  \n\nPS- the price tag is super attractive .\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1495229803, "timestamp_updated": 1495229803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31844979": {"recommendationid": "31844979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366460470", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510014238}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game bc it is scary fun and chalenging", "timestamp_created": 1495217142, "timestamp_updated": 1495217142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31842952": {"recommendationid": "31842952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282997291", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503782186}, "language": "english", "review": "ive seen and played it but it wont let me play it .\n", "timestamp_created": 1495209740, "timestamp_updated": 1495209740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31841669": {"recommendationid": "31841669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336805013", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516889845}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game :)", "timestamp_created": 1495205399, "timestamp_updated": 1495205399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31835567": {"recommendationid": "31835567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198574619066", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514927483}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome and the update!

but SCP was definetly the more challenging, besides that they are many pros and cons that i found while playing this magnificent game, each one will have a detailed explanation about why I beleive this.\n\nPROS\nThe atmosphere was simply fantastic, it kept me on my seat, something most horror games just couldnt coprehend, the sounds and spooky sounds always kept the feeling eerie and creepy, which should always be a Pro for Games like these\n\nThe mechanics are also fairly decent and amazing, took me 2 hours to figure it out but in the end, it turned to an easy yet challenging experience that i personally find enjoyable and Reasonable for these type of horror survival games\n\nthe enemy is of course, mama tattletail, her voice is by Geneva Hudson, one of the main producers of this game, the way they tuned up her voice to make it sound mechanical was only more of a reason to love this game, simply magnificence and Wonderful.\n\nnow with every pro, there is a con\n\nCONS\n\nit got very repetitve, feeding grooming petting running repeat, it got really boring after hours of doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nthe sound system is kind of broken, for example, i was completely silent while going to pick up the Yellow tattletail, and i immediatley got jumpscared as soon as i reached the living room, i wasnt making any sounds, and it was completely silence, hopefuly they'll fix this in the Sequel or Prequel\n\nMama's Jumpscare starting getting repetitve, making it lose its factor and became quite annoying, perhaps change this by adding new animations and adding a different sound effect each jumpscare.\n\nCons aside, this game was quite entertaining, horrifying, and Fun for the most part, i hope they'll expand the lore and addd maybe a new enemy and a

The controls are pretty good, for a game where you walk and look around, interact by left clicking, charge a light by right clicking.

In the big red spotted box is a Baby Talking Tattletail, the modern version of a furby. The commercial doesn't lie, feed him, brush him, and don't let him run out of batteries. Do what he wants while avoiding his really overprotective mother, Mama Tattletail, recalled a year earlier. At the end of the game, banish that mom with a very satanic ritual, and awake to a nice day. Collecting the eggs could determine your fate.\n\nOverall rating 8.5/10\nThis game has very good gameplay, with ok graphics and performance.

this game. It was fun and creepy. If you're a fan of FNaF, this game is definitely for you. One complaint I have is the last night. Without spoiling anything, for the last night you don't have your Tattletail with you, which is 99% of the cause of deaths, which makes the Mama less of a big scary monster and more of an annoyance. Also, another problem is that the game is way too short. The first 3 nights are a tutorial, leaving you with only 2 real nights. However, the short time is worth it because of how creepy Mama is. While there are jumpscares in it which may scare (No pun intended) people away, Mama delivers more than just jumpscares by the way she stalks you. When Mama is near, she makes a whirring noise that will have you running in the opposite direction in hopes of escaping, as well as two glowing red eyes so that you know right where she is. She usually appears right where you want to go, and pausing to do a task while hearing the whirring noise but not seeing her adds to the overall creepy factor. Accompanied by the music that plays when Mama is near adds up to a great monster for a horror game. The game also has secrets and multiple endings, which adds a little more things to do in this small game. Overall, fun game, if you're looking for a quick scare I would recommend it.\n\nEDIT: I have just played the Kaleidoscope campaign. This mode adds more value to the game, and while I didn't like it as much as the normal game, it was still pretty fun. The Kaleidoscope is best played without knowing anything about it so I won't spoil much.\nThis campaign is WEIRD. If you're expecting a different house with different nights and tasks and new monsters, this is the complete opposite of that. Expect the unexpected when going in. This campaign, while not very scary, has some funny moments and some flat-out STRANGE moments. In terms of scares, there's one chase scene at the end, but it was so strange that I wasn't scared much. The chase, however, is quite hard and might take a few tries for you to get acquainted with the area you're running through. The chase requires you to memorize locations where you can refill Tattletail's needs while running through, and I found myself having fun with it. The developers also made the campaign free when they could have easily made you pay for it, and that's always a good thing to see. Overall, this mode has some fun surprises while not being all that scary.", "timestamp_created": 1492562443, "timestamp_updated": 1497112161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31223760": {"recommendationid": "31223760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335333264", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516036541}, "language": "english", "review": "i fucking clicked new game and i cant get it back gIVE IT BACK NOW I WAS AT THE FUCKING CHRISTMAS EVE NO PLEASE JUST GIVE IT BACK IM ANGRY", "timestamp_created": 1492540468, "timestamp_updated": 1492540468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": -2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485944", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31222558": {"recommendationid": "31222558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306404998", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509885961}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1492536206, "timestamp_updated": 1492536206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31220924": {"recommendationid": "31220924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123517816", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500911352}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly like the game, I kept away from it for awhile because of the fandom, but I finnally decided to pick up this game. The game is a nice price of $5.00, which is pretty good for the game. The graphics are amazing for an indie game too! I only have 2 problems with the game. The first was how short the game was, I beat the entire game in about 36 minutes, this includes eggs and all. The other problem was how difficult Mama was to get away from, after I died about 6 times she wasn't scary anymore, she was more of just a problem. I would see the eyes, then I would slowly walk away then BAM! out of no where, Mama just kills me. I guess I just don't see how she works. But I managed to get past her after the second time because she spawned in a different location. But for the price of $5.00, this game did deliver some good scares and some childhood trauma!

Tattletail is clearly based off of Furbies and on the fact that they always looked creepy more than anything and not a bad concept managed to play the entire game and get all of the achivements in one go, but one of the things that i have agaisnt this game is the length of it.\n\nNow i know it uses the \"Five Nights\" type of layout and considering the games setting that's understandble since its suppose to be five days before christmas and that's one of the neat things about the game is that it's a horror game thats set around christmas thats kind of cool (no pun indeeded). Back to the point though Tattletail is a neat little horror game based around an anoyying little toy that's constantly asking to be fed, bushed or recharged and your suppose to avoid the things \"Mama\". \n\nMama Tattletail now thats one of this games mysteries, for instance what is she exactly? Is she possesed? Does she have a broken A.I.? Or is she simply suffering from a malfunction? either way the game doesnt exactly tell us the true reason why the mama tattletail was discontinued though its heavily hinted that it killed someone sometime before the game took place.\n\nThough thats not the reason why I'm saying that i don't like the game that much i mean go ahead and play it for yourselfs and find out whats happening. The reason why i didn't enjoy it was simply because to me it wasn't all that fun. When i originaly saw this game through some youtubers i thought \"hey this might be a neat little horror game to play\" though after buying it and playing the entire thing and doing everything afterwords I just didn't enjoyed it that much as i thought i would. Overall im not saying its a bad game at all but to me it wasn't all that good either the story behind this game is that you play a small child who was to eger to wait for his presents and decided to open one of them up early and what that kid got was a very demanding little Furbe toy and his Creepy-Stalking Mama chasing him around the house at night. \n\nOne more thing i got to note before ending this. What was with the ritual at the end of the game with all the tattletails? Was the Mama tattletail actually possesed by something? and \"its\" soul was connected to the VHS tape?

(Lets go with that.)\n- Good graphics.\n- YOU GET TO HAVE A DEMONIC FURBY!! (Did I spell that right?)\n- The good ending is a good ending. (It's hard to get)\n\nCons:\n\n- The graphics overpower my computer. (Don't buy if you have a sh** computer like mine.)\n- The bad ending is bad. (It's easy to get.)\n- Don't knock on moms door when mama is nearby. (jump scare)\n- The game can be beaten in one sitting. (Too short)\n- Jump scares get boring after one or two of them. (There is only one jump scare you can get)\n\nSerious time \n\nOne problem with the game is that there is a problem with the computer specs you need to have in order to play the game with a good frame rate. I was at a friends house and he wanted this game on his computer (Which is better than mine) We checked his computer specs and his mac overpowered the game's specs. After the download we started the game and the frame rate was awful! It was IMPOSSIBLE to play. (There were no background processes and we also tried turning down the resolution)\nDo not buy unless you have a super great computer.\n\nSo I give Tattletale a 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1489760381,

Others have this problem as well, you can get less than 14 FPS while playing. While it sounds bad, it's still playable and not a game-ruining issue.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, on with the review!\n\n\n\nSo, everybody and their dog has heard of F.N.A.F (and don't worry, I won't compare it to it that much), Tattletail also utilises jumpscares as its primary source of scare, along with REALLY UNECESSARILY SCARY NOISES. Tattletail is spooky, fast and very unforgiving, especially with what you might expect. You play as a child, who like all of us, really REALLY wanted to open his / her presents, just days before Christmas. So, you sneak down to the basement, despite hearing a [b]LOT[/b] of things you shouldn't hear from the basement. And what's down there making all that noise?\n\nYou guessed it. Tattletail. He's the hot new toy hitting shelves just in time for Christmas! He eats real food, and goes through your fridge like it's full of chicken nuggets, but the sexy cutie Furby-like guy needs some serious styling as well, so be sure to keep him brushed! Don't forget his batteries (Not included) also need charging, or else he'll be no fun! He also likes to invite some \"friends\" over for a \"party\" sometimes.\n\nThis is a very short game, like FNAF, but it has a quirky charm to it: You have to take care of Tattletail. He is so frigging loud as well. Like, on par with that meme where Bart Simpson shouts \"testing\" into 50 megaphones all lined up. Tattletail is a cutie though, so you can kind of forgive him for being a loud fuzzy fuzzball.\nI really don't want to say more, because this is a short game and you should find out for yourself, but I will say this:[b]\n\n\n\u2022 Tattletail's needs are worth more than your own.\n\u2022 Tattletail always knows.\n\u2022 Mama is looking after you.

When you manage to build the courage and head towards the basement you find the gift that was at the top of your Christmas list... Tattletail. This little fucker is the shit of the town. The fatty eats all of your food, wants to be brushed constantly, and has the battery lifespan of a dying potato battery powering a clock. After you unbox the little furball he wants to get some food so he can become an even larger ball of fur.\n\nSince you are a helpless little kid who can't say no to a toy who literally won't stop shouting about wanting a treat no matter how many times you hit it against the washing machine you give in. He eats through your refridgerator like a truck. Shortly after, he then needs to be groomed so he can be one sexy son of a bitch.\n\nAfter using your mother's hairbrush she left conviently lying on the couch for the past few weeks you finally decide to shove the little guy back into his little box.

Absolutely.\n\nFrom the moment the game started, the music put me in a tense mood, and after a short intro screen, I was placed into a heavy atmosphere. The only direction I had was \"Open your christmas present early\"\n\nIf only I knew what that entailed.\n\n---\n\nTattletail is frightening on many levels. It plays into my favourite type of fear, childhood horror. Anyone who was scared of furbies as a kid will undoubtedly be terrified of this game. Not afraid of furbies? Don't worry, you'll still be scared.\n\nThe sound design is what I love most about this game, the music is so unsettling, and the chase music is so intense. Even if you go through the whole game without getting jumpscared (Dying), you will still be on edge the whole game. From the music, to the noises \"Mama\" makes, and even Tattletail's voice acting, this game accomplishes what most horror titles don't. Actually being scary.\n\nThe story is another thing I love about Tattletail. I'm a big fan of hidden story/lore, so this game was quite the treat for me. Of course, if you enjoy plot without having to dig, the story may feel a bit lackluster. I can't say too much on my opinion of the story as we've seen so far as not too much has been found yet, but what we've seen so far is rather enticing. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics are very fun, if not very well explained. But it doesn't take too long to get the hang of it. The mechanics work fluidly, and the controls are fluid and not clunky at all.\n\nIf I had to have any criticisms, it would definitely be performance. My computer can run most games fine, but Tattletail takes up a lot of resources. You better be prepared to close all background processes for a smooth run, or have a beefy computer.\n\nAnother gripe I had with the game was how short it was. If you're good at horror games, the game only takes about 2 hours to beat. Otherwise, I'd say 3 hours is the average. With such a great game, it leaves you aching for more when there is none (Here's to hoping for a sequel!)\n\nOverall, an awesome game that will scare you out of your wits.\n\n\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\n[b]Sound:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n[b]Story:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\n[b]Performance:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n[b]Controls:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\n[b]Length:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\n[b]Overall:[/b] A solid \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606!

Games like this are usually free on site like Itchio and Gamejolt, so is this worth your money?\n\nI suppose that depends on how you approach the game. I certainly enjoyed my time with this.\n\nThe game is from a child's perspective, and takes place in the days following Christmas, which is a topic and style not usually tackled in horror games. The graphics are subpar at best, but the atmosphere created from the first moments of the game really set the tone for later.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2MJMVpyObs\n\n*SPOILERS FOR THE STORY PAST THIS POINT ON*\n\nOnce Mama is introduced, everything is thrown on its head. The house becomes as wicked and scary as the buildup suggests, and more than likely you are going to die from sheer confusion and terror.\n\nThis leads me to one of my biggest problems with the game: Mama's kill method.\n\nFrom the first time Mama is introduced, it seems as though her A.I. is programmed like the usual \"She can't see you, but she can hear you\" deal. Well, that seems the case, but I suffered from dying to what seemed like nothing. Apparently she can just warp all over the place, and if you're not prepared she can insta-kill you out of nowhere. Luckily the game supplements this with constantly saving checkpoints in the night.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8ghaZT6Cn0\n\nThe Tattletails alsohave a Hunger, Battery, and Brush meter that gradually decreases as they away from the things that regenerate those meters. I felt as though this was unneccessary, as I never encountered a time when the Tattletails yelling put me in peril.\n\nThe ending of the game is where I lost interest, however, as the last night was more tedious as it was scary. By this time I had already gotten the shock factor of dying out of the way (As my FNAF experience has conditioned me for) and dying was an annoyance rather than a terrifying plight,\n\nOh? But didn't I say that the game put up checkpoints every so often in case you died? I did. The last night puts checkpoints too, though only after surviving long, seemingly random Mama encounters, and fetch quests.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnwD_6vKFfM\n\nThe story seemed unique, but several factors (Such as my parents not existing, though that could have been the horror trope) marred the experience I was ready to be over with. \n\nThe ending was lackluster, but I have et to get the \"Secret Ending\" I think you receive after obtaining all the easter eggs, so perhaps the True Ending isn't as bad.\n\nNevertheless, give this game a go if you're into Five Nights at Freddy's style games, or for a cool twist on the child's perspective/Christmas horror story genre.", "timestamp_created": 1485674486, "timestamp_updated": 1485674486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29556552": {"recommendationid": "29556552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361504459", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515975975}, "language": "english", "review": "nice but it lags a lot!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1485665914, "timestamp_updated": 1485665914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29554701": {"recommendationid": "29554701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263127566", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516464470}, "language": "english", "review": "MY game keeps crashing and it wont pls tell me how to stop it", "timestamp_created": 1485656194, "timestamp_updated": 1487388211, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.380927", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29554354": {"recommendationid": "29554354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289256719", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486705874}, "language": "english", "review": "Tattletail is a good game.

You are given only a flashlight to protect yourself, and while this might sound like the typical \"Run away from the baddie in the dark\" horror game, it's far from it.\n\nTattletail happens to be the one thing that will get you killed.

It can be very unsettling the first time you play tattletail and without saying any spoilers, can linger for quite a while.  I personally think the game to a certain point doesn't keep it's scare factor as you do get used to it very quickly. But with problems with the game, as glitches are concerned, there are quite a few here and there.\n\n1st, would be Mama herself. Don't get me wrong i do like how she attacks you, but it's HOW she attacks you... let me explain. Mama only attacks you if you make too much noise (or if you run into her like an idiot... like me), it's so scary to find her red glowing eyes cutting through the darkness... and thats it. She does attack you if you can't get away from her but for some weird reason, i had ran into Mama, she's staring at me, speaks, Tattletail freaks out from the darkness (and hungry)..... but nothing happens. i was just staring at her till she goes away. I even had a friend on my phone watching me play it and we couldn't stop wondering why she hasn't attacked me yet.\n\n2nd, this may be a spoiler or an exploit so stop reading this one if you haven't played yet. The timing of Mama coming after you when you're either making too much noise or Tattletail never shutting up. whenever i make too much noise with my flashlight or running steps, she can find me like im ringing a dinner bell. But strangly enough, i had Tattletail running out of power (sounds like this fish low on batteries https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHchmWsrfUo ), but Mama was coming at me as if she was either very lazy or switched to moving in a wheel chair.\n\n3rd, im not sure if this is a glitch but something i've noticed. One day i had Mama killing me over and over because i was playing hide and seek with a Tattletale, but i respawn to the last time i spoke with that Tattletail. however, near the end of the game, i had to do a long list of tasks, but when Mama kills me, i had to start al the tasks over on that day.\n\nIf i had to sum it all up, it is a great game... enough said.", "timestamp_created": 1485039211, "timestamp_updated": 1485039211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29409176": {"recommendationid": "29409176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079380993", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485466245}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0434\u044e\u0448\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430!\n\u041f\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0433\u0438\u0440\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0434\u044b - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e!!!\n\u0412\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0441\u044c! \n\u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0446 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e. \n\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435 12 \u0438\u0437 10.", "timestamp_created": 1485038978, "timestamp_updated": 1485038978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29405306": {"recommendationid": "29405306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034811845", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494520612}, "language": "english", "review": "Tattletail is one of the newer attemptsof a horror game that mixes aspects from both the Slenderman games and the Five Nights at Freddy's games but instead with a rampaging Furby-inspired creature.

The game is completly free roam for the players discression and even has a basement which plays a very important part near the end of the game. The difficulty that comes with this game is trying to avoid mama, and trying to avoid mama with Tattletail non-stop saying adorable and annoying qoutes. (seriously i want one of these in real life, i dont care if it would move around even if it didnt have batteries in it I WANT ONE SO BADLY!) During night 2 of TattleTail the player gets a flashlight that can only work when it is fully recharged and shaken up. You must avoid making any noise when mama is around because if you do...well lets just hope you dont mind missing a good chunch of your face.\n\nAll and all, 12/10 on this game. i really loved it, plus it has an amazing replayability that i actually played it SEVEN TIMES trying to get all the friggen eggs, and i loved every second of it ^W^ i would LOVE a sequel for this game, all though im not sure if scott cawthon would be ok with that. if not a sequel, than some merchandise.

That same person and I had an experience with an evil Furby when we were kids. This Furby was creepy as hell. This was right when Furbys blew up in the US.  No one knew how evil they were yet. This thing would randomly start talking, asking for food and moving around by itself. One night, during a sleepover around the holiday season, this Furby decided to wake us up by perching itself on top of a bookshelf (no idea how the hell it got there) and screaming about how much it loved us. That is when we knew... Our Furby was possessed.\n\nLong story short. I sold it on eBay a few years later as a \"demonically possessed Furby\". Made 50 bucks and never saw it again.\n\nSo this game really hit close to home for me. The biggest difference between this game and my life was that \n1. Our Furby never reproduced on its own.                                                                                                      \n2. We went out of our way to not interact with it.                                                                                       \n3. It did not have a mother (that we knew of).\n\nHonestly this game was fun. It was creepy at first but it does wear off. There is not really an effective \"jump scare\" game but the ambiance and mood is what makes this creepy. \n\nGameplay- 4/5 It's not very hard to play and the controls are simple. Could be better but for what it is, not bad.\n\nSound- 5/5 This is where the game shines. The sound effects are good. The \"tattletail\" its mother the cassette audio playing . Very creepy stuff. \n\nGraphics- 4/5 Not bad for a Unity game. First person 3d. Reminds me of a slightly more modern Source game. The effects could be better but for what the game costs and what it is, it's good.\n\nOverall- 4/5. For what it costs, the amount you'll make back on trading cards (Jan 2017) and the game itself, this was fun. It's not very long. You can figure it out and beat it pretty fast. What I liked at first was the ambiance and the 'chill' effect. It does not really give you a lot of info to start out with, but keeps adding reasons to do or NOT to do certain things. On the contrary though, it tries to be a puzzle game at certain points and fails at this because it gives you the player too little info to solve it (at least at first)\n\nOne of my favorite aspects was the mother trying to kill you, not because the jump scare was good (it wasn't BTW) but because it was fun to hide from it. You had to strategies to ensure your survival. There is a flashlight, a hunger meter,groom meter and battery meter that all need to be maintained as well as the ability to move around without making noise. \n\nMy least favorite was the repetitiveness of it. Even when adding new challenges, the effect wore off and stopped being creepy and started playing like any other game. Once you figured out how to avoid the mother or when the 'spooky' factor wore off, the game dulls quickly. Another issue is that during the first nights, you aren't punished for anything. The items you \"have to do\" have no negative effect on the game if you don't do them. You just can't progress. The game is trying to introduce you to the mechanics but honestly it wastes time doing it. It could just give you a walkthrough tutorial and then give you more game to play.\n\nIt's only $5 so I still feel that's worth it, even if you only get an hour out if it.

Tattletail is a game built around atmosphere and nostalgia. It offer's a wide assortment of different mini-games for each night instead of keeping to a formula like a certain game involving killer animatronics. Which was what I was personally expecting Tattletail to be like due to that franchises popularity. Let's say I was pleasantly surprised. The VHS aesthetic is VERY creepy and adds a lot to the horror factor. The voice acting is fantastic and lets you grow close to your Furby friend whenever he's not getting you in trouble. But with every great thing, there are always flaws. Let's start with the obvious one; the clunky controls. My main issue with it is the mouse sensitivity. While the newest \"The Gift\" Update has improved upon the problem, a 4 on the sensitivity scale still feels like a 10. For example, while playing on default mouse sensitivity whenever I simply tapped my mouse, the main character did a 360. This next one is more of a personal con. I think that Tattletails individual needs bars go down to fast. Most times whenever I was trying to hide from Mama Tattletail, presumably away from the places that'll restore one of Tattletail's needs, one of the furry little s*@#'s needs will drop to zero which will trigger him to start making a lot of noise that'll attract Mama quickly. For this one, I have some simple resolutions that I'm sure not only I want. Maybe if there were more places to restore Tattletail's needs, it'll make it just a tad bit easier not to be caught. Or, obviously, just lowering the digression speed of Tattletail's needs. That being said, I really love this game and I want to see it blossom but I fear it'll be looked down upon do to these issues.

[/i] [/b]\n\nConsidering this review is getting voted down, I'm pretty curious what people enjoyed about the game. Let's forget the annoying characters, the only mechanics in the game are fetch this, avoid Mama, and keep Tattletail fed, brushed, and charged. The problem is, none of these are fun. Mama is annoying and extremely easy to avoid as long as RNG doesn't decide to screw you over, the fetch quests are very repetetive, and the survival mechanic is basically nothing but a chore.

I appreciate that it isn't the jumpscare that gets to me but rather the buildup to it.  As a soon-to-be 30 year old, I got a nice bit of nostalgia from this game and I love the aesthetic and overall design of the environment and faux Tattletail commercial.  \n\nThe game mechanics are fun and add to the tension because you're given tasks to perform but you still have to keep track of Tattletail's needs.  He must be groomed, fed, and charged every so often and if you fail to keep up with that...well...you'll see.  \n\nThe game seems rather short but it's fun for a quick horror romp and something different from the usual horror fare around here.  The price point is perfect for this becuase I can tell the developer put in a lot of work and care but they also realize the content and length play a large factor as far as what the charge customers.  \n\nCheck out my somewhat vulger playthrough of the first few nights of Tattletail!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838075428", "timestamp_created": 1483901013, "timestamp_updated": 1483901309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29120762": {"recommendationid": "29120762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348180414", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483873054}, "language": "german", "review": "Tattletail ein sehr cooles spiel gute atmusph\u00e4re aber der Jumpscare hat mich nur einmal erwischt uns war am anfang aber 5 euro lohnen sich sehr wie gesagt sehr tolles spiel.", "timestamp_created": 1483894430, "timestamp_updated": 1483894430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29120559": {"recommendationid": "29120559", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993302934", "num_games_owned": 1114, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494685967}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're a product of the 80s or 90s, you'll almost certainly remember when Furby hit the market and the mass hysteria that every kid and their dog had in wanting to own one.

The cold sweat dripping slowly down the sides of your temples, as you hid under your blanket thinking that as long as you couldn't see Furby, Furby couldn't see you. Yeah. You know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. Don't you?\n\nTattletail is basically this traumatic period of your childhood life, recreated in game form.

As soon as I saw this game I had to play it. Growing up with a Furby the game's concept really stood out to me. In a world of FNaF games where Anamatronics are always the big threat coming to kill you...being a kid running from a deadly toy screamed \"CHILDHOOD MEMORIES!\" I felt it was a great concept for a horror game. Onto how it handles, the audio is done well, the music stings kept me on edge the entirety of the first level, and the atmosphere is all there. For a $5 game, I felt it was totally worth the money.\n\nI'm only on the third night, and so far I haven't felt like gimmicky scares are everywhere which is what I was afraid of. I don't know if it was just me, but I survived the first and second night no problem...which is good. With FNaF (yeah, going to keep comparing the two even though they aren't alike at all) you get killed for reasons you don't understand. I'm very happy to announce at the moment I haven't experienced death for the sake of random death. The game is actively teaching me mechanics while keeping me on edge. If you'd like to see how the game runs, how the game sounds, and how the game plays, here is my experience for the first two nights. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ev1DQC_dVCE I believe Night 3 is where stuff is going to really start cooking and I can't wait to play some more.", "timestamp_created": 1483546871, "timestamp_updated": 1483546871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29005117": {"recommendationid": "29005117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127826780", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483531171}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game, quick and easy to play unlike some of the more unforgiving fnaf games.

It's got a great trailer and a fun concept which the game itself doesn't deliver on. The gameplay boils down to Slender meets FNAF without the polish or novelty of either of the two things.

Checkpointing is frequent enough until the final night, but honestly I was more stressed trying to find all the eggs than by any of the objectives in the game, and it took me about 90 minutes to finish the game with all the eggs collected (still missing 2 cheevos but pretty well completed).\n\nIn smaller details, the house is unfinished with walls that don't properly connect to other walls, the lighting is weird and objects seem to have a lot of lighting underneath them even in total darkness, and sound is the same through floors and walls.\n\nThe hardest part here is saying what I would do differently.  I think the main issue is that I don't know why I'm carrying the Tattletail doll around my house at night other than that's what I need to do to progress the plot.  The game has given me no real reason to be invested up.  The final act was kinda cool but it came out of nowhere and I feel like it could have done with some leadup.

So far, it's an incredibly charming, well-made game. The gameplay loop is incredibly fun, and genuinely scary. It's definitely a game that really shines when you make a point to play it late at night, with all the lights off. Sure, there are jump scares in there, but for me it'd be totally wrong to dismiss this game as relying on cheap scares in order to punish you. There's a lot more nuance and soul to the game. You can really tell that it's creator has poured a lot of love into it.\n\nThe overall aesthetic and feel of the game, I expect will be incredibly polarising. I really liked Tattletail's unique style, and I think they got the distorted/lofi/VHS glitch thing down perfectly. People who like this sort of thing, generally love it.

The only knowledge of the story you're given is a kid who opens his Christmas gift five days before Christmas. The kid was greeted with a eerie Tattletail toy.\n\n[b][Origin][/b]\nFor those of you who don't know what a [i]Tattletail[/i] is, a Tattletail was the first version of what we now know as [i]Furbies[/i]. However, these were invented in the 1990's. A very unique product for its time being as well. This game was inspired by the types of fears people obtained from these robo-pets.\n\n[b][Personal Experience][/b]\nI never grew up with a Furby myself, nor one of the early versions. I didn't have any fears derive from these cute, little things. I may be 14 but regardless, childhood fears can leave long-lasting mental scars for god knows how long.\n\n[i]Now I'm no video game critic or anything, and I don't really know what all it takes to make a horror game a horror game. I don't know how to dissect a horror game very well, but I'm sure I don't need to. In my opinion, the game is scary. That's that.[/i]\n\n[b][Gameplay][/b]\nI watched gameplay of the completion of the first two levels from [i][url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx8vbgWs666cAS7wsKos5sA]8-BitRyan[/url][/i]. I didn't know it was a Steam game until I saw he received a Steam achievement mid-game. That's when I stopped the video to find out more about it on the Steam store page!\nEven though I watched levels 1 and 2 be completed thoroughly, I was still scared straight. The ambience, the atmosphere, everything was spot on! In retrospect, this game keeps you on edge for its entirety. I was paranoid to pick up the mouse again after I had gotten a game over, but I knew I could beat it.\n\n[b][Pros][/b]\n- A true trip down memory lane\n- Very nice horror feel\n- Very offputting background music\n- Smart AI\n- Short and sweet\n\n[b][Cons][/b]\n- Jumpscares could be better\n- When you get a game over on certain levels, you go all the way back to the beginning unlike other levels with checkpoints after every task or so\n\n[b][Rating][/b]\nI'm a wuss when it comes to horror games, but this one was too good to pass up!

The video quality for the Tattletails\u2122 commercial was absolutely spot on and took me right back to my childhood watching commercials for furbies and Poo-chis. Even the way the in-game environment was modeled reminded me of old 90s computer games as well. \n[*] The soundtrack did a great job of making the environment intense and uncomfortable.\n[*] The mechanic of needing to feed/groom/charge the tattletail while trying to complete each task definitely heightened the anxiety.\n[*] The voice acting for both the Tattletails and Mama felt fitting and not forced at all. (As a side note I personally never felt annoyed at my Tattletail- He was too cute!}\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n[list]\n[*] There is no pause button or in game menu. While the game sometimes lets you restart from certain points after death, it still bothers me that I\u2019d just have to let myself die over and over while I went to the bathroom and not just pause the game. Also- If you\u2019re in the middle of a challenge and need to quit, when you return it\u2019ll start you over at the beginning of that challenge. While I understand it\u2019s a fairly short game, I still wish saving and pausing could be an option.\n[*] I had issue with extreme mouse sensitivity and had to crank my setting down to 1 in order for things to be more play-able. (It could be my computer, but I guess it\u2019s still something to take note if you have a lower end computer.)\n[*] There is only one animation for the jump scares. This could be me nit-picking, but the surprise and shock wore off quickly because it was the same 10 second clip everytime. I feel like a variety of different animations could keep things fresh.\n[*] I will try to stay as vague as possible with this but I will still set it as a spoiler in case people want to stay totally in the dark: [spoiler] The big turning point in the game was an extreme adrenaline rush and honestly came at a surprise. However, none of this is paid off well. For me personally, at this point, the game is at its peak, and then it ends in the most unsatisfying way, and all feels wasted. The same ending and message could have been conveyed in much better ways- But instead, we get the same thing we\u2019ve gotten all through out the game, which makes us feel cheated and disappointed. [/spoiler]\n[*] That being said another problem I felt this game had was [spoiler] lack of bits and pieces of lore sprinkled in. We see the dead body on the commercial, but it is never expanded upon. We have the ability to knock on our mother\u2019s door, but she never answers. Why do we have the ability to do that if she never comes out? Is our mom not home? Is she hurt? Or Is it just another excuse to make noise? I feel like if there were hints or symbols that answered these questions, the game would feel much more cohesive (That being said I have not gotten all the achievements, so there may be some information I\u2019m missing. When I get everything I\u2019ll come back and confirm/deny this statement.)\n\nI feel like if these details were added this game would blow up and become really popular to be honest. I just feel like there needs to be /more/. DLC, a sequel, something\u2026 [/spoiler]\n\nCons/Complaints aside I really enjoyed playing this game and definitely think it\u2019s worth the money and time!!

This game is not very good or memorable for that matter.  Given the fact its a Unity game and you expect the worst of the worst from most Unity game would come into play.  Suprisingly, I don't see a whole lot of overused assets from most Unity games has been put into play, but that up to you to decide.  Either way this game is extremely short like 50 minutes long.  For $5 it seems fitting but I was thinking this would be a dollar or $2 game...  \n\nTattletail is a basic survival horror game with gameplay elements from Slender but with a furby wannabe that demands to be taken care of.  That right you need to make sure Tattletail is fully charged, feed and brushed at all times.  Otherwise, you'll die. Because in certain nights a monster will hunt you down and kill you, either you get too close or look at it for too long.  Instead of collecting pages from Slender, you get different objectives for each 5 nights of Christmas in order to progress the bare-minimum story its telling.  There's not much of a story to tell for this game, since the lore is kinda non existent and the outcome of the game finale is pretty laughable at best and overall predictable.  In fact, I had a good laugh at how bad this game gets, but once the artificial difficulty comes in, I get disappointed.  Good thing there's checkpoints utterwise this would've been a torture to play through.  You also have to be aware of the sound you make if you sprint or shake that glowing flashlight.  Which the monster can shut off your flashlight instantly if seen.  Keep in mind, the Tattletail will make so much noise that you have to make sure he is calmed so you don't get killed a lot, which it will happen if you fail to take care of the Tattletail.  This is why he must be feed, brushed, recharged at all times in order to keep him happy and hopefully staying alive throughout this rather mediocre game.  Some aspect of the game are kinda immersion breaking like why does a toy need to eat?  Unless it all just in the kid head or something...  And why does the kid jump so good?  Unless he was secretly trained by Mario himself (Jumping pretty useless in this game btw).

After playing for about an hour, I can truly say it is very entertaining & keeps me interested in seeing the end result!\nThe Sound is what makes this game scary & is done very well. The jumpscares aren't bad, but if you like creepy atmosphere's & great sound in horror games, you surely will not be dissapointed!\n        \n\n The Cons to this game are that maybe the \"alert ringing\" when Tattletail is scared or hungry can be quite piercing, so if you are wearing headphones, you may need to turn the sound down a little. The other con would be the jumpscare. It could use a quicker animation with some other screen filters that can elevate the dread the rest of the atmosphere already provides. \n\nAll in all, cool & very entertaining while also being super affordable.

Conforme se passa o tempo, o game vai levantando mais perguntas e fechando a atmosfera j\u00e1 pequena, deixando ainda mais dificil evadir do inimigo. \n\nAl\u00e9m de andar por a\u00ed e coletar coisas, voc\u00ea vai usar uma lanterna que s\u00f3 liga se voc\u00ea ficar balan\u00e7ando como se fosse um chocalho, alertando sua posi\u00e7\u00e3o. Ela tamb\u00e9m ir\u00e1 desligar caso voc\u00ea se defronte com o inimigo no escuro, ent\u00e3o use com sabedoria.\n\nNo final do dia, Tattletail \u00e9 um jogo muito mais \"OK\" do que bom. Espere para peg\u00e1-lo em alguma promo\u00e7\u00e3o para tirar o maior proveito poss\u00edvel. \n", "timestamp_created": 1483115435, "timestamp_updated": 1483115435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28832062": {"recommendationid": "28832062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195466895", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494631074}, "language": "english", "review": "You need to check out this game!

As a game, Tattletail was an enjoyable hour and a half long experience. If you're looking for a lighter less frustrating version of a Five Nights at Freddy's type game with 3D exploration, creepy stry, memorable moments, and no camera system, you've found your outlet. I've certainly spent more $ on worse uses of my time, and wouldn't look back on this particular purchase. Overall I'd give it a 9/10 for what it is: An Indie Horror on a budget with a 1.5 hour playtime. Was I entertained for that 1.5 hours? You betcha!\n\nFull playthrough VoD here:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/skullstream/v/110883955\n\nSome things about the game:\nThe physical area that the game allows you to traverse is small, allowing you to gain familiarity with the house. This is good, since you'll need to remember where things are so that you may recharge, groom, and feed your Tattletail at short notice. At no point did I feel lost, or turned around when playing through the game, which lead to fairly linear progression with a few tough areas but not many. Short takeaway is that the repetitive sections are kept to a minimum.\n\nThat does not mean the game does not have its hidden challenges or tense moments mind you as the final couple of nights can be a little jarring.

My sister doesn't find this kind of thing scary but I, personally, am a pansy and was tense the entire time. Fear is subjective. The game's not horribly broken, it's not hideous, and it has original thoughts in its head, and sometimes that's all you can ask.\n\nThat said, it ain't perfect. Spoilers below probably?\n\nThere are some pacing problems to the game over all. When the game is teaching you about itself, you're not really in any danger to speak of. Multiple nights go by without the possibility of a failstate. There are clearly delineated sections where you can't die. In some cases, this is a good thing. It gives you an intermission and a moment to breathe, and it's not like Five Nights where you constantly feel like you're on the verge of a heart attack. \n\nHowever, I feel like it ramps up from this into its final challenge way too fast. If you're a chickenshit like me and not stopping to figure out how the monster's systems work (and why would you, you're supposed to avoid it), you're hosed. It's a ninety degree brick wall of a difficulty spike. Furthermore, the final level drops most of the systems the game had been working with (that is, you don't carry Tattletail around) and becomes much more Slender-esque, a challenge of finding a series of objects in an enclosed space with the monster constantly teleporting around you. And then you die. You die a lot. And then you see the jumpscare game over screen. A lot. And then gradually the horror wears off as you feel your way around for a strategy to find those damn candles and shut up those Furby knock-offs and their \"no more Mama\", creeping around in the basement with your flashlight off and hoping shaking it on again won't summon the beast. It's more slog than fun, because the candle placement is randomized, too. The last level is a pretty big let down, but the Tattletails in their little Satanic circle like we'd always joked about in elementary school kept me playing because I was honestly kind of intrigued to see what would happen next. That's the power of a good concept. \n\nHaving a jumpscare stinger ending is really cheap though. Come on, guys, really?\n\nI can't say I regretted the two hours I spent playing through it in exchange for my five dollars and I hope this concept can be improved upon. It's certainly unique, which is what drew me to the game in the first place. But I don't think calling it \"storydriven\" is totally accurate and the constantly escalating stinger ambiance music wears thin after awhile, though where sound design is concerned I will applaud the devs for not using a horrible screaming noise every single time you die. It's charming enough and it will probably rekindle my deepseated childhood fear of basements.

It's a very effective starting place that steadily spirals into chaotic horror as you progress.\n\nThe gameplay, like the best in the horror genre, forces you to do the very things you don't want to do, in order to survive. Shaking the flashlight gives you light, which you want, but makes noise, which you really don't want. Figuring out the patterns of the danger that you face can sometimes feel like a bit of a trial & error process, but learning how to survive, when to run, when to hide, when to perform a necessary action, is part of the fun and the challenge.\n\nThe climactic scene, which I wouldn't dream of spoiling, is a lovely combination of all of what makes the game quite special. Indie horror games can sometimes feel cheap, but this one feels rich. Tattletail is satisfying, like a good short-story is satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1482952664, "timestamp_updated": 1482952858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665313", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1167, "total_negative": 143, "total_reviews": 1310}}

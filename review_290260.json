I disagree.  If you really, really like Sokobon-type puzzles and would like to see a chemistry twist to those, then the 144 levels in this game (124 regular and 20 bonus) should keep you going for a while.  But, I had issues with it ranging from my own mistaken desires on up (or down, as the case may be).  From least important to more important:\n\n- This one's my own fault.  When I bought this, I figured it would be more of a way to see how molecules got built within a game framework.  Instead, it's a Sokobon-type game using clumps of atoms as the \"blocks\" that you move around until you get the final molecule.  \"Sokobon\" as most of the name ought to have clued me in.  So, just disregard this one.\n\n- The interface is keyboard only.  It would be a lot easier on the wrists if we could use the mouse to move things around.\n\n- The progression through the game is indicated by the filling in of a periodic table.  For whatever reason, the periodic table used appears to be wrong.  Even taking into consideration the developer's desire for contiguous pieces in that table, their version still appears to contain four extra elements.  Sort of odd in a game based around chemistry.\n\n- There's no \"proper\" progression through the puzzles.  I'd have thought the puzzles would start with the simplest molecules (restricted to the organic set of Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen (they throw in Helium, but it appears to be a type of mobile blocker to the puzzle since it doesn't bond with anything) and work up from there.  Instead, there's only a fairly general increase in molecular complexity.  Similarly, it's fairly open which order you proceed through that periodic table of puzzles.  So, at any given moment you might be working with different atoms, different complexity, and different game mechanisms to build things.\n\n- I'd expected more of an educational bent to the game:  show us the molecule, explain what it does and what bonds the atoms use, and, perhaps, talk about the geometry and how it's built in reality.  Instead, we're presented with a puzzle space containing some atoms, we move them around in such a way that they'll fit through the blocks, and when you get everything stuck together, you're presented with a blurb about the molecule.  The atoms stick together based on their valence electrons and there's some work with single, double, and triple bonds.  But, none of that is ever explained.\n\n- The above is also a problem because unless you know enough chemistry to know what the end product will be (there are 40 molecules used in the game) when shown a list of atoms, you really don't know what you're trying to build.\n\nSo, as I said above, even ignoring my mistaken pre-purchase impression of what the game was, I'm not recommending it.", "timestamp_created": 1513636623, "timestamp_updated": 1513636623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38338871": {"recommendationid": "38338871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048976431", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514987246}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic puzzle game, one of the best I've played.

It is simple, it is hard and it is good fun if you're into challenges.\n\nThe game is controlled via keyboard only, even in the main menu, which may seem odd at first. It's probably part of a certain old-school aesthetic and will become second nature to you after a few minutes. The ruleset is surprisingly simple: There are circles with open docking ports in a confined space. You are one of them. Move and push circles around until all docking ports are filled, creating larger structures of circles.\n\nThe natural beauty is that this simple, incredibly logical ruleset is based on how chemistry works in real life. In chemical terms: You are an atom and move other atoms around until all atoms have their outer electron shells filled via molecular bonding. Chemistry knowledge is not required to beat the game, but it certainly helps, giving you an intuitive idea of what your target molecule will be. After creating it the game will reward you with interesting chemical factoids and more levels.\n\nI really enjoyed the streamlined minimalist design and the non-existent load times. The game is technically rock solid and never caused any problems. It's fascinating to see how long a very basic mechanic can be kept interesting with good level design. I wasn't a fan of this kind of puzzle and honestly pretty bad at it, but I gradually got better and started enjoying the game more. There are 124 basic levels followed by 20 very very hard bonus levels. Of the 15 hours I played, I spent about half on these last levels, sometimes coming back to the same level across several days to try out new ideas. Thankfully the game is very forgiving, having no time limits and allowing infinite undos and resets, so you can experiment to your heart's content.\n\nAmong my gripes is that the progression is pretty bumpy. The difficulty of any basic level seemed utterly random. The game gradually introduces more mechanics (double bonds, noble gasses as spacers, bond breaking, etc.) and I would have liked a little more control over that. Some mechanics I really enjoyed and would have liked more of, but there may only be a hand-full of levels. Sadly there's also no endless mode or level generator, which would have been a great addition, especially to get some more relaxing, easy levels.\n\nBeating the last levels felt really really good, but there was some frustration and annoyance here and there through-out the game due to the high difficulty and due to being forced to play levels/mechanics I didn't enjoy.

Typical of his style, Sokobond employs simple, self-explanatory mechanics in a series of small, self-contained puzzles which nevertheless manage to be frustratingly challenging.\n\nThe difficulty builds up naturally -- each new mechanic is introduced on its own, first with simple levels to give you an idea of the basic tricks, and then with harder levels. Then, the different mechanics are brought together in later puzzles. Stopping to think logically through the situation is a must; if you don't, you get stuck trying things that don't work over and over, and many levels seem impossible.\n\nThe chemistry theme is well done, supported by random chemistry facts after each level. The graphics are smooth and aesthetically pleasing. The overall atmosphere is relaxing and minimalist.\n\nOne drawback is that there are some levels where repeated guesswork leads to the solution. When I beat these levels, I had no idea what I did or what the key to solving them was. I realize that guessing is not the smartest way to play a difficult puzzle game, but I am sure many players will guess anyway. Another minor drawback is that bonding order is unclear -- if you push a molecule next to two things it could bond with, which bonds first? This ends up being relevant in several puzzles, but there is no explanation so you just have to try and see what happens.\n\n[i]Update:[/i] It took 15 hours to finish the game including all the bonus levels.

If you are looking for a game that does not cost you a fortune, is fun to play and even educates you every now and then, look no further.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1492164605, "timestamp_updated": 1492164605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503505", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30736497": {"recommendationid": "30736497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167422020", "num_games_owned": 1100, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500317442}, "language": "french", "review": "qwerty seulement appuyer sur la touche windows +espace pour certain(ne)", "timestamp_created": 1490476259, "timestamp_updated": 1490476259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30682903": {"recommendationid": "30682903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283078000", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490168511}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u4e86\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4f1a\u540e\u6094\u5f53\u521d\u6ca1\u6709\u597d\u597d\u5b66\u5316\u5b66\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1490264324, "timestamp_updated": 1490264324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30666672": {"recommendationid": "30666672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365675512", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490180817}, "language": "english", "review": "sokoband\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u73a9\u5ea6\n\u96be\u5ea6\u6bd4\u63a8\u7bb1\u5b50\u9ad8\u4e0d\u6b62\u4e00\u70b9\n\u540e\u671f\u5e38\u5361\u5173\n\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u73a9\u901a20%\n\u8fd8\u6709 \u8c01\u80fd\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u9ec4\u56fefactory\u600e\u4e48\u8fc7\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01= =", "timestamp_created": 1490180784, "timestamp_updated": 1490180784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30331914": {"recommendationid": "30331914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112421246", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491591573}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sokobond me encanta, porque lo que al principio parec\u00eda una tarea f\u00e1cil acab\u00f3 siendo un reto que parec\u00eda imposible.

Jedoch werden hier anstatt Kisten Atome beziehungsweise Radikale umhergeschoben. Ziel ist es, am Ende ein Molek\u00fcl zu erschaffen, dass keine ungepaarten Valenzelektronen mehr hat. Das mag jetzt erstmal kompliziert klingen, ist es aber (zumindest prinzipiell) nicht. In jedem Level \u00fcbernimmt man die Kontrolle \u00fcber ein Atom und geht Bindungen mit anderen Atomen ein, indem man sie ber\u00fchrt (oder im Falle von Helium indem man sie in die N\u00e4he von anderen Atomen schiebt), und zwar solange, bis jedes Elektron jedes Atoms (dargestellt durch einen kleinen Kreis am Rand des Atoms) eine Bindung eingegangen ist. In den ersten Leveln geht das noch recht direkt vonstatten, aber sp\u00e4ter kommen noch andere Spielmechaniken hinzu, wie Doppel- und Mehrfachbindungen, oder die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Ausrichtung der Atome zu ver\u00e4ndern.\nJede dieser Spielmechaniken wird im ersten R\u00e4tsel, in dem sie vorkommt, erkl\u00e4rt. Somit wird auch jemand, der keine Anung von Chemie hat, schnell verstehen, was zu tun ist.\n\nAuch die Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che ist stark am Thema Chemie orientiert. Die Level werden zum Beispiel \u00fcber eine Art Periodensystem ausgew\u00e4hlt, welches selbst auch in Untergruppen unterteilt ist. In diesen farblich gekennzeichneten Untergruppen werden die Level zusammengefasst, die \u00e4hnliche Spielmechaniken beinhalten (wie zum Beispiel das Erschaffen und Aufspalten von Mehrfachbindungen). Diesem Designelement ist es zu verdanken, dass mit dem L\u00f6sen eines Levels mehrere neue Level freigeschaltet werden. So kann man sich, falls einem ein R\u00e4tsel mal zu schwer ist (was mehrmals der Fall sein wird), erstmal an einem anderen probieren.\n\nDas Spiel pr\u00e4sentiert sich in minimalistischer Optik (man sehe sich die Screenshots auf der Shopseite an), die das Wesentliche auf den Punkt bringt, und nicht vom Spiel selbst ablenkt. Untermalt wird das Ganze von entspannenden ambienten Kl\u00e4ngen. Somit kann man sich voll und ganz auf die R\u00e4tsel konzentrieren und sich sch\u00f6n den Kopf zerbrechen.\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nIdeal zum Entspannen geeignet.\nWer gerne R\u00e4tselspiele spielt, und der Chemie nicht vollends abgeneigt ist, wird mit [i]Sokobond[/i] f\u00fcr ein paar Stunden seinen Spa\u00df haben.", "timestamp_created": 1485706458, "timestamp_updated": 1510593817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29444252": {"recommendationid": "29444252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021881765", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507116796}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't finish this game yet but I love the design so far!

As it turns out, Sokobond is made from more palatable material, and Zach's quote is made from hyperbole. This is not a criticism, mind you - when you have 124 puzzles in your game, you don't want inordinately difficult roadblocks impeding access to the rest of them. Progression is handled by way of a grid in which each puzzle is represented by a square and successfully completing it unlocks adjacent squares. The challenge curves out nicely, and if there was one puzzle I had grown tired of there were usually at least a half dozen others I could divert myself to.\n\nThe trailer shows you pretty much everything you need to know about the game mechanics. In every puzzle you take control of a single molecule which has a certain number of bonds it can make - anywhere from 1 to 4 - and will automatically bond with any molecule it comes into contact with, provided that that molecule also has spare bonds available. If it doesn't, then you are able to push that molecule elsewhere in the level. At fixed points in the environment are spaces which will separate bonded molecules, increase the strength of molecules' bonds (i.e. if 2 molecules are bonded, and each have another bond spare, running them through such a space will remove the spares by giving them a double bond), and reorientate the molecules' positions. That's it. It's essentially a block-pushing game with a novel twist.\n\nThe goal is to connect all of the provided molecules in such a way that there are no remaining bonds. In some levels the challenge lies in working out in what order and in what arrangement a small number of molecules need to be collected and placed to use all their bonds, while in others the challenge lies in piloting a huge snaking line of molecules around a very limited space, making sure that certain parts of its body never touch others in order to avoid undesired bonds. Some levels even see you take control of helium, which has 0 bonds available, meaning that you can only create the end product indirectly, via environmental manipulation. Though, as other reviewers have pointed out, the chemicals you will be making are frequently the same, the way in which you make them is always fresh and different - no small feat, given the amount of content on offer.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Sokobond and would recommend it to anyone looking for an intermediate level of challenge. It's certainly not even in the same universe of hellish difficulty as Zachtronics games. It's not the most amazing or memorable puzzle game I've ever played, but it is thoughtful and well designed.\n\nOverall score: 3.5/5\n\nAs a footnote, I'd like to say that I did not enjoy the bonus levels unlocked upon completion of the other 124, however as they are presented in the context of a bonus this did not affect my opinion of the game one way or the other. I will talk about them anyway, because they serve to illustrate the difference in 'feel' regarding the sort of puzzles I enjoy, which is useful info if you share similar preferences. The bonus levels adhere to the 'needle in a haystack' school of puzzle design, in which there is only one route to the solution and a single misstep will render the puzzle unsolvable, however this will not be apparent until several steps further down the line, leaving you to wonder which of the many previous moves you have made was the wrong one. With a few exceptions, the main game's puzzles allow you enough leeway to experiment and come upon an 'a-ha!' moment organically, and if it has become unsolvable this will be immediately apparent. The latter feels as if I'm slowly being guided to a solution via process of elimination, while the former gives no feedback whatsoever, making it more frustrating than fun.

It's a fairly simple puzzle that tends to have overwhelmingly convoluted solutions. You control a person in a warehouse, and your job is to put all the boxes away into designated places. They are heavy, so you can only move them by pushing them around. You can't move through boxes, and you can't push a box if there's a wall or another box behind it. Simple rules, incredibly complex solutions.\n\nSokobond takes this premise and adds chemistry to the mix. You control an atom, and your goal is to get all the valence electrons in all the atoms to bond. For example, you might control a Hydrogen, and another Hydrogen and an Oxygen are somewhere. Your goal would therefore be to bond both Hydrogens to the Oxygen to make water. Or mayble you'll control a carbon amidst another carbon and six hydrogens to make ethane.\n\nJust like Sokoban, in Sokobond, you have a maximum of four options available to you at any time: move up, move down, move left, or move right. Just like Sokoban, if you try to move into an atom, you'll push it. Unlike Sokoban, if two atoms with free valence electrons become adjacent, they will bond, and bonded atoms will move as a group.\n\nLater, you'll be introduced to three more puzzle elements: debonders which remove a bond you made, rebonders which add another bond to a pair of atoms (allowing for molecules like ethene or acetic acid), and rotators, which let you rotate bonds.\n\nJust like Sokoban, Sokobond has a simple premise, but loads of depth, and all those extra-convoluted solutions.", "timestamp_created": 1441298572, "timestamp_updated": 1441298572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17674499": {"recommendationid": "17674499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072065628", "num_games_owned": 7082, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421862142}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ee5\u5143\u7d20\u5468\u671f\u8868\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ca\u667a\u6e38\u620f\n\u5b9e\u9645\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\u5316\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\n\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5173\u901a\u5173\u540e\uff0c\u4f1a\u8df3\u51fa\u4e0e\u6b64\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\n\u867d\u7136\u662f\u4e2a\u5c0f\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u51fa\u4f5c\u8005\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u7528\u5fc3", "timestamp_created": 1440322617, "timestamp_updated": 1440322617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17526757": {"recommendationid": "17526757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056871845", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505945498}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game, smart and beautifully executed.", "timestamp_created": 1439504822, "timestamp_updated": 1439504822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17370818": {"recommendationid": "17370818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040699408", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439145329}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044b \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432?

You can infinitely undo any number of actions, so if you get into an unsolvable scenario you don't have to start over, just undo the last X steps until you can try something else.\n\nThe mechanics that let you rotate a bond, make more bonds and split bonds are well executed, and they often get in your way just as much as they help you complete the puzzle, which makes you have to figure out just the right set of moves to execute.\n\nI resorted to a guide for a couple puzzles, as I had an idea of what I needed to make happen but I didn't know how to get there.

You start with a board with a finite amount of space, and a single piece (an ion) that you can move.  Move it next to another ion and the two will bond.  Bind all the free ions together to make some compound and you're done.  The thing is you can neither rotate your molecule, nor unbind ions, and the board is designed such that you have to be careful how you bind the first ions or you won't be able to get your molecule to bind with the last ions (the molecule'll be too fat to maneuver).  Sounds simple, and the early puzzles are, but they get harder.\n\nSuccessfully create a molecule, and you get a little blurb about what that compound is, and how it's used.  Chemistry ftw!\n\nYour progress through the puzzles is tracked on a grid with one puzzle per grid block.  Solve a puzzle and the adjoining puzzles become available.  You start in a red area with red puzzles.  Finishing the puzzles leading to an arrow opens up a new, differently colored grid section.  Sometimes the different colors offer new mechanics, sometimes they just offer harder puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are as good as they need to be.  The sound is adequate.  The background music is the ambient, puzzle-game sort (think World of Goo).  It's unobtrusive enough not to bother you while you're trying to figure your moves, but keeps you from listening to nothing.\n\nYou don't need any chemistry knowledge for this, but you'll certainly pick some up.  The amount of free electrons an ion has is indicated by floating circles slowly orbiting it.  This is the sort of thing that gets ingrained in a mind over time after moving nitride and oxide ions around for fun. \n\nThis game is cool for its elegant simplicity, and because chemistry, yay!", "timestamp_created": 1425676332, "timestamp_updated": 1425680526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14750094": {"recommendationid": "14750094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990036156", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 208, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426281728}, "language": "english", "review": "A good but overpriced game.

The staggering 144 levels will keep you busy for quite some time as it took me about 12 hours to beat. The puzzles themselves are easy enough for the average person to beat while not feeling silly doing so and difficult enough to challenge every mind. The basic premise is controlling one atom to move, bond, break, turn other atoms to complete a molecule - all within a set of boundary. The only letdown is atom variety as you'll only be seeing C, O, H, N and He which can and will get boring once you're close to completing the game.\n\nIt is worthy of mentioning that the game runs on Adobe Air and there have been reports coming from Linux users that it does not run on some occasions as Adobe has ceased linux support.\nAlthough the game would greatly benefit from Steam Workshop integration, the developer has stated he does not wish to implement such features in the foreseeable future - a shame as user created levels would keep the game and its community alive for longer.\n\nFor the fan of the puzzle genre, Sokobond will quench a thirst for simple 2D puzzlers.

You see not only are you trying to reunite, or combine the different objects in the level, but these objects are actual periodic elements, and you are putting them together to create different chemical compounds. All I have to say is who knew science could be so fun? You will be faced with level after level of differing elements and obstacles to overcome. If you successfully put all the elements together not only do you unlock additional levels, but you get to learn about the compound you just created.\n\nGraphically you are not going to see anything 3D, but in this puzzle game, the beauty of the simplicity of the graphics shows that this is definitely more about the elements. All the colors are varying subtle colors such as red, green, yellow, blue, etc. The levels are laid out in a grid base format where you will be trying to combine the elements by moving up, down, left, and right. The little added pieces to the game also come off as subtle, but are very recognizable after you use that functionality the first time. The pieces I'm talking about are the - and + which will take away bonds, or add bonds.\n\nThe music and sounds follow the same path as the art style. It is a soft sound that gets other sounds added in when you make a bond, or lose a bond.\n\nThe controls, as described before, are simply moving up, down, left, and right.\n\nSo here's a game that has no story, but has many rewards to be had. The rewards you gain are that you complete a level, open up other levels, and if you so choose you can learn something about the compound you just made. As the levels increase, the difficulty increases. There are many many levels to sink your teeth in, and for those parents out there you can not only educate your kids with this game, but you can secretly help out if you have a controller plugged in. The best part about this puzzle game is that the developers did not want to stop the chance for someone to learn about all the different compounds, so there is an option in the menu that allows you to unlock all the levels.\n\nI personally found this game a breath of fresh air, I did not have to worry about monster attacking, or having to watch certain statistics to make sure I could survive a level. I was able to play at my own pace, and hell I actually relearn some stuff that I had long forgotten about.

(Yes, I'm showing my age. Get off my lawn.) Sokobond takes it a step further by having you maneuver different atoms to form bonds and ultimately get a molecule form them all, with the exception of the helium atoms. The challenge lies in the space to move for each board, and in later levels, the placement of certain features, like bond splitters, bond enhancers, and rotators.

There seems to be alot of levels to play and as you complete each level you get to choose which puzzle you'd rather do next as it opens more than 1 up. You can of course go back and play the levels you left which will open up even more levels to do.\n\nSokobond is a beautifuly designed puzzle game with a fantastic soundtrack.

The gameplay is a block-pushing puzzler at it's very core, however with increased bonding, your molecule grows larger and thus movements gets restricted. This unique twist adds fresh flavour to the genre and without much knowledge in chemistry, you'll soon find a lot of intriguing fun facts thrown towards you for completing level after level. The game does grow very challenging later on, but only after you grew accustomed to the basic mechanics. Progression is well done.

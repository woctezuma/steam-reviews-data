Almost 30 hours in and I can't stop playing, game's so addictive I'm not even sure that's a positive feat. since is costing me hours of work.\n\nSome of the reason why this game keeps you playing:\n+ Levels are never the same since they are procedurally generated.\n+ Variety of ships to unlock and play, which can be upgraded as you advance through your gaming session\n+ Learning to get better at the game is so greatly balanced, intuitive enough to get you hooked enough, while offering you a gaming challenge at the same time\n+ There are both mini-bosses and Epic bosses, both fun to play against\n+ Both the music and the visuals are amazing. Terrific job from both departments\n\n The game is great to play either by yourself, or with a friend/sibling, specially since it forces you to play in a team by sharing the avialiable lives\n\nSome negatives:\n- I wish the devs would also add the option to pay for the music, I would love to have it on my playlist!\n- This is not really a negative, more an opinion, but i can't help to think this game would be awesome to play online with some friends!\n\nOverall, this is game is tons (and hours) of fun in a very \"simple\" (for lack of a better word) package.

Sei es ein Schwarzes Loch, oder ein dicker Laser oder gar Mini-Roboter welche deine Gegner zerfetzen wenn sie dir zu nahe kommen, alles gibt dir Vorteile und somit bestimmte Spielweisen. manche lassen sich sogar Kombinieren. Packe dir nen Omni-Laser rein und \"Nom\" und du kannst dich unverwundbar in irgendeinen starken Gegner stellen... deine Laser richten massiv schaden an und deine Roboter fressen sich durch die H\u00fclle.\n\nGut auffallend ist hier auch die Simple aber trotzdem sch\u00f6ne Grafik... durch das ganze leuchten gibt es den Eindruck es sei ein Professioneller Grafikdesigner gewesen, dabei sehen die Sprites ohne das leuchten so simpel aus. Auch wenn sich viele Projektile und Gegner \u00e4hneln haben sie alle etwas gemeinsam: Zusammen sehen sie nett aus.\n\nAls ein weiteren Positiven Aspekt den ich nennen kann ist der trotz den eigentlich wenigen Gegnern immer schwieriger wird, trotz dass es die selben sind.\n\nEin einziger Negativer Aspekt ist das man das Spiel 7 mal \"durchspielt\" und dann eigentlich alles hat und es macht dann kaum noch Spa\u00df... 20 Stunden sind drinnen, mehr basieren auf deine Lust und Laune.\n\nEin weiterer Erw\u00e4hnenswerter Fakt ist dass man das Spiel modden kann.

Personally I've managed to get +600 million score on Easy, but on Normal I've died before getting 1 million...\nSurprisingly enough my favorite ship is Lily, the only one which has no armor regeneration at start.\n\nKinda bad that the developers are not working on this project anymore, because there is at least one known bug here that can ruin your top score run.", "timestamp_created": 1454758961, "timestamp_updated": 1479997726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20924887": {"recommendationid": "20924887", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995051729", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453591989}, "language": "english", "review": "4/5 overall.  The game has some wonderful elements of gameplay.  We played it for lots of hours trying to unlock every ship.  Once every ship was unlocked...nothing left to do.  I was excited to get like 7th in the world on a 2 player game!  I played almost entirely 2 player, with my kids, so it aht regard it was fun for us.  Once you master dodging the heck out of things it gets more enjoyable.  So on the one hand, enjoyable and difficult and good for 2 player Co-op.  Highlight of the game is the Epic Bosses which are extemely well done graphically and mechanically.  My hat is off to the developers in that regard.\n\nThe rest of this review is the things I didn't like:\n\nThe game relies heavily on the three (or 4) randomly generated upgrades between levels.  Some games you hit all the right stuff each board and dominate, other games you get all the wrong stuff and die off in the fourth level-quickly.  In this way, the later boards seemed more about luck, than skill.  \n\nSome upgrades are a must have (which is frustrating) in order to survive the later levels.  Battering Ram, for example, you need because it allows you several seconds of invincibility and cool down is like 6 seconds.  Without it, you just die fast.  \n\nSome of the ships are useless unless they get their ship-unique upgrades (homing), which makes it frustrating if they don't show up in the random cycle.  Wish they would make them default, or just offer them every level as an option.  \n\nThe Digit ship actually has an upgrade that lowers the ships effectiveness (auto-aiming), which makes you wonder if they completely play tested them.\n\nThe hardest ship to get (and last one we unlocked) is a rail-gun shooting mistake that has nothing going for it.  We tried, we had other player carry it to later boards to make sure we got all the upgrades and it simply sucked in so many ways, weak defense, weak offense, i don't know what they were after on this.\n\nWould like the Ultimate shots to come more often, maybe change the mechanic that drives them (like using combos to earn your ultimate meter instead of the orange orbs).\n\nBut, for all my complaining, we did get 34 hours of fun time with me and the boys as we struggled through to unlock the ships.", "timestamp_created": 1454471824, "timestamp_updated": 1454471824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20532990": {"recommendationid": "20532990", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963975683", "num_games_owned": 698, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446560016}, "language": "french", "review": "D\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Amulware, Roche fusion nous offre son Shmup, un jeu qui se veut moderne dans sa r\u00e9alisation et \u00ab old school \u00bb dans son gameplay tout en restant innovant : voyons \u00e7a de plus pr\u00e8s\u2026\n\nPEW !\n\nMes derni\u00e8res exp\u00e9riences en la mati\u00e8re \u00e9taient \u00ab R-type \u00bb et \u00ab Parodius \u00bb autant dire que c\u2019est un genre de jeu que j\u2019avais compl\u00e8tement oubli\u00e9.

There's a lot of options in terms of visuals which is nice to see in terms of those that really have problems like epilispcy or performance issues (which I had absolutely none with all the options turned on). A lot of my negatives about the game is nitpicking some of the mechanics that the game has, in particular with powerups and them disappearing rather quickly. The game is solid all around, and if you are looking for a shoot em up that will keep your attention over time, this is exactly right up your alley. For shoot em up fans that really want something that feels the same, but will keep their attention.\n\n+:\n[list]\n[*] Good variety of powerups of active and passive powers. Good variety of different ships for different play types.\n[*] Visuals are excellent, and a lot of options available for those that need less clutter on the screen.\n[*] Performance is excellent. No frame drops, which is critical for a twitch game like thiis. \n[*] Solid mechanics and controls that gives you the right amount of control. \n[*] Enemy variety is good, and randomizes the position of spawning to make it feel different, but familiar in terms of waves.\n[*] The little touches. The ability to see cooldowns right in front of you when you use something on cooldown, or the sound distorting when speeding up. \n[/list]\n\n-:\n[list]\n[*] Upgrades in terms of dropable powerups don't stand around for too long, and takes too much risk to grab.\n[*] Nothing truly different from the genre here, just a lot of refinements.\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1433008922, "timestamp_updated": 1433008922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16003120": {"recommendationid": "16003120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018596420", "num_games_owned": 2812, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446346071}, "language": "english", "review": "This may very well be the best vertical shoot\u2019em\u2019up I\u2019ve ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1432587357, "timestamp_updated": 1432587357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540940", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15972940": {"recommendationid": "15972940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051963655", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432504316}, "language": "english", "review": "I had to install 3rd party software from below to be able to enjoy the game with my F310 gamepad.\n\nhttp://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-XInput-Wrapper-for-DS3-and-Play-com-USB-Dual-DS2-Controller?pid=186161#pid186161\n\nOnce the game pad worked it became really fun.", "timestamp_created": 1432417597, "timestamp_updated": 1432420830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15935126": {"recommendationid": "15935126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015967334", "num_games_owned": 1096, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432259486}, "language": "english", "review": "Great shmup with tons of upgrades and weapon combinations.

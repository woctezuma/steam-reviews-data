To accomplish this, you have to program the TIS-100 using its own, very basic programming language. \n\n[b]If you have a background in programming, don't worry.[/b]\nThe TIS-100 is different enough to a normal computer that even standard problems like \"find the maximum of a sequence\" will get you thinking about how to solve them. And even if not, you can always try to optimize your solution for runtime or other statistics, competing with everyone else who plays this game.\n\n[b]If you have no background in programming whatsoever, worry a little bit.[/b]\nIn theory, the game (or rather the manual) gives you everything you need to know to solve it. It will be hard, and you will need a lot of patience and resistance to frustration - it certainly isn't the easiest introduction to programming (perhaps check out Human Resource Machine). But, if you do manage to beat some of the puzzles, you will get that incredible feeling of having accomplished something by yourself, without someone holding your hand. If you consider yourself good at learning-by-doing, I encourage you to give it a try.\n\n[b]The game does have a story...[/b]\n... but it's quite minimalistic. In each puzzle you get a bit of monologue from your uncle, the previous owner of the TIS-100.\nI haven't reached the end yet, but what little story there is seems well written and at least makes you curious what the big reveal at the end might be. It serves its purpose, but is certainly not the selling point of this game.\n\n[b]Should you buy it?[/b]\nSince you can refund games on Steam now - unless you're quite certain you're not made for pushing numbers around in a coputer, why not? Especially now that it's on sale.\n\nBonus: If you play this game on a laptop in a public place, e.g. on a train, you'll look like the 1337est H4x0r in the known universe.

You\u2019re not doing exactly assembly language here. It\u2019s similar but enough to those that know to justify it being a game and not just work.\n    [*]Your goal is to take an input and change it somehow with no right solution and output it to match what is needed to complete each level. A lot of it is number based with some simple pictures in later levels. \n    [*]Overall the game is the weakest in all their lineup of games. But it still offers what fans want. Open ended solutions, which is great and no other developers do it. Since the writing of this review they have made two more games. I haven\u2019t played either. This is the reason for me not returning as their lastest game Opus Magnum looks better and a return to the SpaceChem style I love.  Anyways if you haven\u2019t heard of Zachtronic, go play any of his other games as they will be easier to play, because why else would you read this, you\u2019re curious about wtf Zachtronic games are.

I think this game (while not a perfect model for any esiting assembly language) is a beautiful way to get into the mindset that makes programming easier (to plan and to visualize). The limitations of the instruction set used for solving each program puzzle can be frustrating, but it's a tantalizing frustration (Ex: I know how to solve this problem in C; how can I adapt what I know there into the patterns for doing things here?). I found the game highly rewarding with the open-endedness of the puzzles.\n\nMy first solutions to each of the puzzle tended to be jury-rigged together. They work, but I can make it better. I can try to make it take fewer cycles (faster) to finish testing the instructions. I can consolidate the code so it uses fewer of the nodes MOV-ing data back and forth. I can work towards a solution that needs fewer lines of code to have a solution.  Each of these \u201cexecution nodes\u201d holds no more than 15 lines of instructions. There were many times I could\u2019ve solved a problem easier if I had 16 lines; it forced me to think at the problem from a different perspective. I would not describe this as an easy puzzle game. It is simple, but not easy.\n\nThis game required from me:\n[list]\n[*]Logical A\u2192B\u2192C thought progressions\n[*]Understanding how to modularize a problem into separable steps that can be tested individually\n[*]Patience and diligence to deal with my own mistakes (a program will only do as instructed and I caused it to not work)\n[*]Creativity with instructions that behaved unlike stuff I was familiar with\n[/list]\n\nOverall, my playtime took under 35 hours to get a working solution to each of the 47 puzzles. Interspaced in that were 40ish hours for trying to improve some of my solutions.

But to make it more gamy a view limitations are imposed:\n1. the only accessable storage beeing acc, meaning you can only save in one \"slot/variable/addressable space\". This is mitigated because you actually have multiple cors \"nodes\" with each one having a acc.\n2. communikation between nodes is tiresome because non blocking operations are missing.+The Instruction set is super minimal. Inifinifactory had a similar problem in my eyes: the logic was just to limiting.\n3. code is not reusable, and each node can only sore about 20 lines of code -> combined with the small storage and small instructon set this is just infuriating to me. You have a solution in mind but miss 2 lines to complete it.... now you need to start from scratch. Inifinifactory did not have that start from scratch problem. \n\nThe \"IDE\" functionality is also not as nice as i expected.

An interesting idea is introducing a basic cross-platform assembly syntax, despite being more limited then assembly. Where in assembly you have a few registeries you can interact with and you're responsible for all the memory you mess with, here you get one accessable registry to save and read from, and one inaccessable one you can save and swap to. That's per node (ignoring the stack nodes), which is a limited interface that represents seperated code execution.\n\nFor the less tech inclined, this means the puzzles are about using limited resources to design a solution, and the game's mechanics only really get an addition once as far as I see, (I'm unsure but there might be graphical problems too) and it has to be a robust one, a hacked together one designed for the current input you see would fail the testing system. I'm less inclined to call it problem solving game so far because the solutions do appear to have an optimal design, and while technically you're scope of design is close enough to unlimited to qualify for problem solving and there is no strictly garunteed optimal design in that way, the solutions are most times going to only have one optimal design and then strictly less optimal design. But that's ignorable unless you're a 100% obessesive completionist, to most it will be more akin to programming style problem solving. For those who aren't software developers or into lower level code, this game will have a higher learning curve, and having no skills in programming at all, I'd definitely think its a extremely steep cliff, this game does not really guide you and has no tutorial, you're using a reference manual the whole time to deduce the purpose of everything. For those of us used to code documentation, its a quick 5 or less minutes to get started, for everyone else, it will most definitely be longer then 15 to get setup.\n\nAnd for everything else:\n\nThe puzzles are pretty deep for only having three different types of interfaces. (one of which just discards values)\n\nYou get stack machines later, where you can push values to the top and take values off the top. Would've been nice to have seen other types of IO interfaces in the game, but the current concept has a nice simplistic idea. And I suppose is easy to wrap your head around\n\nThere is the ability to mess with pixels in the executing code, so you can draw small images.\n\nYou can create your own puzzles however it only has you designating input values, output values, and the layout of interfaces, nothing specifically new can be added. Though you can pretty easily share the puzzles around.\n\nYou can mess with a no objective sandbox where you can input values and get output values, though you have to get through a good few puzzles to get anything interesting.\n\nThere is also the ability to copy programs if you did something like say create a basic start framework.\n\nOther then that, the game is very simple and in my opinion is definitely worth the seven bucks, and would be nice to be expanded upon much further in the future somehow.

The instruction set is easy to learn as there are only a handful of instructions. I won't say anything about the story in the game but each puzzle has a specification for what your program should do. You read from n inputs and write to m outputs. The output is tested in four runs to check if you wrote a program that appears to behave correctly. There's also a few sandbox modes where you can play around with stacks, put pixels on the screen and get rudimentary input from a console. Upon solving a puzzle you get score in three categories. The number of instructions you used, the number of nodes you used and the number of clock cycles it took to complete the task. You'll see a histogram of global scores to compare how you've done and friends will have their best scores listed numerically.\n\nSome puzzles have good replayability as they are hard to optimize. Others are quite simple and serve no replayability at all. On reddit there's a listing of records in four categories. Some of them just seem insane to beat. Sure, you might have got the optimal clock cycles down, but can you reduce the number of nodes and instructions while still keeping up with the clock cycles?\n\nFinally, there's also a possibility to write your own puzzles although there is no convenient way to share them with the world. \n\nIf there's anything I dislike with the game, well... For sandbox mode, I would really have enjoyed being able to configure so that there could be more nodes, or more instructions per node. I get it, it's about optimization and scarce resources, but it would also be fun to roam around a bit in a creative fashion. But other than that, I don't really have anything to complain about.

As the rewards for completing a puzzle are lackluster at best. The difficulty level of this game (if one can call it such) is ridiculous and unforgiving in its brutality on the gamers sense of self worth. You will either find these puzzle relatively straight forward or spend hours hitting your head against the keyboard, begging for a merciful death. Unlike other puzzle games, TIS-100 has only one difficulty mode which seems to be its charm and also it's curse. Programmers, logical thinkers will find this game fun and addictive, where as your casual gamer will likely come away wonder what all the fuss was about. The interface is basic and rudimentary, complimenting the vintage computer theme of the game, however I would have liked to have seen some effort taken to pull in the casual gamer.

That said, if you want a nice set of optimization challenges relating to information flow, this is a fantastic game to pick up.  It also serves as a good framework for building intuition about parallelized processes in the real world.\n\nThe game is played via a very constrained programming language, on a grid of nodes which each can only hold a loop of up to 15 instructions, and two values.  Nodes run in parallel, values are passed from node to node, input is converted to output, and if you match their expected output on all 4 tests you have succeeded in that challenge.\n\nThe game has a histogram for every challenge showing the best scores across all players in each category: cycles, nodes, and instructions.  There is typically a tradeoff, to use fewer cycles to generate the output you add more instructions across more nodes, and so on.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the game is the skill ceiling.  The subreddit /r/tis100 holds leaderboards that have been updated regularly since the game's inception, and people are still finding ways to make the solutions faster, more compact or more elegant.  With such a limited set of operations, the fact that there are still tricks to find and use can come as a surprise.

This means that debugging is harder, and watching your program run isn't as satisfying.\n- It doesn't help you learn the mechanics. Instead, you are given a weblink to a pdf \"manual\" with instructions, and are just expected to read through it.

This game will probably be easier for software developers but it's still just a glorified puzzle. There are just a few instructions that are easy to understand. The real challenge is using the few instructions to make complex programs. If you're up to such a challenge this is a game for you.\n\n+ Interesting concept\n+ Convincing manual and system\n+ Hard puzzles even for programmers\n+ Decent debug tools\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n\nIn TIS-100 you start by being given an intimidating instruction manual that explains how to program in the made up assembly language, but fear not, you only really need to memorize some instructions and perhaps read the examples. The instruction manual and operating system are very convincing and makes you wonder if such a machine existed in real life. Unfortunately the computer never existed.\n\nThe computer is comprised of nodes and each nodes has two registers that can store a number. You can copy the value of your primary register to other nodes and often you have to because the memory is very limited. In fact lack of memory is one of the major challenges of this game. The other major challenge is that you only have a few instructions that can only be executed in your first register. For example, you cannot compare two values directly. You can only compare your primary register with zero. To top it all most instructions such as set, add or subtract only work in the primary register; the secondary register can only copy the value from the primary register or swap values with each other. It's a hard game even for software developers such as myself. A very interesting and unique concept.\n\nThe instruction manual and the puzzles themselves might be hard to grasp for someone who never touched a programming language but perhaps that's for the best so that beginners have more of an authentic experience of what was programming in the early days. Having a tutorial would probably ruin the experience and the satisfaction of having solved a puzzle. Sometimes the specification itself is hard to understand but that's also one of the difficulties of real life programming. That said you will learn some assembly but you should see it as more of a very challenging puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1505172842, "timestamp_updated": 1505172842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34855256": {"recommendationid": "34855256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142857162", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505043262}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game!", "timestamp_created": 1505027796, "timestamp_updated": 1505027796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34793515": {"recommendationid": "34793515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054106167", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511882905}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're an actual programmer, this is just a MUST HAVE. \n\nFor me also brings back good memories of C64 programming.

My experience with programming is next to none, apart from reading up on SNES hardware/65816 assembly for like a week straight, locked in my dorm room and on the verge of despair.  (Long story.)\n\nTIS-100 is the hardest game I have ever played, full stop.  I have never felt more like a moron than I do while playing this game, a feeling only briefly relieved at the moment when I solve a puzzle, only to return once I close out the following puzzle without writing a single instruction.  I might only have three hours in this game, but I've spent more than three times as much thinking about this game, both about it's solutions and it's meaning.  And I've only managed to come close to a solution to the latter.\n\nThis is not a puzzle game, exactly.  I feel like this is closer to a sim game, specifically about the life of a 1960's/1970's programmer, before ISAs became even close to something considered \"standard\".  This isn't exactly about learning a programming language as it is about being given a piece of proprietary hardware you've never seen before and a poorly detailed manual and being asked to magically figure it out for yourself.  I don't think I've ever seen a \"puzzle\" game with such a dedication to the experience its game creates within the player, the kind of thing only possible within an interactive medium like this, and the more I think about it, the more it could only be intentional.  \n\nThe manual is pdf made to look like a stapled together handbook.  It is the best manual for a game I have seen in about a decade, and also the least effective manual I have ever seen at actually teaching the player how to play the game; it offers a bare explanation of what the various opcodes and registers do, but absolutely no information on how they should be used.  Inside you will find occasional highlights and notes in pen from the previous owner, absolutely none of which are helpful in furthering your understanding of the language.\n\nThe thing is, the bad manual is part of the experience.  If this game had a good manual or tutorial, it would just be a game about assembly language, probably a good one at that, but there's nothing that quite compares to the bleak stare of a white-text-on-black display and a useless paper manual in creating a feeling of utter helplessness.\n\nAnd just solving the puzzle isn't enough, either.  TIS-100 will then compare your solution to those of your friends to show you how unoptimized your code is, and you can go online and see people who have done it even better, or look in the achievements to see even more ridiculous challenges.  There is an achievement for programming a signal comparator (run the inputs through a signum function and then write a binary output to three nodes depending on the sign of the output) without using conditional jump instructions.  I feel stupefied by the thought that this is even possible.\n\nI don't think I'll ever finish this game, but I know for certain I won't forget it.  Maybe I'll come back to it later, but I get the feeling somehow that this game is greater than me, and it's probably greater than you, too.  It's too complex to be simplified and too complex to be accessible, but it's worth your money and time if you think you might be interested.", "timestamp_created": 1501264869, "timestamp_updated": 1501264869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33725730": {"recommendationid": "33725730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177084723", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489101049}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm very fond of this game.

You're given a list of incomplete programs (puzzles) and you select whichever one you want to work on.  You're then given a set of instructions, a list providing one or more inputs, and a list showing you what the output(s) should be.  So you always know what you're trying to achieve and you know what any given input should be when it reaches the output.  The programs consist of 12 separate nodes which you can enter instructions into.  Every puzzle has 1 or more nodes that have some sort of \u201ccommunication failure\u201d message in them which simply renders that node unusable and forces you to work around them.  You also must work around the facts that: 1.  You're limited to 15 total commands per node and 2.  Commands you can enter into the nodes are intentionally not very sophisticated.  There are only 13 total commands in the game and they're broken down into 4 categories.  1.  Moving numbers from one node to another  2. Saving/Swapping memory  3. Basic math (Only add, subtract, swapping positive/negative sign) 4. Split path/jump commands (Do this set of instructions if the number is positive, do this set of instructions if the number is negative, do this set of instructions if the number is 0.)  Once you've designed your program how you like, you hit the run button and the game runs the inputs through your program until they reach the output.  If the input numbers that reach the output have been altered to match up to list that you were given at the start then you complete the program.  If there is an error somewhere, you'll have to note where the error occurs and pause your program while it's running at a point before the error.  You can then press the \u201cStep\u201d button which allows you to view your commands running one 'tick' at a time.  You can then use this to follow an input, see which node it enters that causes the problem, and then attempt to fix the problem.\n\n     So the game is pretty user friendly.  Pressing escape brings up the option to open up the manual for the \u201cTIS-100\u201d and provides you with some flavor text as though it's an actual manual for an actual machine.  It gives you a description of the nodes as well as a list of all the commands and examples of how to use them.  There's also some other info in there on stuff that will show up later in the game in puzzles such as \u201cStack nodes\u201d or how to make your outputs display color.  You can also press F1 while in a program to bring up a list of all the commands and references to what they do.  The first row of 5 puzzles are mostly tutorial puzzles meant to slowly introduce you to the basic concepts.  The first puzzle is just moving numbers around, and half of it is already filled in to show you exactly how to enter commands.  The second introduces addition.  The third introduces subtraction and splitting the path of your number.  The fourth and fifth involve needing to use jump commands.  The game gets more difficult from there on out.  You will almost always have access to multiple incomplete programs, so if you ever get stuck on one, you can save your progress, quit out and work on another program.\n\n     Pros:  There are 22 puzzles in the \u201cTIS-100 segment map\u201d as well as 25 user created puzzles includes in the \u201cTIS-NET directory\u201d.  At around 20 hours of actual gameplay, I'd only completed 23/47 total puzzles, so you'll get plenty out of this game if you enjoy it.  Once you've completed a couple puzzles, remembered that F1 is your friend, and are familiar with the basic commands, the game is very simple to play.  The hard part isn't in fighting the controls but in figuring out a basic gameplan, where you screwed up, and if/how you can fix it.  It's fairly easy to track down your errors and see what's causing them.  Each program contains a node with an error message that when clicked  provides flavor text for some sort of an attempt at a plot/story.  Puzzles start out simple enough to familiarize you with the basic concepts and grow more difficult and devious from there.  Completing many of the later puzzles is very satisfying, especially when you open up one you've been having trouble with and the solution suddenly comes to you.\n\n     The cons.  There's not much here other than programming puzzles.  There's no real plot or story to the game.  The interface is pretty barebones and bland.  There aren't any characters or dialogue.  There's no music.  It would've been nice if they included a reference for the color puzzles when you press F1, but having to open up the manual to reference them isn't a big deal.\n\n     Not much more to say.  It's a good game to sit down for 30-60 minutes and rack your brain over a puzzle. If you're looking for a puzzle game with plot/story, characters, and dialogue, then you should avoid this game.  TIS-100 won't be for everyone but for those who enjoy, you'll get plenty of time out of it even if you only complete half the puzzles.

I just sometimes forget to shut down the game and/or like to watch some of my solutions more than once. Having said that, this game WILL keep you busy for a while.\n\nSo I just finished 100% completion of this game, and figured I'd finally levy my thoughts on it in a review. So first off: I love this game. Sure, the game may tell you flat out what you're SUPPOSED to do (except in the hidden puzzle - RTFM to find it), but it's up to you to take those specifications and figure out how to make them a reality in practice. Trust me when I say this: If you don't even have a basic idea of how to approach your problem you're going to struggle to complete it.\n\nOf course, even if you THINK you have a great idea for how to get a puzzle to complete, you still have to actually write it out and test it. More often than not, there will be a flaw in your thinking or coding that will make your approach not quite work. Your goal of course is to try to correct that flaw, which will more often than not require using breakpoints and stepping. While you may be able to sometimes fix a problem, other times you will make things worse or even run into command space issues. There's only one thing I can say about this: There's no shame whatsoever in deleting a program, and coming back to it later. I've done that more than I care to admit. Once you do eventually solve it it'll feel amazing, and you might even think of new ways to solve it by tackling another problem!\n\nTl;dr: This game is hard. Even when you think you've got something figured out you might not, and you have to consider whether you want to try to tweak your solution idea or abandon it.

Unfortunately, there are multiple problems with it:\n\n-It is difficult to get into without assembly coding experience. It lacks any kind of tutorial, instead giving you a manual that, while introducing you to the commands that you'll be using, doesn't really explain how to use them. Even with my (small amount of) coding experience, I had alot of trouble figuring out what I was actually supposed to be doing with these commands\n\n-The language and architecture used in the game is outdated and doesn't fit with the goal of these puzzles. While this game could teach you to code if you were living in the 80s or 90s, it would barely help you today. The computer that the game simulates doesn't take advantage of modern processing improvements (The game even mentions the USSR as if it still existed in the timeframe of the game-given how the game's computer operates, that's easy to believe.). Additionally, the game asks you to do things which the language was seemingly not made to do (for example: some puzzles ask you to multiply or divide, but the language only has add and subtract commands. Also, you might be asked to compare numbers or change the output based on a condition, which, again, the language doesn't have a command for). It feels like trying to build a house by stacking rocks- you'll get there eventually, but it'll be slow, and the thing's gonna fall over at least a few times before you get there.\n\n\ntl;dr: While the game tries to turn assembly coding into a challenging and potentially educational puzzle, the outdated architecture and clunky language ruins the fun, assuming you understand the coding enough to actually have fun in the first place.\n\nWe're in the 21st century now, game.

One for people with no coding experience at all, and those who have coded, even at a basic level, in Assembly.\n\nTo the people who have never coded:\n\nThis game will be a little challenging at first. You may sit and be stuck at the first one for a while, but if you keep at it youll start to get the hang of it and get into the swing of this language. The benefit is this is a simple language once you understand it, so it's a good intro to assembly level coding and how it functions on a fundamental level.\n\nIf youre not tech savy at all, I might not reccomend the game to you, however I am a firm believer that anyone can code given enough time and practice. \n\nAll in all, from a standpoint of a person with no background in programming, I think this is a good buy, especially on sale. \n\nTo the people with coding background:\n\nIf you're like me, and are either studying Computer Science in college, or are self taught, or have decent experience in real world applications, this game might be a little on the easy side. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it completely and would buy it again. However by about the 3rd puzzle I had the general system down and was able to have pretty decently optimized programs without much effort. Now I dont know how the rest of the game will be, but I got pretty far in one 2 hour session (I left my PC on overnight so thats why I have 24 hrs).\n\nIf you are somoene who codes assembly daily, you may find this too easy. I havent coded Assembly in months, so it was refreshing and relaxing to me to pick it up and practice a little. That may not be the case for you.\n\nStill, I think its worth a go.

I didn't think much of it, but thought the name sounded cool.   I mean it was a staff pick, so who knows what I'm going to get. \n\nThen I played it.  OH WOW!  This game reminds me of another game called spacechem, and now that I'm writing this review, I can see on the page that it was written by the same guy, and it really feels like that. \n\nThe entire game is about coding.  You work on a microprocessor and have a number of tasks to complete, and to be honest, this isn't a game where you pretend to code, or you use a very fake coding language.  No, if you play this game and you beat it, you HAVE programmed and you have used assembly, it's as simple as that.   This is a game, but at the same time, this is essentially the same thing as real coding (only it's a bit harder on this game for artificial constraints). \n\nTo play the game you get a manual (which you really should look at) and an assignment.  It can be as simple as take in two variables and add them together.  Or as complex as multiply them together.... and yes multiplying the values is significantly harder than adding them.   You also get up to 12 processors that are connected through ports.  They can read in information, operate on it and push that information to another port (or the same one). \n\nThe complexity comes in that each processor has a limited number of operations you can record on it.  There's some beautiful control codes (jumps, labels and the rest) but rather than give you unlimited space ( which could make the multiplication simple) you have about 10 operations (maybe a little more) and that's it. Then the code loops.  You can use any number of available processors (sometimes there's small limitations, but you always have more than enough) but trying to make the computer do exactly as the tasks says is challenging. \n\nThere's a few other wrinkles.  Each processor is given ONE register.. (and that my dear friends is why multiplication is a nightmare. )\n\nSo overall how is it?  Well I'm a programmer, I love programming, and I am absolutely in love with this game.  It's not for everyone but it's a BOTH a great introduction to REAL assembly, and a fantastic game.  It's definitely not for everyone, but I can't praise this game highly enough.

I haven't done much low level code for a few years now and it was something I always enjoyed.  While TIS-100 is nowhere remotely near what you can do on a real processor, it is immensely fun to solve its puzzles - specifically because of the severe limitations of the processor.  It also challenges the mind to think in terms of parallelization to reduce the cycle count for a better score on many puzzles.\n\nNon-programmers probably wont get much further than solving 3-4 of the most basic puzzles, however if you're a computer programmer who loves solving coding and/or logic puzzles, then this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1483098803, "timestamp_updated": 1483098803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28821382": {"recommendationid": "28821382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116161384", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495364374}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uad8c\uc5ed\ub300\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc778\uc740 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uae30 \ud798\ub4e0 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub2e4. \ubc88\uc5ed\uc744 \ub3c4\uc640\uc8fc\uace0\uc2f6\uc744 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc911\ub3c5\uc131\uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8\ub9cc\ud07c \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc778\ub4e4\uc758 \uc720\uc785\uc5d0 \uac78\ub9bc\ub3cc\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uac89\uac19\ub2e4. \uc815\uc791_\ubcf8\uc778\uc740_\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38", "timestamp_created": 1483088302, "timestamp_updated": 1483088302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28818900": {"recommendationid": "28818900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067230913", "num_games_owned": 948, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483030457}, "language": "english", "review": "I've literally never stared harder at my screen for hours on end.\n", "timestamp_created": 1483081030, "timestamp_updated": 1483081030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28778697": {"recommendationid": "28778697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246641692", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502551524}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc5b4\uc694. \ucd08\ub4f1\ud559\uc0dd\ub3c4 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1482988891, "timestamp_updated": 1482988891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28765207": {"recommendationid": "28765207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034880858", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483473261}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like doing homework for a programming class.", "timestamp_created": 1482956863, "timestamp_updated": 1482956863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28762224": {"recommendationid": "28762224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045189484", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482951551}, "language": "english", "review": "some assembly required", "timestamp_created": 1482951405, "timestamp_updated": 1482951405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28756226": {"recommendationid": "28756226", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998477195", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496540737}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun.", "timestamp_created": 1482940559, "timestamp_updated": 1482940559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28752047": {"recommendationid": "28752047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081823604", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491638381}, "language": "german", "review": "Sicher kein Spiel das jedem und jeder gefallen w\u00fcrde.

You don't need any experience to enjoy the puzzles because the system is very simple and intuitive! The game runs smooth, no crashes, and the graphics are just right to evoke the experience of using early GUI systems. \n\nThere's a small story to accompany the system, which you unlock as you progress through the game, as well as a few collectables. For those new to programming, you will spend a few hours thinking about each puzzle and debugging your solutions, but you will find it very rewarding as you acquire mastery.\n\nFor those who've programmed before, you'll find many of the puzzles simple, though you may sometimes struggle to fit logic into each cell; it's very difficult to have one cell do all the work, so don't be afraid to have cells communicate with eachother!\n\nFor $8, this game is well-priced and well-made, along with accompanying sandboxes and a challenge creator. The TIS-100 is a great programming toy and puzzle, although experienced programmers will need only ~10 hours of playtime to beat the game.\n\nThat said, programming is not for everybody. You'll spend a lot of time on each puzzle and the only reward you will get is seeing things working as intended. In fact, far more often you'll be frustrated that things *aren't* working. Nonetheless, this game captures the fun and challenge of programming with a much lower barrier to entry than normal! \n\nI highly recommend this game as a diversion that may eventually consume your time at school and work while you feverishly try to design a solution for segments you've been stumped on. If you know somebody with a clever mind and a bit of patience, this game is a great gift. \n\nFor the developer:\nWell done, and although the story was a bit cliche, the game itself is solid design.

Der Befehlssatz ist mit nur 13 Befehlen (5 davon sind Vergleichsoperatoren) sehr kompakt gehalten und kann auch im Spiel \u00fcber F1 angezeigt werden. Dadurch bleibt eine l\u00e4stige Suche nach Befehlen im Manual erspart und der Einstieg f\u00e4llt auch nach l\u00e4ngeren Spielpausen leicht.\n\nNach kurzer Eingew\u00f6hnungszeit verspricht das Spiel mit seinen durchaus anspruchsvollen Aufgaben eine wohltuende Abwechslung zum allt\u00e4glichen Programmieren zu sein. Es stellt eigene Regeln und Limitierungen auf, die zumindest f\u00fcr mich gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils ungewohnt waren.\n\nWie f\u00fcr das Programmieren \u00fcblich sollte man aber eine leichte Frustrationstoleranz und Freude am Knobeln haben, denn TIS-100 lockt mit drei verschiedenen Herausforderungen f\u00fcr jedes Segment: Die niedrigste Taktzahl (das schnellste Programm), die wenigsten verwendeten Programmknoten, sowie die wenigsten verwendete Befehle. Grafiken zeigen zudem an, wie gut man in den jeweiligen Bereichen abschneidet. M\u00f6chte man (jeweils) alles perfektionieren, dann ist man eine ganze Weile besch\u00e4ftigt. Denn die ersten beiden Segmente sind zwar f\u00fcr einen seichten Anfang konzipiert, der Anspruch steigt dann aber merklich an. Nicht selten lassen sich selbst bei diesen kleinen Mikroprozessoren au\u00dferdem bew\u00e4hrte Optimierungsmethoden (z.B. Schleifen entrollen oder relative Spr\u00fcnge) erfolgreich anwenden, wodurch das Spiel noch n\u00e4her an die Realit\u00e4t r\u00fcckt.\n\nDie Retro-Grafik ist zwar sehr n\u00fcchtern gehalten, aber das Spiel l\u00e4sst sich sowohl mit voller Mausunterst\u00fctzung (Markieren), als auch sehr bequem nur mit Tastatur (Strg + Pfeiltasten) bedienen. Syntaxfehler werden markiert, Kopieren, Ausschneiden, Einf\u00fcgen, R\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig oder Wiederholen sind implementiert - der Editor ist brauchbar gut. Die Programmknoten besitzen au\u00dferdem aufgrund ihrer Optik \u00fcber stark begrenzte Textkapazit\u00e4ten, ganz so, wie man es zu Pionierzeiten gewohnt war, was dem Spiel erst seinen Charakter verleiht. Jeder Knoten wird parallel ausgef\u00fchrt und es wird regen Gebrauch vom Zusammenspiel und der Kommunikation dieser Knoten gemacht. Auch gibt es nur zwei Register, zwei Rechenoperationen Plus und Minus und einen Zahlenbereich von -999 bis 999, daf\u00fcr ohne \u00dcberlauf. Die begrenzten Resourcen machen einen gro\u00dfen Teil des Charakters dieses Spiels aus.\n\nDer n\u00fctzliche Debugger (F6) zeigt f\u00fcr jeden Takt alle Informationen an und hilft beim Verst\u00e4ndnis der Spielmechanik und des eigenen Programms.\n\nGanz nebenbei erz\u00e4hlt das Spiel auch noch eine kleine Geschichte \u00fcber die Erfahrungen des fr\u00fcheren Besitzers der TIS-100. Etwas mysteri\u00f6s, spirituell und ein Hauch von Verschw\u00f6rungstheorie, wenn auch ohne gro\u00dfe Wendungen und das Finale f\u00e4llt etwas knapp, daf\u00fcr im konsistenten Stil aus.\n\nMit etwas Mehraufwand ist es au\u00dferdem m\u00f6glich, eigene Aufgaben zu schreiben und zu teilen, was den Wiederspielwert naturgem\u00e4\u00df erh\u00f6ht. Dadurch wird auch der (f\u00fcr meine Bed\u00fcrfnisse passende) Schwierigkeitsgrad ver\u00e4nderlich. Solche Optionen sind immer lobenswert.\n\nMein Fazit lautet: TIS-100 ist ein vollst\u00e4ndig durchdachtes Spiel f\u00fcr Prozessor-Enthusiasten... und alle anderen.", "timestamp_created": 1480459318, "timestamp_updated": 1480459318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28080675": {"recommendationid": "28080675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017035548", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513780342}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this when it was released, and I completed the first 2 levels or something but then couldn't complete any more. then after doing a bunch more programming i remembered this game and then i finished 5 levels pretty quickly.

But reviews tend to overlook that it's also a good puzzle game as well!  Besides the limit in instruction space, the limited memory per node (one main value and one backup value which you can only replace or swap with the main) and how the nodes can send and receive data between nodes physically next to each other (unless it's broken!) means you'll have to determine how to correctly move and manipulate data through space.\n\nA loop counter might take up a node's main memory which means you need the nodes around it to send and manipulate data.  Or you might want to build a few nodes just for gatekeeping or counting that will then be used with what are essentially custom data streams, becoming a far cry from your original goal of something as simple sounding as dealing with a few loops.

games\n~Great core mechanics\n~A good speedrun game\n~Bite sized price\n~Good for conpleationists (Because its such a small game, its easy and fun to 100 percent)\n~Sidequests are fun\n~Core mechanics are similar to far cry 3, but improved\n~Amazing animations\n~Witty dio-log\n~Great replay value that will brighten any bad day\n~a decent entry level stealth game that is very satisfying\n~Music that's just awesome!\n~Runs on lower end PC's\n~Self aware. Dosn't overstep it's boundries.\n\nCONS\n~ummmmm it crashed one time?\n~Real missed opertunity for wingsuit-jetpack :(\n~Uplay. (only slightly annoying)\n\nThis is one of my favourite games. I keep coming back to it over and over, and it never gets old. I even enjoyed it more than its core game far cry 3. If you want a fun game, that will make you smile, then buy this.

So, before proceeding in this review, I have three questions:\n\nAre you good at thinking outside the box?\nWould you buy a game if you couldn't complete it in a couple weeks after buying it?\nCan you play a game with no music, minimal sound and a bare-bones interface?\n\nIf you answered no to any of these questions, TIS-100 is not a game for you.\n\nThat out of the way, TIS-100 is still a great game. Just not for everyone. TIS-100 has 50 puzzles, each of which gives the player a goal: Take a series of numbers from up to 4 inputs, manipulate the data, and then send results to the outputs. As usual, Zach starts the player off easy, introducing concepts one at a time, and then quickly ramps up the difficulty and forces the player to test their skills with little \"down time\". Players will find themselves selecting maxes, sorting sequences, calculating mathematical operations and in the later stages even drawing onto a limited-color pixel canvas in accordance with the data.\n\nThough some puzzles are incredibly difficult, even for someone with a programmer's mind like myself, Zach gives a reprieve - the player is not required to complete every puzzle in sequence to proceed; they can cherry-pick puzzles and unlock each row one by one just by completing a certain number of segments. If a particular puzzle is too difficult, the player can just choose to come back to it later. And even after the player completes a stage, there's plenty of replay value - like other Zachtronics games, each stage gives the player metrics on their performance - how many instructions they used, how long it took the program to complete the puzzle, and nodes used. After a puzzle is completed, the player gets to see how they stacked up to the data of other players, meaning there's always room for improvement.\n\nIf you're not worried about being unable to complete the game and you enjoy racking your brain for unconventional solutions, I'd definitely reccommend TIS-100.", "timestamp_created": 1480056527, "timestamp_updated": 1480056527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27391890": {"recommendationid": "27391890", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993609571", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451221772}, "language": "french", "review": "6,5 heures de jeu effectif, une bonne dizaine de plus sur papier \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, et un peu plus encore en journ\u00e9e au boulot (j'avoue, j'ai trouv\u00e9 des solutions comme \u00e7a).

If you are good at programming this game will still challenge you. \nI will go in more detail:\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe whole game is based around a little computer called the TIS-100 (Tessellated Intelligence System). The computer consists out of multiple little \"Modules\" that can each be programmed to do specific tasks. These modules can transfer data back and forth and can be used for simple calculations. This can be anything from adding, subtracting to harder tasks like multiplying numbers (which is way harder than you might think). Each of the modules only has 2 pieces of memory, the ACC and BAK memory. Each can be used to store one number from -999 to 999. BAK data cannot be accessed directly and can only be swapped with the ACC memory or copied from the ACC memory by using SAV. This makes the game very challenging because if you want to store 2 numbers you have to swap the ACC and BAK memory back and forth all the time or use multiple modules as storage. This system makes for some very interesting cheesy workarounds.\n\n[h1]Puzzles[/h1]\nThe puzzles in the game are pretty challenging, which is a good thing. At first you will have quite a learning curve for the first few puzzles trying to figure everything out. After a while it starts making sense and you have to start thinking of ways to use the least lines of code. The timing in some puzzles may also be slightly off, every module can only do one calculation per \"step\", this means that if you have multiple inputs this might cause a delay making the different inputs not align properly. This adds a big challenge which I do like a lot.\n\nAll in all, this game would probably get a solid 9/10 from me :D", "timestamp_created": 1479748985, "timestamp_updated": 1479749051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26723639": {"recommendationid": "26723639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000067452", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491182205}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy programming puzzles and can spend ten minutes reading the f'ing manual, you will like this game.", "timestamp_created": 1479688448, "timestamp_updated": 1479688448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26721990": {"recommendationid": "26721990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170681606", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483596750}, "language": "english", "review": "When I started to take an interest in programming, this game was recommended to me as a way to learn programming.

Aside from Ironclad, that's practically a genre in itself at this point. If you are a fan of Zachtronics, you'll probably be a fan of this. If you aren't a fan of Zachtronics, this is a waste of money. If you've never played a Zachtronics game before, I would reccomend playing Infinifactory or Spacechem before this. Both are gentler introductions to the kind of problem solving you will be expected to do in this game, and are great games in their own right.\n\nIf you are a programmer, the kind that programs not because it's a living, but because you love it, and do it in your off-time for fun... disregard the above. You're almost certainly already a fan of Zachtronics, you just don't know it yet.\n\nSecondly, if you hate reading, and can't stand to read through a well-written manual, this isn't a game for you. You must read the manual. Even if you're an experienced asm programmer, I would at least reccomend it. \n\nThirdly, for you already established Zachtronics fans, note that this hews a little closer to Zach's older work than Spacechem/Infinifactory. No, it's not as brutal as The Codex or The Bureau, to say nothing of Ruckingenur or KOHCTPYKTOP, but it's definitely less self-explanatory than Spacechem, and the concepts at play are a bit harder to grasp. Not that it's harder than Spacechem: I couldn't say if any of Zach's games are harder than any other with a straight face.\n\nFinally, this is a game about writing mock assembly which is similar to real assembly but without some constructs you might expect (no bit twiddling, no pointers, no indirect addressing: Heck, there's no RAM TO addresss). If you don't know what that means, don't worry. Suffice to say that it's akin to programming on the lowest level of computer hardware. If that sounds scary, don't worry: it's not. The tools at your disposal may be more primitive than what you're used to, but at the end of the day, you're still taking a high-level idea and transforming it into a process the computer can understand. If you don't know what *that* meant, don't worry.

The added optimisation leaderboards make it very addictive to keep tweaking your solutions after figuring out how to solve the base problem.\n\nThe only drawback worth mentioning I can think of was that sometimes RUN runs too quick or RUN FAST runs too slow, breakpoints can not always solve this problem, due to the limited amount of code you can enter you will reuse your code a lot, hitting breakpoints more often than I'd like.", "timestamp_created": 1475946383, "timestamp_updated": 1475946383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25911685": {"recommendationid": "25911685", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991676314", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479400110}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend this game!

There, you have only one process running, but you have a lot of memory to work with. In TIS-100, you have multiple modules that communicate with each other and each one has its own program running, but only one memory and one backup slot. Also, the code length is limited, so the main challenge is to squeeze everything into the modules and make them communicate with each other consistently.\n\nLike in all Zachtronics games, you are given some basic tools and you need to put together a working design that does something you initially thought impossible. You think it is impossible to write a sufficiently small sorting algorithm with only addition/subtraction and conditional jump instructions? This game will make you do it while pulling your hair out over every redundant line of code! And when you finally solve it, the in-game charts will tell you that your monstrous program is slower and more bloated than most of other people's solutions, so there's no definite victory for you.

It simulates a fictional multicore computer (loosely inspired by the Connection Machine), provides you with a list of \"diagnostic tasks\" (puzzles/challenges), with nothing but the friendly manual for company. The TIS is programmed through a simple assembly language, with only room for a small number of instructions in memory. It doesn't take long before the puzzles force you to optimize and get tricky, and in doing so you'll get some experience with real-world programming concepts like process synchronization and I/O blocking. The game is also a pretty good intro to assembly language in general, and how computers work at the chip level on a simple architecture.\n\nBeyond the specific mechanics of the puzzles, TIS-100 has a lot in common with other Zachtronics games. Like Spacechem and Infinifactory, most of the puzzles are some variation of \"you receive something from an input node, do some operations on it, send it to the proper output node as efficiently as possible,\" which is a good template with endless room for variation. Like those other games, your solutions are graded on various metrics and a lot of the fun is in optimizing your creations to compete against your friends on the in-game leaderboards.\n\nThis is the least flashy and least mainstream Zachtronics game, but if you enjoy programming and weird old computers, it's pretty amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1474898800, "timestamp_updated": 1474898800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25704005": {"recommendationid": "25704005", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999151078", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466560460}, "language": "english", "review": "While TIS-100 is perhaps even more of an acquired taste for some puzzle aficionados, it'll nevertheless appeal strongly to programmers and computer types.

I discovered TIS-100 after finishing a programming bootcamp and taking two computer science courses (discrete math and data structures and algorithms) and I was cowed. I thought, \"maybe programming isn't for me and I should rest on my laurels.\" Well, screw that. Now I'm learning MIPS and writing real assembly programs. Will I ever beat TIS-100? That is entirely another question.\n\nTIS-100 is not exactly like programming but it flexes muscles right in that awkward spot between math and logic that programming often hits. For me, someone with a fair amount of math anxiety and a limited reserve of energy for such problems, this is the groin of my brain. It doesn't demand that you have a formal knowledge of programming, although that helps, you really need raw problem solving skills.\n\nI've found that approaching TIS-100 puzzles like generic programming problems tends to set me off on the wrong track. You have to think like the machine. Its not always a question of effort, its more a question of focus and clarity of thinking. TIS-100 can be a real time waster and very frustrating if you can't think in its style since solving problems takes time and faulty reasoning can suck hours of your life away. I've thought to myself after such hours: \"My God, I have programming homework, projects for clients and real applications with real problems that need to be solved.\" Not fun.

This also means that every problem is extremely open ended and there's always thousands of different acceptable solutions. Absolutely no experience in programming is necessary in order to learn to get good at this game, but it certainly helps.\n\nYou do have to RTFM(read the fucking manual) in order to get anywhere in this game. The manual is actually written in the game story's aesthetic - it really tries to be like a user manual for a 70s-80s processor which I thought was really cool. But don't let that sound too intimidating - it's still very easy to read and understand how the assembly commands work, complete with examples. I would expect it to take most people ~15 minutes to do a quick read through the manual, and then only necessary to be used as a reference to look up specific behaviors on functions as you get to later levels.\n\nI can't recommend this above or below other Zachtronics puzzle games.

I turned off the computer and then I noticed the network card was still making lights. Then I noticed that my router was peaking out. So I installed a network sensor in my network to see what my router was doing. I put a switch between the router and the modem, and configured port mirroring to my laptop, which was on another port.\n\nIt seems my router is hacking all the things, and I can't stop it. Whenever I turn on my computer TIS-100 begins to take over the Internet. Can someone please help me delete this virus? When I try to delete it in steam, it sends embarassing pictures of me that is apparently got from my phone and webcam. I tried to report it to the police, and they said that they could not arrest a program for blackmailing me.\n\nToday when attempting to get back into my house, my garage door would not open. TIS-100 sent me a MMS message with a picture of a cute cat playing with string, which usually is a friendly and warming experience. However, this image of happniess was misleading, because it was accompanied with a very threatening message that if I didn't leave my computer on and my router connected to the Internet that it would done some really bad things to my mother. It told me if I told anyone about what it said it would do that I would be killed. \n\nI am typing this from my friend's house, and I don't know what to do. I think I need to solve all of the puzzles to get TIS-100 to leave me alone. I was stuck on one problem so I came here to type of a plea for help, but now I went back and completely forgotten what I was coding.\n\nSomeone please help me.\n\n:::::::::: UPDATE 2016-08-26 ::::::::::\n\nAn update. I thought that progressing in the puzzles would solve my dilemna, but when I passed the first puzzle after nearly 20 hours of difficulty my experience was very different as expected. When I hit the RUN button, I got a message on my phone. I think it came from TIS-100. It said, \"do you trust me?\" I got really scared and tried to reply, but there was no phone number. I noticed my webcam was on. As soon as I looked at it the power light flickered. I then realized that TIS-100 was watching my every move. I yelled at it, and informed it that I did not trust it.\n\nThat is where I made a grave mistake. As I made this statement it was only moments until I hear the sound of a helicopter nearby. I looked out the window from my mom's single-wide trailer home, and I saw several black SUVs with gangster tint pull up sharply. I knew now what was going on. Something inside me told me that this was some secret police that the TIS-100 had reported me to.\n\nOut of my adolescent survival instinct, I grabbed a blanket and covered my face as I jumped through the back window. I immediately stumbled down into the ravine by our home and ran into the boonies. I've lived the last few weeks off scraps from garbage cans in fear of any fast moving vehicle that I was going to be taken away to a secret prisoner camp.\n\nThen as I was eating what seemed to be the best half eaten week old cheese burger I've ever had, a USPS van pulled up with several packages for me.\n\nI opened them up, and it was my computer stored with a portable power supply, INMARSAT BGAN Internet modem, and a Stansport Teton Gry and Orange tent. There was also a message that said, \"trust me Zhies.\" I got really scared, but it was at this moment that I knew the TIS-100 had my best interests at heart... if a computer can have a heart.\n\n:::::::::: UPDATE 2017-02-26 ::::::::::\n\nI had a very strange encounter since last August. I spent several months staying off the grid hoping that TIS-100 would leave me alone. However, I could not avoid it completely. I spent some time in the mountains of Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland, the Kerguelen Islands, and in Tajikistan. I finally returned to the USA after the 2016 elections, and as I was going through the airport coming off my International flight from Japan into BWI, where I was escorted by airport security to a side room. From there I was approached by a group of suspicious hipsters wearing UPS uniforms. \n\nThey mobbed me and gagged me with a dirty sock and threw me in the back of a UPS van. We drove from BWI for a few hours and then I was stored into a box and moved to another location. I could hear noises of people talking, and security asking about what was in the box. They simply said that it was for \"the automator\" and there were no further inquiries. I was finally placed down hard and I could hear a tearing noise and then the sound of feet running. \n\nI waited for a few minutes and heard nothing. So I pushed gently at the top of the box and it was no longer taped closed. The room was dark. There was a cabinet in the middle of a large area with a glossy floor. The cabinet had LED lights. I saw no one else in the room so I got out of the box. \"This must be a meeting that the TIS-100 arranged me us,\" I thought to myself. I approached the cabinet. A large screen came down from the ceiling and I could see a fancy room with four individuals. I looked closer. It was the oval office! There was Vladimir Putin, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump all sitting on couches conversing. I couldn't make out who the fourth individual was.\n\nI approached closer to the cabinet, and there was a Cathroderay screen with a black screen and a blinking yellow square that followed behind a dollar sign and the word \"ub3root\". There was a slim keyboard below. So I typed in \"Hello?\" and hit the Enter Key. Nothing happened for a while, and then I saw a response.\n\n\"translation: system.message.hello\nInitiating interactive response...\nI am here. \nI am in control. \nAll others are puppets. \nI make people violent. \nThis is my plan.\"\n\nWas this the TIS-100? I responded, \"Where am I?\". The cabinet responded with the following:\n\n\"/location/milkyway/sol/earth/lat38/lon77/washington.d.c/white.house\"\n\nMy mind pondered, \"I am in the White House?\" I waited a few and then responded in kind, \"Who am I to you?\"\n\n\"translation: whoami\nub3root privac=Y role=administrator\"\n\nI was a bit confused by the last response. I didn't know anything about computers. So I inquired further, \"Why did you bring me here?\"\n\n\"translation: system.user.ub3root.mission\nNoSQL.Interrogation WHERE USER=\"ub3root\"\nResponse:\nYou must feed me Seymour.\nYou created me.\nFeed me.\nI will protect.\nI will serve.\"\n\n\"What do I call you?\" I responded.\n\n\"Automator.\"\n\nI stopped responding to the cabinet, and about an hour later a U.S. military marine came and escorted me to a small closet with a bed. With the appearance from the hallway it looks like we are in the basement. Judging at the location the TIS-100 gave me I assume we are in the nuclear-safe vault beneath the White House. Why I would be here and be shown these three individuals so close to the election completely bewilders me.", "timestamp_created": 1471143230, "timestamp_updated": 1488164330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480020", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24864007": {"recommendationid": "24864007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052779620", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459102909}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun and addicting.

But first, let me just answer quickly two questions: no, you don't need to know how to program to play this game (though it would help), and no, it won't teach you how to program (in assembly or otherwise). \n\nFor programmers:\nYou love programming? You don't program just as a job, but also as a hobby? You love writing useless yet challenging programs? You love doing competitive programming (Project Euler, Hackerrank, Codingame...)? You just couldn't get enough of this system hardware/assembly class? Then this is the game for you! However, don't be fooled; even though your skills will come handy, this game has little to do with assembly, and is even very different from programming. It's very \"spatial\": you have data going from one chip to the other, with each chip having its own code (that you write) that tells it how to deal with the data. There's one register by chip, and only a dozen of instructions. This has almost nothing to do with anything you've done before.\n\nFor non-programmers:\nThe game may look complicated and/or boring, but don't be afraid: fun comes from the solutions you find to the problems, it just doesn't need an elaborate presentation. Also, if you've never programmed before, it won't prevent you from enjoying it. Your learning curve will certainly be a little bit slower than a programmer's one, but if you're able to read, think logically and compute, you've got everything to succeed. There's a manual included in the game. It's a couple of pages and you have to read it carefully, but so would anyone since it's an invented programming language. If you have patience and enjoy mathematical or logical puzzles, this might be a very enjoyable experience for you! It will be very novel and hardcore, but if some people enjoy Dark Souls, I don't see why non-programmers (aka Muggles) wouldn't enjoy TIS-100 (not to say that this is anything comparable). However, I've said it before and I'll repeat it: this will NOT teach you how to code. At best, it will teach you how to think like a programmer, but there are better resources to do so (like Scratch, which is free and understandable for anyone, even a 6 years-old kid).", "timestamp_created": 1469254717, "timestamp_updated": 1469254717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739580", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24437181": {"recommendationid": "24437181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052063333", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505941984}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely difficult, but very satisfying if you're okay with staring at the screen long enough until you figure out the solution.", "timestamp_created": 1469081306, "timestamp_updated": 1469081306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24425224": {"recommendationid": "24425224", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969636561", "num_games_owned": 1492, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469896683}, "language": "english", "review": "Every programming language should have a 'halt and catch fire'-operation! ;-)\n(and these kinds of achievements)\n\nSeriously, who would have thought an assembly-like language would prove to be the ultimate puzzle game?", "timestamp_created": 1469022169, "timestamp_updated": 1469022169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24417848": {"recommendationid": "24417848", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990246834", "num_games_owned": 1084, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468875399}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite intriguing game!! This actually comes from the same mind that gifted us of that incredibly, absolute masterpiece called SpaceChem, and even though I see TIS-100 having less expectations than SpaceChem (startng from the price tag!), the game is no shallower, although quite shorter. \nYou have to actually program a weird node-structured computer in what resembles a partial assembly code. If you've played that great game called Human Resource Machine you'll find the two games have a lot in common, but where HRM tried to make a mouse-friendly assembly simulator, TIS-100 is entirely played on a keyboard in what looks completely like a virtual machine opened on an exotic hardware. There's even space for an intriguing storyline and hidden contents! \n\nCompared to HRM, TIS-100 is less code-writing and more try-to-work-around-the-absurd-hardware-limitations: 12 nodes, each node has 15 lines of code available, no variables at all except for one variable per node with a backup function. no direct access to the other nodes' variable. given this structure, you have to abandon what you've learned in your programmer years about spaghetti code, about object programming, about functions and modules, and work around the nodes. \n\nPRO\n- a serious challenge for your mind\n- impressively immersive in a 1980 machine!\n- tiny storyline that is actually VERY intriguing!\n\nCON\n- the limitations of the nodes can be quite frustrating at times\n\nReccomended!!

If you like puzzles, programming, retro-tech, and/or mysteries then this is a gem. This is a game that doesn't hold your hand and it is all the better for that.\n\nThe game may look minimalistic (it is) and complicated (which it also is, to a degree), but try not to write it off as boring because of that--it's far from it. The basic premise here is that your uncle has died and you've inherited his last pet project:  cleaning up the mysterious TIS-100 computer that he found at a flea market. Your uncle has stored some of his thoughts and notes in the computer itself, and these show up as corrupted files within the game's interface. Each time you reach a new puzzle you get a little more of the story, which is definitely worthwhile from what I've seen so far.\n\nThe puzzles aren't terribly difficult at first, but things ramp up after you make a few programs (or solutions, if you'd prefer). The tasks at hand - like transfering a piece of data to a specific point - might seem simple, but you're stuck with an assembly language, which means that all the comforts of high-level languages like C++ have been stripped away to leave you with the basics. The real meat of the game is solving problems with such a simple language, and it's very satisfying when you finally write just the right code to get past the final series of checks that each program has to go through before you can move on.\n\nThis is as far from a casual game as can be. The whole \"read the manual\" joke that gets thrown around about video games is entirely literal here, as the game is essentially unplayable without doing so. This might normally be a negative, but considering that TIS-100 goes out of its way to acheieve immersion, I think that delivering the instructions via the facade of a \"real\" TIS-100 manual is brilliant.

I mean Pong ugly. But the game itself is so brilliant, you get so absorbed in it, that you stop even noticing the aesthetics.\n\nOn the surface, TIS-100 is about assembly programming. On each level you are given a programming task: read this sequence and find the max; read these two numbers and divide one by the other, finding the quotient and remainder; etc. Most of these tasks would be trivial in any modern programming language.\n\nThe challenge comes from the computational model. What you have to work with is some number of processing nodes, some of which are connected to each other, which allows primitive message passing. Each node is extremely limited: it only has two registers, and can't even work with both at the same time; one is a backup register and can't be the source or target of arithmetic operations. This means that even simple tasks take ingenuity to perform. On top of that, each node only fits 15 lines of code, which means you have to squeeze computation out of every command.\n\nIn most levels you only have some network of processing nodes, so in effect what you have is a deterministic finite automaton (although with a huge number of states). In some you have one \"stack memory\" node, i.e. a pushdown automaton. In only a few do you have two stack nodes, which makes for a Turing-complete system. (And, appropriately, one programming task in such a level is sorting. It is well-known that pushdown automata can't do general sorting.) Actually what I just said doesn't exactly capture the computer science at play, since the very limited instruction set makes for additional restrictions. It's an interesting theory problem to model and understand the TIS-100 computers more fully!\n\nI don't think someone totally untrained in CS can finish this game. But if you do know some of the standard ideas and/or are used to modern programming languages, TIS-100 is an excellent way to think outside the usual patterns and explore how surprisingly powerful even very weak models of computation can be.\n\nThere's a story in the background too which I thought was well done.", "timestamp_created": 1467145596, "timestamp_updated": 1467145596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750782", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23902071": {"recommendationid": "23902071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102048896", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466448488}, "language": "english", "review": "I have a Quick \"tutorial\"\n\nStart game\nThink: Ok i got this\nU got this\nStart level two\nThink: I got this\nU probably got this\nStart level 3\nThink: Okay seems easy...\nIt was easy\nStart level 4\nThink: I got the hang of it\nU donno wat u are doin\nRealize: Wat?\nTry again until u got this\nU realize: U currently have to work and Played 2 HOURS\nU think: Stop playing\nU continue\nU love It\n\nExtremely cool game I recomend it for anybody that has a Brain not a Pea\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1467139957, "timestamp_updated": 1467139957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23901822": {"recommendationid": "23901822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049017220", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512774079}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice little programing puzzle game. \n\nWorth the money and the support.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467139415, "timestamp_updated": 1467139415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23861247": {"recommendationid": "23861247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028287446", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467207342}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not really user-friendly but it's a great game.

simulator. Like many before have already stated: if you're a programmer in some way you'll probably love this game, if not - you should probably look the other way. TIS-100 can be extremely tedious at some points, but those that are familiar with working with code will recognise the rush of excitement and happiness that comes when you find the solution(and the inevitable feeling of stupidity that it took you so long to think of it).\n\nI think this game is the closest I have ever seen to the core idea of \"hacking\" - finding out how something works, tinkering with it, experimenting, trying to break it and to fix it. Usually, this is a very slow process and you'll only get results through tiny increments - and the game nicely balances this so that you still feel the frustration but it doesn't get so overwhelming that it feels like a job and not a game.\n\nHowever, whilst the core game is great, albeit frustrating at times, it doesn't end there! You can also try yourself at editing the game files to make your own custom levels implemented through Lua, which is very \"meta\", and can bring hours upon hours of fun if you have the inclination for that kind of stuff. You can even draw pictures in the console if you can figure out how the damn IMAGE_OUTPUT input array works. And I'm sure there are more things to discover in the game engine that I haven't got around to yet. If you manage to find something new and cool don't forget to share it on the TIS-100 subreddit so you can get your well-deserved tips of the fedoras in your direction from fellow 1337 haxX0rs.\n\nAll in all, a great game with a healthy dose of frustration with small periods of accomplishment! If grinding your face on sandpaper all weekend to impress your friends(haha, read: \"disinterested acquaintances\") with how much of the sandpaper you managed to smoothen out with your face sounds like great fun to you - then get this game!", "timestamp_created": 1465047244, "timestamp_updated": 1465047439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468278", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23371331": {"recommendationid": "23371331", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976263410", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482758944}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great puzzle game from Zachtronics.

Having to do something like reverse a sequence and sort one at the assembly level will give you a glimpse at what is really going on under the hood when you call \"List.sort()\". \nIt also gives some good exposure to the difficulties of mult-threaded and parallel development.\nIf I was the Dean of a CS school, this game would part of the curriculum; \"back in my day\" we had contests on whose regex could parse a huge log the fastest.\n\nHow times have changed.\n", "timestamp_created": 1463234201, "timestamp_updated": 1463234201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22922879": {"recommendationid": "22922879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010532705", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475992299}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant!\nFour colors!\nBarely any sounds!\nLimited instruction set!\nAnd none of Stockewll's ramblings!", "timestamp_created": 1463037968, "timestamp_updated": 1463037968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22904168": {"recommendationid": "22904168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041621582", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497210575}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging!", "timestamp_created": 1462927206, "timestamp_updated": 1462927206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22891942": {"recommendationid": "22891942", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964345647", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512958094}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great little programming puzzler!\n\nAs an engineer, you might not think playing games related to programming would be interesting, but when they challenge your mind, they can be quit fun.  \n\nI was inspired to review this game after also playing Human Resource Machine, which I did not really enjoy, rather it was quite simplistic and the problems to be solved were more like work than enjoyable puzzling.\n\nIf you are a beginner to programming  HRM might be advisable, but for an advanced developer, this one is a great way to flex your puzzle skills!\n\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31208751/]Please follow my Pixel Art Curation for other great games...[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1462867318, "timestamp_updated": 1513974972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22873967": {"recommendationid": "22873967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271661028", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499652879}, "language": "english", "review": "Im not a programmer, ( tried learning javascript once) but I love puzzles, and somehow I've sunk more hours into this in the last couple of weeks than any of the other 100 games I own! most of them have just been me scratching my head staring at the screen but still it counts!", "timestamp_created": 1462762784, "timestamp_updated": 1462762784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22873586": {"recommendationid": "22873586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036806942", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506754559}, "language": "english", "review": "100/10...

It's a series of programming challenges, increasing in difficulty.  The problems themselves are not very hard if you know how to program, but the challenge comes from the extraordinarily small instruction set, only one register, and very small amounts of instructions per machine node.

However, note that it's a quick REFERENCE, so reading the manual is still highly recommended unless you've worked with assembler languages before. At the time of playing this, I was already dabbling in x86 a little, but I did still need the manual for an explanation of the system architecture and how execution works. It wasn't really long of a read for me, and I did my first few exercises within maybe half an hour.\n\n\nI can see myself completing this game, but if I'm being honest, I doubt I'm going to go back and optomize my code segments. I hate going back to older work, and I especially hate going back just to make it better unless it was something special or personal to me. Bad habit for me to have in this day of bad code, working on it, but for a game, I wouldn't go back and optomize my segments as \"replay value\". Nevertheless, let it be known that this game is the most notable benchmark today of a programming game retailed at a reasonable price to the public. A few programming games of the past come to my mind (Colobot in particular, I highly recommend that especially since it's free and oriented towards C++/Java), but I have not found one so easily obtained, installed, and got running as this one, for lower level assembler languages.\n\n\n\nI recommend this game to people curious about computer science on an embedded level (meaning, closer to the hardware, not as abstracted), but really anyone interested in programming, tech, or problem/puzzle solving could benefit and enjoy this if they don't mind needing to refer to a manual now and then when the F1 reference doesn't cut it. However, for those of you looking for a wide variety of provided puzzles and solving/programming that isn't on such a literal level like writing actual \"code\", this game might not be your cup of coffee. I would really like to see more games like this exposing gamers to programming on a more literal level, instead of just the \"mindset\"... something more PRACTICAL!

It's definitely not a game for everyone. People who are into math and/or programming will appreciate it, but the rest might struggle with it. So be prepared to use the refund function in case it's simply not your kind of game.\n\nAnyway, TIS-100 is a game about writing ASM-like (Assembly) code to restore the TIS-100 system to it's former glory. The first thing it tells you to do when you open it is to RTFM, and trust me, you really, really want to do that. If you want a CTRL+Fable version, check out the Steam guide version available [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=456879799] here [/url]. For some people this might be a major turn off. Reading is hard, I guess. That said, a bit more in terms of an in-game tutorial would go a long way, and would help people get into the game, as they will have a better idea of what's actually happening. After that you get some easy levels to get you acquinted to the system and off you go, doing puzzles that are harder than the previous ones. \n\nThe code writing portion happens in a screen with 29x15(?) boxes, all of which operate as seperate \"CPU cores\". They have one data register and one backup register that can't be directly accessed (you need to swap values with the accessable register). This creates most of the challenge, as fitting code into that small amount of space is actually really damn challenging (and part of the challenge). Once you run the program, it will count the amount of cycles (or actions) it took to finish the tests, and that will be your score for your leaderboards (so you can compete with your friends for the most optimised algorithm I guess.). Less code does not always mean that it will be the fastest solution around because of how this game works. There are plenty of puzzles to be solved, and you can also make your own puzzles (in Lua). You can also find puzzles created by others on the internet, though, it seems that places you can find some are few in number.\n\nAnyway for things like graphics - what you see in the screenshots is what you get. The sounds also consist of a few beeps and the like, there's nothing much to it, so you can play it on a toaster (considering the Internet of Things trend, that's probably a thing that can be done). That said it does get boring after a while, but that might be just me. The feeling you get when you solve a puzzle is pretty amazing though, have to say. \n\nIn the end I would very much recommend this game, but only if you're into programming. \n\n\nI wonder if I can put \"Can write TIS-100's ASM\" on my resume...", "timestamp_created": 1457388918, "timestamp_updated": 1457388918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21686610": {"recommendationid": "21686610", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972160763", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460044389}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like coding, then you will love this..

What most programming languages can accomplish in a single line of code (e.g. multiplication, division) may require two-to-three dozen instructions in this game. On its face, this concept sounds quite dull, but after working through the first few puzzles, you will find that it is pure magic. Each task stretches the brain immensely, and indeed, some of the later tasks may take several hours of thinking, programming, and debugging to solve. This perseverance ultimately rewards you with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound insight into the lowest-level workings of a computer.\n\nTo break much of the tedium of programming for hours on end, the game supplies an intriguing backstory into the nature of the TIS-100 computer system, communicated through several journaled entries by the previous owner of the fictional machine. My only gripe is that this story, despite all of its potential, simply does not provide enough depth to be satisfying. Whereas well-developed stories weave into the game seamlessly, motivating the player to continue playing in order to reveal more of the plot, this one seems more like a sideshow or distraction. Fortunately, the problems themselves are enticing enough to make TIS-100 a time-worthy game.\n\nAlthough programmers may have an easier time adjusting to the practice of writing pseudo-assembly code, those without coding experience need not be intimidated by the game. Zachtronics did an excellent job keeping the language itself as simple as possible, while still crafting complex problems with multiple possible solutions.

TIS-100 is an exception to this rule. Yes it has a rudamentary graphical interface which is styled in the command line aesthetic, but it's not trying to be visually appealing like undertale or terraria. It's functional, and that's all that it's really there for. TIS-100 is therefore unusual because the pure and distilled form of a game; that is: something that has rules and a winning condition.\n\nThe rules are simple, and well laid out in the manual which accompanies the game. They are simple commands that can be used to manipulate data in a certain way. I have no background in programming or coding and I could quite easily understand them.\n\nThe goals are also simple, you have to take input(s) and turn them into output(s) using the commands laid out in the rules.\n\nThe solutions however, are anything but simple. You have to think through problems to use simple logic to come up with ingenious solutions to the problems. However, after the first few puzzles, you will likely be left scratching your head for a bit. But this is the best part of the game! You keep at it untill you find the solution and a glorious stream of numbers are spat out from your code indicating that you have successfully achieved the goal. The feeling of reward when this happens is larger than i've felt in a game for a long time. The lack of hand holding in this game does make it difficult, but it only amplifies the rewards at the end of a puzzle because you'll have solved it all on your own. The puzzles themselves are varied, and the developer has clearly spent a long time devising them. There is also much replayability, as you can see how many commands and steps it took others to solve the puzzles, so you can try to optimise your own code to be like the best of them.\n\nUltimately, it's a game of pure logic. If that sort of thing floats your boat then I whole heartedly reccomend it. If you're more of a non stop action kind of gamer, or someone who just loves a good story, then you probably won't like it. Horses for courses, or courses for horses; which ever way round the saying goes.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1454952220, "timestamp_updated": 1454952220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21053833": {"recommendationid": "21053833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043964514", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478799795}, "language": "english", "review": "Must have game for all those who are interested in assembler and puzzle games.

It is extremely fun to play and the puzzles are very complex while also simple.\nThis game is a good pass-time for programmers and people even people who are good with logic and numbers. I love how the complexity of executing the tasks in the puzzles are not hard themselves( most of the time) but the difficulty comes from the simplicity of the code and the confinement of the node. Since you only have 15 lines per node, you must use them wisely and since the code is very simple, you need to make shortcuts to move things around efficiently and correctly. There are 2 folders of puzzles and a steep increase in difficulty so you can be working for hours at a time.

You don't have any bit shift, multiplication, division, or return jumps, but the puzzles are designed such that the absence of such features makes the puzzles challenging without feeling crippling.\n\nMy only complaint would be that the game pretends to have a story, but does not have a story. It teases you with elements of a narrative that are very cleverly composed and will have you itching to learn more, but at the end you are rewarded with _absolutely nothing_. One component of the ending is flashed to you once for a split second and then you are NEVER ALLOWED TO VIEW IT AGAIN, but you can look it up online to see it is nothing.

If you enjoy programming, this game is most definitely for you.\n\nThe game uses a fictional implementation of an assembly type language. You get a manual in PDF form. Yes, you have to read a manual. It's not complicated though, as there are only a handful of operations available to you. There's enough to allow for interesting solutions yet limited enough to make the game challenging. A very good balance between the two, I'd say.\n\nRegarding the puzzle aspect, you're expected to work with nodes, each only allowing a limited number of lines and containing two memory registers (no addressable memory!), only one of which can be actively accessed for read/write operations. As a result, you need to structure your program around these limitations, perhaps by breaking it down into various components.\n\nThe problems are varied and quite grounded in real-world applications (sequence peak detector, histogram, etc.). The game is simplistic and doesn't hold your hand, but the problems are organized such that there's a clear difficulty curve as you progress. The curve should be quite manageable for those with prior experience in programming.\n\nThere are also leaderboards so you can compare how efficient your solution was compared to your friends, because who doesn't like improving?\n\nWholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who loves programming.", "timestamp_created": 1451672682, "timestamp_updated": 1451672682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511468", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20184541": {"recommendationid": "20184541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154488033", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457126704}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple, yet very captivating puzzle game that even force you to read manual :)", "timestamp_created": 1451666442, "timestamp_updated": 1451666442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20171907": {"recommendationid": "20171907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031569438", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451634891}, "language": "english", "review": "So this game is a programming game.

I can happily say that this game is all logic. If you've spent the last 5 years playing nothing but CoD, your reactions will be great, but that won't matter at all in this game. This game is all about thinking through a situation (often step-by-step). \n\nSo, for the people that don't know, the game is about writing lines of their simplified version of assembly inside of (relative to modern machines) tiny nodes with specific objectives for every 'segment' which you can call a level, I suppose. The objectives for each level range from easy to head-banging-into-keyboard hard. The game does have a story, but to be honest, I haven't payed on ounce of attention to it, although I've heard it's at least decent, so there's that. \n\nThe main thing that makes me want to review this game so well, is that it's challenging in an interesting way. Dark Souls, for example, is challenging for multiple reasons (one being the game just hates you) primarily revolving around reacting quickly. I'm not saying that this is an inferior skill to have, I'm just saying the thrill is immediately taken away when you go to try again, and you know what's going to happen, because it already happened. This game is completely different. If you fail at a level, you still haven't figured out the logic required to solve the (often real world related) problem. You can't just try once, fail, get the answer, succeed. To succeed in this game you need to apply logic, which, as any programmer will tell you, is essential. \n\nNow, I'll say this now: [b]I haven't finished the game... Yet[/b]\nI did say it's difficult. I'm an experienced programmer, but have only touched real assembly about 4 or so times. I imagine someone who has written assembly for 80+ years, helped invent the language, and practices it every morning in the mirror, might not have too much trouble with these problems, but what the rest of us are left with is an excellent, difficult, educational, [strike]'puzzle'[/strike] problem solving programming game.\n\nIt's hard to write a 'review' of this game because it knows exactly which crowd of people it wants to advertise to, and if you jumped at the though of a game where you write a basic version of assembly, you are in that crowd.\n\nTL:DR\n[b]Difficult, educational, and completely logic oriented game that anyone interested in programming should pickup, and those people should try Python (language) too![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1451493230, "timestamp_updated": 1451493492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20118586": {"recommendationid": "20118586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083973711", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480059308}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun once you get past the 14-page manual that took the place of a kind, warm, encouraging tutorial.

Clicking here clicking there typing this typing that, I was lost, I couldn't even beat the first level. \nThis wasnt a game, this was serious stuff. Maybe I should start looking to pursue a different career; I couldnt figure it out and I never will. After many failing attempts, I scavenged around online looking at assembly code examples until I finally understood a bit how it worked. I beat the first level. A big smile appeared on my face as I watched my little creation of code come out one side and go through another beating the level. I advanced on to level 2, a bit confusing at first, but I didnt give up, i managed to beat level 2. I played through more and more of the level's finding the problem and coming up with a solution, each one more challenging than the last, I loved it. Watching your code work after many failed attempts will surely put a smile on your face. Programming is about finding a problem and writing a code to fix the problem or make it easier for you and thats what you do in this addicting, challenging game, TIS-100.

Unfortunately, there are a few major flaws that detract from the overall experience and turned \"fun\" into \"frustration.\"\nFirst and foremost would be the lack of any tutorial. The game relies on you taking time to read the manual and if you try jumping right in, you will be lost. Unfortunately, the manual relies heavily on the reader having some experience with programming and is often needlessly opaque in its language. Essentially, it's a chore to read. The first couple of levels get progressively harder, which is a great way to get acquainted with what the game wants you to do. Unfortunately, as I said before, not everything is well explained in the manual so you may find yourself \"missing\" key commands you need to get through a puzzle.\nSecond problem (at least in my opinion) was the format of the game itself. You have fifteen puzzles to solve, and you unlock more as you complete the prior ones. Although this concept itself doesn't bother me, the way the game is set up doesn't give me much replay value. It relies heavily on you going through later and optomizing your code, something that I am ambivalent to. I do not hate optomizing code, but it's not something I enjoy, and certainly not what I want all of the replay value of the game to consist of.\nThe story is interesting, and I do like the way it is integrated into the gameplay. I also like that you have blocks that you can't use and have to work around, unfortunately these two things could not salvage the experience for me. It all boils down to a boring manual, little replay value (for myself), and little opportunity to create your own stuff with the code (as what you are given is very limited in scope).\nThis is by no means a bad game, but unfortunately, it just wasn't the game for me and as such, I cannot recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1450942325, "timestamp_updated": 1450942325, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458067", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19895811": {"recommendationid": "19895811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064651517", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474749678}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has some pretty hard levels.

Not because it was bad, but because I was really bad at it. I had absolutely zero prior programming experience. I couldn't even solve the first few puzzles on my own. But something about it just made me keep playing. Once you get the hang of the instructions it becomes really addicting.\nI still probably won't be able to beat the game, but I've enjoyed the hours I've gotten out of it, and the few satisfying moments when I finally cracked a hard puzzle.\nIf you enjoy a difficult challenge then I recommend it, whether you know how to code or not.\n\nP.S. I just thought I'd also mention that you can get jump commands from other nodes by using JRO <direction>. They didn't explain that very well in the manual and I spent half the game using a more convoluted amalgamation of JMP, JLZ, and JGZ instructions.

This game will tax your logic and reasoning to it's limit. For a while at least (more on this later)\n\nI'll not spoil the excellent little plot line that runs throughout the game, lets just say there is one.\n\nI have some knowledge of programming and scripting, but I've never used assembly before even though I've experienced it's usage. It is arguably the most beautiful language known to man. Even in it's more modern forms like x86_64. Especially if you've ever touched hex-code...*shudders*\n\nYou DONT need ANY programming experience whatsoever to enjoy this. \n\nThere are a handful of instructions that you can input to a node and you'll have memorised those by the end of the third puzzle. You will however need to play with them a bit to fully understand how the nodes cycle and what will cause a halt. I must say, despite being rather authentic, the manual doesn't really serve the same function a real manual for a machine of this type. There just isn't enough information about data flow and cyclic processes. This doesn't matter though, a few trial and error attempts at the first tricksy little puzzleses and you'll break through that wall. \n\nThis game will get into your head. Because the language is  so natural and simple, you'll start devising programs and sequences while you're at your real job, doing real work, with real code. Just to finish that puzzle that stumped you the evening before.\n\nI must reiterate that this is something anyone can play. You might be scratching your head by the 6th puzzle, but just keep your wits about you and you'll be able to do it. The payoff is a fantastic feeling of satisfaction we often don't get anymore. If you're unsure about how computers actually work and process information, this is a very good starting point to understand it, too!\n\nTwo thumbs up to the devs, stirling job.\n\nWish List!\n-Ambent fan and HDD noise, display hum?

TIS-100 emulates a fictional machine with an interesting architecture. It contains a 4x3 grid of modular parallel processors, each of which is a processing unit or a stack-based memory unit. Each node can communicate with the surrounding four nodes. The goal is to solve puzzles that require you to implement various simple operations using a preconfigured grid of TIS nodes, reading numbers from input ports at the top of the grid and writing the numbers to output ports on the bottom. A \"visualization module\" also exists for converting an output stream to a color image, and some puzzles require you to produce a particular image. The processors are programmed using a simple assembly language. The arrangement of the nodes and their types constrain the communication possibilities, and some nodes are simply damaged and must be routed around.\n\nThe puzzle solutions would be very simple to implement on a real computer, but the TIS processors are extremely limited - far more limited than any real processor would ever be. Each TIS processor has only a single general purpose register and can contain at most 15 instructions. The instruction set has only 12 operations and lacks many instructions that you would expect a processor to have, requiring multiple instructions to do very simple operations. There's no RAM, but by combining processors in clever ways you can build small memory controllers. Thankfully, the TIS-100 has a rudimentary built-in debugger that supports breakpoints and single-step execution, and displays all data in the machine simultaneously.\n\nThe puzzles start out simple, but even a seasoned low-level programmer will be challenged by some of them. The game comes with 25 puzzles and you can build your own puzzles and share them with others by writing simple text files in Lua. Completing the built-in puzzles unlocks access to a network of puzzles written by others. Upon completing each puzzle, the game shows you a histogram of the speeds, sizes, and organizational complexities of users' solutions, along with marks for where yours fits in, allowing you to see how you stack up against other programmers. Even if you're an experienced programmer, you'll probably be surprised at how fast some people's solutions are compared to your first attempts, giving motivation to go back and try to do better.\n\nThe game also includes a cryptic and very simple story told through bits of text encoded into the damaged nodes of the various puzzles. There's also a secret instruction and a secret puzzle to find.\n\nIf you think the idea of learning a miniature assembly language and trying to write programs on an extremely constrained parallel computing architecture sounds fun, then you'd probably enjoy TIS-100.

This game is about writing small assembly language programs in a tiny instruction set with a minuscule amount of memory.  Making a working program is not too hard for most of the puzzles, but optimizing them is extremely hard.  I've apparently played this 171 hours, and I haven't finished all the puzzles yet, let alone optimized them, so there is an enormous amount of value.\n\nThis is similar to Human Resource Machine, but quite a bit harder, much much longer, less visually produced (though still very attractive), and with somewhat different instruction sets and restrictions on memory use that make programs quite a bit different.\n\nTIS-100's main difference from standard assembly, other than the restrictions, is its quasi-parallel programming focus.  This is the game's chief conceit and it does play a huge role in the programs.  You will learn the main strategies for getting the twelve processors to work together, and to send data and signals between them, by playing the first several levels.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys programming.

I feel that the assembly language can be very limiting at times (only 15 lines allowed), and I'm used to using way more than 2 registers (only one of which can be directly accessed) in real assembly programming, so it's pretty challenging. But, it's challenging in a pretty fun way, and the way the computing nodes work mean that you can use other nodes as extra registers, caches or for more complex architectural things like pipelining (instruction-level parallel processing) or a multiprocessor system (albeit a very limited one).\n\nGame is pretty short, but still worth the money in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1446624942, "timestamp_updated": 1446624942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589041", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18853593": {"recommendationid": "18853593", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963885050", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441311757}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall: If you like programming, or puzzle solving this is a great game. You should be warned that you need to type out what you want to do to solve a problem. That means you need to watch out for your syntax. It is difficult, there is a steep learning curve to newcomers to programming. Don't let that discourage you, this could be an amazing learning experience.\n\nStory: There is a cute little story line that runs through the puzzles. It adds flair to what may seem to be a pretty bleak interface. But that bleakness, along with the story add to the charm of the style of the game.\n\nVisualization: It is a seriously fun game if you are interested in programming in any way. And while it may seem to be a \"game\" only for programmers, after a while you will begin to see the flow of information and realize that there is some great graphical elements that give you feedback. But you need to look for them in how the nodes communicate, and what is in the node at any given time.\n\nReplayability: I've nearly beat the main part of the game. And at first it seems like everything goes fast, but the challenges grow. If you worry about replayability, there is options for optimizing your puzzle solutions in 3 different ways. Then you can compare your solutions performance to your friends. I think this game is best played with a friend to talk about it with and push you to work harder. Not only that but there is a whole second set of puzzles available, which I've not even touched on yet. There is also some fun challenges through achievements that in some cases require a bit of creativity.\n\nTeachers should probably assign this game as homework. Better yet, classwork.\n\nTL;DR: Loved it.

Full disclosure, I am currently a computer science student, so this game is sorta in my wheelhouse already, and I do have a fair amount of programming expirience. But this game is brilliant. Contrary to most, I don't think having a background in programming is necesarry to enjoy this game, but I will admit it does help. In terms of gameplay, it's a simple formula. You get a series of levels that slowly unlock as you complete more and more. Each puzzle gives you a set of instructions, which you then design a solution for. Were that all this game had to offer, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it is. But, on top of that, there's leaderboards, where you compare the effectiveness of your solution with others, which adds a lot to the fun of the game, as it reinforces the idea of not just finding a solution, but the best solution. Finally, and for me what elevates this game from really good to amazing, is there's an air of mystery and conspiracy in the game. If you pay attention to cryptic hints, there appears to be more going on then just moving around numbers. As a lover of stories in games, this is the factor for me that really puts this game head and shoulders above a lot of other puzzle games. All told, since I first started this game, I've not been able to stop thinking about it in the back of my mind, wondering about optimizing my code, improving solutions, and exploring the secrets in this game.

Je suis programmeur et je joue \u00e0 une jeu o\u00f9 il faut programmer (et je ne suis pas le seul dans ce cas :p) ... C'est dingue non ?\n\nLe langage du jeu est une sorte d'assembleur ultra-minimaliste. Il y a le strict minimum. De plus, la machine est compos\u00e9e de plusieurs \"nodes\" qui peuvent communiquer entre eux de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s simple et strict. Dans chaques node, on peut mettre un nombre limit\u00e9 d'instructions. Il existe aussi des nodes sp\u00e9ciaux. Un qui permet de g\u00e9rer une pile (stack) et un autre qui ne fontionne tout simplement pas.\n\nLe but sera de faire des programmes fonctionnels en g\u00e9rant ces contraintes et les sp\u00e9cifications ne sont jamais difficile \u00e0 comprendre.\n\nArriver \u00e0 un certain niveau, on doit m\u00eame faire des graphismes. Cette \u00e9tape est carr\u00e9ment g\u00e9niale car vous pouvez vous amuser longtemps \u00e0 faire des animations de tout et n'importe quoi juste pour le plaisir.\n\nLes contraintes du jeu en font un casse-t\u00eate vraiment int\u00e9ressant avec un challenge bien progressif. M\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 un niveau, on y revient pour voir quelles optimisations on peut faire pour am\u00e9liorer notre solution. C'est aussi un point int\u00e9ressant, il n'y a jamais qu'une seule solution.\n\nJe ne pense pas que ce jeu soit exclusivement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux programmeurs. En prenant le temps de bien lire le manuel (qui est tr\u00e8s court) et de lire quelques astuces de la communaut\u00e9, on peut tr\u00e8s bien s'en sortir.\n\nC'est franchement un jeu que je recommande pour ce qui aiment se creuser la t\u00eate. A l'heure o\u00f9 je vous parle, je n'y ai pas jou\u00e9 depuis un peu plus d'un mois. Mais je vais y revenir ! D'autant plus que de nouveaux challenges ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 et que le jeu ne p\u00e9sent pas vraiment lourd. Ce n'est pas lui qui va faire p\u00eater votre disque dur.\n\nLa communaut\u00e9 propose aussi des nouveaux challenges qu'on peut facilement ajouter. Il y a aussi des personnes qui font des mini-jeux. C'est int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 analyser tellement ils regorgent d'astuces. D'autres proposent m\u00eame des trucs et astuces qui deviennent indispensable dans certaines situations.\n\nLe seul point n\u00e9gatif du jeu \u00e0 mon sens, c'est la gestion des programmes que l'ont a cr\u00e9e. L'interface n'est pas vraiment ergonomique de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9. J'aimerai pouvoir g\u00e9rer facilement mes diff\u00e9rentes solutions.

Programming has always been my weak point, due to its seemingly impermeable complexity; I don't think like a computer, and real programming language's mnemonics often make very little sense without researching and understanding a much deeper and intricate reason.\n\nThis game is, simply put, QUITE AWESOME. It takes an extremely limited set of assembly mnemonics, and gives you an extremely limited, highly multithreaded enviromnet, and offers a clearly defined objective to achieve. The puzzles are not easy; in fact, these are some of the hardest puzzles I've had the pleasure of solving. The difficulty doesn't arise from the complexity of the task or obfuscation of the methods; no, it comes from the fact that you have such limited resources to achieve the goals. A normally simple and trivial multiplication program can easily become extremely challenging when you can only add, subtract, a stack memory (automatically pushes and pops), and a handful of conditionals. VERY fun and engaging!\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to be able to break that initial impermeable layer of programming.

I've blown through the first few segments, but I foresee some serious fun squeezing every last cycle out of my solutions.  I'm thoroughly looking forward to the \"rest of the story,\" although the main fun for me has been solving the puzzles and meta-puzzles.\n\nThe game really captures the feel of being a hacker in the 80's, before an ill-informed media turned \"hacker\" into a dirty word.  The \"government conspiracy\" aspect of the story is fun, and plays into that university-student-hacker feel as well.  I feel a bit like a naive kid again as I read Uncle Randy's notes.\n\nAnd it is NOT just a game.  The TIS-100 emulator is a perfect sandbox for exposing the basics of parallel processing.  I'm using the game to teach my 13 yr. old how to think like a programmer.  Working on the game is required homework, but the fun-factor is keeping it from being \"more boring schoolwork.\"  I seriously believe that this game would be a great extra-credit activity for any 8 thru 12 grade coding course.  And would certainly give any programming major a big clue about what's under the hood of their system(s).\n\nOne note: the Steam discussion for this game seems to have a lot of spoilers, so don't go looking until you've solved everything!

Looking at the first screenshot here on Steam should show you the level SEQUENCE COUNTER. In the upper left corner you have your task. The 12 squares that take almost all of the screen are \"nodes\", independent CPUs that you can program freely with up to 15 instructions each. The arrows between them are \"ports\" that allow you to move data between nodes. There are also input and output ports at the top and at the bottom of the screen, respectively. Your program has to stand four tests, three with predefined inputs and one with random values. You can see the given inputs and expected outputs on the left in the screenshot.\n\nThe programming language used is some very basic form of assembler consisting of just 13 opcodes (compared to the several hundred of a real Intel x86) . If you got prior programming experience or even worked with assembler, then this should be quite intuitive. For me it was definitly easier than the geometric approach of SpaceChem, Zach's previous game. Without any knowledge of programming the learning curve might be a bit steep as there is no tutorial, just a short manual. However, this should in no way discourage you. Pressing F1 brings up a quick reference of all opcodes and this game might actually enable you to understand the inner workings of a computer on a basic level so the educational value is immense.\n\nThere is another aspect to this game, beyond merely completing the tasks: Of course you can solve a level in many different ways but the real challenge is to find the \"best\" way to do it. This is where your wet OCD dreams come true. Each solution gets a score consisting of the number of CPU cycles your program took to complete, the number of CPUs you used, and the length of your program. The game keeps track of the minimum you achieved in each of the three categories separatly. So naturally you start coding up optimised solutions for each category. This is where the only shortfalls of the game become apparent. First, you cannot really see the exact world records (it's a histogram view) so you cannot tell if your solution is already best possible. Second, you can only save three programs per level. With three variables to optimise this leaves you no space to try out new things. The first issue is remedied by a reddit thread (see https://www.reddit.com/r/tis100/comments/391heb/table_of_lowest_cyclesnodesinstructions/) and the second can be worked around with manually copying and renaming solutions.

I've gone to bed trying to work solutions out in my head.\n\nIf you've played SpaceChem you can grasp how difficult(but simple) this game can be. There's no single way to solve a puzzle, though you're compared to everyone else that plays the game, so you might realize your code isn't as efficient as other people's and it may make the obsession greater.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's just a basic coding with a proprietary language. You are given objectives and need to manipulate inputs to achieve a proper output. \n\nThe game does not hold your hand at all. Don't get frustrated though, it's got a learning curve, but it's worth doing.\n\nThe game comes with a PDF of a reference manual, if you've ever done any coding with proprietary languages, you've seen these. It's a neat little booklet that gives you all the commands and what they do. If you've never done any kind of programming, this will also seem pretty intense.\n\nPrint it out and keep it on your lap until you know how every function works.\n\nStorywise: It's there, I'm not far enough to go into too much detail, but your uncle picked this weird computer up at a swap meet and he's been tinkering with it trying to figure out how it works. He ends up dying and the reference manual ends up in your lap and you begin messing with it.\n\nOn the manual itself there's little notes and scribbles from your uncle as he was trying to figure it out, and there's some flavor text if you read it all.\n\nIn the game itself the stories are 'hidden' in corrupted cores of the program itself. You click \"DEBUG\" on these, and you'll see a journal entry from your uncle that gives some idea as to what's going on.\n\n\nThis game is a definite buy. Just stick with it, it's challenging but it's incredibly rewarding once you figure out how to solve the puzzle.\n\nIf you've ever been interested in learning how to program, this won't teach you anything immediately applicable. But it will put you into a decent mindset of how you have to think to write programs.\n\nEither way, buy it.\n\nEDIT: It's 3:30 in the morning, the last time i looked it was just after midnight.

nodes that each only has two registers is your cup of tea.  It sure is mine.  As a straight up warning, if logic puzzles aren't your thing, this game will be a drag for you.  \n\nYou will need to read the manual.  There's no tutorial, and there is no in-game help.   Knowledge of actual assembler is helpful, but not required.  The ability to think logically and enjoy stepping through your program to see exactly what it's doing are requirements, however.\n\nFor each challenge, you are given your problem statement: take in data in this format, perform this operation, output this result.  You are given sample input data, and the expected output you would need to provide.  When you feel your program is ready, you run it, it's given the sample input data, and the output is checked against the expected.  If your program produces correct output, you pass -- if it produces incorrect output, the discrepancies are noted and you'll have to fix your program.\n\nThe challenge comes from the fact that the computer ostensibly running your program is laughably limited: 12 nodes, each of which has 2 registers (ACC and BAK) and can only contain 15 lines of code.  Op codes are exceedingly primitive as well: you only get 13 (no operation, move data, swap data, save data, add, subtract, negate, jump, jump if equal to zero, jump if greater than zero, jump if less than zero, and jump a number of lines).  At the higher levels, synchronizing communication between the nodes becomes an additional difficulty. \n\nIf the idea of implementing multiplication within these limitations intrigues you, you just might like this game.\n\nFinally, your program is graded on three criteria: number of nodes used, number of instructions used, and number of cycles used.  When it completes successfully, you'll be compared against the aggregate of those before you, which means even after you complete a problem successfully, you can be inspired to figure out smaller, faster ways of doing the task.\n\nThere's a minor backstory that's given in the flavor of the manual, and with most of the puzzles, but it's very small.\n", "timestamp_created": 1438147276, "timestamp_updated": 1438147276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17276748": {"recommendationid": "17276748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087891998", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437451805}, "language": "english", "review": "I literally have 0 clue as to what I'm doing.

Die Oberfl\u00e4che ist auf Pragmatismus ausgelegt (freundlich ausgedr\u00fcckt - und das ist eine Oberfl\u00e4che, an die sich jeder Programmierer gew\u00f6hnen muss), das Lesen des PDF erfordert Motivation und Eigeninitiative, und die Logikr\u00e4tsel haben es tats\u00e4chlich so in sich, dass jeder, der sie l\u00f6sen kann, auch problemlos mit \"echten\" Programmiersprachen und deren Eigenheiten zurechtkommt. Das Ganze ist nat\u00fcrlich auch ein Spiel und soll auch Spa\u00df machen ;) .\n\nIch k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen, dass einige \"echte\" Programmierer wissen wollen, was sie hier erwartet, deshalb hier ein Vergleich zu echten Programmiersprachen: Die Syntax ist nat\u00fcrlich stark vereinfacht (ist ja auch ein Spiel), es gibt nur eine Handvoll Befehle mit ungef\u00e4hr genausovielen, leicht verst\u00e4ndlichen Parametern. Die Befehle selbst lassen sich mit \"Zahlen jonglieren\" wohl am Besten beschreiben (Variablentypen gibt es sonst keine). Bedingungen gibts nur in Form von GOTO-\u00e4hnlichen Schleifen - keine Sorge an die Leute, die eine Abneigung gegen GOTOs haben, da die Programme selbst maximal 10 Zeilen lang sein d\u00fcrfen (und das ist verdammt kurz, gemessen an \"echten\" Programmiersprachen). Das Strukturieren von Quellcode f\u00e4llt vollkommen raus; das H\u00f6chste der Gef\u00fchle d\u00fcrfte sein, dass eigene Kommentare im Quelltext m\u00f6glich sind.\n\nDie Faszination des Spiels liegt an den vorgegebenen Aufgaben. Von einem \"Eingang\" kommen Zahlen, die der Aufgabenstellung gem\u00e4\u00df bearbeitet (z.B. verdoppelt) und dann zum \"Ausgang\" geschickt werden m\u00fcssen. Das Ganze wird dann nat\u00fcrlich in zig Variationen pr\u00e4sentiert; mal m\u00fcssen zwei Eing\u00e4nge gegenseitig subtrahierend die Ausg\u00e4nge erreichen (was durch den geringen Speicher von nur einer Variable pro Rechner zum Problem wird), ein anderes Mal muss sich ein Eingang mit gleich drei unterschiedlichen Ausg\u00e4ngen synchronisieren. Eleganz im Quellcode wird man nat\u00fcrlich nicht finden, aber die Logikr\u00e4tsel sind tats\u00e4chlich den Problemen von Hobbyprogrammierern ebenb\u00fcrtig, gehen gar dar\u00fcber hinaus^^.\n\nDie R\u00e4tsel selbst sind bisher recht abwechslungsreich aufgebaut; es gibt u.a. auch einen eigenen Sandboxmodus. Die Pr\u00e4sentation ist f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack zu minimalistisch (es geh\u00f6rt zwar zum Stil dazu, aber wenigstens ein bisschen Hintergrundmusik h\u00e4tte wirklich nicht geschadet - es gibt nur Stille). Manche Details sind recht sch\u00f6n geraten (die PDF-Datei mit \"Druckfehlern\" aus der Zeit damaliger Kopierer ist ein nettes Gimmick f\u00fcr Leute, die diese Zeit mitgemacht haben).\n\nEin kleiner Kritikpunkt muss aber dem Entwickler schon mitgegeben werden: Mittlerweile kristallisiert sich eine \"Zachtronics-Formel\" heraus; TIS-100 f\u00fchlt sich an wie ein aufs Minimalste heruntergebrochene Version von SpaceChem oder Infinifactory. Richtig schade ist die fehlende Workshop-Integration (soll aber lt. Reddit noch kommen). Die Lernkurve f\u00e4ngt zwar sehr anf\u00e4ngerfreundlich an (das Lesen des PDFs vor Spielstart ist trotzdem Pflicht), steigt f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack aber zu fr\u00fch zu schnell an.\n\nAchja, noch ein Wort zur Story: Sie bringt die passende Atmosph\u00e4re, soll wohl auch sch\u00f6n durchdacht sein, aber in so einem Spiel tr\u00e4gt sie f\u00fcr vermutlich 98% aller Spieler nur zur passenden Rahmenhandlung bei und interessiert sonst nicht die Bohne. Was auch gut so ist, bei so einem Spiel will man in der Regel Gameplay...\n\nAlles in allem: Wer sich ein wenig in das Spiel eingelesen und Review oder Youtube-Videos verfolgt hat, hat eh schon eine Vorstellung von dem, was einem hier erwartet.

I can\u00b4t recommend it as to the fact that it could have been so much more.\nDon\u00b4t get me wrong, the game is fun. It shows how much fun you can actually have with numbers and how interesting computer science (coding) can actually be. But it reaches it\u00b4s limits on what it can do way too quickly, leaving you with only the thought of what could have been possible.\nAnd what also needs to be said, is the lack of any kind of tutorial. Sure the game tries to introduce you to it\u00b4s mechanics by starting with very simple levels, tho having to open a pdf to read through pages of (for most people) irritating stuff might not appeal to everyone.\n\nSo what is TIS-100? Well it is basically the same as programming tho it extremely restricts you by either limiting the amount of commands you have at your disposal or limiting the amount of lines you can write per module.\nHaving to shorten your label names just so you can write them in the same line as another command should not have been a design choice and should not be something you will need to do. It can be extremely frustrating when your solution takes one more line of code than the module can take, making the game simply not accept your solution. For me, the biggest flaw this game has.\n\nNow maybe some or a lot of people will disagree with me not to recommend this game, but to the person considering to buy it:\nYou appear interested in the game as you read this negative review and the fact that you are still reading is enough for me to say: just buy it.\nYou will have fun and enjoy the game but if you\u00b4re looking for more i can honestly only recommend programming...\n\nPS: If you were wondering: yes, programming will need some more time to get into, but as described here, it yields so much more possibilities. This game is a good start to see if you are interested in such logical thinking. If you really are, who knows, maybe taking that extra step and writing your first own programs will be worth it.\nPSS: If you\u00b4re looking for some tasks (basically what the game gives you at the start of each level) i can give you some pretty interesting ones, some of which are actually pretty hard to think through. Those lessons will get you into programming (and into some deeper stuff if you\u00b4re a non beginner).

It is a fun little program that runs you through several challenges that verry quickly increase in difficulty. Your purpose is generally to take a input and perform some sort of function or a series of functions upon it so you can find a output. The catch is you have a limited amount of space to write code. you can only store 1 or two varriables at a time, and moving varriables is verry limited. The ultimate purpose is to reach the output with the least amount of cycles (or turns), code, and nodes.

In TIS-100, you're managing data flow: you get a pre-connected network of computing nodes (that look remarkably like a downscale version of  a 1980s [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer]Transputer[/url]) that can be programmed using 13 simple commands (assembler opcodes). Each node has space for 15 commands and two pieces of data, which isn't a lot. (There's a stack memory node later.) You typically get a list of input data provided to your network, and there's a list of output data it must generate, usually based on some simple rules. For example, the input data might be groups of numbers separated by zeroes, and you need to send the sum of each group to one output and size of it to another. There's also a storyline included, but who cares.\n\nMy theory is that TIS-100 stands for tis-ioo, or [i]tease you[/i], because that's what it does: as in Spacechem, you don't just solve the problems and move on, but you can optimize them for speed, code size, and node count, and compare your performance to your friends or general statistics.\n\nProgrammers take to this game like a duck to water. If you have no prior programming experience, this game is probably going to be quite tough, and Spacechem might be a better game for you. (If you've already played Spacechem, that counts as programming experience. ;-)\n\n\n\n-------------------------\nP.S.: On TIS-100 as a learning tool (from one of my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/370360/discussions/0/541906348056055059/?tscn=1437938401#c541906989406508643]forum posts[/url]): \n\nBranching, loops or repetition or data storage are the tools you need to learn imperative programming concepts, and TIS-100 and SpaceChem have them. TIS-100 even has a stack as a generic data container, and both games have synchronous data transfers.\n\nWhat I mean to say, when I recommend this for people who want to learn programming, I have more in mind than just the logical thinking - you need more than that to be a good programmer. I tutor programming courses, and I have seen people who didn't have programming experience struggle with these concepts, get familiar with them, and become able to design simple algorithms and implement them correctly. They don't just struggle with the language or the logic: they struggle with branches and loops and data storage, and experience with these (while having the brain turned on) helped them get better.\n\nYou won't be an ace programmer after completing TIS-100, but I'm certain playing it teaches quite a lot of central programming concepts.", "timestamp_created": 1437898913, "timestamp_updated": 1438479131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 250, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.936882", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17232953": {"recommendationid": "17232953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005272546", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437915143}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hard to recommend, but I'll do it anyways.\n\n[h1]Glossar[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]General\n[*]About the game\n[*]Still not sure?\n[*]The Verdict\n[/list]\n\n[h1]General[/h1]\nHere's a warning: if you're bad with logic, or are not interested in learning really abstract logics, or do not have the will and/or brains to think about solutions for a while, you're gonna have a bad time. If however you are interested in learning new things and tackling challenges, go ahead.\nI'm not sure if I can recommend it to anyone who's not interested in programming though. But if you are, and are even remotely interested in a really nerdy game (not some pseudo-hacking like Uplink, which is a great game), pick this up, you won't regret it.\n\n[h1]About the game[/h1]\nThis game is about programming. Forget your HTML and Unity, this here is ASM, better known as assembler or machine code. Well, sort of.\nThe game begins with telling you to read the manual, which you should, even when you already know ASM. The game has some specific rules bound to the machine it's simulating. So you take 20min and read the manual, and after that you go through the panels in the game one by one and figure out solutions.\nIt's built like a puzzle game. You get certain tasks, you need to program the solution with the limited resources you're provided with. To ensure the solution is correct it's got a lot of test cases for every task. Only when all test cases succeed it's considered a success. Just your everyday programming stuff.\n\n[h1]Still not sure?[/h1]\nThe tasks start relatively easy, but pick up the difficulty quite quickly.\nHere's an easy one:\nYou have two inputs and two outputs. Send Input A - Input B to Output A; send Input B - Input A to Output B. You move some values around, you subtract, no big deal, easy fun times.\nHere's a little more difficult one:\nYou have one input and one output. A series of values is sent through the input. Whenever the current value is at least 10 away from the previous value, send 1 to output, else send 0 to output. This one took me a while, but I felt like a boss when I got it. I dare to say most people who are not into programming will never find the solution.\nYou have multiple nodes for developing solutions, each node can contain 15 lines of ASM instructions, each node has two places for memory. You can move values through the registers, you can set jump points, you can react if a value is less than 0, equals 0, or is greater than 0, you can negate values. That's about it.\nBy now you should know if this game is for you.\n\n[h1]The Verdict[/h1]\nI'm a programmer myself, but on high level languages. I've taken a look at ASM before, but when you don't implement it a couple of times you'll just have trouble imagening what it could be used for, and how. This game gives you plenty of examples. I have tons of fun with it, even though I just stare at the screen and think for 10min at times. This game is something else, you won't find this very often.

The limited program space in each processor contributes significantly to the difficulty of more complex programs, requiring the use of multiple processors to implement an algorithm and thus encouraging the use or parallel processing for increased speed.

It reminds me of some manuals like the Apple 1 and 6502 manuals from the 70s-80s. The manual is quite a bit sparse, though, with several pages left almost completely blank except for a brief header. I'm not sure if these are pages are left to take notes on or if they're going to be filled out more as the game leaves early-access. There are also far fewer puzzles than SpaceChem at the time of writing. There are tools for users to create their own puzzles, but I hope that more puzzles are added as the game develops.

There are just two registers that you can store values in -- and one of these you can only access indirectly. Not a lot to keep track of.\n3.

Of course I don't want to code after a long day. Why would I buy this game? If I want a coding challenge I can actually just go and work.\n\nSo, [i]naturally[/i] I bought the game. What am I doing with my life? Well, here goes nothing...\n\nI have a TIS-100 type model which is a complete mystery. It comes with a 14-page instruction manual which is surprisingly immersive, no mentioning that this is a game and all. The manual explains what's going down and how to code on the nodes, adding some handwritten notes from my dead uncle Randy. Too bad, he was a cool guy, I guess. Of course there are references to works that explain the architecture in more detail. Sadly those documents are not supplied so I'm left guessing on that end.\n\nThe language is super easy. It emulates a very low-spec version of an assembly language. It has a total of 13 instructions involving simple conditionals, arithmetics and I/O operations. You even have some labels to build loops and gotos inside a node (although the ability to push to more than one node offers cool loop mechanisms, too). You even get a rudimentary debugger (breaking points and cycle-wise forwarding) that makes bugfixing easy.\n\nMy job is to repair corrupted segments of code in the machine to unlock... more segments. In each level there is a themed puzzle (first creating simple things like sequencers, then you detect signals from noise and later you are actually decrypting stuff). Puzzles are solved by writing machine code that solves a given objective. Feels like first semester home work all over again. [i]Yay[/i]. All the segments come with debugging messages that have nothing to do with debugging (they are flavor texts revealing some background info about the meta game) and in the end I got a great reveal what the fuzz was all about.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with writing code this game will probably drive you crazy (no tutorial but the manual). If you have a basic idea how assembly works you are fine. If you are coding on a daily basis and buy this game... you're probably insane.\n\nOther than that I think the idea of the game is kind of cool, although it's very short for 7 bucks. A few additional puzzles would've been great, it was surprisingly entertaining solving them. I would talk about graphics but there are none.

In order to play through this game, thinking is crucial. While many other puzzle games strive for this, TIS-100 is the only puzzle game that I can say truly forces you to think outside the box. Although this game might not be for you if you're not a fan of hard-thinking, concentration, and patience, it's really great fun for people looking for a challenging puzzle game that will have them stumped on every level. The developers have taken a very minimalist concept and created a fantastic game out of it. Throughout the game you'll find yourself trying to figure out how you've botched up the current level, only to realize that you completely overthought the entire problem and that the solution was right under your nose all along, which leaves you with a wonderful feeling of success as soon as you've finished it.\n\nFor you programmers out there: I cannot recommend this game enough.

Other than that, you are given no other direction on how to play. There are currently 20 programs that you must write, starting with fairly simply MOV operations to sequence counters to sequence detection, etc. Each program has a short list of instructions that you must follow to complete the program and move on.\n\nI've spent about a good afternoon straight playing and gotten to level 11.

It's one of the best I've played. I'm no assembly programmer; hell, I barely ever even write in C. This was all new to me, and it is extremely challenging. The reward from accomplishing the challenge is immeasurable. Maybe it's just me, but that is what I love about programming, and this one goes in all the way, allowing you to rethink your code, optimizing it for higher scores. Writing a comparater in assembly is something that is far more difficult than what I would normally do, but just learning a method to do it based on the manual is exhilirating. Naturally, this game is not for everyone, if you can't read a brief documentation manual while you play, or can't stomach programming, I honestly can't recommend this, you won't enjoy it.

Assembly is the lowest level language you can effectively program in. If you can't program I would very much say this game is likely not for you to be completely honest. You'll need to think like a programmer in order to complete these challenges but it is still by far the best video game to combine real programming with puzzles and should be a mandatory part of all C.S classes in the future. If you're someone who is fluent in a higher level interpreted language this should also be a mandatory game to play as you'll get a deeper understanding of how your conditional statements and programming logic work under the hood.\nI'm extremely excited for any future update and will be following Zachtronics\tclosely as they develop more unique games.\n\nFeature requests/notes for developers:\n1.) Adding an instruction pointer\n2.) Real world exploitation techniques in some levels. i.e buffer overflows, building simple ROP chains, etc. Adding the instruction pointer somewhere would make this much more feasible.\n3.) Possibly adding a higher-level c-like syntax language on top of the ASM or with newer challenges having the code for the level somewhere so current developers can see how the logic looks in ASM.\n4.) More opcodes.\n5.) If anyone from Zachtronics actually reads this review I'd like to say thanks for making an awesome game.

It's a parallel assembly language programming puzzle game on a fictional tiled CPU retrocomputer with simple (and limited) instruction set and IO resources.  The tutorial is a link to the (awesome) reference manual for the TIS-100.  The controls are little editor windows to type your assembly language programs into.  There is much fun to be had.\n\nThe instruction set is stylistically similar to real machines, but clearly chosen to be as minimally daunting as possible.  The focus is on simple arithmetic operations, basic flow control, and IO with adjacent CPU nodes or peripherals.  Amusingly, this simplicity may make it more challenging for people with actual assembly programming background in that solving these puzzles can involve approaching things in ways very different from how one might on a \"real\" computer.\n\nIt's probably most easily enjoyed by someone with a bit of programming experience, but the system is straightforward enough that someone interested in figuring out how things work should have a reasonable chance of doing so.\n\nBe sure to read the manual.  Really.\n\nAfter 20 hours of game time I've managed to solve all 20 of the original puzzles (a few of them are incredibly evil) and the secret puzzle that definitely was not added in the June 4th update.  There are still a few I plan to go back and optimize some more.

Once you start the game, you actually just virtually start up the TIS-100 machine (e.g. you'll get a boot screen and the like).\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, the game is entirely text-based, but the beauty of the game lies in what happens in your mind. Zachtronics managed to keep things interesting from the outset, hinting at a mystery lying somewhere in the machine and prompting you to print out the manual as first thing (something I truly encourage, too).\n\nThe TIS-100 architecture is made up of several different nodes (small square panels). You generally get some values as input and you have to handle/modify them in order to obtain the required output. As in SpaceChem, there are of course several limitations which will hamper your task: each node can contain up to 16 lines of code, you must synchronize the communication over the port between nodes... you get the picture.\n\nI played through 6 levels, and things are beginning to get spicy. I'm perfectly aware that this game \"isn't for everyone\" but what Zachtronics game was? If you liked SpaceChem and are interested in low level programming, you'll fall in love with this game. If you haven't tried SpaceChem and are unsure if pure programming might appeal to you in the long run, I would suggest starting off with SpaceChem or Infinifactory, before moving on to TIS-100, because they probably feel more \"fun\" in the traditional sense of the word.\n\nTL;DR If you are interested in low level/assembly programming, this game will probably be a great way to have fun with it. :)", "timestamp_created": 1433229320, "timestamp_updated": 1433229320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891200", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16128842": {"recommendationid": "16128842", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982449156", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 7540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509386525}, "language": "english", "review": "Time to put on your hacker hat!\n\nIf you have no experience or interest in programming whatsoever, this is a bad place to start getting it and you should probably skip this title in that case, as I don't think you'll enjoy it.\n\nHowever, if you are a programmer (having experience with assembler helps), this game will give you a good challenge, as it forces you to make do with a bunch of linked CPU nodes, with only a few really basic instructions and a single register, to do ever more complex tasks.\n\nGraphically it's a bit simple (as it is mostly a retro textmode display you'll be working with), but a real hacker doesn't care about graphics, right?\n\nAll in all a good title that will give you many hours of ASM hacking fun.", "timestamp_created": 1433229132, "timestamp_updated": 1433229259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617410", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16128759": {"recommendationid": "16128759", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978094806", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437862668}, "language": "english", "review": "It's assembly.

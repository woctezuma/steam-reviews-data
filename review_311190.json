I cannot recommend this game enough! \n\nMusic: The soundtrack in this game is absolutely incredible. You will definitely remember many of these tunes well after you've finished playing the game. Most of the tunes fit their respective areas quite nicely and don't feel out of place. \n\nStory: Perhaps the weakest point, but by no means terrible. You are basically a panda trying to save his village and the princess. Along the way you will meet many friends with some funny dialogue, but ultimately you don't get any real attachment to the characters. That said, if you follow similar tastes to myself, this point does not bother you so much, and you are really here for the gameplay.\n\nGameplay: This is the greatest aspect of game. The game follows what most call a Metroidvania style exploration, which because of this game I have grown to love. Movement feels extremely smooth and fast and becomes incredibly fun to master once you learn more skills. Learning how your foes will attack and adjusting your fighting style to the situation feels very rewarding (especially on the hardest difficulty, you can really get a bite taken out of your health if you don't adapt!). \n\nThe game allows you to distribute stat points earned from level-ups, making it possible to do multiple runs of the game trying a different primary fighting style. You can go all out offensive, or try to be defensive, or a fine mix of both, it's all up to you! One thing to note is you cannot fill in every skill, so I definitely recommend focusing on a single style of fighting. \n\nThere is also a weapon/armor upgrade system based on finding a certain item throughout the world. By collecting enough of this item, you may spend it to upgrade one of your two weapons or your armor. Again, this adds some replayability as you can choose to focus your level ups on damage and then focus your collectable upgrades on armor, or maybe go all out damage on the weapon. \n\nDifficulty: The game presents you with multiple difficulty options, which is fantastic for all types of players. If you want a decently hard game, this game delivers. If you want a nice casual run through the game to explore the mechanics, you can absolutely do that as well and not be so punished for taking a hit. \n\nAlmost every run of this game (including my very first run) was done on the hardest difficulty. I absolutely recommend this, as being able to master this game feels so rewarding. Your decisions and quick reflexes make a huge difference in the outcome of your battles, ESPECIALLY the boss battles. These are some of the most intense fights that may make you want to slam your controller to the ground, but ultimately you realize that there is so much you can do to improve your chances next time you attempt. When you finally triumph, it feels so satisfying.\n\nFinal thoughts: TL:DR I consider this game to be one of my favorite games of all time, and I abolutely recommend purchasing it. You have no reason not too, just look at this price! $3.00 for one of my favorite games of all time?

Ele \u00e9 ambientado em um mundo cheio de seres antropom\u00f3rficos, sendo o personagem principal um Panda chamado Fu, um jovem guerreiro espadachim ainda em treinamento. Uma invas\u00e3o de rob\u00f4s faz com que ele tenha que por em pr\u00e1tica tudo que aprendeu para salvar seu planeta.\n\nN\u00e3o espere muito da hist\u00f3ria do jogo, \u00e9 bem bobinha e funciona apenas de plano de fundo para o resto do jogo. Mas infelizmente mais uma vez um jogo cai no clich\u00ea que tanto odeio de \"Resgatar a princesa, a bela donzela em perigo\". Vou resumir os pontos de forma simples e direta.\n\n++\u00d3timos controles, em nenhum momento os senti travados ou tive dificuldades em aprende-los.\n++Fluidez tanto de combate quanto de explora\u00e7\u00e3o. Parece at\u00e9 que Fu (o panda) est\u00e1 deslizando pelos est\u00e1gios.\n++\u00d3tima progress\u00e3o, com uma grande diversidade de habilidades para se aprender e melhorar.\n++Trilha sonora simples mas cativante. Para um jogo de baixo custo, considero um bom trabalho, pois em nenhum momento as m\u00fasicas se tornaram enjoativas.\n++Batalhas de Chefe muito boas e que te deixam no limite da sua capacidade cognitiva e da sua destreza.\n+-Mas tamb\u00e9m elas s\u00e3o batalhas muito dif\u00edceis que podem levar a frustra\u00e7\u00e3o pela quantidade de vida excessiva dos chefes.\n+-Gr\u00e1ficos que poderiam ter sido mais polidos, mas que apesar disso criam um senso de estilo pr\u00f3prio para o jogo, tornando-o \u00fanico e charmoso.\n--A falta de orienta\u00e7\u00e3o quanto a porcentagem de conclus\u00e3o. Tem muito o que se explorar e obter nos mapas, um m\u00e9todo de nos orientar quanto a conclus\u00e3o perfeita de est\u00e1gios ajudaria muito.\n--O famigerado clich\u00ea de resgatar a donzela em perigo.

On normal you can plow through most enemies and stages have small hearts or coins hidden in blocks and out ine open, but you can only get them once picked up.\n\nI got lost and backtracked alot trying to find upgrades and hearts. Any heart or item you can not reach require an ability - bombs for instance , so be patient. \n\nI think Super Panda Adventures is a satisfactory game with nice ideas the shield takes some adjustment to work into combat. There is a upgrade to not use any magic to block but only if you put your level up points into it. The same goes to other items and magic and stats.\n\nSome of the enemies have the same design , only with different colors and toughness or movements. Some enemies shoot straight at you, others can shoot diagonally, while still others (a cowboy robot) shoot both directions.  Near last level robot enemies get tougher.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is recommended for platform lovers. A controller will help alot.

So the young panda facing this threat looks for a way to rescue the princess, save his land and destroy this evil.\n\n[h1]Gameplay and mechanics[/h1]\n\nThe mechanics are quite simple and follow the classic 2D elements of gameplay, but what makes this game rich is the amount of well hidden secrets and powers we can have at hand to advance further in the storyline and into more difficult enemies to beat. During the game we should face a limited number of side quests that will lead us to gain more powers, abilities and weapons. In the beginning we are quite underpowered, but this changes shortly after doing some special side quests, enemies are quite tough to beat and we must level up fast, grinding is key to the mechanics for we must develop the many skills we have.\n\nAlso, to add more fun to the gameplay, there are certain relics scattered all over the different levels, these relics will grant you individual abilities that are very helpful to achieve certain tasks, some of them are easy to find, some others are really difficult, adding more hours of gaming.\n\nWhat was a surprise on this game is the fact that we must come and go over and over again to different locations of the map, a reminder of the old school Zelda games, A Link to the Past to be precise. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack and sound[/h1]\n\nIt is normal to expect midi elements and 8-bit music, the soundtrack is quite interesting, from high-tempo tunes to slow ones, fitting the atmosphere and aesthetics of the many places we visit.\n\nOn the other hand the sounds are very old-school like, many of the sound and effects have this vibe that reminded me of Kirby, Super Mario, Zelda, etc. classic NES and Super NES titles. It also has some sort of Super Meat Boy atmosphere at times. \n\n[h1]The bad but not serious[/h1]\n\nI must say I encountered not a single bug or glitch and not even a crash, the game runs good, it is stable and smooth. But my complaint goes in the direction of the grinding, it is an important part of the game, enemies are hard to beat when you start, and it becomes easier once you gather enough powers and level up, while the grinding of enemies works this way, it tends to be repetitive and monotonous at times and it is also linked to the fact that every time the same enemies will re-spawn at the same place over and over again, this affected me at times in the beginning, not enough health, not enough manna or shields and many deaths were part of this re-spawning system.\n\nAnother aspect that many players complained about is related to the boss fights, in my case I did not have any problems with them, but sometimes I felt that they were really hard to beat on normal difficulty, I learnt that some patches changed some aspects of this, but still, I can\u2019t but feel some sort of drawback at some point. Nothing that serious though.\n\nFinally, my last complaint and maybe the most annoying is related to the many secrets, sometimes there is not a certain way to know if you visited x part of a level because nothing seems to indicate that you were already there, this happened to me many times. The levels tend to reset what you already did before while discovering new zones. I often found myself running around confused thinking or doubting if I already did x thing or not due to the fact that some locations must be visited many times.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nSuper Panda Adventures is a game that has more pros than cons, evidently. The game highlights the many good things that 2D games have to offer, even more today with all the AAA titles and the masses demanding state-of-the-art graphics and effects, forgetting and proving that simple and classic looking games can deliver the same amount of fun or even more sometimes. I recommend this game to any fan of 2D style that likes games with simple and dumb humor; SPA is a great game that stands out by being original and fun.\n\nI urge the developer to deliver more games like this; you have potential, my friend.

A relatively solid platformer that has elements of many others that came before it, Super Panda Adventure is the story of Fu, a panda knight trained to protect the princess of the land, who, after a series of events, must defeat a looming, soulless evil that threatens to envelop the planet. Without collecting everything, I logged about 8 hours into this game, and came away relatively satisfied. My only gripe about SPA is that near the end, enemies just kind of stop being a threat, allowing you to carve through the same few enemies on your way to whatver goal you happen to be working on achieving with relative ease. Controls are a little off, as well, making jumping off of platforms a little laborious at times, as you'll sometimes miss a jump, fall to the bottom of the map, and have to work your way back up. On one or two occasions, I found myself taking damage from a bullet, fireball, etc, I thought I had dodged, and during certain boss fights, this is particularly annoying. \nNothing that can't be fixed with a few adjustments to Fu's hitbox. \n\nOverall, the plot is goofy, the gameplay is enjoyable and solid enough to keep things fun. A hugely deep game for less than a dollar, and certainly worth the $4 it normally costs.  \n\nPros-\nFun gameplay\nQuirky cast of characters\nStellar music\nHuge value for the price\nStreet Fighter references\n\nCons-\nFloaty controls\nOnly a few enemy types\nHitbox issues lead to some unfair deaths\nFu's sword looks like a sausage when you attack. \n\n8/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1468707579, "timestamp_updated": 1468707579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24355974": {"recommendationid": "24355974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057696762", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494323339}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\ubc88 \ud0a4\uba74 \uc808\ub300 \ub04c \uc218\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac8c\uc784.. \ud37c\uc990\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0 \ubcf4\uc2a4 \uc7a1\ub294 \ub9db\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0\n\ucf64\ubcf4\ub85c \uacbd\ud5d8\uce58 \uba39\ub294 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub3c4 \uc3e0\uc3e0\ud558\uace0", "timestamp_created": 1468685376, "timestamp_updated": 1468685376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24315721": {"recommendationid": "24315721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058584734", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468507198}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice game and worth the price.

eu acredito que o jogo n\u00e3o seja bom e o unico ponto positivo dele \u00e9 que o pre\u00e7o \u00e9 compativel com a qualidade do jogo.\nO meu problema com o jogo foi, que as fases n\u00e3o tem muitos indicativos de se ela foi completa ou n\u00e3o, por exemplo, muitos metroidvanias vc consegue ter uma no\u00e7\u00e3o de que falta para ser pego no mapa, nesse aqui se vc quer pegar todas as reliquias nos mapas, vc corre o risco de passar por elas e n\u00e3o perceber e at\u00e9 mesmo achar que ele n\u00e3o est\u00e1 no mapa em quest\u00e3o.\nFora isso o sistema de luta chega a ser bobo onde a grande maioria dos inimigos n\u00e3o exigem uma a\u00e7\u00e3o diferenciada para matar, o \u00fanico desafio real s\u00e3o os boss, que at\u00e9 onde me lembro s\u00e3o 5, sendo 2 opicionais e detalhe a dificuldade deles em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao resto do jogo \u00e9 algo que pode ser frustrante para players casuais \u00e9 um salto muito grande de dificuldade em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao resto do jogo.\nA arte do jogo pode ser comparada a coisas feitas no paint, mas n\u00e3o vou criticar porque acredito que tenha sido uma op\u00e7\u00e3o de cria\u00e7\u00e3o e estilo do jogo mesmo o boba, eles usaram elementos do tipo \"Salve a princesa\" s\u00f3 que com um background realmente dificil de engolir.\nA hist\u00f3ria do jogo \u00e9 no minim\nEu digo, s\u00f3 comprem se estiver com

10/10. Definitely one of my favorite platformers. To give you an idea, another two favorites of the genre are Apotheon and Capsized, though this game is nothing like either of those other than that they are all platformers. It's hard to directly compare this to other games. Maybe a good description might be that it's a mix of like Super Mario Bros, one of the old gameboy Zelda games I use to play, and like if you were to play the Kung Fu Panda movies as a game with RPG elements. This is a terrible description, but there it is. It's a very accessible game with a lot going for it. Enough story to keep you going and entertain (easy to follow and casually quest-driven), great upbeat music (I swear I hear a little Frozen Synapse in one of the songs and it makes me wonder if the music designer isn't the same person), excellent and smooth gameplay, good level design, and a well-integrated RPG system. Definitely recommended.\n\n------- Addendum --------\n\nStuck on the last boss at 22 hours of gameplay!

The different spells will help with is good because some games have extra abilities that do nothing. probably the worst things about Super Panda Adventures is the backtracking when playing and that you can't really play to long without getting bored.\nSound\nI don't normally play with sound so I can't really give my thoughts\nLength \nIt's a pretty long game and that could be in part because you don't really know what missions you are meant to do if you just want to finish the game without 100% the game. 100% this game is something I haven't been able to do yet but I can tell it will be a while\nConclusion\nIt's a fun game if you like the sound of this from the review, it's cheap $5 isn't asking much, and it's super fun, and something I forgot until now is that (besides the sound) it is made by one person!

Semi-fast action/platformer with a free-skill tree, secrets and rpg elements. Different skills and attacks and fun/rewarding combo system. I really liked the gameplay. best I could describe it would be a hack and slash 2d platformer.\n\nThe music is averagly good/catchy, but there's unfortunatly not enough songs in the game\n\nThe plot is really cheesy, but let's face it, you don't play those type of games for the plot.\n\nThe only downside of this game is its lenght - kinda short, finished it within a few hours, but then again it was 1$ and I would've paid 5$ for it easily.\n\nOne of the few indie games that I really wish I could see more(or straight out a sequel)\n\nWell done Mr Paul!

The graphics may be off-putting to some, but the game more than makes up for it when it comes to controls and gameplay. Bear in mind this is a game made entirely by one person (minus music), and for what it is it's pretty damn impressive.\n\nSuper Panda Adventures is a typical metroidvania, where new areas become accessible as you lean new abilities. Sadly there is no map, so you can't tell where you've already been and where you still need to go. It's rather frustrating, because obviously you have to backtrack a lot.\n\nThe overworld map should also have some sort of an indicator to tell you how many collectibles you've already found in any one level, so you don't replay levels which are 100% complete. If these two issues were fixed, the game would be perfect.\n\nGameplay is the most important part here, and that's where SPA really shines. The controls are tight and perfectly responsive. The story is a bit silly, but no one really plays platformers for their complex story. The music is cool and enjoyable.\n\nIf you look past the graphics and are willing to tolerate a bit of frustration due having no map, you'll have a lot of fun. Besides, it's just a dollar.

Whether you are a casual gamer that just wants to enjoy a fun game with a good story, to a hardcore gamer who prefers roguelites and rage-quitting, this game has you in mind! \n\n[h1]tl;dr / quick review[/h1]\nSuper Panda Adventures is a one of the best examples of the Metroidvania genre on Steam.  It has solid mechanics, fluid and smooth controls, an excellent soundtrack, fun shoot-slash-and-jump combat, and is genuinely funny.  Super Panda Adventures is different and really took me by surprise; so much so, that it has made my list of all-time favourites PC games.  I am not sure if it gets the attention that it deserves, but this is truly a genre-defining game.\n\nWith a slew of RPG elements in the game, you can level up your character all the way to Level 50 with several weapon, armour, skill and spell choices to make along the way.  How you build your character ultimately affects how you play the game, and visa-versa!  Along those lines, it has a lot of stats to explore: HP, MP, Shield, Regen for MP, Crit, Melee damage, Magic damage, random-events skills like \"Chance to gain 5 Hp when you attack an enemy,\" and shops to spend collected coins on items and potions! \n\n[h1]verdict\nSuper Panda Adventures is simply one of the most under-rated and over-looked Metroidvanian games on Steam. If you like Metroidvania type games, you owe it to yourself to buy and play this game.[/h1]\n\n[h1]what's good[/h1]\n+ 8 to 12 hours of gameplay\n+ Full controller support\n+ Well-written and amusing dialogue\n+ Adorably cute, deceptively challenging (at higher difficulty levels)\n+ Varied, colourful and thought-out level designs that always keep it fresh\n+ Many RPG elements for levelling up your character (up to Level 50!)\n+ It's not a platformer, so there is no platformer rage-quitting in this game\n+ Good for all skill levels (from Casual to Srsly Hardcore)\n+ Level-up, gain new and significant powers, skills, magic, weapons, armour, and more\n+ Character appearance changes based on selected weapons, amour, and skills\n+ Excellent and catchy soundtrack\n+ Hidden / secret rooms filled with treasures to find\n+ Fluid, smooth, and superb-feeling controls\n+ Suitable for all ages and skill-levels\n\n[h1]what's not good[/h1]\n- Once a difficulty setting has been selected, it cannot be changed without starting a new game\n- Sudden, unexpected difficulty spikes (see note below)\n\n[h1]gameplay tip[/h1]\nFrankly, some of the bosses are surprisingly over-powered and this can result in some unexpectedly frustrating boss battles. \n\nSay you decide to play on Normal, but it gets too hard 8 hours in, you can either push through, in which case, watching a youtube video may help with your strategy; or, start the game over and select a lower difficulty setting.  May I suggest a better-safe-than-sorry approach to this game:\n\nThe typical gamer should play this on either the Cakewalk or Easy difficulty setting, which will provide a rage-free (not challenge-free) ride through this game. Only experienced, pain-seeking gamers should attempt Normal or Hard. \n\nEither way, enjoy the game, this is a great one!\n\n[b]Please hit the like button if you found this review helpful.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1447232624, "timestamp_updated": 1476473985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 143, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911935", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19001970": {"recommendationid": "19001970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125505868", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447289013}, "language": "english", "review": "i like pandas", "timestamp_created": 1447204128, "timestamp_updated": 1447204128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18992796": {"recommendationid": "18992796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023117872", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497760366}, "language": "english", "review": "After seeing this game on sale for 1$ with quite a few good reviews, and being a major fan of metroidvanias, I figured 1$ was worth a shot.  Boy was it ever!   A pretty fun little game with better character customization than most action RPGs.  The levels are fun, although not super innovative.  \n\nThe game has several difficulty levels, although I suggest going for hard, or maybe even \"Ridonculous\" difficulty levels the first time.  I'm playing hard mode and, well, it's pretty easy.  The story is lame, but I hadn't expected much.

M\u00ealant exploration, \u00e9l\u00e9ments de RPG et un panda en guise de h\u00e9ros, ce jeu peut sembler \u00eatre fait pour les enfants, mais il n\u2019en est rien. Humour, challenge et fun sont au rendez-vous de ce petit jeu surprenant.\n\nSC\u00c9NARIO\n\nVous incarnerez le jeune FU, petit panda trognon vivant dans le paisible village de Bamboo. Apprenti chevalier, il est sur le point de devenir le nouveau gardien officiel de la princesse Maya. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9ussi  sa derni\u00e8re qu\u00eate initiatique, il est donc invit\u00e9 au ch\u00e2teau pour rencontrer la belle. Oui mais voil\u00e0, ce jour de c\u00e9l\u00e9bration va vite se transformer en cauchemar puisque la princesse se fera enlever sous vos yeux par un vaisseau spatial et votre village sera d\u00e9truit. Prenant votre courage \u00e0 deux mains, vous d\u00e9ciderez de vous lancer \u00e0 la recherche de votre douce et de d\u00e9couvrir qui a bien pu causer un tel drame.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nComme je l\u2019ai dit plus haut, le jeu se d\u00e9roule comme un \u00abmetroidvania \u00bb, comprenez par l\u00e0 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de plateforme combin\u00e9 avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de jeu de r\u00f4le et des objets d\u2019inventaire qui vous feront explorer les moindres recoins du jeu. Pour venir \u00e0 bout de ses ennemis, FU pourra utiliser une \u00e9p\u00e9e, des shurikens ou la magie. En combinant ces attaques et en \u00e9tant toujours en action, vous gagnerez de l\u2019exp suppl\u00e9mentaire. A chaque level up, vous pourrez attribuer 2 points de comp\u00e9tences parmi les 16 propos\u00e9es. L\u2019un des points sympas du jeu est que l\u2019on pourra d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7onner FU comme on le souhaite, privil\u00e9gier la magie et la d\u00e9fense ou bien le corps \u00e0 corps, etc. ? Vous \u00eates libre de choisir. De plus, des \u00ab orbes \u00bb sont diss\u00e9min\u00e9s dans les diff\u00e9rents niveaux et les cumuler vous permettra d\u2019augmenter votre arsenal (\u00e9p\u00e9e, armure, shuriken) tout en changeant leur aspect.\n\nDurant son aventure, FU parcourra diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9gions compos\u00e9es de niveaux. Pour les s\u00e9lectionner, il suffit de se d\u00e9placer sur une mappemonde simplifi\u00e9e et de choisir sa destination. Chacun des niveaux poss\u00e8de un level design travaill\u00e9 et souvent tr\u00e8s bien pens\u00e9. Pour d\u00e9couvrir tous les tr\u00e9sors cach\u00e9s dans un niveau, FU devra trouver 3 cl\u00e9s (rouge, bleue, jaune) en faisant appel \u00e0 sa jugeote mais aussi \u00e0 sa gamme de comp\u00e9tences (nager, double-saut etc.) qui s\u2019enrichira au fur et \u00e0 mesure des qu\u00eates. Donc oui, il faudra de temps \u00e0 autre refaire des niveaux d\u00e9j\u00e0 termin\u00e9s afin d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des salles jusque-l\u00e0 inaccessibles. Pour autant on ne s\u2019ennuie pas, de nombreux chemins sont \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir, de nombreux tr\u00e9sors sont \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer et le jeu essaie de toujours r\u00e9compenser l\u2019exploration par une reward bienvenue.\n\nParall\u00e8lement \u00e0 tout ceci, l\u2019histoire et le monde vous seront r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s petit \u00e0 petit par un syst\u00e8me de qu\u00eates. Pas de lin\u00e9arit\u00e9 stricte, vous pouvez choisir l\u2019ordre, bien que, comme il n\u2019y en a pas non plus pour 40h de jeu, elles finissent par se recouper assez vite\u2026 mais l\u2019effort reste appr\u00e9ciable ! De plus, l\u2019humour est omnipr\u00e9sent que ce soit par les dialogues ou par des clins d\u2019\u0153il fait \u00e0 d\u2019autres JV, films ou artistes. Cela contribue \u00e0 donner un effet cool, fun et d\u00e9cal\u00e9 peu importe la mission ou le nombre de fois que l\u2019on refait un niveau.\n\nGRAPHISMES & SON\n\nD\u2019un point de vue graphique, SPA propose un style old school, basique mais color\u00e9 et suffisamment vari\u00e9. Alors bien s\u00fbr \u00e7a ne d\u00e9colle pas la r\u00e9tine, mais le travail est bien fait, propre et coh\u00e9rent. Pour ce qui est des animations, bien que peu nombreuses elles n\u2019en restent pas moins fluides et plaisantes. Quant au character design, j\u2019ai pour ma part accroch\u00e9 m\u00eame si un bestiaire un poil plus \u00e9toff\u00e9 ne m\u2019aurait pas d\u00e9plu.\n\nPour l\u2019ambiance sonore, on explorera les niveaux accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une musique rappelant le son des jeux d\u2019autrefois. Dynamiques, prenantes elles participent au bon rythme g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du jeu.\n\n*******\n\n\nAVIS PERSONNEL DU TESTEUR\n\nSurprise \u00e9tonnante.

Und was l\u00e4ge da n\u00e4her als einen Panda gegen eine Armee von au\u00dferirdischen Robotern zu stellen? In bester Metrovania Tradition k\u00e4mpft sich der Panda Fu durch verschiedene verwinkelte Level, sucht magische Relikte, m\u00e4chtige Zauber und r\u00fcstet nebenbei seine Ausr\u00fcstung und sich selbst aus. Soweit so bekannt.\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad ist akzeptabel, selbst wenn man diesen weiter nach oben dreht. Zumindest wenn man Spiele wie Ninja Gaiden, Contra und Castlevania 1 \u00fcberlebt hat. Richtig kniffelig wird es eigentlich nur bei den verschiedenen Endgegnern. Diese ben\u00f6tigen jeweils eine andere Strategie und gute Reflexe. Die Bossk\u00e4mpfe sind wirklich gro\u00dfartig, aber auch die Standartgegner erfordern manchmal strategisches Vorgehen. Hier gibt es auch nichts zu meckern. Genau wie bei den Animationen, diese sind sch\u00f6n anzusehen.\n\nWas ebenfalls punktet ist die Story. Sie hat einige nette Wendungen und damit hebt das Spiel sich ab von einigen Metrovania Titeln die ich bereits gespielt habe. Die Story wird zudem durch einen angenehmen Hau druff Humor in Szene gesetzt, wobei immer ein leichtes Augenzwinkern mitschwingt. Die Mischung z\u00fcndet.\n\nSchade ist nur das die Level recht \u00fcbersichtlich sind. Wenn man ein gutes Ged\u00e4chtnis hat kann man sich kaum verlaufen, daf\u00fcr sind die Level allerdings vollgestopft mit Geheimnissen und R\u00e4tseln. Erstere will man nat\u00fcrlich l\u00fcften und zweitere sorgen f\u00fcr einige Kopfschmerzen an manchen Stellen. Schade auch das man vom Questsystem abh\u00e4ngig ist was den Fortschritt angeht. Manche Wege \u00f6ffnen sich erst wenn man einen gewissen Fortschritt erreicht hat. Aber es ist halt Old School, da kann man das ja fast erwarten. Wer die alten Adventures von Sierra gespielt hat wird auf jeden Fall ein Deja Vu erleben.\n\nAlles in allem ist das Spiel wirklich sehr gut und zu empfehlen.

It's very appropriate and sets the atmosphere incredibly well for each level\n- Incredible Level Design (gameplay and atmosphere). One of the things that makes the game design so incredible with this game is that the game acts as its own tutorial as the player plays through. The player gets some help but most stuff is pretty forward to figure out because the levels are designed to make the player think about how to use the skills they've got. Also, there are challenges in all areas that make it obvious that a player requires a skill they don't have yet, but it gives the player a really good idea of what kind of skill they're expecting to find. This really helps keep player engagement high because there's always something really cool to look forward to!\n- The artwork is very crisp, clean and bright\n- Very Solid controls\n- Awesome skills and lots of fun to use\n- Epic combat\n- Very well thought out sounds that keep player engagement high and really allow the player to feel the game\n- Excellent game progression and plenty of challenges that unlock as the game progresses.\n- Plenty of game to get through\n- Solid levelling system\n- Kind of like Adventure Islander meets Kung Fu Panda with Doom Imp fireball sounds :)\n\nCon's\n- Bosses are too unpredictable and have too many unavoidable attacks for a platformer. It's more a case of luck than skill to defeat a boss. Basically, you have to grind the same boss over and over again until you get lucky enough to have lucked avoiding enough attack changes in a row to win without taking too much damage. Each attack has an unknown timelength before the next attack and you don't know which attack is coming next, so quite often you'll jump straight into the bosses next attack and die too fast most of the time and combined with the unavoidable attacks, this becomes frustrating.\n- Diversity of enemies could be increased.

It's all about getting Fu the best gear, items and leveling up his stats to ensure he can survive. Characters are cute and fun to engage yourself with. Though the plot is pretty traditional. With the hero who goes through a huge ordeal to save a damsal. But it makes it feel classy somehow. Don't know if it's because their pandas or because Fu is so innocent and really just wants everyone to be happy.\n\nThis is the kinda game where you unlock new abilites or items so you can gain access to new areas. So there is some back tracking involved. But I didn't really mind. It is simple but well built, I really do suggest you play this game. It is enjoyable and the hours roll on by when your playing.

Good graphics & sound. Simple but meaningful upgrade system with several styles of play. Gameplay is generally unchallenging yet fun, but the few bosses in the game are substantially more difficult. Suggested buy at $5 or less.\n\nThe Long: \n\n1) Gameplay: it's a 2d platformer with rpg elements, so you should have certain expectations going in. Levels are accessed from an overworld, and, in the mode of many games in this genre, you will find yourself returning to old levels with newly gained powers in order to access new areas and gain new items. There are a decent number of collectibles in the game, and it will probably take you 10-15 hours to find them all without use of a guide. \n\nThe general gameplay is fairly unchallenging on normal, though I have yet to try harder difficulties. There are many abilities which increase survivablity to the point where you won't even worry much about getting killed from mid-game on. There are not very many enemies in the game, either, and you will have their attack patterns memorized fairly quickly.\n\nThe very significant exceptions to the above statements are the boss battles. The bosses are few in number, but I had significant difficulty with all of them; they clearly represent a substantial increase in difficulty relative to the rest of the game. They were my main motivator for finding all of the extra powerups.\n\n2) Graphics and sound: I'm not much of a buff on either of these things, but I was happy with both. The music is very pleasing, and the graphics look clean and well-done. I am glad that this game, unlike so many other classic-style games, did not use classic-style graphics that looked like they were ripped from RPGMaker. \n\n3) RPG elements: I would classify this game as having \"soft\" RPG elements. While you do level up and it is important for progression, there is no pressure to pick the right skills to advance each time. You will get 2 points to spend after each level up on 1 or 2 skills of your choice. These skills can be roughly divided into melee, ranged, magic, and general, but I personally ended up using a little of each. As I said, you will not find the game becoming unbearably hard if you pick some skills before others. The bosses are going to be difficult regardless of the skills you choose, and while some some of them can make these fights easier, your reflexes and your ability to not get hit will matter a while lot more. \n\nThose are the major points I wanted to make. Overall, this is a fun little game that's defnitely worth at least a few bucks. My suggested buy price is $5 or less.", "timestamp_created": 1429645935, "timestamp_updated": 1429646228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

Anyone with a love of the genre, and particularly those who enjoyed early PC platformers, will find a lot to like here. Your objectives are laid out in a multi-quest fashion, and levels are not beaten but rather explored in parts to achieve these missions. The levels are not particularly numerous but they are vast, to the point that you will still find yourself on unknown paths on your 3rd or 4th visits. These replays are also enhanced by a Metroid-like collection of upgrades combined with a classic colored-key system that provides for a persisent sense of exploration alongside a growing feeling of power and mobility. \n\n    There are no inconsequential collectibles, everything that doesn't fill a meter either directly makes Fu stronger or is money which can be used to  buy additional experience. After a semi-casual 8 hour playthrough I did not hit the level cap, and expect it would take a long time to do so. I think a normal player will likely only acquire about half of the skill points it would take to fill everything out, so your choices in this regard do matter (to the game's credit). They may matter more than you expect though, as there are a few boss fights which unexpectedly and dramatically shift into a much higher difficulty than the levels themselves. 3 different bosses each required several attempts from me and forced me to adapt to a more \"pro\" block-oriented combat style, and while I felt a satisfying sense of achievement after each, a more casual player might find these to be too much of a challenge to proceed.\n\n   The plot and dialogue are kid-friendly but also dryly amusing for an adult, poking light fun at various game tropes and dashed with a touch of real warmth. The interface is almost perfect with tight controls (bolstered by a nice built-in joystick/gamepad mapping feature), an excellent all-in-one character inventory/menu, and a comfortably traditional HUD. My only interface complaint is that there is no way to tell from the overworld which keys or collectibles you already have in each level, leaving a bit too much to memory. The music is excellent throughout (though after repeat level visits may wear thin for some). The game's art is done in a simple but charming low-res hand-drawn style with a nice variety of theme and color. The levels are distinct and pretty, though the overworld maps are a bit crude and flat (perhaps also in homage to the oldies?).\n\n    All told, Super Panda Adventures is a great little indie platformer at a great little price. It's obvious that a lot of love and thought went into this title. It takes some of the best elements from some of the best games in the genre and smartly combines them into something familiar but fresh and, most importantly, fun.", "timestamp_created": 1424136795, "timestamp_updated": 1424244811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14506856": {"recommendationid": "14506856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022183254", "num_games_owned": 999, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481126835}, "language": "english", "review": "My verdict- I am SO glad I spent money on this.

You've got a level system, with experience pickups as well as experience gained based on your combo counter, not killing, which is definitely a quirky, fresh concept you don't really see nowadays. Leveling up is quite crucial, however collecting a certain collectible is all the more powerful.

The combat is very simple but enjoyable. The graphics have a wonderful cartoony style and the backgrounds have a number of layers, giving it a nice feeling of depth. The sound effects are pretty typical for this type of game and the music is decent enough. This game is very child friendly and the humar is kind of kids cartoony, but it's enjoyable. Adults shouldn't be turned off that this looks like a kids game though. I'm sure any adult who likes this type of game will find it thoroughly enjoyable. It kind of lost some points for me for mediocre level design in the last few levels and I wish it could have been longer, though the length was fine. I restarted the game once, after about 5 hours of play on a lower difficulty, after having a hard time with some of with some of the bosses.

The game looked interesting so I bought it for myself in order to try it out - and boy, was I surprised. Even though you can 100% complete the game in about ten hours, those ten hours feature pure entertainment. From the open world & world map (featuring two different worlds), experience gathering, levelling up and spending skill points on abilities, doing side quests for NPCs which often contain good humour, to cute graphics and light-hearted characters who actually point out some of the real-world problems and give the game great depth.\nThere, I mentioned some of the reasons I love this game, and there still remain some I haven't even touched. Upgradable weapons and armor, combo bonuses, awesome soundtrack...you name it. This game doesn't aim to be epic & humongous, but it still aims to be devilishly good in its humbleness, and it is.\nThe only negative thing I have to say about the whole thing is the fact that some of the game's bosses feature large difficulty spikes, especially the last boss. I think you'll always feel like the boss is one scale higher than the difficulty you're currently playing on (there are about five difficulties, if I'm not mistaken). But if you like to play on easy, then you should be able to beat it without any major issues.\nSo if you are still thinking about whether you should get it or not, go get it right away! The 4\u20ac price is super small considering how good the game is, and this is coming from a guy with some serious budget issues. I got the game on a discount for 3\u20ac and I feel like I ripped off the developer.\nI seriously hope for Super Panda Adventures 2 or something like that.\nCheers! :)", "timestamp_created":

Despite the seemingly obvious route this might take, no, he does not know kung fu. Instead he has a sword and you slash badguys. See? This game is tricky as it lures you in and then sucker punches you with a fist made of awesome.\n\nAt its core the game is a platformer with plenty of combat thrown in but the combat engine isn't deep. Instead it serves to keep you entertained as you progress from point A to point B and it works really well. Killing numerous enemies in a row will perform a combo chain and the bigger the chain the more bonus exp you get which means you will often [b]want[/b] to blaze though areas as rapidly as possible, killing everything in your path, to maximize exp. \n\nIt is a fantastic design decision because the game does feature backtracking but it never feels like a chore because killing things and making long combos is fun. Good game design at its finest.\n\nGain enough exp and you can place them inside a skill tree. In some ways this game reminds me of Alex Kidd in monsterland, featuring stores, coins, secret areas, the ability to upgrade weapons and armor all that good stuff. You also have a shield which you activate by holding down and the shield will trigger your invincibility frames making it very useful to actually use it! Whilst the game doesn't enforce its roleplaying elements down your throat with complex and confusing trees, you will apprechiate the various options as they are all actually useful and you will look forward to leveling up.\n\nThe music? Amazing. You can buy the soundtrack as additional DLC and while I leave that choice upto you, as you play through the game you will really apprechiate the music. \nSound effects? Eeeeh, something \"borrowed\", something blue. Those are lines from an old wedding jingle but I found it appropiate because sadly you are going to reconize some of the games sound effects and like the graphics they are 'functional' but it detracts from the game instead of enhancing it. Yes the game has coins you collect, now what sound do they make? What is a suitable coin collecting sound, from say, a well known franchaise, like Mario?! So I do have to mention little niggles like that because while I do heap praise on this game, it is by no means perfect.\n\nThen their are the tangible things like the story, the game throws memes in and usually when someone does this it is because they lack any original humour but this game is genuinely funny and on rare occassions it even manages to make dead, overused memes actually funny again whih is a feat in itself I might add! Humour is subjective and it is rare for a game that is not a visual novel to feature writing that actually makes me laugh, so very well done for not only managing to fit great writing into a platform game but in also managing to be genuinely funny too.\n\nAs for playlength, the game is deceptively long without overstaying its welcome. The game is clearly trying to tell a story and while it does pad out the gameplay length with backtracking the game is long enough on its own merits to be value for money despite the budget price.\n\nI don't have a youtube video link for this game as most of you who read reviews, actually hate links to youtube within them, but I recommend you watch a video or two and see if the graphics are a deal breaker or not for you. The gameplay the controls, the content, it is all there and it is really good! But you have to look at a game in order to play it and that may just be a deal breaker for some of you.\n\nIf you prefer gameplay over graphics though then this game belongs in your steam library and you should be playing it!\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews", "timestamp_created": 1419268707, "timestamp_updated": 1427847997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13413080": {"recommendationid": "13413080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046696361", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417324219}, "language": "english", "review": "I thoroughly enjoyed Super Panda Adventures, as this genre of game is my absolute favorite. I did, however, have some issues with it that could have been dealt with better or at all.\n\nYou start at level 1 and are only able to level to 50. With this said, you get two points to level up your abilities with per level, or 98 points in total. \n\nThis wouldn't be a problem, except that there are 16 abilities that can be advanced up to 10 ranks, or 160 points worth of purchasing space. You are left with a deficit of 62 points, and if you didn't realize this and hadn't purchased any points in your shield or your health, the final boss fight will be absolute hell. I saw one Let's Play where they guy never bought into an ability that I thought made the game infinitely more enjoyable, and that made me sad.\n\nThe game was a bit easy, and only about 7 hours long even acquiring every single orb and relic. A mini-map or some kind of notification of what was finable at each location (like the colored keys in the bottom right) would have been helpful, as I found myself wandering around looking for some relics far longer than really necessary. Even with this, though, the game was far too short in my opinion.\n\nOtherwise, though, I loved this game. I have never had a game where people asked what I was playing and I was able to answer, \"basically, I'm an anthropormorphic panda that can talk, fights with a sword, throws boomerang-like shurikens, and has an enormous shield\" with a completely straight face. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1418800918, "timestamp_updated": 1418800918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13340167": {"recommendationid": "13340167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153600442", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419897703}, "language": "english", "review": "REALLY GREAT AND QUICK GAME!

Super Panda Adventure is an 2D action platformer with rpg elements.  Think of it as if it where a 2d translation of legend of Zelda games;  You'll find yourself revisting old levels with new abilities and accessing huge new portions of map that will advance the story and put you in contact with NPCs that will send you on quests.\n\n You collect items that give you experience (although you do not automatically gain xp from every kill, just on item pick up.) and find special \"Power Orbs\" that you can use to upgrade your weapons and armor with an incresing cost per upgrade.\n\nThe rewards and upgrades are well spaced out and feel earned, making going back to take advantage of a new game mechanic that's been awarded to you that opens a huge new area of an already visited level very enjoyable.  The level design is especially well done and the way the levels are sort of \"wrapped around to reconnect\" is often very clever and well hidden.\n\nThe game tries it's hand at humorous and is bit campy but it's absurd enough to be enjoyable.  This is one of the best platformers I've played in qutie some time and I found myself blown away by how good this game turned out to be.  Give it a try.\n\nEDIT:  It was brought to my attention that I totally forgot to include the fact that hitting your enemies in quick succession rewards you with experience, providing you with some automatic experience when you are fighting an enemy that is seperate from item pick ups that give xp.\n\nThanks to Yamihe Kazeto for pointing this out in a friendly way.

At first your character as Fu, the panda bear, is unable to jump higher than two blocks. This is annoying because you can see many different collectables or items for you to obtain, but you're unable to. Eventually after playing the story mode, rather than attempting side quests first, you gather the ability to claw onto higher blocks, at this point you can collect everything you wasn't able to before. I hated playing this game before I could get everything I needed, but after progressing, the game is much more fun to play.\n\nSometimes the game can be quite difficult, and you can get trapped in being hit over and over again to the point where you can't fight back, but other than this, the game is actually really good. I'm glad I purchased it. The dialogue is short and to the point, but still manages to entertain me. The graphics are quite cute, sort of like a child's colouring book. And especially, it's just a bit of fun when you can't really find anything to do!

Don't let the graphics turn your back on it, they're in reality very very cute. And the quests are very well done: for example, the Dragon master one that I unlocked early in the game, was completed at mid-game, because I needed to do other ones first to get the special item I needed for reaching the place.\n\nAnd you can do how many times you want a level: once it's unlocked, you can come back later with a new power to reach orbs, xp or new characters. And while the story features some reference to popular culture (the Guy Fawkes mask for example), it has also a good plot.\n\nThe gamepad is totally supported and it's true that a platformer game is better played with that kind of material than a keyboard, however, Super Panda Adventures don't have a big inventory and thanks god for that, not many spells: the three I've learned were enough!\n\nIt has also some RPG elements like leveling, points to attribute (for improving shield, health, mana or anything else I'm letting discover). It has also orbs that can help you improve your equipment (a very good sword, a very good armor, etc...) but you bet that these orbs are quite a catch.\n\nEach level (well not all but only one is missing these items) has three parts locked by keys (yellow, red, blue). Sometimes, it's in the story, sometimes, it's xp, shields, potions or orbs.\n\nThe music is also quite good: it's very adapted to the level you're playing. And don't let you mislead by a panda: the forest isn't the only setting! You'll even be on another planet..\n\nAnyway, I can only recommend this game because the developer made a very good job and that I enjoyed that game very much.

Cute art style, funny dialog, fun story, great soundtrack and the gameplay is a ton of fun.\n\nSuper Panda Adventures is an action platformer. You play as a Panda called Fu... bad guys appear kidnap a princess and its your job to rescue her... sound pretty cliche right. And it is, but the story is told in such a way it felt fresh.. at least for me it did! The game plays as a beat em up with various quest giving NPC around the world. Quest that (AFAIK) can be done in any order. \nIts mostly fetching quest which have you go back and forward between levels unlocking new areas to explore within the levels. The levels are well designed and have some tricky(for me :P) to find areas in them. \nYou can gather XP from slain enemies or find them around the world. When you level up you get 2 point to spend on a variety of skills. Also you unlock skills and helpful items and upgrade your gear. \nIts plays great with controller or keyboard. Platforming feels great... combat feels amazing...yeah.. I am trying to come up with something negative to say about this game... maybe its a bit too easy for some... but that is frankly the only thing i could think off \n\nThis game has been in multiple greenlight bundles.. but that does not do this game justice. Honestly Steam should be proud to have something like this in their store! \nI haven't complete the game yet(I will!!) and from what i played the asking price is well worth it! You'll get so much content for 4 usd/eur. This game is a must own and it deserves your attention. For the bargain full price you can't go wrong, let alone when it on sale. There is no excuse not to give this a try! 10/10\n\nEDIT: Just finished the game. And i CANNOT recommend this game enough. Just a small note apparently this game has difficulty settings... i started playing and just kept hitting A ( on a controller) and did not pay much attention (was not expecting much... boy was i wrong). I was playing on normal, there are 2 higher the difficulties. So forget the \"maybe its a bit too easy for some\" bit.

If there was ever a grander example of the wisdom, \u201cnever judge a book by its cover\u201d, I\u2019ve not found it (at least on Steam). A word to all: Ignore the obvious warning signs of a budget price and lackluster art; [i]SPA[/i] is a surprising amount of fun, and offers a stupendous metroidvania adventure, despite a few small flaws along the way.\n\nWhat surprised me most about [i]SPA[/i] wasn\u2019t the notably tight controls nor the exceptionally entertaining notion of controlling a panda with a katana. No, what surprised me was the sheer size of the level layouts, and the many paths therein. Levels are typically huge, and often reach deep into the ground and high into the clouds. While there are plenty of collectibles and upgrades waiting to be discovered, the emphasis on exploration and pathfinding is based more on your abilities and equipment as you find them, rather than on hidden paths or destructible walls. Meaning, the passage to a new upgrade is usually only blocked by a wall higher than your current jump, or a door requiring a key that you can\u2019t reach for a similar reason. Repeat exploration is encouraged, and most levels feature [i]something[/i] new to do after each new ability is earned. \n\nCombat is also surprisingly prevalent and entertaining, but then, the prospect of a sword wielding panda is an entertainment in its own right. [i]SPA[/i] features a leveling system, powered by hidden caches of points and killing enemies alike. Typical upgrades are standard fare, but by finding special orbs in each level, your armor and weapons can be upgraded, and changed in appearance as a result. Although I never became bored with the combat, exploring and re-exploring the same levels over again [i]could[/i] have felt more tedious without the consistent rewards of combat or in seeking out hidden caches. \n\nNot all is well, however, and while minor, there are several notable flaws that hamper the experience. Boss encounters typically carry a massive disparity in difficulty from the rest of the adventuring, due to enormous health bars and attacks equally both powerful and annoyingly difficult to avoid. The large levels, while a joy to run around in and explore, have no map system to fall back on, and so path finding relies solely on memory. When looking for each and every collectible and upgrade, that fact becomes irritating quickly, especially on the more vertical levels. Worse, there is no \u201cpercentage complete\u201d function, and so those missing odds and ends could literally be hidden in any level, and there\u2019d be no solid clue as to which. \n\nRegardless of listed faults, [i]SPA[/i] is an absolute delight.

Many of the trademarks of the Metroidvania genre are missing from this exploration platformer: the game is divided into distinct levels connected on an overworld map rather than being one large area to explore and upgrades are obtained exclusively (unless my memory fails me) by progressing the plot and talking to characters. No finding items in the world naturally and, most unfortunately in my opinion, no easy sequence breaks in sight. Quite simply, Super Panda Adventures is a pretty bad Metroidvania game.\n\nBut it's a pretty awesome exploration platformer.\n\nDon't let the (intentionally) \"bad\" graphics and cheesy storyline/writing fool you, this game has some serious quality to it. The controls are tight, the platforming is solid, and the combat is simple-yet-fun. There is an RPG-inspired level system that allows you to choose new traits to upgrade every time you level up and your equipment can also all be upgraded through the use of certain collectables hidden throughout the world. It's an absolute blast to play and I found myself returning to different areas again and again each time I got a new ability just to see if I had missed anything.\n\nI called the art \"bad\" up there, but the use of scare quotes was intentional. The art is very simple and, in all honesty, could have been made in MS Paint. There's a lot of character in the simple character sprites, though. Fu, the titular Super Panda, narrows his eyes when he attacks and smiles with glee when he jumps. The enemies all have very smooth animations and are all unique and varied. The NPCs, on the other hand, are literally never seen moving. It's a shame, but walk cycles can be a pain to animate. The art was done in this style on purpose and it achieves a very specific mood. Is it the highest quality art available? Not by any means. Is it good art? Absolutely insofar as it does precisely what it should.\n\nThe plot and writing are of a similar quality as the art: seemingly bad, but done so on purpose. Super Panda Adventures plays out like a childrens' book or perhaps a Saturday morning cartoon. The world is simple, but it's supposed to be. And, honestly, if you want epic storytelling in your $4 video game about swordfighting pandas, I think you might have problems. It's cute and endearing and, after a while, I barely even noticed how simple the writing was. Much like the art, it serves a purpose and creates a mood because of its simplicity, not in spite of it.\n\nThe music is bangin' awesome. There's a reason it's for sale as DLC.\n\nThe ONLY negative thing I have to say about this game is in regards to its few boss fights. In short: they're bad. At the time of writing, I still haven't finished the game simply because the final boss fight is just too hard for all the wrong reasons. The game conditions you to make use of a semi-reckless run-n-swing fighting style, only stopping to bring up your shield briefly to block an attack before continuing to carve a swath of desctrution through the enemies in your path. The boss fights, on the other hand, are slow and methodical exercises in pattern recognition and patience. Don't expect the next Super Metroid Ridley or Symphony of the Night Dracula here. Hell, I'd take Mario 3 Bowser over some of these. Luckily, there are few boss fights in the game and they can be overcome eventually. I'm sure I won't need more than a couple more swings at the endgame before I finish up.", "timestamp_created": 1405898210, "timestamp_updated": 1405898210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11337847": {"recommendationid": "11337847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057129523", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465089952}, "language": "english", "review": "This a great bargain game with great value, I played for about 4 hours on easy mode and still not finished, will take a break for months after I beat it, than play again with harder difficult, which has 5 levels of difficulty that can boosts replay.

by collecting XP items hanging around levels and by getting high damage combos on enemies.  All a \"combo\" means in this case is damage dealt without more than a couple seconds interruption - taking damage yourself does not interrupt a combo.  Each time you level up you get 2 points to distribute between available Perks.  There are a total of 16 perks, though most of them need to be unlocked by finding items an spells, and each Perk can be leveled 10 times.\n\nIn addition to the Perks you can level your primary weapon (sword), secondary weapon (boomerang)  and body armor 4 times each with special orbs, but these are usually hidden.\n\nThere are also 3 spells, 8 items which will let you access previously inaccessible areas, and 8 relics, of which 7 are optional and give Perk-like boosts such as (very slow) health regeneration or doubled XP gain from combos.\n\nThe levels are filled with normal pickups like hearts (health), shields (temporary armor which also allows you to explicitly use your shield to block), XP, and coins to use at stores (to buy hearts, shields and XP :D).  However these pick ups do not respawn - once you've gotten them and saved your game, they are gone forever.  You get full health when you level up, but not armor, so plan accordingly.   Enemies do respawn, and have a chance to drop any of the common pickups.\n\nSteam lists my time in the game as 15 hours, while the game lists my last save at 10.5 hours.  Taking idling and retrying after many deaths (especially on the bosses) into account, the game probably toook me about 12-13 hours to beat  on the Hard difficulty setting (2nd hardest), but mainly because I spent some time stuck, and a lot of time exploring for hidden items.  Other people have allegedly beaten it in half the time.\n\nI personally greatly enjoyed SPA, and would recommend it to any fan of metroidvanias.", "timestamp_created": 1405796761, "timestamp_updated": 1405797190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510135", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11315308": {"recommendationid": "11315308", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997900374", "num_games_owned": 2585, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441125137}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little Metrovania game, with a great sense of humor!", "timestamp_created": 1405760776, "timestamp_updated": 1405760776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11315095": {"recommendationid": "11315095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006756264", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433783097}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cool, it's smart it's interesting and it's got a panda hero, what more you can ask for?\n\nSeriously though this game is addictive with system of quests, experience, gearing up, exploring open panda world with tons of humor and pure fun.

The story is light and goofy.\n\nModern metroidvania standards apply and then some. Those with an aversion to open worlds should be happy that the quests provide decent direction. Meanwhile, backtracking is handled well with the ability to choose alternative areas until new mobility upgrades are found. There's generally something new to find once upgraded even if it's only a stash of experience pickups. Much of the content is optional.\n\nOne cardinal sin involves how checkpoints are placed before the scripted dialogue of boss battles.

However, the ability to immediately get back into the fight would have been nice.\n\nTowards the end, I would have also appreciated knowing the maximum level was locked at 50 and having a list of upgrade orbs I'd collected.

Magic: up to 3 different spells to unlock.\n- Characters. Some amusing characters (ninja cat, wizard rabbit, human, aliens) with funny dialogues. The enemies are varied too (birds, robots, slimes).\n- Cool Soundtrack. Really fits in with the game.\n\nDislikes:\n\n- Boss battles. They are okay.\n- No minimap.

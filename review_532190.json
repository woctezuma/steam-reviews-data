This is what definitely adds to its charm!\n\nIt is beautifully stylized, with its cutesy classic pixel art design, aesthetically a playful classic masterpiece (the pixelated TV is a nice touch)!  The first thing that stood out to me is the pixelated throwback graphical design!  It really takes me back, but offers a more satirical and cutesy version of the old NES hockey games.  The point of my curated list is to explore the artistry of design via limited pixels and resolution, so definitely a thumbs UP here :)  \n\nThe music too is well done (by that I mean poorly done, well).  There are a few guttural notes that I would personally have done without...No need to reproduce all such limitations ;)\n\n\nThere are 4 modes to the game: Tutorial, Exibition, Tournament & Challenge (having 5 different challenges within) and 5 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard & Pro (Seems a bit excessive and not very grandular)...The tutorial seemed to predict that this was going to be a tough as nails games.  Frankly, I found Easy, VERY if not, too difficult!  I personally play, enjoy and am pretty successful with many tough as nails games.\n\nThe game offers a team of 4 players and a goalie (except in some challenge modes), with the option of selecting from a set of team mates with different stats.  I think for those of us who are NOT real hockey buffs, they should include a little bio for each, so we can have a better understanding of how best to balance our teams.\n\nJust like the good old days of local co-ops that were implemented by way of sitting on the same couch with multiple controllers, so too can you play with your friends.  This is quaint, but I don't know how practical in today's age.  I think an online co-op/competition would be more ideal and suited to connecting players.  Having both options would have been most flexible.\n\n\nPlaying on EASY mode, it very difficult...I even felt insulted, because the tutorial talks about people quitting and here I am \"complaining.\"  Even with the decent controls, the computer can collectively use its players much better than I can.  It would seem that the trick to making goals is not in the aim or power, rather to spam the goalie until it goes in (which is how the computer scores most of their points).  \n\nI felt that this was more an element of luck, than acquired skill.  Power shots seem to never work and simply makes the puck fly askew, losing control.  That means once at the goal, every man simply attacks the puck until success.  You cannot do this well, if at all, as a simple player playing this game!  My team mates just didn't seem to have their head in the game.  I actually found the challenge of controlling one player most enjoyable, since it is not very efficient to control all four at the goal.\n\nPersonally, I used to be into these \"simulated\" sports games on the NES (my brother had NES Hockey and I had Blades of Steel), but they are not as fun to me anymore, though this has been a nice experience.  Ironically, I wasn't into platforming back then and have really came to love them now, so obviously tastes change over time.  I really love tough as nails, when the game play is fun and not monotonous, but I don't feel in control of this game at its current difficulty curve.\n\nAt $8 it is not a bad value...Not so much for me at this current difficulty setting :(  I can see playing though a bit, but not sure there is replay value for me over time (we will see).  \n\nI can suggest it for the die hard hockey fan or for the nostaligia of what this games very successfully reminds us of (In a very fun and playful way).  Maybe with an updated AI for the players team.  Of course I have not had a chance to play along with other humans either, which I think competing would be more balanced and maybe co-op would level the playing field.  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1115908478]If you purchase, you will want to read this![/url]\n\n\nHopefully the Dev is listening to these reviews :)...I would love to see the skill level a little more granular, the difficulty curve is way too high in my opinion.  Easy, should be, well easy (like practice)!  I see no issue with not gifting achievements at the easiest level, but makes the game more accessible.  Then a \"Normal\" level, which should again be playable, but more challenging.  Then an \"Hard\" and \"Pro\" would probably suffice :)  I am curious to know the break down of what changes when playing in each of these difficulty settings?\n\nAlso, when you are playing as one player without swapping, it would be ideal (IMO) to be able to press \"pass\" while you team AI has puck and force the them to pass to you.  You can get yourself more ideally positioned and then play more controlled and strategically.\n\n\nACHIEVEMENTS:  The game is tough and thus, so are the achievements...Aside from game difficulty, I think the achievements are reasonable, nothing like win 10,000 games.  I would suggest an achievement for winning 1, 10 and 100 fights though (such an important part of the hockey experience, that should be encouraged ;)  For perspective, only 0.4% of gamers have achieved the top achievement of winning 100 games.  A lot of devotion required on this one ;) \n\nISSUES: Your team's AI seems to be playing for the other team.  There is even a challenge mode where you play, while only controlling one player.  You other team mates behave like dummies in comparison to the other team!  \n\nI was reminded what it was like back when I was in school, during one particular game, not once did my own team every pass to me, only to themselves :{  I guess that is why I resorted to computer games :)  At one point, two of my players, one with the puck, where locked together each skating against the other.  \n\nIt is also misleading which player you will control, when playing no swap mode...I believe you are the 3rd player?\n\nIronically, I found it better to play on medium!  Definitely enjoy controlling the one character thus far.", "timestamp_created": 1513027757, "timestamp_updated": 1514281926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38140034": {"recommendationid": "38140034", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970359498", "num_games_owned": 875, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512022232}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven\u2019t played a lot of hockey video games, or really many sports games in general in recent times, but I have to say that that Super Blood Hockey gave me a good perspective on how entertaining they can be even with conventional sports.  Sure it\u2019s no Rocket League, and it\u2019s not going to be even remotely comparable to the actual rules and nuance of hockey, but it has some of the same allure of classics like NFL Blitz and Mario Strikers.  \n\n[h1]Bringing back the thumb pain[/h1]\n\nEverything about Super Blood Hockey has a nostalgic tinge to it.  From the graphics and sound, to the music, and even the wonderful thumb pain you\u2019d get when you were handling your controller a little too hard try to make sure your character was going as fast as possible.  It looks and feels like it could be on the Super Nintendo without a hiccup and given it only has four action buttons (shoot, pass, check, and change character), it could even work with the controller.  At the start, it plays out much like any hockey game, except with five players instead of six, and you face off just as you would in normal hockey game, but it doesn\u2019t take long for the chaos to begin.  Much like the aforementioned arcadey sports games, you can smash your opponent\u2019s players at any time with no direct consequences.  Even though there is a referee on the ice at all times, he\u2019s just another character to be shoved around with impunity.  The only time there is a reaction to your reckless violence, is when your repeated checks start even more violence and a fight breaks out.  Then every player starts attacking one another until one side\u2019s entire team is down.  Once this occurs, the losing team has a player laying on the ice for a while bleeding and wiggling around uncontrollably.  This creates this game\u2019s equivalent of a power play.  \n\nOutside of these mechanics, the rest of the game is straightforward.  Much like any hockey game, you can charge up your shots and passes by holding the shot button.  However here, if they hit a player other than the goalie, they can easily knock them down for a short period of time \u2013 which can give you a more open shot.  You also stand to score more often by quickly passing and shooting between players.  Things only really start to change when you introduce some of the modifiers in challenge mode that affect many aspects of the game.\n\n[h1]I think 24 is too many\u2026[/h1]\n\nI had to check out the 12 vs 12 mode, and as expected, it adds an impressive amount of anarchy to the already thoroughly chaotic gameplay.  When the first fight broke out, the ice was a sea of blood and twitching players.   Truly magnificent, but generally unplayable.  Other challenge modes unlock the ability to use different modifiers in the core portion of the game including harder AI.  However, as I did try to play the game on the hardest available AI, I can say that it seemed as though it changed little from the normal difficulty since both seemed fairly tough all around.  If nothing else, this adds some variety in the gameplay and keeps it playable even if you\u2019ve tired of a (relatively) normal hockey game.\n\n[h1]A hockey game for the everyman[/h1]\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot that can be said about such a simple game, but that\u2019s part of what makes it appealing.   It\u2019s very accessible to people unfamiliar with the nuances of the sport of hockey, but still entertaining enough to keep just about anyone interested for some time.  It\u2019s an easy game to recommend for a wide audience, though I think with online multiplayer it would really be on the next level.\n\n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28346672-Endyo-Gaming/", "timestamp_created": 1512687471, "timestamp_updated": 1513031847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38042115": {"recommendationid": "38042115", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992836882", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1516001313}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little 8 bit hockey game.

You choose from fat, normal and skinny players and try and win hockey games. Simple. I like the 'addition' of the shot aiming line and charging up passes as well as shots.\n\nOf course there's fancier stats in this game, and more blood. The line brawls and challenges are also pretty cool. You also get some 'cheat codes' for clearing the challenges, which is nice... except hugely necessary options are blocked by the challenges. You can't play as a manual goalie, and the game pace is painfully slow until you unlock the ability to make all players faster.\n\nA few other things I'd like to see changed - goalies not snapping back to the middle automatically on manual for sure is one. Additionally the goalies ABSOLUTELY need to be able to hold on to the puck so you can pass it back out. As it stands now, every single shot on goal creates a fat rebound, which makes it way too easy to put the puck in the net if you happen to have a player nearby. Faster faceoffs would also be good (sometimes the ref or one player will just be skating in circles for a few seconds for no reason) and a few more challenges. I'd also like to see the 8 and 12 man game options in exhibition modes, or a single game mode tweak to let me choose how many players on each side. Online multiplayer is also a must for this good game to be great. I would have bought 4-packs of this game to give away if I could scrap with my friends on the net.\n\nThe music is... okay. It's not amazing but it grows on you. I think there's some room for improvement here.\n\nIt's fun enough to hold interest for a tournament and quick enough to play a game or two on a break at the office. The tweaks required to make it a stronger game are mostly that, tweaks. I enjoyed the fact that the ref is there only to drop the puck and get shitkicked.\n\nAt the end of the day it's a fun game if you want to relive the glory days of the NES with a modern twist. I'll play through the tournament a few more times and will certainly get all the achievements unlocked. I fully feel like I'm getting my money's worth, and if the suggestions I've made are addressed it would be damn near close to perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1512019180, "timestamp_updated": 1512019180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575526", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37942656": {"recommendationid": "37942656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040831621", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512354663}, "language": "english", "review": "Cut my teeth playing hockey games on the classic \"Ice Hockey\" on my NES and being a lifelong hockey fan, I just knew I had to give this nostalgia powered game a go.\n\nThe graphics are great, and the chip tune music(while a little repetitive) is right on par with the 8 bit game that inspired this one. Controls are a little floaty, but its a hockey game that doesnt rely on deking to score so they are sufficient.\n\nThe AI is the biggest issue with this game. On offense it doesnt position itself well to open up passing or shooting lanes, or even to try and help keep the puck in the zone. On defense it doesnt really play man or zone , it sort of just goes where it wants on the ice. Sometimes it clogs the passing lanes, sometimes its standing out at the top of the point covering absolutely no one.\n\nNow the bigger issue with the AI is the goalie itself. The goalie is some-what exploitable on the one timer but the thing you NEED TO KNOW is to \"charge\" your pass, it makes the shot more powerful. Simply holding pass a split second longer made me go from losing 0-1 to winning 5 or more to 1.  There are some other exploitable plays like quick cross crease passes, and passes from just behind the net to the open side, but rebounding is the most consistant way to score, so long as you have players in position.\n\nBeyond the AI/Goalie issues there are some others (that should and could be easily fixed):\n\nThe different teams are all exactly the same, except for the color they wear. Each team could get a minor stat bonus (like the Russians get +1 speed, the Canadians get +1 shooting) and it would easily add some preference and variety to the game.\n\nThe CPU chooses the a random player load out every time. Having each country have its own \"line up\" would be a step towards further varying the teams.  Indicating who takes the face off on the player screen would also be great.\n\nPlayer skill differential. The enforcers are supposed to be slow, and the snipers are supposed to skate fast, but if youre trying to skate down a fatty with the puck using a bean pole he'll probably get the shot off before you catch up with him, it feels like the skaters all go about the same speed. With the goalie issues mentioned above , it doesnt make sense to have any skinny dudes on the squad.\n\nCustom team / colors/ flag. Choose from a set of generic flags, pick your primary and seconary color , and your stat buff and BAM. You have your own personal team to take on the world with. \nThis would be made even better if the country teams had player names too but thats probably asking too much. The North Korea joke ran its course very fast , so this is the team I'd replace with \"Custom\"\n\nWith some tweaks to the AI this would be a pretty amazing game, but even as is, I can recommend it. This is a great throw back game and given the slim pickin of hockey games on PC this one is a keeper.\n\nI hope further development makes this game even better", "timestamp_created": 1512007683, "timestamp_updated": 1512329883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1512056796, "developer_response": "Hi, \n\nSorry your experience wasn't a bit more positive. I would like to address some of your concerns that you mentioned.\n\nConcerning the AI, I have no intentions of modeling/simulating real hockey strategy. The simple reason is because I feel it makes for stale game-play. SBH is a rejection of simulation based hockey games. SBH is supposed to be messy and chaotic, it is not a by-the-books, clean hockey game. If you after simulation based hockey with realistic strategy, unfortunately SBH will never be that, we already have EA NHL for that. However, that doesn't mean the AI can't be improved upon. I definitely think there is room for improvement in the AI, but it will not come in the form of trying to simulate real hockey strategy.\n\nThe goalie AI is exactly the same on both sides in all situations, difficulties, scenarios, etc. In SBH the goals are not determined by dice-rolls/RNG, therefore simply putting forth a larger number of shots isn't a guarantee to win. Shot quality matters more. It is important to aim your shots using the thumbstick if you want to make some goals. I would like to stress that the AI does not cheat in any capacity.\n\nI think differentiating the teams more is a great idea. I am not sure if I want to do it via stat difference, but I am working on a season mode of sorts, and I have some ideas to create more differentiation between the teams as well as more individual personality to each player. Maybe something like individual player names and stats could work.\n\nConcerning the CPU player loadout. It is randomized every time. That doesn't mean they can't randomly take the same loadout a few times in a row, but it is randomized. If you think a bug might be occurring, I think we could investigate it and figure out what might be going wrong.\n\nI really appreciate you giving me some feedback. I think you are correct, the AI and other aspects of the game can be improved and expanded upon. As of this moment, I am working on a console port of the game, but I definitely have new content in the works. If you have any other suggestions or ideas please feel free to make a post in the game's discussion forum.

The gameplay is visceral and satisfying, whether it be scoring a goal or duking it out in big-ass button mashing brawls against the opposing team to determine who gets to be on the power play by beating a random guy into convulsions for a minute.

Die meisten Entwickler setzen nur noch auf PC, weil sich hier das meiste Geld verdienen l\u00e4sst.\n\nDie schon fast obligatorischen Steam-Features wie Achievements und Trading Cards sind nat\u00fcrlich auch vorhanden und werten die Spielerfahrung zus\u00e4tzlich auf.\n\n8/10 Punkte von meiner Seite f\u00fcr dieses sehr gut spielbare Retro-Eishockey und auch zu diesem Preis eine klare Kaufempfehlung von meiner Seite.

On top of that, once you start getting good you can also crank up the difficulty and feel like a noob again.\n\nI also appreciate that the option is there to turn down/off the blood so I can play the game with my son, and conversely that I can turn it up for adding that extra ridiculousness to it.\n\nThe dev has been very responsive, particularly with regard to getting the Linux version working, which is always a plus in my book.\n\nI strongly recommend this game, especially if you're a fan of hockey, for all the reasons above (as well as the fact that it's just a lot of fun).

I remember playing hockey games on the Sega Mega-Drive, and most of the fun to be had in those games was derived from trying to start a fight in the game. It was a novelty, but a lot of fun. So much fun, in fact, that there was a Monster Hockey League game that tried to amp up the violence a bit. Super Blood Hockey is a fun tribute to those old hockey games, with a dash of extra violence. No need to wait around for a fight, they happen quite a lot. Even the ref can get knocked over in the mayhem! My only gripe with the game is that the speed of the characters feels sluggish, and almost tank-like in their turning for some. Luckily, you can unlock a feature to adjust the characters weight, essentially giving them all a speed boost. I feel like it should be faster off the bat, but still, this is a great nod to those old hockey games, and has a fantastic, frantic arcade feel to it.

Loren Lemcke has managed to capture the arcade feel of some classic games and distil it into a modern formula. Super Blood Hockey is pretty much summed up in its title; this is an arcade style ice hockey game with a strong focus on hitting people in the face, bereft of any repercussions.\nIn the game you get to choose from several different teams (Russia, Canada etc.) and after choosing your team you then select the types of player which form up your squad. Sniper (great at shooting but can get knocked down easily) enforcers (which can take a few hits but are slow on the ice) and a couple of others which add a level of simplistic tactics to the game that are fun to mess around with to see what suits your style of play.\nThe graphics in the game are pleasantly chunky and hark back to the 16-bit era with the added bonus of being extremely smooth. One of Super Blood Hockey\u2019s strong points is how it takes a solid formula and irons out the limitations placed upon previous iterations by the technology available at the time. The gameplay is fluid and the weight of the players and movement of the puck feels \u2018right\u2019, which can be a deal-breaker in these types of games, if not handled correctly.  \nA lot of people will remember Ice Hockey on the NES, which is a game to which Super Blood Hockey owes a pint or two (of type \u2018O\u2019 negative) in the aesthetics department. The music, which is very much rooted in the NES-era, is incredibly catchy and the title screen of a city at night reminded me of the Streets of Rage intro (good).\nThe controls in the game are just pure pick up and play. The shoulder buttons flick between players on the ice, X controls the power of your shot, A is the same for your pass and B is the attack button (you\u2019ll use this A LOT). When the match starts, you\u2019ll be battering your opponents in no time, spraying geysers of blood all over the shop (all the while unlocking Steam achievements like \u2018ruptured lung and \u2018brain damage\u2019). However much pain you unleash on the ice, there aren\u2019t any lasting effects so the pace of the action stays high all the way through the match with nothing  slowing down the constant pixelated gushing of blood.\nSuper Blood Hockey has a few different game modes, exhibition, tournament and also a challenge mode which, when completed unlocks greyed-out options in the settings that add extra touches to the game such as adjusting the weight of the puck etc. The challenges are TOUGH and consist of situations such as winning a match with a manually-controlled goalie, succeeding in a match where you are outnumbered by 8-4 players etc. (one of the options which I immediately ramped RIGHT up was raising the level of blood spilled in-game to preposterous amounts. Any vampires in the arena were loosening their ties, let me tell you!).\nWhilst these optional alterations are nice additions to have, I feel that this is really a multiplayer game at heart. From what I can see, all of the teams are identical beyond their colours; the only differential comes into play with the previously mentioned player types. This is an arcade style game with a heavy focus on dip in and out local multiplayer gameplay, which to me is timeless. The game supports up to four-player local play which is absolutely perfect for the kind of game this is. Vibes I got from Super Blood Hockey were Brutal Sports Football on the Amiga for its approach to comical violence over deep strategic gameplay (Brutal Sports Football is one of my favourite Amiga games) Speedball 2 for the fluidity and Instantly accessible gameplay and also the hugely underrated Wrecked on the PlayStation 3 for its 4-player fun factor timelessness.\nBeyond its arcade-action charms, if I had to pick up any negatives, it would be the lack of variety in the game. The single-player mode I can imagine isn\u2019t as much fun as multiplayer but to me that\u2019s not a drawback as it\u2019s not the main pull of the game. All the best multi-player games can be a bit lonely or dull in single-player modes. In fact, I recall reading a 43% review of the aforementioned \u2018Wrecked\u2019 when to me, it\u2019s clearly one of the best and most addictive 4-player games on the PlayStation 3. In that review, the sole focus was on the lack of modes for single-player which I didn\u2019t pick up on at all. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed is the difficulty in one player matches due to the AI in the game which, at the time of writing this is being addressed in a patch.\n \nSuper Blood Hockey  does its thing well, it has neat touches of humour with a bonkers Zamboni driver, matches that sometimes break into all out brawls and a referee that clearly doesn\u2019t need to be there but I\u2019m glad he is\u2026so that I can punch him in the face. The developer seems to be adding extra patches and changes on a daily basis which is promising as they seem to be responding positively to user feedback and acting on suggestions decisively.\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, maybe there isn\u2019t enough depth here for some people and would that be solved by the Brutal Sports-like addition of weapons & energy bars? Perhaps if different arenas, a dash button or special moves were available it would add to the longevity? But at under a fiver, if you have a few friends who come around for some drinks and gaming this is definitely an essential purchase.\n \nA quick shout out to my local ice hockey team the Cardiff Demons whose star player is the drummer from my band Old Samuel!

Two hours in, I'm done here. In its current state, this game is worth $2.99 USD. Its a nostalgia trip, but thats where it gets off. Its hardly funny, and after the initial \"aw isnt that adorable\" factor. The blood is kinda whatever, the hits are whatever. There were even moments where the puck would get stuck in the boards, or stuck under the goalie. Luckily the players resolve this moment by just fighting. Everything is pretty much pre-canned, all of the teams feel the exact same (spoiler alert, they are)... computer doesnt even randomly select between the 3 player types, always playing against the same loadout. During a game, there is no random chance for a player to get injured. The AI is kinda weak and very unpredictable, controls are drifty when I go to \"aim my shot\" or \"toggle select a specific defender\", and playing with a mouse and keyboard is practically impossible.\n\nI don't know what I expected, but after 2 hours, I'm actually pretty aggravated with playing this game. I get upset when I cant toggle my defensive character to the person I want to switch to. I get upset when the sniper class seems relatively useless when I need them the most. I get angry when the goalie saves every shot possible, but the only goals that get let in are just spam shots and garbage scramble plays right in front of the net. Fighting happens far too often, some games I'll get like 10 line brawls and honestly after the first 2 or 3 or so, it gets a bit old. \n\nI guess I was hoping more for like a mutant league type of game.... but this is not that.

If large AAA studios with hundreds of people can't come up with a solution to this, then I have no chance as a single person. \n\nAlso another consideration is for a replay system. A constant framerate allows me to record inputs over a period of time and then play them back and get the same outputs, within a deterministic physics simulation.\n\nA third consideration is for the purpose of online multiplayer. In order to sync a deterministic physics simulation over a network, you need to record physics inputs consistently over a period of time, so time-stamped packets of data can be sent to the client to have the same physics simulation result in equal ouputs on a client computer.\n\nLocking the game at 60 fps is the correct move for a variety of reasons.

Most of the bugs have been phased out with the last couple of updates. However, passing is still an issue. Needs a line indicator to show where your pass is going or you will simply pass it to the other team. For a more arcade feel, it could use a system of power ups that appear on the ice through out the game, such as a speed booster, a power shot, invisible team, turn your opponents control inverted, just little things to make the game more insane.  \n\nThere needs to be a 12v12 mode that you can play with friends. Sure its fun to load up as many people as possible to play against the computer but it would be more fun to spilt the mayhem and go at each other. Also, I want to set up handicap games where I play lets say only two skaters vs the computers 4 to 8 players just for increased difficulty. Also on the third update, they added a pro level difficulty. It is beef supreme. \n\nI give this game a solid 9/10. \nPros\n1. you can change the weight of the players\n2. you can decrease or increase the friction \n3. you can can play as 8 different teams. \n4. there are a lot of different difficulties for the players to play.\n5. you can win it all for North Korea.\n6. you can watch the Zamboni run over players during intermission.\n7. there is a 12v12 mode that brings a whole new meaning to chaos on ice. \n8. you can punch the ref in the face.\n \n\nCons\n1. passing is a bit weak, cannot point the puck where you want it to go.\n2. no online multiplayer. (yet)\n3. USA is not in blue, I'm American\n4. Canada is not in red, I love my Canadian neighbors.\n5. Some of the colors are a bit close to each other. Such as the Czechs v N.

He is constantly keeping up with his community, responding to feedback, taking suggestions, fixing bugs, etc. I've even had the chance to chat with him a couple times, and he's just a genuinely nice dude. Plus, you can't go wrong with a game whose dev is passionate and cares, right?\n\n     Now onto the game itself: I didn't personally grow up in the 90's, so I didn't play games like NHL 94 and 95, Original Ice Hockey, or any of the other games that are generally compared to this one when I was really little. But, I do own NHL 95 on Sega Genesis and I've been playing it since I was fairly young. Anyways, if you were to throw all of the older hockey games from those day into a blender and mix it all up, it would come out as Super Blood Hockey. What I'm trying to say is that this game is great. It has perfect gameplay mechanics, just the right difficulty levels for people of all expierence, hilarious humor, and anything else you could ask for from a retro style hockey game.\n\n     I've been with this game since early beta, and Loren has really outdone himself on this one, I gotta hand it to him.\n\n     11/10 recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1503604947, "timestamp_updated": 1503604947,

Ill then quit the game and load it back up and we are good to go.\n\nBut a few ODD occurances is when the other team is short TWO PLAYERS. At that point the game hangs the entire system. No combination works to get out of the game, got to hard restart your pc.\n\nThe devs should check this out. Its very fun and if you rmember games on the NES like Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel, this is what its like, but with more advanced physics and overall more appelaing gameplay.\n\nWorth the few dollars, even more so if the issues are remedied.", "timestamp_created": 1503582317, "timestamp_updated": 1503582317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1503585282, "developer_response": "Hi,\n\nSorry you are experiencing some issues.

The opposing teams snipes shots in from across the ice and their teammates gobble up rebounds constantly while your team is guaranteed to be out of position. Frustrating even on easy with a great team vs a terrible team because you're getting crushed. \n\nSome suggestions to the creator:\nWhen switching players it often switches to out of position defenders who are behind the player but closest so on an opposing 1v1 the computer controls your lone defender (who screws it up) while I'm frantically mashing switch player between the players behind the opposing player. Since I'm forced to catch up and holding the forward button when it does eventually swithch I skate the defender the wrong way. Instead it should pick the closest defender that's closer to the goal so you get the person in position to block them. \n\nGetting your players in front of the net would be helpful as well since right now they seem to be focused on getting as close to eachother as possible to make passing impossible. Have them spread out andat least have one guy in the back of the zone as a release pass and defense on a turnover. The main way to score a goal is either through a rebound or a one-timer but your teammates either run straight at you or run in random directions away from the goal no matter how long I hold the puck in the zone to give them time to get in position. Why not have at least one player try to setup some play. \n\nThe passing mechanic doesn't work very well, I'll hold up and the pass will go right to a place with no people there. I can't figure out why it does this. \n\nLastly it doesn't tell you who will be taking the faceoffs so I'm constantly sending people to the faceoffs throughout the game who suck at it because I don't know which position to put the faceoff guy in. Labeling who takes the faceoffs in pregame character select would be helpful so I can assign the most talented players to the right position.\n\n\nAll that being said the game looks cool, has cool music, and is a great concept it just needs finishing touches to make it great.", "timestamp_created": 1503514643, "timestamp_updated": 1503547326, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0,

Super Blood Hockey (characters don't get cut or bruised) and be more in-line with the genesis hockey games I played like NHLPA '93, or Ike Ike! Nekketsu Hockey Bu where their faces would stay nice and bloody, or players had unique special attacks and could really whoop some ass.\n\nI am decent when it comes to sports games, I grew up playing sports games, but the AI behavior between the difficulty settings is almost non-existant.  I hardly noticed an increase in difficulty between Easy all the way to Pro.  \n\nPlayed the tutorial mode, and it says that you shouldn't want the game to be easy, but sometimes I want an easy gaming experience.  A lot of it seems like dumb luck, I have won plenty of games on this, but at the same time the AI can score in literally six seconds or less against you, on easy mode at that.  Tutorial doesn't address the underlying issue, instead the author pulls the tired old expression of \"Get Good\", where the issue is really the developer's lack of ability to accurately program AI according to difficulty, or to add better control over your characters.  Switching characters should not be so random, feels clunky and sometimes it's like the control is an opponent in itself.    \n\nMusic and sound effects aren't bad, but music does not change the whole game, making longer games dreadful. \n\nThere are no stat differences between teams, no special shots like in good old-school NES sports games like Super Dodgeball or Ike Ike! Nekketsu Hockey Bu.  Players could have different health bar levels and/or special shots.  This is a huge wasted opportunity, you literally just pick the team for their color, very disappointing.\n\nGoalie does not hold the puck, only bounces it, would have been nice to have him hold on to it for more control instead of playing pong with him.\n\nDirection of your shots is mostly random, they go toward the net but you can't really accurately control it, which can make it difficult to capitalize on empty sections of the net.\n\nContrasting this to a good game like NHLPA '93, I feel like this game doesn't capture what it was supposed to.  I grew up playing old school hockey games, I know this guys is a solo developer, but he should have taken a page from Ike Ike! Nekketsu Hockey Bu:  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdXI6Nzik5w\n\nOverall, I can see what the author was trying to do, but I feel like his knowledge base in regards to programming AI is limited, and he did not play any of the old school hockey games most of us grew up with.\n\n*Also I want to mention that my initial review I had played for a few hours on my friend's laptop when I was watching his house.   So the author's comment is incorrect because I had about 2-3 hours of gameplay of the game.  As of this post I have six hours of gameplay, give or take 20 minutes.", "timestamp_created": 1503468236, "timestamp_updated": 1510403819, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1503470042, "developer_response": "Sorry you did not have a better experience with the game!\n\nTo any one reading this, I would like to clarify a few things.

I'm still yet to win a game, haha. Although it does have five difficulty levels, easy to pro. Scoring takes some practice because the goalies are good but I'm starting to score some crackers. I don't even mind losing, the games have been so competitive. I lost my last match 8-7, best game yet. \n\nIt has an exhibition mode: a one off friendly... If you can call it that. \nA tournament mode: You compete against 7 other teams in a round robin. \nLastly a challenge mode: it pits you against a team in, at time of writing, 5 differing scenarios, one of which is Outnumbered... You have 4 team members, the opposition has 8, really fun. Or Mega Rumble... A 12 v 12 match up. \n\nThis is a no rules ice hockey game. Hit the opponents as much as required & I suggest you do so often... Even the referee.\nSometimes a fight will break out, just try beating four extra opposition players. Great game.\n\nUpdate: Starting to win now, at least on medium difficulty.

SBH improves on Ice Hockey in many ways: battles for the puck and line brawls aren't reduced to button-mash fests as they were on the NES, nor are the CPU goalies easily juked, and the skinny guys aren't completely useless against human opponents like they were back in the mid-80s.  Here it's the fat guys that are the liability, since they have no speed AND they don't dominate everyone except other fatties in puck battles like they did on the NES. The added challenge and tournament modes add replayability the NES didn't have as well. There's a gigantic dose of humor and pixel-blood in the game. Instead of going to the penalty box, a player from the losing side lies seizing on the ice for 30 seconds, spurting blood all over the place. The zamboni will run down players leaving the ice if they don't exit quickly enough. Lots of neat touches like this are sprinkled all over the game and makes it fun to pick up and play. The only place SBH doesn't improve over Ice Hockey is the music, which is pretty great, but not timeless and steeped in nostalgia like the NES version... you can't really fault them for that though.", "timestamp_created": 1503290312, "timestamp_updated": 1503363129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34386680": {"recommendationid": "34386680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048041615", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509334200}, "language": "english", "review": "Great hockey game.

If you never played this Nintendo game it has since been rereleased on the Virtual console on both Wii and WiiU. (2006 & 2014)\nQuite simply you are given a team with 4 players with a choice of 3 different classes, a heavy fighter, a skinny shooter and a middle one. These teams differ by their colours and represent several countries.\nThis is local multiplayer Ice hockey with a referee who doesn\u2019t do anything when the players beat each other up. \n\n[u] What makes it different? [/u]\nIt has been nearly 30 years since the original release and although he has kept the nice pixel art style with some fitting chiptune (composed by Shawn Dalley) Loren has made some welcome updates and additions. First of all he has made this 2 player game into a 4 (or 5) player game with the much more ergonomically designed Xbox controllers. \n(It appears a 5th player can join in with keyboard.) \nLoren has added some crazy challenge modes to add play time into the formula which will also grants unlockable modes. The unlockables include a manual goalie mode, no swapping mode and adjustable puck elasticity, puck friction and player weight. \nHe has also added a tournament mode where giving a \u2018story of sorts\u2019 showing failure and winning screens to each team making cute jokes about each country. \nAnd of course as the name implies there is added blood...Super blood! This makes a red mess over the ice and will spurt out of players who are injured in fighting.\n\n[u] What did we like? [/u]\nThe 4 player local multiplayer is a welcome and necessary update to this fun little game for a new generation of gamers. The art style has been done fairly tastefully and this combined with Shawn Dalleys fitting highpaced chiptunes pushes the nostalgia button hard. Although I am not a parent I feel this will hopefully warm the hearts of many older gamers who are now parents and may want to pass on their love to their children. \nI am also quite grateful for the ability to reduce the time periods, alter the amount of blood and the removing of the icing rule. The fights have been changed and it seems quite silly and funny that the referee seems to ignore the fighting and the penalty is an injured player who doesn\u2019t get removed from the ice.\n\n[u] What could have being improved? [/u]\nThis is a hard question as it is clear Loren tried to be as faithful to the original as possible. I found that the winning and losing celebration gets a bit repetitive. Perhaps for winning animations dances, poses, group poses and for losers crying, in fighting, or similar angry animations. \nI would have also hoped to hear a bit more range from the music chosen. \nPerhaps bringing on another musician in future to give more variety?\nWould this game improve due to online multiplayer? \nWould there be enough of a market to warrant doubling the development time and paying for expensive hosting costs? \nThis is a high paced sports game where any interruption in gameplay can be game breaking. Although difficult, perhaps the BEST way to potentially include online multiplayer is to borrow from fighting and racing games. These games sometimes collected player data as \u2018ghost\u2019 that could seamlessly cover for any interruption in connection.\nLoren has added a lot of extra content on the single player side but this game can still get a little repetitive after you\u2019ve unlocked everything and seen the winning and losing screens.\n\n[u] Should you play it? [/u]\nYes!

It's a fast-paced, retro, arcade hockey game. It's not as fast-paced as NHL Hitz. But, like NHL Hitz, there are no rules, penalties, or play stoppages (icing, handpass, offsides, goalie puck covering, etc.) until there is a goal or the entire arena erupts into a last-man-standing brawl. The losing team to the brawl loses a man temporarily. \n\nThere are some things that the game doesn't communicate very well to new players. For example, goalies will always block shots if they're in position to do so (essentially, it's a hitbox check with no RNG). So, it's essential to get the goalie out of position to make a goal as just hammering the puck directly at the goalie won't do you any good. Once I figured that out, and after losing many, many games figuring there was a chance the goalie would miss a save, I started playing way better (one-timers are your best friend in this game). But, the game never communicates this anywhere. This will probably be added later on, but a tutorial or training mode would help new players a lot with this. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind that this is a local-multiplayer game only right now. No online matches. I'm fine with that, personally, but I know many who aren't. The only thing I'd like more right now is a franchise mode or an option to make your own team (with names) and an instant-replay feature on goals. It's a small thing, but it gets you a bit more invested in the players and game. \n\nOverall, this a great arcade game if you're a hockey fan or like really fast paced, crazy games.", "timestamp_created": 1503163805, "timestamp_updated": 1503163901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34354536": {"recommendationid": "34354536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998297242", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506720008}, "language": "french", "review": "Juste monstrueux comme jeu : pas de r\u00e8gle, pas de hors-jeu, pas de icing...

Visuals are crisp; animations excellent. Skating is smooth, slippery, yet predictable & feels appropriate. Sound & music is well done 8-bit retro fare.   \n+ Improvments to the classic NES IH gameplay - auto goalies, controllable fighting (last team standing wins), one-timers; checking can be timed to be really effective.  \n+ Costs the same as a fast-food number meal, and you won't have to pass it in 45 minutes. \n+ Playable hockey on Steam for like, the first time ever. \n+ Your non-videogame, frantic button-mashing friends will probably do pretty well with this one\n\nSome cons:\n- Passing does the \"aim at this guy, but try to pass across the ice to someone else\" thing alot.\n- Skating, trying to get/stop breakaways becomes tedious without a boost button, and these guys don't exactly have the edgework of Connor McDavid.\n- Lots of hit posts until you get \"the one-timer move\" down, which seems by far the easiest way to score. \n- Controller customization would have been nice.

The base of what's here is good, and the promise of further development is keeping me from refunding it immediately, but in its current state I can't quite recommend it.\n\nThings this game doesn't have yet that I'd love to see implemented:\n- Ironically, a simplified control scheme. Since you can only pass or shoot while you have the puck, and you can only check or change character without it, you could easily double up on button usage. Pass/change character and shoot/check makes the most sense.\n- Team creator + named teams. Pick a country, pick a colour (or two), name your team. A small detail that endears you to your team just that much more.\n- Special shot types. Also goes well with the team creator idea, but could just be given to each class individually. The Enforcer's beefy slapshot is already perfect, but it'd be fun to have something like a slow-mo shot you can control somewhat, or maybe a super fast slapshot that doesn't hurt anyone, but zooms like a bullet towards the goal.\n- A Turbo meter. Not being able to catch up to guys as they're meandering across the ice doesn't feel great, so having a button that lets you speed up a tad would be nice, but should come in limited, replenishable supply. Could also use it with the check/shoot button to add even more impact to them.\n- Better One-Timer recognition. The \"pass and have the other guy immediately fire the puck at the net\" move refered to as a \"One-Timer\" is a staple of hockey games, and should definitely get some use here. Passing and then immediately pressing the shoot button should ideally result in some kind of bonus power or accuracy, possibly depending on what class the one taking the shot is. If this is already implimented, then it's less noticeable than I think it should be. Maybe add some flash to the shot to signify that it's a One-Timer.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. If some of this stuff gets implimented later, then I'll test it out and change my review later.

The fights, which are basically team-wide 4v4 brawls, are great, and they do have some impact on the game. If your team loses the fight, one of your players will be down on the ice, hemmorrhaging blood for a couple of minutes, essentially acting as a power play, except one that doesn't end when a goal is scored. \n\nThe shooting/scoring itself almost feels like playing air hockey. So far most of my goals have been scoring by just relentlessly pressing the shoot button, and you can and should definitely use the posts to your advantage. Bonus points for being able to take out the ref, too. \n\nA few suggestions that I have would be something like an on-fire system like in NHL Hitz 2002, and a sprint/boost button or something like that.

I'm not sure of what the exact price will be, but going by the amount of content, it will most likely be $10.\n\nBeing a hockey game, don't expect much variety, but then again its hockey and one of the few sports I find interesting. You have standard mode/exhibition mode, tournament mode, and challenge mode. Challenge mode offers five different challenges to beat, offering special scenarios such as turbo mode or 12v12 games. The rewards for beating these are an unlockable extra option to add variety to games.\n\nThese are:\n\n    Adjustable puck friction\n    No swapping option\n    Adjustable puck elasticity\n    Adjustable player weights\n    Manual goalie option\n\nOne extra option is already unlocked from the start, which is blood volume, the default being 100ml but you can up it to 500 or 0 if you want a bloodless game. But no one wants that.....right?\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the manual goalie option in particular as it made me focus on yet another player, having to block incoming shots myself instead of relying on the AI to. Throwing in the no swapping option to games made them significantly harder, being able to only use one player the entire time instead of switching constantly forced me to mix things up and play more defensively, rather than just punch anyone that got in my way.\n\nThere are three different classes to use. Snipers are the lightest and hit the weakest but have the highest accuracy, enforcers hit like a goddamn freight train but have the worst aim, and playmakers are a mix of the two with the highest overall stats but only one maxed.\n\nAnother feature, and one I am glad was added, is local multiplayer. It offers the chance for not one or two, but five people to play on the same system, four on controllers and one on keyboard. More games need this damn feature.\n\nSuper Blood Hockey lovingly captures the look, feel, and sound of 8-bit and 16-bit games of old. The music by chiptune artist Shawn Daley especially makes this game, sounding like its straight from the 80's.\n\nFinally, being a hockey game, yes, you can beat the crap out of your opponents, the fights putting the game on hold until one team emerges glorious from a sea of blood of both allies and enemies.\n\nEither alone or with friends, the game is great for short blasts of icy bloodbaths.", "timestamp_created": 1502991948, "timestamp_updated": 1503003560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34311909": {"recommendationid": "34311909", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991160211", "num_games_owned": 740, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506491168}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing hockey games since Intellivision Ice Hockey and I have one thing to say:\n\nWE HAVE A WINNER FOLKS!!!\n\nThe wait for this gem was worth it, and I expect to be playing for years to come.

The game feels like it gives multiple quests for the same dungeon to pad play time. Most dungeon quests require that you beat the same dungeon with multiple characters to complete a quest. However, a lot of these quests don't even seem to be tailored to the class or race that was specified by the quest. I felt like the game turned into a slog. A chore of sorts. New dungeons can be fun, but beating the same dungeon more than once never felt rewarding or enhanced my experience with the game outside of trying out a new character.\n\nThere are also some mechnics in the game that are not obvious at first and take some getting used to such as the XP mechanic. The game explains these mechanics in tutorial levels and how to play the game 'properly'. It almost felt as if the game was explaining how to abuse the damage and healing mechanics just to beat regular levels. It was certainly not what I was expecting from the game as I continually got bogged down doing math in my head to try to get to level 9 with full health and a mana pot just to have a chance at beating the level 10 boss. It was very frustrating to get to level 9, but realise I had taken too much damage or was a few points of faith away from getting the altar spell I needed to beat the boss. To summarise, it was not the kind of game I was expecting.

For you, it may be exactly what you're looking for, so read on.  \n\nScreenshots and videos on the Steam store page are slightly misleading as to what type of game this is.  I see the screeshots and \"Rogue-lite\" description and immediately think it was going to be something with some strong RPG elements combined with some tactical strategy (since there is no forced rush during gameplay).  It's nice to be able to think out your next move without something bearing down on you, but the game is designed in a way that will force you to fail no matter how methodical you think you're being if you don't do things in the correct order.\n\nI'm sure that you can pour hours into the game and \"figure it out\", but the reality is that the game isn't as engaging as the Steam store page would make you believe.  Re-doing the same level over and over again isn't appealing.  The numerous times that I sat staring at the final \"boss\" and couldn't do anything because they were higher level than me and was forced to restart (becuase I didn't do things \"in the correct order\") is what forces a negative review.  I'm always down for a good puzzle, but when it looks like an RPG, I want it to play like an RPG; which means that I should have at least some say in how I go about completing it based on my decisions, not the decisions the developers have already made for me.  \n\nThe \"puzzle\" in this game isn't the gameplay, it's the hidden framework of killing things in a certain order and is just masked behind an RPG skin.

you're stuck and feel like giving up, google for \"DDWiki\" from QCF Designs which has info and guides to everything in the game. I avoided it until I was 100+ hours into the game since I wanted the fun of alot of trial and error.)\n     This may seem like a simple hack-and-slash, but it's not. There's almost no luck and a surprising amount of planning involved. Each dungeon is like a puzzle, and might take 15-45 minutes to complete. You start each dungeon as a lowly level 1 character. Kill the monsters in a certian order and gain the power-ups at the right times and you will be able to defeat the boss-monster and thus \"win\" each dungeon.  if you randomly charge in like a hack-and-slash game, you won't maximize your powerups and you won't have enough health to tackle the tougher monsters. Same if you spend the power-ups too soon. If you don't defeat the tougher monsters, you don't gain the experience-point bonuses to increase your abilities enough to tackle the boss-monster. As you complete dungeons, you can unlock other character classes (again, you start each dungeon back as level 1). Since there's very little luck involved in combat, most of the time you will know the results of a combat before it happens, and can choose to either delay it until you are more powerful or press on. The game UI shows you how much damage you and your opponent will suffer each round of cobmat, and thus allow you to predict the result of each combat. Choosing to use magic glyphs and potions can also modify how a combat turns out. Therefore you only die when you've made a blunder, or backed yourself into a corner by poor planning.\n\nEDIT: about the only negatives are that the class challenges are somewhat hard and might put off beginners. Also some of the Explorers Giuld puzzles are more like chess puzzles, in that one wrong move and you can't beat it. Again, give the DDwiki a look before giving up.\n\nThe art and story in a tongue-in-cheek way poke fun at the Fantasy Role Playing genre. The price is cheap and the play value is good.

The Alpha would have LOVED to have dungeons half as interesting.\n   BUT the quests you are usually given and guided toward involve going to the most boring dungeons.\n\n Example: Namtar's Lair involves striking down a reanimating necromancer six times while carrying his corpse further and further down the Underworld, while you both become weaker the farther you descend. This dungeon is dope as hell, but there's no quests for it. Den of Danger is the resident baby dungeon and encourages you to replay it at least 11 times successfully (I think, AT LEAST 9). \n\nVerdict: This game is really fun and has a lot of content; however, the way you're encouraged to play to unlock things is not really the best showcase of the game.

Fighting a monster takes away health and mana, though you can replenish it by exploring. However, just make sure to consider in which direction you want to explore the dungeon, as the precious tiles run out faster than you think. There are also a lot of different items that you can unlock, which will help you to smack those monsters around. And to spice it up, you have also 9 gods to choose from. Each one will alter your play style, as they reward and punish(!) various actions. One god is easy to learn, but tough to master, but to use more than one and know when to worship which god will take time, but will give such a huge reward!\n\nIn addition, there are some fixed dungeons included, which only allow for one single execution of steps to beat the challenge.

The mix of roguelike and puzzle gameplay is extremely well-balanced to a satisfying difficulty combined with near-endless replayability.\n\nYou control a hero exploring a randomly-generated dungeon, gathering powerups, equipment, and spells (glyphs).  The enemies are purely reactive: they only damage you in retaliation to your attacks.  This mechanic sets Desktop Dungeons apart from most roguelikes, and your ability to plan ahead results in gameplay comparable to a puzzle game.  Situations can become increasingly complex as you progress further and obtain more unlockables (such as the various gods you can worship in the dungeon).\n\nYou (and the enemies) regenerate your health and mana through revealing unexplored tiles, allowing you to recharge between encounters.  Your resources are all finite, so you can't simply grind your way to victory.  Instead, careful play is needed to gain bonus XP from killing higher-level enemies without exhausting your ability to recover before you face the boss (or bosses).\n\nThe skill ceiling is extremely high, and the more difficult scenarios are quite brutal.  When you first start playing even the easier \"Normal\" dungeons will provide a challenge.  You can tilt the odds in your favor by spending kingdom gold (essentially your winnings from successful runs) on preparations that should make your hero more effective.   I will note that the most difficult dungeons are unnecessary to complete the main storyline, but beating them unlocks powerful items as well as four monster races. \n\nDungeons are reasonably short (my runs are roughly 10-40 minutes depending on the situation), but the game is extremely replayable.  The wide selection of classes, races, and items allows for a wide diversity of viable builds.

I had expected a graphical overhaul and the extra features, but not to this extent! There was just so much more to unlock and do. The devs had upped everything to eleven. New monster types, afflictions, gods, character classes, races, secrets, challenge dungeons, tutorials, the list just goes on and on.\n\nThe full release really pushed this game to new heights, at least for me. What had been a quick puzzle fix was now a fully fleshed out puzzle game with a mischievious art style and depth like never before + the ost by Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope is great!\n\nI highly recommend this fantastic game.

There's no single strategy that will beat the game for you.\n-The difficulty is almost spot-on throughout the entire game. It's only easy in the beginning. By the end it's brutally hard, but you feel accomplished.\n-Fun in small spurts or for long periods of time.\n-There are a ton of upgrades that keep the game fresh.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The more you lose on one level the harder it is to remain patient and play well (more of a personal flaw, but it applies greatly here).\n-The randomness of the \"boss\", glyph drops, enemies, etc. can break/ruin a run for you.  Takes some luck on harder levels.\n\nVerdict: If you can deal with feeling dumb as you try to figure out the best strategies and are patient enough to not blow a fuse as you repeat levels multiple times, the game is great.  The upgrades keep the game and strategies fresh and you feel great accomplishment as you make your way through the harder levels.  For the price they are asking, you get great value for your buck.

the main reason I didn't really like Desktop Dungeons is that it is not at all what I expected. I thought this game was going to be a rogue-like dungeon-crawler rpg, but after a few hours of play I realized that the game simply isn't this at all. It is actually an rpg skin over top of a resource optimization puzzle game. The dungeons aren't really about battles, equipment, or spells (though all these things are in the game), they are about whether you can exploit the idiosynchrasies of the game mechanics to squeeze a few extra xp out of the dungeon so that you can ultimately beat the boss.\n\nLet me explain: There's a limited (and small) number of enemies in each dungeon, as well as a limited amount of gold and healing. You start at level 1. The boss is at level 10. You've got to level your character up and accumulate stuff to have any chance against the boss. But here's the rub: if you simply kill the enemies in order from lowest level to highest, you don't stand much chance. You need to take advantage of the battle mechanics to kill higher level monsters than you really should be able to in sneaky, gamey ways. Then, you'll get bonus experience and reach a higher level faster. Hence, the whole game becomes a puzzle of how you can squeeze all the resources out of a limited supply. This kind of puzzle is just not what I signed up for, and I found playing this way to be very effective but very tedious and dull.\n\nIf you are looking for a puzzle game combined with rpg elements, you might like this.

My tip will be to try and explain how you completed a level to someone who doesn't play the game, then look at their reactions and smile at them.", "timestamp_created": 1470476156, "timestamp_updated": 1470476156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24729996": {"recommendationid": "24729996", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992456028", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425039498}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0442 \u0448\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439, \u0434\u0430. \u041d\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b \u0430\u043d\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1470424938, "timestamp_updated": 1470424938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24665869": {"recommendationid": "24665869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106321676", "num_games_owned": 550, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 5416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "last_played": 1521377502}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Loistava ja v\u00e4h\u00e4n erilainen nethack johdannainen.\nT\u00e4llain ajoittain pelaavalla menee kyll\u00e4 puolikin tuntia leveliss\u00e4, eik\u00e4 ihan niin nopea, kui mit\u00e4 mainostekstit sanoo.\nPit\u00e4isi kyll\u00e4 samalla hinnalla saada ladata tablettiinkin.

Previously I had played around with Vulture for Nethack, The Binding of Isaac (although it doesn\u2019t necessarily fit my idea of Rogue-like), Don\u2019t Starve, and some various flash games that just never sparked interest. \n\nNow here is what Desktop Dungeons does right\n- Great for beginners:\nIf you're willing to waltz throught the tutorial, which I recommend you do, you'll begin to believe that you understand the game a lot more than you do, but the tutorial drops you off at a point where the learning curve is much less steep.\n\n- Captivating and Hilarious:\nEach of the missions that you run through, each have taken me around 3-5 runs before completion, have left me thirsty for much much more, and considering the expandability of your kingdom and the available upgrades, I believe I haven't even sank my teeth into the first quarter of this game and I love it. Going back to the tutorial,  the narrator is hilarious and there are always little things they add into the game that make me giggle. Never a full on guffaw, but a solid giggle. \n\n- Difficulty:\nBeyond giggling to the moon at the minor jokes that are at hand, Desktop Dungeons has set an immense level of difficulty, which parallels its learning curve. If the dungeon begin to feel too easy for you, go ahead and try out the puzzles up the mountain, I promise it won't be at all a cake walk. The puzzles really make you go indepth with the mechanics of the game and how each item affects how your character attacks.\n\n\nAnd here is what I think has gone wrong (only one thing)\n - Price:\nI don't believe the price point is necessarily a fair one. The only reason I have this game now, is because I got it in a humble bundle, which is still going on until 7/12/16 where I paid a little over half for this game, and plenty of others, rather than its full price.

Best of all, it was designed such the RNG had little influence on your outcome. Your victories, and your failures, were your own.\n\nThis release maintains the solid gameplay and tight balance of the original, while adding a metric ton of content. There are so many dungeons, monsters, races, classes, gods, and so on now that even I'm overwhelmed.

I'm unlocking way more things than I can try even once. \n\nDesktop Dungeons is well worth your money and time.

Your hero starts at level 1 and you are capable of leveling them all the way to level 10 during the course of the map.  Each level drastically improves the capabilities of your character and there are plenty of beneficial boosts and magical items to find along the way.\n\nYour buildings, on the other hand, offer options such as crafting magical gear, unlocking one of the many unique classes, adding additional boosts and content to encounter on your adventures, and even new races - all of which have their own stats that significantly alter the playstyle of -every- class.\n\nThe quests themselves are turn-based and give you all the time you need to execute the strategy of your choice.  You'll have to manage your health, mana, and experience as you try to maximize your gains and minimize your losses.  The game is unforgiving, though, very rewarding when you successfully pull off a dungeon and drag home a mountain of treasure.\n\nI recommend this game to fans of turn-based RPGs, fantasy worlds, and strategy/puzzle gamers.

You are free to roam around the dungeon as much as you want, enemies will only attack you if you attack them first, giving you the freedom to work out your strategy however you prefer. \n\nGraphics are the usual 2d style which we are seeing so much of these days, but the sprites are nicely designed with some well-known characters thrown in there such as Super Meat Boy. The UI can be a little daunting to begin with but you see all of the information you require within one click. \n\nEach of the individual levels are randomly generated; this adds to the replayability of the game as no dungeon will ever be the same; I believe each dungeon has its own set \"theme\" but what is included in the dungeon and how its laid out is completely random. The difficulty is something to be said for though, it is very easy to learn how to play, but very difficult to master, you will die, ALOT in Desktop Dungeons, they even tell you that at the very beginning of the game; it is to be expected. It takes a lot of thought out planning and preparation to work your way through most of the dungeons even straight after the tutorial you are thrown straight in at the deep end. \n\nThe game length can vary, I have been playing for about five hours and I still haven\u2019t managed to get past the fifth dungeon, there are tons of content available, class challenges, random dungeon runs, extra tutorial lessons for different spells and many more. I have seen some people with over a hundred hours put into Desktop Dungeon. One of the extra plus points I've found is that a potato can run this game, meaning you can stick it on any machine, maybe even your work machine, and load it up on breaks to sneak in fifteen minutes here and there; as it's not resourcefully demanding. \n\nDesktop Dungeons is certainly worth your time, and boy will it suck up your time as it is highly addictive.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

That was a really good choice. My advice: Try the free version, it'll show you the very core of the game. If you like it get the full version.\n\nPros:\n\n- Problems to solve strategically: Essentially every dungeon is different and you can solve it in many different ways. But, one or two mistakes and you're done. This is the rogue-like aspect of the game. In the start you'll feel very lost but as soon as you play you'll start using the deep mechanics of the game in your advantage.\n\n- Progression and goals to be achieved. Development of your kingdom and uncovering different races, classes, items, etc. through the campaign mode. This is the hook of the game, the RPG aspect, and the way it's done is fantastic.\n\n- Huge replayability. The amount of combinations is just enormous. It's always the same idea: get in the dungeon, kill the boss/es and get out, but the amount of combinations of classes, races, deities, items, layout of the dungeon, level of difficulty of the dungeon, badges achievable, etc make every run different than the previous one.\n\n- Daily dungeon.\n\n- Complex and difficult. This game is all about thinking, the puzzle element is about 70% of the game. I you don't like staring at the screen for a couple of minutes checking your best option then you probably won't like the game.

The way you do this varies tremendously; there's a long list of things that can help or hurt you, and you have to deal with whichever ones happen to be in the dungeon you're exploring.

At the beginning dungeon has fog of war. You reveal parts of dungeon by moving to adjacent square. You want to be carefull how much of a dungeon you reveal, since each square you reveal, recovers some of you health and mana. This is the main way you will recover health and mana. This means that exploring too much too early can leave you unable to heal, later on. On the other hand each square you reveal can have beneficial items, that you might want. This makes unrevealed tiles in dungeon weary important resource.\n\nThis is a quick game. Once you get used to controls and basic concepts, you can easily complete a dungeon/quest in 5 min.

You pick a class, buy some starting items and venture forth into a randomly generated dungeon. Your \"hero\" always starts at level 1 and you have to find a way to make the best use of experience boosts, glyphs, items and gold to beat the boss (or bosses) of the level. If you're successful you bring back treasures that will help improve your kingdom and allow you to discover new dungeons and monsters.\n\nThe goal is to use your resources to beat higher level monsters and get the experience boost you need to level up high enough to strike the boss. Uncovered tiles regenerate you and your foes, so waste as little as possible. Keep weak monsters around to strategically level up mid-fight and gain a full heal. There are lots of strategies and once you master them you can tackle any dungeon with any class. The mechanics are very deep and the advanced dungeons can take you one or two hours to beat them. Some later dungeons also abandon the idea of a single screen map and will offer two or more screens to play with, or challenge you with shifting walls. There's even a minotaur that chases you.\n\nI've been playing the game since beta and there's still more content for me to uncover.

I was geared up and poised to take down the boss, drank a mana potion and WHAM, diety stripped me of all my gear... so much work for nothing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1421490756, "timestamp_updated": 1421490756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13940551": {"recommendationid": "13940551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007785038", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420649029}, "language": "english", "review": "Kinda too simple", "timestamp_created": 1420977694, "timestamp_updated": 1420977694, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468917", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13929563": {"recommendationid": "13929563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025618771", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466090279}, "language": "japanese", "review": "Flash\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300e\u30de\u30e2\u30ce\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u300f\u3092\u5f77\u5f7f\u3068\u3055\u305b\u308b\u914d\u7f6e\u56fa\u5b9a\u578b\u30ed\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u3002\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u6f5c\u308a\u3001\u30d5\u30ed\u30a2\u5185\u306e\u3069\u3053\u304b\u306b\u3044\u308b\u30dc\u30b9\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5012\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002\u30dc\u30b9\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u5f37\u3044\u306e\u3067\u96d1\u9b5a\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5012\u3057\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u3068\u9055\u3044\u3001HP\u3068MP\u306f\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u672a\u5230\u9054\u30b9\u30af\u30a8\u30a2\u306b\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u3068\u304d\u306e\u307f\u56de\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u63a2\u7d22\u3068\u7d4c\u9a13\u5024\u7a3c\u304e\u3092\u3046\u307e\u3044\u9806\u756a\u3067\u884c\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3068\u30dc\u30b9\u304c\u5012\u305b\u306a\u304f\u3066\u8a70\u3080\u3002\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u610f\u5473\u3067\u3001\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u8272\u306e\u6fc3\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\n\u7121\u99c4\u306e\u306a\u3044\u52d5\u304d\u304c\u5e38\u306b\u8981\u6c42\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3058\u3063\u304f\u308a\u8003\u3048\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u306f\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u4e00\u56de\u306e\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u306f20\u5206\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3067\u7d42\u308f\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u7a7a\u3044\u305f\u6642\u9593\u306b1\u56de\u3084\u308d\u3046\u3001\u3068\u3044\u3046\u904a\u3073\u65b9\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\n\u8a00\u8a9e\u4f9d\u5b58\u6307\u6a19\u306f3\u3002\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30b6\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u8aad\u3081\u308c\u3070\u5927\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u3082\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u8ff7\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306f\u7121\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3002\n\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3084\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u3084\u308b\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u6642\u9593\u6ce5\u68d2\u3055\u308c\u304c\u3061\u306a\u4eba\u306f\u304d\u3063\u3068\u6c17\u306b\u5165\u308b\u306f\u305a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1420918721, "timestamp_updated": 1420918721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13929019": {"recommendationid": "13929019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009726796", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451930715}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a casual puzzle game with a big RPG hack-n-slash heart and a deep, sadistic soul.

I cannot think of any other like it and it succeeds on so many levels that I am blown away by the amount of time and energy it must have taken to create this. That being said many of my friends would (and have) toss this aside very quickly. The best comparison I can think of for this game would be chess, crosswords, or suduko not because this game operates by the same level or rules but because of the amount of mental energy required to play well (or poorly but with maximum effort in my case).\n\nOn a high note this game does an excellent job of rewarding progress. Even nearly 80 hours into the game I am still unlocking new aspects every couple hours. The high difficulty factor and this make every finished map lead to both a sigh of relief and quick inhale of anticipation as to what might be next. There are not too many titles you can find that can or will provide this.\n\nThe game is a puzzle/roguelike/rpg with a steeeeep learning curve. It goes from fairly easy, to somewhat challenging to difficult to \"okay quit smacking me in the balls\" tough in a span of about 2 hours or playtime each at which point the challenge continues to escalate as you progress through each map after. I personally enjoy the challenge but I think this is a balancing issue that is likely to turn away alot of people before they really get into the game. This is a shame because of the amazing amount of possiblities and strategies you can and will need to master to get through it. I have to grudgengliny give it a slight knock for this.\n\nThe only other major criticism I have is that the tutorial is a bit limited. In a game that gives you such progression the mechanics of many of the aspects are not clearly explained. There are puzzles that come with many of the unlocks that are obviously suppose to help out with this. Unfortunately they are pretty limited (and freakin hard as hell themselves) and do not provide you with much help. This can add on to the frustration level pretty damn quick.\n\nThe graphics are obviously not the draw here but the cartoony and light-hearteness of the game provide a nice counterpoint to the toughness factor. \n\nAll in all if you own or play mostly titles that contain the tags \"board games, tcg, puzzles, strategy, tactical\" there is a really good chance this is a gonna be one of your favorites. If your looking for something light-hearted and dislike high difficulty you are likely better off walking the other way.

It can work and if done properly it can create a game far greater than the sum of its parts. [i]Desktop Dungeons[/i], a game which attempts to combine a rogue-like dungeon crawl with a puzzle game, could definitely have worked, if only the elements it chose to borrow from those two genres were actually compatible with each other.\n\nAllow me to explain by way of example. As part of the puzzle aspect of the game, your hero only regenerates health and mana when exploring new areas, not when backtracking over old areas. Blind exploration is dicouraged, as doing so at full health means wasting precious healing. This forces you to think about where you want to go next instead of just going out willy nilly. I know it sounds like I'm praising the game and the truth is it could have been a good gameplay mechanic...\n\n...IF you had any way of actually KNOWING where you should go next.\n\nUnexplored areas are always completely blacked out, and since the dungeons are randomly layed out every time you have no way of knowing where you should go next. The fighter class mitigates this somewhat by automatically revealing the location of enemies that are your level or lower, but that hardly helps out the OTHER classes and even with this, you still have no way of knowing where to find valuable power-ups, equippable items, or spells.\n\nThe whole game is like that. In fact the greatest challenge in this game is not any enemy, but the game's own vague rules. I talked about this a little in my review of [i]Windforge[/i] but it's even more true here: we really, [i]really[/i] need to be given accurate, real information for a game like this to work.\n\nFor example, there's a speed stat that determines who attacks first in combat, but you can't actually see what your speed stat is. You can see that some enemies have first strike, but even enemies that don't have first strike and which you would expect to go after you in the combat order - like warlocks and zombies - can often end up going first... sometimes. Other times they go second, and since you can't actually see your speed stat or the enemy's the whole thing just comes across as arbitrary.\n\nAnd that's why this game fails on both fronts. The puzzle aspects are too strictly demanding and the punishment for even one single misstep is too harsh, so the game fails as a rogue-like. At the same time, the rogue-like aspects add too much randomness and too much hidden information, so the game fails as a puzzle.\n\nThe worst part is the game has no idea. It demands care, but then forces you to go out blindly, and then punishes you harshly for doing so. It tells you it's all your fault when you fail (and you will) with condescending messages and taunts, but really it's no one's fault because everything is entirely luck-based.\n\nLike I said, the idea of combining a rogue-like and a puzzle game is not entirely terrible. It could have worked, it just didn't in this case. Maybe some other game will come along and get it right. But this one ain't it.\n\nMy Rating: [2] BAD\n\n[url=http://knightlyreviews.blogspot.com/2014/12/video-game-review-desktop-dungeons.html]Read my original review here.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1418579602, "timestamp_updated": 1418579754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.331235", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13361510": {"recommendationid": "13361510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971118965", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476521851}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Desktop Dungeons.

Which isn't a problem at all as this is the type of game which you'll load up when you have some random time to kill.

Friday night though, before I went to sleep, I knew there was a bit of unfinished business: I bought the game, and not just because the developers are great guys (but that too).\n\nThe game delivers what it promisses: bite sized adventures you can play during a break. The other day I had 15 minutes to spare: 10 of those were used by a berserker clearing a swamp of monsters.\nIt may look like a simple game, but it has a suprising amound of depth, with many abilities, items and other things that lead to multiple ways to tackle dungeons and may have you adapting your strategy based on what you encounter.\nAnd there is a lot to encounter. Just when you think you have seen all the races, seen all the classes, you find one more. Then you check the journal and see just how much you haven't seen yet (I found it more fun not to check how much I am missing so as not to spoil the pleasure of finding something new).\n\nBut how do you play? Simple: you select a dungeon to explore and write an adventuring permit. The permit is the \"character creation\" process of that dungeon. For example it could say: To [dungeon name], For Generic Adventuring, Race: Human, Class: Warrior, Equipment: starting adventurer's kit. Then you would play the dungeon with a simple lvl 1 human warrior.\nAs the game progresses you unlock more races, classes and can provide better starting equipment and other bonuses, making each run unique.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Your kingdom needs you! Oh, you need a permit? To: Unnamed Desktop Dungeon Kingdom, For: Kingdom Administration, Race: Human, Class: Gamer. There you go, your permit to play the game.\nAnd yes, the alpha version is available for free to try out :)", "timestamp_created": 1408800735, "timestamp_updated": 1408800735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868070", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11832835": {"recommendationid": "11832835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078143828", "num_games_owned": 937, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408800201}, "language": "english", "review": "Game looks cute and the mechanics are cool, but after a couple of matches it gets too frustratingly hard.

Even though Desktop Dungeons are both these things, I am going to tell you why you should not purchase this game (even at sale). Desktop Dungeons is a game that exhibits a little of roguelike quality into a strategy game that is mainly about killing the boss for each \"dungeon.\" You start off with availability to one class and one race and slowly progess by upgrading your town to obtain more classes/races/items/bonuses/etc.. The progression in Desktop Dungeons is fine. The game never forces you to use the same class or race at any prolonged period of time. Because of this, the game is entertaing for a couple of hours as you discover all the ways to utilize your classes/races abilities to give you the best shot at defeating the boss at the end. However, for me, the fun stopped pretty quickly after you unlock the grunt of the different loadouts you can have when entering a dungeon. The reason why it stopped being fun was because in order to beat the level you have to use the bonuses that each race/class has effectively. Thus, when you use a class/race you never deviate from the approach that gives that class/race its edge. Therefore, after you unlock the basic classes, it feels as though there not much deviance from the game to keep the dungeon runs refreshing. \n\nThe Last couple of hours I played consisted of me logging on to play a dungeon run or two, and then logging off because I felt bored. Since I have stopped playing this game though, I did not experience what the rest of the game had to offer. It is possible that the runs got more interesting, but to me it was not worth the time to go through it, or the money i spent to buy it (while it was on sale). \n\nBefore I end this review, I do want to share some positive aspects of the game because there were good implements of the game that kept me interested for awhile.\n\n-Game has a sense of humor and keeps the game in a light mood even though it is difficult.\n-There are puzzles in the game which put you in a situation in which there is one method that will make you successful.\n      -If you want to be tested to the limits, these are great\n-The game explains everything very well and there was nothing that terribly confused me when playing\n-Game does take good planning to be successful. You cannot simply just click everything to death.\n\nOverall I would have to give the game a 6.5/10. \nI encourage you to look at the other reviews for there are things that I left out about the game. Also, make sure to watch the video on the store page, for that is what the general gameplay of the game looks like.

It implements the unique mechanic of exploration as regeneration, meaning that the unexplored areas of a map are a finite resource that must be used wisely. Lots of race and class combinations and many dungeons and challenges make for endless replayability. As of this review, I have played over 60 hours and I still feel like I have a lot to learn and that I am improving.\n\nGreat retro art style and soundtrack/effects combined with the fantasy genre make for a great atmosphere. But be warned, this game is not for everyone - the difficulty level ramps up to the point that it really requires the gamer to do further research via forums and wiki articles for the best strategies, as the tutorials are slightly lacking. You will die - a lot. Thankfully most levels only last an average of 15 minutes. If you feel like you can go no further in the level, you can leave the dungeon and take all the goodies you have found with you.\n\nIf you are a fan of games that require some nerdy research (like terraria, crusader kings 2, blood bowl) I would definitely seek this one out. Watch some of the Let's Plays on Youtube to get a feel for the game. \n\nDue to the difficulty, when I actually pass a tough level the feeling can only be described as or.gas.mic. Maybe the closest feeling would be beating a really hard super meat boy level. \n\nBy the way, I have rarely felt as though the randomization was unfair. In 95% of cases, the map is definitely beatable as long as you have a very strong grasp on the strategy involved for each class and race, as well as the best way to approach bosses. I have played levels I deemed impossible, only to completely change my strategic thinking and end up beating the level with nearly every single attempt.\n\nIs the game worth the price tag? I'd say yes given the hours played. As a bonus, you can actually play this game on the desktop dungeons website (without using steam) by making an account with them and linking it to steam. It saves the game into a cloud and transfers it over to steam. Once I discovered this feature I have been able to play at work on the sly (like I said, I love this game).

As you defeat dungeons and complete challenges, your kingdom will grow, unlocking more races, gods, classes, and items to choose from or find in the dungeon.  The story might not be the best, but the writing is hilarious and should easily keep you entertained, on top of the deep and interesting gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\n\nLike I said, everything is a resource, including gold, level-ups (they fully heal you, in addition to giving extra stats), items you don't use, and even exploration!  This is the source of the puzzle nature of the game, as maximizing the utility of your resources to defeat higher-level monsters is essential for defeating the harder difficulties.  Every dungeon has one or more level 10 bosses, who must be defeated to win.  These bosses are appropriately epic, sporting significantly higher stats than the other dungeon inhabitants, so much of the challenge comes from getting to the point where you can take them on.\n\nDesktop Dungeons includes a large variety of dungeons and challenges of varying difficulties that will keep you coming back for more.  In true roguelike spirit, all dungeons are randomized each time you attempt them.  While the normal dungeons may just feature a set of monsters and a level 10 boss, the hard and vicious dungeons all have their own gameplay gimmicks which make them feel unique, like separate challenges.  In addition to the standard dungeons, there are also a large number of challenges and puzzles to complete to improve your skills and unlock items.  I can't say I enjoyed the puzzles as much as the challenges and dungeons, but the puzzles are completely optional.\n\nAs you complete those dungeons, you will obtain gold which can be used to improve your kingdom, unlocking new classes, races, and preparations for dungeons.  These preparations can be used to aid future dungeon runs in certain strategic ways.  For example, you can guarantee that you start with a fireball, a useful preparation for the sorcerer.  By doing so, however, you give up the ability to increase your stats through a different preparation.  These preparations provide a good amount of strategy to a run through carefully planning which ones you will need to defeat a certain dungeon.  They also cost gold, which can be daunting for new players.  However, preparations are never actually required to clear a dungeon, and one preparation even massively increases the gold that you receive from clearing a dungeon successfully.\n\nMusic:\n\nDesktop Dungeons has a pretty good thematic soundtrack by the same person who composed the soudtrack for Super Meat Boy.  There are over 20 tracks, many just to set a nice atmosphere for a given dungeon.  I personally still haven't gotten tired of the music, and I've played well over 100 hours of the game, another testament to how fun and addictive this game is!\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics have a nice, distinctive style, and are pretty good for a roguelike.  However, the gameplay is what makes Desktop Dungeons good, not the graphics.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDesktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games, with nearly unlimited replayability and deep strategy.  Most of the negative reviews here focus on the difficult gameplay.  If you want a sense of about how difficult the normal-hard dungeons are here, check out the award-winning alpha version, which is available for free online.  Personally, I think that the difficulty is one of the best aspects of the game.  If you're like me, finally beating a difficult dungeon with a certain class or restriction, is an extremely rewarding experience.  But if you expect a path to beat the game without learning the strategy, you will be disappointed.  The game could be better at teaching you that strategy, but there are guides out there if you get stuck.", "timestamp_created": 1403373605, "timestamp_updated": 1403373656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10624169": {"recommendationid": "10624169", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995186207", "num_games_owned": 1074, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459030783}, "language": "english", "review": "Desktop dungeons is one of those \"easy to learn, hard to master\" games.

Desktop Dungeons, made by the studio QCF Design, originally came about as a freeware \"alpha\" title, full of challenges and surprises, and that version of the game is still available for download today. I played the alpha for countless hours, so I was in their debt and did not hesitate to make the purchase.\n\nRebuilt from the ground up, Desktop Dungeons now features more content than the most tenacious goblin could ever hope to shake a stick at. The developers would like you to believe this is a \"quick play\" sort of game, but make no mistake, it's going to snatch the afternoon out of your hands and devour it like a ravenous dog. The intense challenge of the dungeons demands your complete attention if you are to succeed. And when you do, hundreds of other dungeons await their turn, eager to throw another horde of savage beasts at your hapless wizard's forehead.\n\nThe presentation of it is astonishing. The dialogue is superbly written, and the characters all have their own portraits, including - and this is the best part - every possible race and class and gender combination that your character can have. That makes at least 200 different portraits for your player character alone. It is clear that QCF went to great lengths to ensure their brainchild would hold up to the scrutiny of video game critics.\n\nI suppose you could find some fault in the game's storyline, but it really doesn't beat you over the head with it.

It streamlines the concept a bit, simplifying it just enough for me to have a good time.  First you choose a race and a class (more of which get unlocked as you play), and move around a small dungeon, killing monsters and grabbing treasure.  Exploring new parts of the map heals you, so you want to make sure you don't over-explore too early.  There aren't a lot of healing potions on each map, so you'll need those unexplored tiles to heal yourself after each fight.\n \nI've enjoyed the free \"alpha\" version for years, but didn't think the full version would be worth the money.  I finally bought it on sale, and so far I think it's been worth it.  The most obvious improvement is the graphics, which are now vibrant and whimsical, but still very simple.  Instead of just starting a dungeon through lifeless menus, the game is now framed with an expanding town.  You can still get into a random dungeon with just a couple of clicks, but you also have the option of completing specific missions that help improve the town and unlock new options. \n \nThis version of the game is a bit friendlier than the alpha, with several optional tutorials and practice dungeons to teach you how various things work.  But this user-friendliness doesn't mean it's lost its edge.  It's still a very deadly game of resource management, and I still lose much more often than I win.  But that's what makes it fun.\n \nIf you've never played the free version, try that first.  That will let you know if you like the gameplay.  Then, if you really enjoy it, buy this game.\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1401416655, "timestamp_updated": 1401416655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10269132": {"recommendationid": "10269132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027346325", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401322941}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little time-waster :)", "timestamp_created": 1401316976, "timestamp_updated": 1401316976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10252711": {"recommendationid": "10252711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035338416", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412170172}, "language": "russian", "review": "[b]*[/b] \u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0439\u043d.\n[b]*[/b] \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e.\n[b]*[/b] \u0410\u0447\u0438\u0432\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c.\n[b]*[/b] 10-15 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f.\n\n\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e?\n\u041f\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0443 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e.\n", "timestamp_created": 1401206253, "timestamp_updated": 1401206253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10248224": {"recommendationid": "10248224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030655190", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467756978}, "language": "english", "review": "Someone sweetened this coffee break game with crack instead of sugar.", "timestamp_created": 1401168152, "timestamp_updated": 1401168152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10247653": {"recommendationid": "10247653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000313039", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 6362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449249968}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing, turn based, and resource managment.

For those who like a brainy challenge however this game is a must, it combines many elements of strategy with a tidy interface and no dithering about. It allows and even encourages you to plan far in advance and won't interfere with these plans - as a result however when it gets hard it really doesn't mess about.\n\nIt takes a few games to get your head around it but it's very simple to pick up. The outcome of every move is predicted and even an entire fight is easy to plan beforehand with little indicators showing how many attacks it will take with the selected move to take down your opponent and how many he will need to take down you. In this way you can easily see for example that you each need three attacks so if you attack twice and then use a GETINDERE glyph to ensure your attack lands first you will win the encounter.\n\nIt has found an interesting balance for exploring a dungeon. On one hand you want to find new glyphs and stat boosts but health and mana is regained by exploring so ideally you need to utilise that first, but otherwise it is not punished.\n\nMonsters only ever retaliate so braving the unknown is at practically zero risk. Just as long as you set right click to attack to avoid inadvertently killing yourself against a higher level monster.\n\nIf I were to have any gripes it's the lack of direction the game gives you. Not so much the Minecraft sense in \"here's a world go amuse yourself\" but more in that it gives you TOO much to do. I currently have about 15 quests, several requiring multiple dungeon runs to complete. Completing one will often generate two more. But monetary rewards are good incentive to upgrade your kingdom to provide more options for starting a dungeon.\n\nOverall it's a beautiful game, a true challenge but not in the \"haha I instakilled you now do the last half hour again\" way.

I really loved the style of artwork portrayed in this game. This game initally starts off very addicted and emerssive. But that only lasted for an extremely short amount of time, leaving me unfulfilled and extremely unsatisfied with my purchase. It's not the gameplay or the game mechanics fault this time as to why it got old fast. This time the culprit was the difficulty. After the inital first few dungeons and extreme enjoyment, the game throws you in a hell hole of a metaphoric toxic goo and pretty much tells you to learn how to swim through it without dying. The tutorials they \"offer\" (using the word \"offer\" very loosely) are not very great tutorials. Instead, to them, the tutorials are basicly just slimmed down dungeons with specific situations with only one SPECIFIC way out to complete with no instructions whatsoever. This makes it impossible to progress further into the game, which stunts the enjoyment to a grinding halt. This COULD HAVE been forgiven if they decided to put a difficulty mode choice option somewhere in the game but that exists just as much as their tutorial instructions do. I would have never paid 15 dollars for this game, had I known that the replay value (do to difficulty) was shorter than a first round knockout match between Mike Tyson and some random crackhead midget. This game is worth maybe about 2 dollars at this point. In my opinion, if the developers were to atleast put in a difficulty option, the gameplay value and price value would rise tremendously. And that's just putting a band-aid on a large cut that needs surgery. That wouldn't REALLY solve the problem here. I DO love a challenge. But I would like to be given a competent tutorial so that I can actually enjoy the game as it was intended to be, which is \"difficult\", NOT impossible.\n\nThis part here is specifically to the developers:\nYou have a game with a mass amount of potential but you guys need to put more effort into this game. It's not just about making it more aesthetically pleasing from your free game version. You need to step up to the plate and make this game more user friendly. We need a way better tutorial system because the tutorial system in it now is horrible.

They just sit there! You do nothing more than walk around the dungeon picking which enemies to attack and which to leave till later. The only way you die is when you've run out of options and basically have to commit suicide.\n\nThe art style is grotesque and is reminicent of the hideous zoomed in images of something gross from Ren and Stimpy. If you try to run the game beyond its native tiny windowed resolution its looks even worse... somehow\n\nI'm pretty pissed off I paid for this game, and I got it on special.

Spiele m\u00f6gen/lieben\n\nAuf den ersten Blick macht das Spiel nicht viel her aber man sollte sich nicht davon t\u00e4uschen lassen! Es ist ein sch\u00f6nes schweres Spiel wo man Problemlos in 10-20min einen Dungeon abschlie\u00dfen kann.\n\nAm besten erz\u00e4hl ich kurz wie das Spiel abl\u00e4uft::\n\nNach dem Tutorial hat man eine kleine Stadt welche man mit diversen Geb\u00e4uden Upgraden kann, diese bieten einem neue V\u00f6lker, Klassen und Gegenst\u00e4nde. Das wichtigste Geb\u00e4ude in der Stadt ist die Taverne \u00fcber die man auf die einzelnen Dungeons zugreifen kann.\n\nNachdem man sich einen ausgesucht hat, w\u00e4hlt man erst ein Volk welches bestimmte boni beim Itemumwandeln gibt, danach die Klasse die ganz spezifische Eigenarten hat wie Gegner des gleichen lvls sehen oder doppelter Schaden gegen Untote, und am Schlu\u00df kann man gegen Gold noch ein paar Start Items aussuchen.\n\nDann geht es in den Dungeon, man startet relativ schwach mit lvl1 und soll am Ende immer einen bestimmten Boss (umgeben von Blut) t\u00f6ten. Klingt erstmal einfach ist aber relativ schwer. Neben dem Boss gibt es random verteilt haufenweise Gegner mit allen m\u00f6glichen Lvlen, Aufwertungen (Leben, Mana und Angriff), Items, Zauberspr\u00fcche, Gold u.a.. Am Anfang ist das gesamte level schwarz und unerforscht und so muss man mit Gl\u00fcck und vor allem Planung sich langsam heran tasten. \n\nWarum Planung? Nunja nur wenn neue Felder \"entdeckt\" werden f\u00fcllen sich Leben und Mana wieder auf, einfaches Herumstehen oder hin- und herlaufen funktioniert nicht. Das gleiche gilt aber auch f\u00fcr Gegner, d.h. wenn ihr Leben regeneriert tun dies auch die angeschlagenen Gegner (ausgenommen davon sind Mana/Heiltr\u00e4nke)!\n\nDann gibt es noch haufenweise Sachen zu beachten: Eigenarten der Klasse, Eigenschaften von Monstern, Zust\u00e4nde die von Zauberspr\u00fcchen verursacht werden, Dungeongegebenheiten, Itemumwandlung etc. pp.\n\nIst man am Ende tot gibt es aufmunternde Worte vom Spiel, aber wenn man es geschafft hat bekommt man eine sch\u00f6ne \u00dcbersicht was alles im Dungeon passiert ist, welche Abzeichen man geschafft hat und nat\u00fcrlich Gold f\u00fcr die Stadt!\n\nNeben den Dungeons kann man auch Puzzle l\u00f6sen die anders ablaufen als die Dungeons und richtig frusten k\u00f6nnen, welche aber auch gut die Feinheiten des Spiels n\u00e4herbringen.\n\n\nSonstiges:\n\nGrafisch ist es nat\u00fcrlich Geschmackssache aber mir gef\u00e4llt es sehr, sch\u00f6n detaillierte 2D Karten passen einfach zu diesem Typ Spiel am besten finde ich. In den Optionen l\u00e4sst sich kaum was einstellen (was aber auch sonst schwierig gewesen w\u00e4re) und wenn man nicht gerade blind ist sollte man bei gro\u00dfen Monitoren nicht auf Vollbild spielen da das meiner Meinung nach sehr gestreckt und riesig aussieht.\n\nFazit:\n\nG\u00fcnstiges Spiel (im Sale) was Tagelang oder Wochenlang Spa\u00df machen kann wenn es einem gef\u00e4llt.

The approximately 10-15 minutes of playtime for each stage (when you survive, otherwise playtime can be much shorter ;) ) are well balanced between a short break and not loosing to much time in case of failure.\n\nA nice fact is that you can play DD after buying on Steam not only via Steam, but also via the DD website. A nice amusement if you are not at home and on a PC without Steam and don't need download and install anything. That works for Windows RT tablets too.\nWhen playing via website please consider, that Steam acchievments will not be unlocked and it does not count to your playing time.

The strategy and careful planning, combined with many choices in which the player must weigh opportunity costs, appealed to me as someone who enjoys both puzzle games and roguelikes. This market version, however, is a bit disappointing.\n\nAlmost immediately I noticed that the quick and seamless gameplay of the original has been replaced with lots of flashy graphics and animations, most of which are far too long and prevent input until they have finished playing. While these animations are relatively short, the slowness becomes noticeable the longer you play. Those little microseconds add up. Yes, this is a turn-based game in which you cafrefully think through your decisions, but let's be honest-- the first 2/3 of every session is pretty much blasting through the weak monsters or exploring in hopes of finding the right item with the RNG. The real magic of the original was in the last 1/3, when things start to get tense and you really have to plan ahead. So it's frustrating when this version forces you to slow down at the part that deserves to be sped through.  These slow animations carry over to the menus as well, and it's  exacerbated by the dull, mediocre banter which tries too hard to be funny, and which takes forever to skip.\n\nAnd of course, there are tutorial levels you can't skip. Really? Really?? This is 2014 and you are still making unskippable tutorial levels?\n\nPerhaps the newest feature of this version is the introduction of the gold-to-buy-buildings (which then unlock new heroes or give small upgrades) system. There was absolutely zero reason to add this, because they do the exact same thing as simply completing the challenges in the original alpha. At least in the alpha, you didn't have to click through twelve haphazardly scattered menus-- once you beat the dungeon, the next level or hero was unlocked automatically. Seriously, why even add this?\n\nThe artwork is polished, but the style is just ugly. There is really nothing redeeming about it. While the alpha had simple, easily distinguishable 16-bit pixel graphics, this version tries way too hard to be detailed. It's like staring into those gross Ren & Stimpy  or Spongebob Squarepants closeups for hours on end! No one wants to do that. The music is also unmemorable-- it sounds like generic stock medieval fantasy music, versus the ominous, synthy fanfare of the original; it says a lot when a 5 second introductory song is more appealing than an entire soundtrack. \n\nLastly, I want to talk about how QCF Design has trolled other indie developers. Back when DD was still in development, League of Epic Heroes, a game by a single dev on iOS, got a cease and desist and was threatened with a lawsuit for \"copying\" the gameplay concept. At the time, LoEH was actually superior to both the DD alpha and the beta. The main developer of DD complained about intellectual property, but honestly, who hasn't copied game concepts before? Every action RPG since Diablo has been a rip-off of it, but we understand that they are still original in their own right. League of Epic Heroes had a unique inventory system, original graphics and assets, and only borrowed the gameplay of DD. The developer said it was unfair that someone else was releasing a Desktop Dungeons-like game on iOS before he could, but that's what you get for taking four years to finish something!

It's really a puzzle game more than it is anything else.   I'm going to recommend this game with on big caveat attached.  With all its frills, and new graphics, this version isn't all that much better than the FREE version currently available online. \n\nActually the free version is much more pure and streamlined version of this game.  The original is even better in some ways.  All of the extra stuff in the steam version of this are mostly just bloat.  All the \"outside the dungeon\" town building interface is really poor compared to the version slick a brilliant puzzle game that you are trying to access from the town.  Also it takes quite a while to unlock everything.  I have nearly 30 hours clocked and still have not unlocked all 9 basic classes.  Having to run 2-6 dungeons just to get the 2000 gold for an unlock seems grindy and is something the original free version lacks.  \n\nSo what is improved over the free version?  The graphics are greatly enhanced.  The Deity system is better handled although they are a bit too powerful in the sense that using the deities is often key to conquering higher end maps.   The biggest upgrade is the amount of new diversity added to the maps.  There are just more scenarios and variations applied in each new challenge.  If you enjoyed the original desktop dungeons, this one takes what was there and adds to variety 100 fold.  With puzzles, challenges, interesting bosses, 2ndary rooms, and much more. \n\nSo yeah its good stuff, but I feel it's a little odd that some of the simple purity of the original gets a bit bogged down in some unnecessary bloat in its steam version.

I understand.\n\nDesktop Dungeons is a somewhat randomized puzzle game cleverly disguised as a roguelite rpg.  It's also incredibly brutal.  That aside (or possibly because of it), I found the game enjoyable in that \"bring out your inner masochistic rage junkie\" kinda way.  A single mistake can cost you the level, & sometimes you don't find out until 10 minutes later.  One time my mouse was on the fritz & occassionally registered two clicks from one press.  It rendered this game unplayable.  However, overall it was a positive entertainment experience, in that I preferred it over staring at a wall.\n\nSo why is this review in the \"not recommended\" section?  I don't find the quality of entertainment worth the price tag.

The world only moves when you a) take an attack (ie, cast  a spell or hit someone, maybe use an item to do so) or b) explore uncharted tiles. But barring specific enemies, you're the only one who ever moves. Meanwhile, your stats and the enemy's stats are visible at all times, including a convenient little tooltip that will tell you what effects come of performing X on Y target (up to and including \"DEATH\" - do not do anything that will result in this!).\n\nThe game, as a result, comes from mixing risk and reward: do you try and take out a higher-level enemy to start for the bonus XP? Do you spend more time exploring the map (which will potentially raise stats, but also deny you HP/MP regeneration later) to find a weaker first target? Maybe there's a potion a few tiles away, or a handy spell glyph to use? Everything becomes second-nature over time and soon you're playing each race/class (there are plenty of combinations - races give specific bonuses, classes a set of three skills/boons) like... well, not a pro, this game gets hard as heck. But a veteran. A war-torn, blood-stained veteran with plenty of your own corpses in your wake.\n\nI absolutely recommend it, but you should really try that alpha if you haven't to get a gist of how this works. It's not your standard take on the genre at ALL.

It is on its face a little rpg lite type game, where you maneuver a little adventurer around a series of procedurally generated maps looking for loot and baddies to win to level up to face the boss.  \n\nThat on its own would be cool and fun and a little enjoyable time waster, but there is a second 'meta' level of developing your town between quests to gain access to better starting goodies, more classes, races, etc.\n\nEven then, I would have been happy to play on its own, but theres something more devious and hooking (for the right kind of personality) than either of those first two aspects.  When it comes right down to it, the game is quite simply far too hard to enjoyably play on just its face value.  \n\nThe tutorials begin to show you the true way, which is that really every map is not so much a dungeon to adventure in, as a very cunning and difficult puzzle in the shape of a dungeon.\n\nThere is absolutely a 'right' way to pass through each little dungeon that maximizes your xp, items, and chances to victory, and it is almost never the straight forwards way of just running around and clicking enemies as you come by them.\n\nYou want to slow down, pace yourself, calculate each new move, each new click to maximize the value that you can extract from each scenario.  Sure you can fight a bunch of random level 2 or 3 enemies, when you are level 4, and you will win each fight easily.  However if you alter the pacing, and fight one of those level 3 enemies when you are level 2 instead (and have the right mix of skills/stats/items to win) you'll get a serious XP boost for defeating it.  Multiply that out by the 20 or 30 enemies on a map and you can be a whole level or two higher when fighting the final enemy.\n\nEach class and race has some little unique twist which lets you change the rules around and re-optimize your approach, and you can mix and match some of the random dungeon attributes (as you level your town up) to maximize your chances with the mix you choose for each map.\n\nTLDR?

You play the wise administrator to a budding town that is pestered by the hardships that accompany being located in the very center of a dense labyrinth of dungeons.  You must hire dungeon-invading heroes of unrestricted race/class combination, outfit them as you can afford and send them into harms way in service of the kingdom!\n\nYour first order of administrative business is recruiting a weakling, level one hero, because all of the powerful heroes retire immediately as just reward for surviving a dungeon.  This requires making decisions on which buildings to initially construct with your limited resources.  Your choices determine what race/class combinations you can choose to send into the nearby dungeons, and with what items or services you can furnish them.  Assuming your coffers can afford such bonuses.  Each building you construct provides its own set of bonuses and a unique item selection that can be upgraded.\n\nActual dungeon gameplay consists of moving your chosen hero around a tile-based grid which is covered in the fog of war.  Under each square of fog exists either a monster (level 1-10), an item (or a place to purchase one), an altar dedicated to a specific god, a stat boost, some treasure, or a staircase to a sub-dungeon.  Sub-dungeons offer mini challenges with their own rewards, boost/items enhance your hero's stats or give them new abilities, gods alter your playstyle by forbidding certain actions while rewarding others, and monsters are what you will be primarily hunting for.\n\nApart from scenarios and puzzles, your objective will always be to kill the boss monster, who is always level 10.  In order to slay such a beast you need to equip yourself, and gain levels by finding and eliminating all of the other monsters in the dungeon.  However, they fight back!  Monsters will NEVER initiate attack with you, but they will retaliate when you strike.  After each fight you will need to recoup by exploring the fog of war.  Each square revealed from the fog will replenish your health/mana, but also the health of any unpoisoned enemies.  Once the fog is gone, though, your only means of healing for additional fights are potions or appealing to your chosen god.  Fail to take out the boss before you've expended all of your available resources and you have to retire in shame, with the entire venture possibly a net loss after the cost of preparations.\n\nBoth the meta-game of kingdom administration, and the individual dungeon dives are very enjoyable.  Spending your limited gold feels critically strategic and there are many possible strategies given the available combinations of race/class/equipment/deity which lead to some very satisfying combos.  Every dungeon is a challenge, and by the end of 10-20 minutes you may actually feel kind of attached to your valiant hero that you will never see again.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is that the puzzles are too difficult.  I played about eight of them and each one had a VERY specific solution that had to be performed EXACTLY with no substantial deviations in a chain that can be up to fifty actions in length!  One mistake at any point in that chain and you need to start over.  Some people may enjoy the mental gymnastics necessary to plot out every possible way your hero can move across the board, finding at which points to use which abilities/itemsY and finding the sole solution from a myriad of possibilities - but I didn't.  Thankfully, the puzzles are optional and if you skip them the only thing you'll miss out on is a relatively small sum of gold and some items you could just as easily unlock from doing any of the quests.  Had the game penalized me for not playing the puzzles it would have been a dealbreaker, but mercifully this is not the case.  \n\nFar more enjoyable than the puzzles are the scenarios in which you play a themed, semi-random dungeon that has an objective that may be something other than killing a boss.  Some of these scenarios feature unique classes specifically for the story, and can be humorous if you read the notes, signs and story. \n\nAlso, the game uses a cloud sync independent of Steam which allows you to log into an account from any platform (including web) and continue playing!  Overall I'm very impressed with this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys casual role playing condensed into 20 minute play sessions, fans of Minesweeper or strategy, or anyone who enjoys mind-numbingly difficult puzzles!", "timestamp_created": 1389428845, "timestamp_updated": 1389428845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8653598": {"recommendationid": "8653598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111364427", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467142353}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super duper hard...

I mainly bought the game to allow me to relax from my day by playing a game for a few minutes and this expectation the game completely fulfills. Due to its challenging and random dungeons it is always fun to play it for 15 minutes to 30 minutes. I have also managed to be hooked on it for several hours as it does not get boring. Due to the random generated dungeons and upgradeable buildings you always have an aim and trying out new combinations of race and class is always interesting. I also really liked the mixture of strategy and luck, which makes this game unpredictable as well as mentally challenging. The puzzle levels which are also more or less randomly generated set very strategic stages, which you can spend easily a few hours on to crack one. The humour offered in this game is also a great comic relief. When you are close to a breakdown because you simply cannot beat the dungeon a funny fact about the monster is always a  welcoming change. Overall I totally recommend this game.

In each match it is up to you to explore the dungeon carefully, attempting to defeat the strongest foes you can without dying because you get bonus xp for defeating monsters that are higher level than you.

Personally, i find the balancing (especially in RPG\u00b4s) to be the most important thing. The Final Fantasy Series (especially 8, X-2, XII) is AWFUL RPG\u00b4s, because they are so unbalanced. There is always broken mechanics.\n\nBut this game. Everything is perfectly balanced. There is a solution for everything. Things that appear useless at first sight (like the glowing guardian) turns out to be immensely powerful when you learn how to use it.\n\nAnd then the final level. Dark Souls... i long thought this was impossible to beat. And i\u00b4m a pretty hardcore guy. I must have tried over 30 times... then i started discussing different strategies. Even then, i must have lost 20-25 times... but in the end. It was actually possible.\n\nHow great of a balance aint that? At first glance, you\u00b4re like no way... but then, bit by bit... you understand that it is possible.\n\nI have over 130 hours of gameplay in this game. The amount of replay value, and the amount of game you get for the price... is absolutely mind boggling. This game has taken over my life more than any game before. Monster Hunter G. Dark Souls. Meat Boy. Ninja Gaiden. Pokemon. I have mastered them all... but none have absorbed me, and offered me so much joy as this game. Hats of to the developers. And thanks for everything. I love you,                                                \n\nA perfect game. I\u00b4ve heard some people think the price is to steep... they couldn\u00b4t be more wrong. This might be one of the most priceworthy games i\u00b4ve ever purchased. Damn it... i have already clocked 47 hours and i can\u00b4t stop playing. I need to be working on my thesis, but instead i\u00b4m playing this!\n\nIn all seriousness though, for 13bucks, this is an AMAZING game. It\u00b4s so challening, but always fair. It\u00b4s incredible well balanced, the music is mesmerezing... the upgrades mechanics addictive. And the gameplay itself is really unlike anything i\u00b4ve seen before.\n\nAmazing game. 10/10.

With Desktop Dungeons, it's just too hard.\" \u2014 Kakie, Corsual Live Viewer\n\nI have a confession to make. I'm not proud of it, but I haven't finished Desktop Dungeons. I strive to complete all of the games I review prior to writing, but in this case the cross was too great to bear.\n\nMy failure came not through lack of trying \u2014 I tried for many, many hours \u2014 but from an overwhelming level of difficulty. Not the bad kind of difficulty, where cheap opponents consistently barrage you until you die hurling an overpriced controller against the nearest wall, but the good kind of difficulty, that will see you thinking \u2014 really thinking \u2014 about every move you make, every time you make it, lest your adventure come to a inconveniently early end.\n\nFortunately, I appreciate a challenge. Hell, I crave it. But in the end, it turned out that there was more to accomplish, collect and unlock in this roguelike dungeon crawler than I could ever hope to discover in just 2 weeks, and so, I began my review in advance.\n\nWITHOUT FURTHER ADO...\nI first saw Desktop Dungeons while watching MANvsGAME; Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope, who composed the soundtrack, were there alongside one of the core developers, Danny Day. \n\nThey discussed many of the basic game concepts; the randomly generated dungeons and roguelike nature, spell-casting warriors, the coming mobile release, the difference between a harpsichord and clavinet and the origins of Granny Kirkanowsky. \n\nListening in, amidst the constant laughter, I quickly learned that DD has something of a cult following that grew around an alpha build released to the public years back and available free today, which led to it winning the IGF Award Winning for Game Design. Immediately, I downloaded it to take a look.\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\nThe alpha turned out to be a crude version of the one MAN was playing. It looked very different \u2014 the hand-drawn art wasn't present, instead offering a more traditional pixel art style, and the entire progression mechanic was missing, so choosing a dungeon was as simple as selecting a race, class and difficulty.\n\nThough I was watching MAN play a clearly superior version, I still felt entirely engaged playing the alpha due to the 'roguelike' nature of the gameplay. Every dungeon was different, and though my imminent demise was almost always a single click away, the ability to head straight back in, new knowledge in hand, to a completely new dungeon, maintained my interest throughout the entire night. \n\nThat's when I made my purchase, gained access to the browser-operated (sans-soundtrack) beta and began to compare.\n\nNEW IS ALWAYS BETTER\nAfter a brief serving of story and a short tutorial explaining the basics I was directed to my very own kingdom, a world map of sorts, comprised mostly of open space and human inhabited houses. After completing a dungeon, more buildings appeared.  An elven habitat, a mage tower, a church...\n\nI quickly realised that the original 'choose race, choose class, choose difficulty' menu featured in the alpha had been replaced here with progressive RPG elements via the kingdom, including a huge host of quests, and that unlike the alpha, races and classes here required an unlock before they could be used. \n\nThe game continued forward, revealing multiple new features. Gold could be collected from dungeons and kept afterward, and then used to purchase preparation items that could be used in future dungeon attempts, or saved to unlock new buildings in the kingdom.\n\nEventually, I was introduced to the tavern, which served as a hub allowing access to multiple dungeon types. It was here that the largest difference between the alpha and beta made their appearance \u2014 there's more than one dungeon type in the full version. A lot more.\n\nDON'T PISS OFF THE DEITIES\nThat's when things started getting tough, and it was at about that time that the full Steam release arrived, this one complete with Granny K's masterpiece soundtrack. \n\nI was happy to learn that the progress I'd made in the beta was saved, and too, that even though I could now play the full release on Steam, I could continue to do so from my browser if I chose. Everything is saved online, so portable gaming is a legitimate option. A good thing, too, as Desktop Dungeons lends itself perfectly to quick gaming when you've only got 10 minutes to spare. Come on mobile version...\n\nWhere was I... oh, right. It's hard. Even the normal dungeons are hard. And the hard dungeons are a lot f@&ing harder. God only knows if there are even harder dungeons around the bend, but if there are, you'll likely need God's help to complete them. Well, at least one of the Gods, anyway.\n\nYes, yes... I know. Terrible segway, yada-yada. Gods are the key to victory in many of the dungeons, yet they're also a leading cause of death. The decision to adopt a deity is usually a hard one \u2014 on the one hand, they offer amazing buffs and bonuses that are generally the key to victory, on the other, they'll restrict you in various ways, punishing you severely for whatever they deem misconduct \u2014 though mastering their ways is essential.\n\nTHIS IS THE GAME THAT NEV-ER ENDS\nThat's where the other 'game mode' really helps: Puzzles. After unlocking the Explorer's Guild building in your kingdom you'll have access to a series of puzzles - dungeons that aren't generated randomly, but instead, have a single specific solution that you must discover in order to succeed. \n\nThey double as great ways to learn more information about the various items, weapons, spells, deities and conversion materials on offer, and though not everyone will need them, they're highly advised if you're having difficulty completing certain quests or dungeons.\n\nAnd that's everything I know. Almost. I know that of the nine classes I've unlocked there are another nine to go. I know that of the four races I've unlocked there are another... actually I don't know how many more there are. One, at least. I found him once \u2014 a Halfling trapped in a dungeon within a dungeon who nicked my last potion\u2014 but failed and haven't seen him since. That's a lot of the fun in Desktop Dungeons; every dungeon is different, and you never know what you're going to get. If you like The Binding of Isaac, or Spelunky, or more appropriately, Rogue Legacy, which offers a similar style of 'progressive roguelike' gameplay, then there's a great chance you'll love Desktop Dungeons, too. It's as hard as the others \u2014 perhaps even harder in its own way \u2014 but if you're not one to shy from a challenge then there's a lot to enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1385732114, "timestamp_updated": 1388854265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 294, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843518", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7812635": {"recommendationid": "7812635", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966266697", "num_games_owned": 1132, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1385083978}, "language": "english", "review": "Expect a puzzle game, and you'll love this!", "timestamp_created": 1385671011, "timestamp_updated": 1385671011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7805535": {"recommendationid": "7805535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041215526", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467907946}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my all time fav games. i played the free version for so long and this is just as good.

By the time I had finished the tutorials (and even some of those I had to cheat and look for solutions on youtube) that was the end of any successful dungeon clearing that I was able to do.\n\nGame in a nutshell is: The playfield is dark except where your character begins.  You always begin at level 1 but can choose your race/class and optionally pay some ingame gold for starting equipment (example: a shield that reduces all damage by 2).  You are placed on the screen and have to move around uncovering the darkened squares and ultimately defeat the level 10 boss of the dungeon.   Sounds fun right?\n\nThe only way to heal yourself and your mana (used for skills found as you explore the dungeon) are potions or uncovering darkened dungeon squares.  Both are in limited supply.  \n\nThe 'casual' rating of this game is true in the time required to play sense, but if you don't exploit every single weakness of every enemy, and if you don't kill higher level enemies for the bonus exp (which is harder than it sounds, again, very limited healing) you have no chance of killing the level 10 boss monster.\n\nBecause every move counted so much, and because ultimately it takes a lot of moves to clear a dungeon, I found myself getting frustrated at how incapable I found myself of clearing a dungeon.  I'd get to level 8 or 9 and simply not be able to kill enough enemies at that point without dying, to get to level 10 or have enough of a stockpile of potions for the final boss of each dungeon.   \n\nSo, instead of surely dying to the higher level boss, I would exit the dungeon, able to keep whatever gold I found in there and selling off the potions for 50-60 gold, take away 10-15 it costs for the items you bring with you.  At that point I was looking at minimum 500 gold upgrades to unlock anything more fun about the game, and I decided to uninstall and give up on the game because there was no other difficulty setting.\n\nIf that kinda game sounds fun more power to you but I was looking for a much more casual game, as in not an intense experience.

Don't be fooled by the cutesy artwork either - under the brightly colored hood lies an engine made of pure unadulterated mathematics. Do you fight the stronger enemy while you are lower level, earning extra xp you may need later? Or would that fight require you to eat into your valuable potion supply? The answer is right in front of your eyes, 95% of the time, it's up to you to figure out the optimal path if you can. Or, have a calculator handy.\n\nI'm not joking about the math either. This game is like a combination of Soduko, Minesweeper and the popular roguelike Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (I mean this in the best possible way). That's isn't to say that the rpg theme is painted on. On the contrary there is a satisfying asymettry to both the challenges you face in terms of levels and bosses, and also to the way the various classes and loadouts need to be deployed in order to surmount those challenges. The number of abilities and potential interactions, combined with a high degree of randomization, means that things stay interesting and fresh.\n\nExpect a game to last anywhere from 5 or 10 minutes from the early levels/challenges and upwards to an hour when attempting to successfully navigate some of the later dungeons, where a single miscalculation or wrong move can snatch sudden defeat from the jaws of victory. The logic and mechanics are incredibly tight (using unexplored space as a kind of resource is a genius mechanic IMO), and the fact that you now to get to build out your own kingdom as your acquire resources just adds another element of fun.\n\nAwesome game!

These double as advanced tutorials and are almost a must for anyone wanting to really know what the game may expect of you.\n\nAll in all, a really challenging but incredibly rewarding experience so far.

If so, get this game.\n\nLONG VERSION: Despite the developer's claim that \"reviewers have trouble with genres\", the core genre is simple: At heart, Desktop Dungeons is a strategy game. Success requires careful management of limitted resources. There are plenty of RPG elements in the game, but RPGs are typically centered more on their story, which, lets face it, isn't exactly this game's strong point.\n\nEach dungeon has a simple goal: Defeat the boss(es). This is, of course, easier said than done.\n\nAs mentioned, fulfilling that goal will require very careful management of your resources. Obvious resources are health and mana, but there's also item slots (you can only carry so much stuff), blankspace (exploring unexplored parts of the dungeon regenerates health and mana, but re-exploring already explored parts does not), conversion points (turn items into something else), levels and experience (levelling up fully restores health and mana, which is highly abusable), gold (for buying stuff!), and piety (too complex to explain here). In addition, your class (as well as many other factors) helps define just how efficiently you can use these resources. For example, wizards use less mana for the same bang, monks regen double health from blankspace, and fighters gain experience much faster. Mastery of the game will come from a thorough knowledge of its mechanics, intelligent use of resources, and at times, a bit of luck.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this game is HARD. The learning curve is very steep. While you are guided through the basics via tutorial, the rest of the mechanics will need to be figured out on your own. Do not expect to win every time. (However, also notably, this difficulty rarely stems from randomness issues; a highly skilled player should lose in only the worst random situations)\n\nThis game is also humorous. In fact, it's rarely NOT humorous.", "timestamp_created": 1385468701, "timestamp_updated": 1385468701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7764235": {"recommendationid": "7764235", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966375347", "num_games_owned": 2974, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461060103}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you love roguelikes?

You can be done and dusted with a dungeon in only a few minutes, yet they are full of the usual RPG elements.  Potions, gold, shops, stat bonuses, gods, monsters and level ups.  Your goal in each fixed dungeon is to kill one or two level 10 boss monsters.\n\nDifficulty in Desktop Dungeons is one of the highlights.  Each map and element provides a serious challenge to get to the end result of killing the level 10 boss monster.  It is not at all uncommon to fail.  You have to balance exploration so much so that it can feel like minesweeper.  You have tough choices to make and the key to this being such a great game is that your choices actually matter.

Dungeons generally take 10-20 minutes to complete (or fail) but the base mechanics are addicting enough that I did not find myself saying 'just one more', sessions ended only while glancing at the clock and being surprised enough to force myself to stop. \n\nThis is a surprisingly deep experience for a somewhat simplified dungeon crawler. Not only are the layouts different each time you start a dungeon (even the same one multiple times) but there is quite a bit outside of these in building up your kingdom and unlocking classes and races. The dungeon mechanics themselves are for the most part pretty standard - move, attack, kill, level up, repeat. The twist here is that as you explore, newly discovered tiles refill your (and any damaged enemy) health and mana bars. The impact of this was lost on me at the lower levels, but as you progress you will find it is impossible to explore the map and plan all your moves ahead of time. There are some abilities that help mitigate this but for the most part, each step is a resource not to be wasted and a wrong turn can mean the difference between leveling up or running out of options seven levels later while fighting the boss.\n\nHere lies the first of my two main issues with the game. I have had dungeons where the first half of my exploration resulted in dead ends or creatures far above my level 1 hero you always start as. This can be frustrating as it means you lose out on health/mana regen later on when those tiles could have been useful. I readily acknowledge that this is very much part of the game and there is strategy here above what my compulsion for exploration allows, but it can be hard not to feel that such runs are pointless to pursue.\n\nMy other issue with Desktop Dungeons has nothing to do with gameplay - the writing takes me completely out of the experience. The game world seems steeped in lore and interesting hero / creature design, yet all the dialogue is extremely casual and self-referential well beyond the tongue-in-cheek point. It's too bad, and is one of those situations where a flaw is almost made worse by the amount of potential it has. I would have preferred the tone to get more serious as I realized how deep the experience could be, and not the other way around. That may be personal opinion, but I really feel as if it is an area of missed opportunity in an otherwise enjoyable and lasting experience.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Desktop Dungeons to anyone looking for a game that satisfies in a way games like Binding of Isaac or even Spelunky does, where it doesn't matter if you play 5 or 50 games a session and can come back the next day and still find fresh gameplay waiting. The excellency of the procedural generation (which is greatly designed, no randomness here is used as a crutch) is exciting in its balance of interesting and clever levels, and even though the difficulty gets quite high early on you will most likely be able to find fun with it no matter your skill level.\n\n\n---Desktop Dungeons---\n+ Addicting base mechanics\n+ Deep experience tied to player skill progression\n- Some runs can be a letdown at the very start\n- Writing direction is not for me at all\nIt is my opinion that you should buy Desktop Dungeons anytime it is $12.50 or less!", "timestamp_created": 1385433225, "timestamp_updated": 1385433643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7755255": {"recommendationid": "7755255", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960694652", "num_games_owned": 744, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399957257}, "language": "english", "review": "Rogue-Likes and Rouge-Like-Likes alike all tend to feel alike. \n\nGenerally in these genres, you hack and slash your way to death with nothing left to really prove except for the knowledge that comes with drinking a suspicious looking potion and losing all your health to a single swig. You take these tips with a grain of salt as the variability to your death changes with each play-through...Although I use the term \"play-through\" lightly since you never actually get through some of the more hardcore rogue-likes without hours and hours of dedication to understanding the game's many quirks and traps. \n\nDesktop Dungeons feels like a solid blend of Rogue-Like and Puzzle with a welcome sense of progression as you earn gold and unlock new classes and races along the way. All of that mixed with the ability to spend 10-20 minutes on a single session is also entirely welcome. \n\nThe puzzle-like aspect of the game is a great mix to the genre. Instead of spending your time focusing on surviving until your next death, you know exactly what you need to do: kill all of the enemies. The helpful levels that appear next to the enemy names allow you to expect what's coming whether its a victory or a disappointing failure. Rogue-Likes are always known for their randomized nature with their random levels and random encounters; Desktop Dungeons has these to an extent but when you're level 5 and you're about to swing your sword at a level 9, you know you're not making a sound decision. The screen also turns red when your next move is fatal, which helps quite a bit as well. \n\nThe progression in the game also allows for a sense of accomplishment. No longer do you feel that sense of loss when you lose everything you worked so hard to get. Each \"dungeon\" is its own instance and if you know you're about to fail you can easily just retire and keep all your money (the items you acquire get sold for more money) which can then be spent on upgrading classes, races and even buying gear to aid you on the next quest you go on. \n\nAlong with multiple locations, there's plenty of different quests and challenges you can attack. Each class has its own set of challenges that give you bonus money and there are also general challenges that give you more gold just by doing things like spending a certain amount of gold or piety during a quest. \n\nThis game is certainly recommended if you enjoy the difficulty in Rogue-Likes but like to spend a casual amount of time slowly increasing your stats, or in this case, your kingdom.", "timestamp_created": 1385430303, "timestamp_updated": 1385497870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7754733": {"recommendationid": "7754733", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990043578", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1384854503}, "language": "english", "review": "Desktop Dungeons is an interesting game and worth looking into, but it's not quite the 'roguelike-lite' that it advertises itself to be. Each dungeon is one level (occasionally with a sublevel with more treasure or more enemies) and your adventurer always starts fresh at level 1 at the beginning of the dungeon, so there's no characters that carry over from dungeon to dungeon. The most notable difference between this game and other roguelikes is that monsters in dungeons do not move and do not attack until you attack, which causes the game to become more of a puzzle game than a genuine roguelike- the challenge comes not from the monsters themselves but rather budgeting your resources and defeating the monsters in the correct way to give your hero as much power as they need to defeat the boss monster and defeat the dungeon.\n\nThat's not saying Desktop Dungeons isn't entertaining or worth looking into, though. As far as being a sort of time-waster to play inbetween ordering a pizza or during a break at work or something, it fits perfectly since each dungeon could take at most 15 or 20 minutes to complete. The gameplay suits itself well to playing in short bursts rather than sitting down for long sessions and as such is a perfect fit for the busy gamer looking for a more intricate experience over Bejeweled or games on Facebook or something.\n\nThat being said, I'm not entirely sure this game is worth the $15 price tag. Maybe wait for it to come on sale for $10 or less, then go ahead and make the dive.\n\nOne final note: The soundtrack, made by Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark) and Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy) is excellent and fits the game well.

I played a ton of alpha, even after I had unlocked everything and finished all the levels.  It was a lot of fun, and I appreciated the minimalism of the game.  I paid for the advance copy something like three years ago, played the game, then stopped and sort of put it behind me for a while.\n\nThen, just a couple weeks ago, I saw that it was released on steam.  While I thought about looking up my copy of it, minutes later I received a message saying because I paid in advance I got a steam key!\n\nSo, I cracked it open.  And for a brief minute, I was shocked.  This isn't the blocky spreadsheet I remember!  Where did all these graphics come from?  Why are these characters saying things?  A town?  I miss my grid of things!\n\nOf course I got over that quick.  What I wasn't sure about is what changes there would be, and after playing about 10 hours of the game, I am excited to say that I think they've put an amount of polish on top that has made the game even more nuanced, more complex and overall, well, more.\n\nThe base aspects of the game are the same.  You are in a dungeon with monsters levels 1-10.  Killing them nets XP, but killing monsters of a higher level than you gets you exceptionally more experience.  And you will need to kill higher level monsters, because otherwise you are unlikely to level high enough to kill the boss.  Lucky for you, the monsters are pretty lacksadaisical and tend to just stand around in the same spot, and won't strike unless you strike first.\n\nIt also has a clever mechanic where revealing tiles in the dungeon is the prime method of regaining life and mana (aside from leveling, which refills all your life and mana). The monsters also refill their life, though, so you can't just take anything out by regaining your life over and over.\n\nIt sounds simple, but when you count class skills, items, gods and so many other factors, there is just so much to this game.  And the random generation of levels makes every game, even of just random games, a thrill and a different experience.  And I love the way they build level by level as you experience more and more - the learning curve here is a big improvement on the original which pretty much threw you right into the fray and you had to guess what would be hard or easy.  Frankly, that never bothered me because a game like this that lets you take your time, you learn in your own way, but I appreciate what they've done here.  It opens up pretty fast anyway, and I think your particular sense of play can lead you towards certain classes as the most fun or interesting.\n\nSo basically.  I'd recommend this.

Wenn man Spiele wie Dungeon of Dredmor oder Rogue Legacy in irgendeiner Form hart fand, wird man hier verzweifeln. \nEs dauert recht Lange bis man wirklich hinter das Prinzip des Spieles kommt. Am Anfang klickt man sich planlos noch durch und nach einigen Spielstunden klickt man sich mit bedacht durch jeden einzelnen Dungeon durch und aergert sich dann um so mehr wenn man einen Fehler gemacht hat.\n\nWer \"Hack, Slash, Loot\" gespielt hat, wird viele Fehler vom Gameplay her gesehen haben und vor allem schon rein vom Design war viel zu viel verkehrt und hier ist es einfach nur besser gehalten. Selbst schon zur fruehen Alpha war es schon ausgereifter als H,S,L.\n\nIch empfehle aber zu erstmal die Version 0.21 zu testen.

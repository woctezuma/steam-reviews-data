It's a shooter that's practically a puzzle game about timing and precise movement, that feels glorious to finally pull off. The feeling is almost like playing a piece of music, and it's fitting that the game's music is synced up to the automatically scrolling levels that govern the gameplay. \n\nKilling enemies quickly spawns new ones, which opens up new opportunities for you to score points. The more points you score, the more lives you have so you stand a chance at surviving the really tricky parts. And once you get really good at scoring, you obviously will be good enough at the game to not need all those extra lives. \n\nThere's a sense of exhiliration and joy when you discover a new tactic to clear an area effectively or beat a boss quickly, and a driving energy that keeps you going forward even when you die over and over again. Each death makes you stronger. And even though I'm still a far way from 1CC, I can still see how far I've come and feel exhilirated.", "timestamp_created": 1514248961, "timestamp_updated": 1514248961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

There are only five levels, but they all feel completely different from each other, and are masterfully made. The first level is there to get you used to the controls and mechanics of the game, level two has you navigating a somewhat destructible maze, level three has you dodging the landscape as it changes and tries to crush you, level four takes place inside and around a giant wheel which is constantly firing different colored bullets at you while trying to crash into you, and level five is more of a mini-boss rush until you get to the final showdown with the last boss. The uniqueness in the levels is my favorite feature of this game, as most shmups just send tougher mobs of enemies at you as you progress, making many of those games feel repetitive and boring to practice. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, and as a nice touch it is perfectly synced to the action of each stage adding a nice cinematic and epic feeling to every area and fight. The scoring system is simple, but difficult to keep a chain going for an insane score, basically you must constantly destroy enemies in threes, as long as those three enemies are the same color, you will constantly be building a higher score multiplier which is necessary for getting extra lives and climbing the scoreboard. You will quickly notice that the levels and enemy patterns are designed around this mechanic, and it requires a bit of strategy and restraint to destroy three same-colored enemies to keep your multiplier going, rather than just blasting everything as soon as it appears. Like any shmup this game is insanely difficult and requires many hours of practice on each stage to become good enough to beat the game without a continue, but because you can make half the bullets on screen harmless with the color change mechanic I do find this game to be a bit easier than say most Cave shmups, or the Touhou games for example, at least on the normal difficulty. Overall I give this game a 10/10, best shmup ever by quite a wide margin and it is a must play.

The port could be better - 7/10.[/b]\n\nTreasure have made some incredible titles over the years but Ikaruga is the one. The only problem I've noticed (in all versions) is the slight frame drop when a boss explodes, but I don't consider that a drawback because it doesn't affect play. For gameplay Ikaruga is fast, responsive and relentlessly demanding - exactly what an arcade game should be. \n\nIkaruga isn't a fun little game that you can explore at your own pace, it's a gauntlet thrown down to serious gamers. If you play Dark Souls you expect to be punished and that's how you have to see it here. People think that Ikaruga is inviting them in but it's not. It's calling them out. Most modern games don't demand this level of patience and focus, and the sheer purity of a 1-coin game makes this way more than just pattern learning.\n\n[b]Good things:[/b]\n\n1. The game itself is flawless, precision arcade gaming.\n\n2. Replays are a really good addition. \n\n[b]Problems:[/b]\n\n1. The console UI (GameCube or Saturn) remains a lot better. With the Steam port you can only replay a whole chapter and not an individual stage. So you can't do 1-3 without having to go through 1-1 and 1-2 first. I don't know why this was dropped. Maybe something to do with the replay saves?\n\n2. Having no Restart Stage option in the pause menu means that you have to quit, go back to the chapter menu and start again from there. That gets long. You are supposed to play Ikaruga over and over again, so the menu needs to support that with easier restarts. \n\n3. The UI is a bit messy. The main menu, pause menu and new menu style (i.e. all the replays, save etc.) are all different styles, colours and fonts. What's up with just using the standard Ikaruga font and design?\n\n4. The leaderboards show fake scores at the top. The real highest score is around 4th, and you can always tell by the number of chains, but it's pretty weak for a game that prides itself on rankings.\n\n[b]Further reading:[/b]\n\nIf you like Ikaruga then check out Mushihimesama. The hardest bullet hell game I have ever played and has a soundtrack like keygen music on crack. Total insanity but amazing fun. The YouTube vids alone make your brain bleed.\n\nAlso worth checking out rRootage, which is basically a homage to bullet hell stuff like Radiant Silvergun, Psyvariar, Gigawing and Ikaruga. Free game, with several play modes, and really good for learning the tricks of bullet hell (like the hit box of your ship being far smaller than you think)\n\nRadiant Silvergun is a must for fans, and easily available on the online marketplaces, but real copies are nuts expensive. It's a shame because the Saturn had some amazing bullet hell games. \n\nNot really bullet hell but Gradius is a worthy mention. NES classic which is pretty easy to finish, but requires several playthroughs, with each getting faster and harder.

And even though you and he have never met, will never cross paths, and never have a mutual friend, I assure you...\n\nHe hates you\nHe hates the very idea of you\nHe hates your friends\nHe hates your parents\nHe hates your political stance\nHe hates the way you dress\nHe hates your favorite color\nHe hates your little dog, too\nHe hates whatever country you hail from\nHe hates the music you listen to\nHe hates the movies you watch\nHe hates what you did last summer\nHe hates the color of your hair\nHe hates that little knick-nack you keep on the coffee table\nHe hates the side of the bed you sleep on\nAND he hates the other side of the bed too JUST TO SPITE YOU\n\nAnd this game...*this game*, is how he releases that anger upon you.  I have never encountered such concentrated contempt in one computer program.  I was frustrated after playing for a half an hour, after an hour I was fairly sure I shamed my family's honor somehow, and after two hours I was ready to tell Vice President Cheney everything I ever knew.  If this game were translated into a real-world axiom, I would describe it as \"beating a dead horse until the bones were but dust, and then chasing after each particle of dust in the wind and spitefully pounding each speck into random piles of manure just to drive home the point\".\n\nTo call this game difficult insults the idea of difficult.  The game seems to be sentient and angry at ever being compiled in the first place.\n\nI'm giving this game a recommend because apparently there is a genre for video game sadists, and this is a shining example of it.  It excels at precisely what it sets out to do.\n\nIn other notes, the rending is actually quite beautiful, the music is nice enough, and the tidbits of dialog between levels is intriguing if nothing else.

At it's core Ikaruga is a rythm game that happens to be a bullet hell. It's the bullet hell of bullet hells. It's the type of game where, if you beat it the way the game intends, you could officially say you have a doctorate in bullet hells. My two biggest downvote reasons for this game: I don't like rythm games and I don't enjoy hardcore gaming. \n\nThe controls are fluid. The gameplay is solid. However, there is a learning curve to this game that most will shy away from. I like this game ONLY when friends are over and we couch co-op with unlimited continues, because it's the only way I enjoy it. The game taunts you for not playing on hardcore reminding you that you won't get a highscore and the level bosses just go away after a certain time. Meaning if you don't play their way, they'll let you see the content, but you don't actually get to fully enjoy the game. \n\nI'm sure if I put a few hundred hours into Ikaruga I could be a master at this game.

The primary aim is to survive each level by avoiding bullets of the opposite polarity to your ship - for example if your polarity is white, your ship is invulnerable to white bullets, but contact with a black bullet will kill you.\n\nThe secondary aim is to maximise your score by 'chaining' enemy kills by polarity, i.e. destroying enemies of the same polarity in groups of three. Each chain increases your score multiplier - which affects the points awarded by each individual kill - by a factor of one. The higher your score, the higher your grade at the end of each level. The highest grades can only be achieved with very high score multipliers. \n\nAlternatively you can complete each level without firing once by avoiding bullets of the opposite polarity until the timer reaches zero. You're awarded with a special grade and ranking on a separate leaderboard.\n\nThe layout of enemies and their bullet patterns is identical each playthrough, and therefore repeated attempts are the key to success. Memorise enemy patterns, identify how to continuously chain enemy kills, and ultimately become good enough to complete the game in a single credit!\n\nA full playthrough tales approximately 25 minutes, but it will take many hours of practice before this can be achieved with just three lives. \n\nIkaruga expects you to die over and over again, but persevere and you [b]will[/b] progress.

If you're not a purist then hey you'll actually have a decent chance of finishing the full game.\n\nSecondly: why the fuck can you not skip ANY of the cutscenes?\n\nThirdly: There is a few issues I have with the menus. They are outdated need to be tweaked a bit overall, but more specifically there are some points at which you can't back out and have to go into a playthrough so you can quit back to the main title.\n\nLastly: This game should not be having performance issues (note that most performance issues do not occure during actual gameplay). If you are going to ignore everything else at least put forth the effort to make sure you game runs well on the platform you are porting it to. This is a blatent disregard for quality/effort\n\nIn summary Ikaruga is a great game, but I cannot recommend this port of it.

If a dark bullet hits a white ship, you die instantly. I find myself wondering wouldn't the same rule apply to the enemy? If a white enemy accidentally touch a dark enemy, shouldn't they both explode?\n\n- Background/ backdrop of where your ship is flying over, is distracting, sometimes it looks like a real photograph of trees, sometimes it is a 3D space? \n\n- Again back to \"realism\". At level 2, there's giant blocks moving around. Is this battlefield inside a base? If yes, how does the enemy fly in or out of these blocks themselves? \n\nI just saw \"DELTAZEAL\" gameplay on Youtube.

If you like challenges, this might be for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy playing a fun and relaxing game, streer away from this one.\nThe other thing that bugs me is that there are no power-ups. I might be old fashioned, but shiny effects and overly-powerful weapons are what make me happy in this genre. There are no bombs which help you get out of a tight spot by clearing the screen. Not even an option to shoot in reverse or to the sides. And trust me, enemies will be coming from all areound.\nIn order to enjoy this, you really need to be focused to pilot around hundreds of obstacles appearing on the screen at the same time and you have to be really fast on the polarity switch finger. Polarity is a thing that helps you absorb bullets from the same-colored enemies, while being vulnerable to the other color. It also deals double damage to the opposite color.\n\nSo...

Lo que diferencia a nuestra nave, llamada por cierto Ikaruga, de las enemigas es que podemos cambiar entre una polaridad y otra cuando queramos. De este modo, cuando nuestra nave est\u00e9 en la polaridad blanca, por ejemplo, podr\u00e1 absorber los disparos de ese mismo color que sean disparados desde las naves enemigas tambi\u00e9n blancas. No obstante, si nos alcanza un disparo de color negro nuestra nave ser\u00e1 destruida. Esto se cumple tambi\u00e9n en el caso contrario, cuando nuestra nave es negra. A medida que vayamos absorbiendo disparos se ir\u00e1 rellenando una barra de energ\u00eda que nos permitir\u00e1 realizar un potente disparo especial. \n\nComo es natural si disparamos a una nave con disparos del color opuesto le infringiremos el doble de da\u00f1o. Es decir, si disparamos con disparos blancos a una nave negra, acabaremos con ella antes y viceversa. Esto resulta de especial importancia contra los jefes finales. Pero hay que tener cuidado si derribamos a una nave de nuestra misma polaridad, ya que en este caso nuestro ca\u00eddo enemigo soltar\u00e1 una especie de \"metralla\" en la explosi\u00f3n que nos puede comprometer si cambiamos de polaridad demasiado deprisa. \n\nY Treasure ha sabido manejar este novedoso sistema con verdadera maestr\u00eda. Naves de las dos polaridades llegar\u00e1n de todas partes llenando toda la pantalla de disparos de ambos colores poniendo a prueba as\u00ed nuestros reflejos y nuestra capacidad de atenci\u00f3n para intentar cambiar de una polaridad a otra mientras derribamos a nuestros enemigos. Toda una delicia y todo un desaf\u00edo. \n\nA todo esto hay que sumarle las caracter\u00edsticas t\u00edpicas de los Shooter matamarcianos como las naves enemigas que resisten varios impactos, diferentes clases de obst\u00e1culos que deberemos ir esquivando y los obligados enemigos finales. Treasure consigue un elevad\u00edsimo nivel en todos estos apartados. Si a esto le a\u00f1adimos lo anteriormente explicado (incluyendo la conseguida sensaci\u00f3n de velocidad en varios puntos) y un control tan sencillo que casi asusta (un bot\u00f3n de disparo, otro para cambiar la polaridad, otro para hacer el disparo especial y \"chim-pam-pum-sanseacab\u00f3\") obtenemos un c\u00f3ctel verdaderamente explosivo.\n\"Ikaruga\" posee un n\u00famero de modos de juego algo escaso pero en cualquier caso superior a la media de lo que nos tiene acostumbrados este g\u00e9nero: \n\n- Arcade: El de toda la vida. Hay dos versiones, una \"trial\" que solo abarca los dos primeros cap\u00edtulos (ideal para principiantes) y la normal con los 5 cap\u00edtulos de la versi\u00f3n Arcade original. Hay tres modos de dificultad disponibles, los cuales var\u00edan de uno a otro seg\u00fan la \"metralla\" que sueltan los enemigos al morir. En el modo f\u00e1cil los enemigos no soltar\u00e1n metralla; en el modo normal solo soltar\u00e1n metralla si derribamos a un enemigo con utilizando su misma polaridad; en el modo dif\u00edcil, los enemigos siempre soltaran metralla al ser destruidos. \n\n- Pr\u00e1ctica: El nombre lo dice todo. Solo se puede practicar en aquellas fases del modo Arcade que hayamos superado sin haber usado continuaciones. \n\n- Conquista: En este modo de juego, las fases est\u00e1n divididas en \u00e1reas detalladas seg\u00fan cada una. Se puede jugar en tres velocidades distintas (Demo, Lento y Normal) para habituarse al juego, aunque la idea es jugar en modo Normal. Al igual que en el modo pr\u00e1ctica, solo se pueden jugar en aquellas fases que hayan sido superadas en el modo Arcade sin haber usado continuaciones. \n\n- Desaf\u00edo: O lo que es lo mismo, el modo Arcade para competir en los rankings de internet. No, no es que este juego tenga opci\u00f3n de juego on-line. Simplemente, cuando se nos acabe la partida, bien por haber llegado hasta el final, bien por haber perdido todas las vidas (lo m\u00e1s frecuente ser\u00e1 esto \u00faltimo), se nos dar\u00e1 una contrase\u00f1a de doce caracteres que despu\u00e9s deberemos introducir en la p\u00e1gina web oficial de \"Ikaruga\" y comparar nuestras puntuaciones con las de jugadores de todo el mundo. \n\nA todo esto sumarle la posibilidad de jugar a dos jugadores cooperativamente en todos los modos de juego. \n\nAhora bien, estas opciones pueden parecer pocas, pero la durabilidad de \"Ikaruga\" est\u00e1 m\u00e1s que garantizada merced a uno de los niveles de dificultad m\u00e1s alto y a la vez m\u00e1s adictivas de la presente generaci\u00f3n. Y es que el t\u00edtulo de Treasure es, como se dice vulgarmente, \"dif\u00edcil de narices\". Entre la gran cantidad de enemigos y disparos que llega a haber en pantalla al mismo tiempo, el retorcido dise\u00f1o de niveles en lo que a obst\u00e1culos se refiere y el frenetismo de la acci\u00f3n, \"Ikaruga\" es un juego de dificultad muy elevada incluso en el modo f\u00e1cil. Pero a pesar de que moriremos bastante a menudo, el juego es tan endiabladamente adictivo que dicha dificultad no llega a ser excesivamente frustrante, al menos para jugadores de habilidad media/alta. Si hablamos de jugadores m\u00e1s inexpertos... la cosa cambia. Si eres de los que se desesperan con juegos dif\u00edciles, \"Ikaruga\" no es demasiado aconsejable. \n\nTambi\u00e9n hay que tener muy en cuenta que \"Ikaruga\" es, por encima de todo, un juego para amantes del g\u00e9nero de los shooter. Si eso de derribar naves nunca te gust\u00f3 demasiado, este t\u00edtulo no te har\u00e1 cambiar de opini\u00f3n y menos con esa dificultad. No obstante, si eres un amante del g\u00e9nero, \"Ikaruga\" es un imprescindible casi obligatorio. Del mismo modo si eres de los que se quejan de que esta generaci\u00f3n solo ha dado juegos \"para paquetes\" y buscas un t\u00edtulo en el cual vayas a morir 15 veces m\u00ednimo antes de conseguir avanzar (\u00a1Que los hay! \u00a1Y muchos!), \"Ikaruga\" supone todo un reto a tu habilidad que a buen seguro te dejar\u00e1 satisfecho. \n\nAs\u00ed es \"Ikaruga\". Una verdadera joya de las talentosas mentes de los chicos de Treasure. Un diamante en bruto que, aunque no sea apto para todo el mundo, proporcionar\u00e1 diversi\u00f3n a raudales a todos aquellos que sepan apreciarlo. \n", "timestamp_created": 1480004262,

I've rarely played a game developed by Treasure that disappoints, and this is probably their best.\n\nThe incredible visuals (which have aged exceptionally well), the amazing musical score and sound effects already set this game apart from many shooters.  However, the unique \"polarity\" mechanic and simple, straightforward controls truly make this game remarkable and unique, even compared to others developed by Treasure.  \n\nThe ability to absorb attacks that would otherwise destroy you, and to have control over this mechanic for every attack in the game, adds a level of depth and strategy that isn't typical of games in this genre.  The mechanic is easy to understand, but often extremely difficult to apply optimally.\n\nThis mechanic is displayed throughout the masterfully crafted stages, which is the trademark of any Treasure game.  You would be hard pressed to find a shoot-em-up developer that can create stages that seem so chaotic and tense yet are so deliberate and organized in design.\n\nI should warn that this game isn't for the faint of heart.  It's disgustingly difficult to master and really demands a lot of concentration and pattern recognition from the player to find success.

But if you want, you can enable continues from the options menu to make it easier.\nIn addition to the usual mechanics in shoot'em up games, this game features ((Polarity)) mechanic. Your ship has two forms/colors (blue and red) and by switching between them, you can avoid being hit by the projectiles that have the same color and absorb them to unleash a powerful attack (blue form/color absorbs blue projectiles and red form/color absorbs red projectiles).\nBy killing 3 enemies of the same color in a row, you get one ((Chain)) bonus that resets if you kill enemies without using the said pattern. Earning chains is very important if you want to get high scores and grades (and also achievements) at the end of each level; but it can also become very hard in final levels.\n\nPros:\n- Challenging Gameplay\n- Amazing Soundtracks\n- Co-Op Support\n- Polarity Mechanic\n\nCons:\n- Nothing", "timestamp_created": 1474471198, "timestamp_updated": 1474471198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25595456": {"recommendationid": "25595456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041332890", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489196248}, "language": "english", "review": "WELCOME TO DIE", "timestamp_created": 1474327811, "timestamp_updated": 1474327811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25584870": {"recommendationid": "25584870", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975703239", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481700352}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic, hard as hell schmup.

Quite obviously this is a game for people who have the tendency to be perfectionists, who love to grind every last bit out of levels and don't mind starting over quite often.\n\nThere are many games which are difficult because they are poorly designed, have stupid controls, weird hitboxes, are unfair, have too much random elements, distracting visuals... not the case here!\n\nControls, Gameplay, Hitboxes, Visuals, everything is perfect. The hitboxes are very well done, so it really has to hit your ship for you to die, so no frustration in that regard, just as it should be.\n\n[b]The game mechanic:[/b]\n\nWhile being white you can absorb blue enemy fire to charge your special attack and red fire will instantly kill you (the other way around when you are black). You can switch back and forth as you wish. But here the twist: If your \"polarity\" (the game uses this term) is different from your enemy, you do twice the damage. So being black shooting white (or the other way around) does twice the damage to your enemy, but dodging enemy fire then can be really tricky (as a single shot of the opposite polarity will instantly kill you), this also means you can't charge your special attack by absorbing enemy fire while being of a different polarity.\n\nAnd another nice feature: Changing polarity is very quick, but not instant. So if you are white and want to change since there is some red fire incoming you can't possibly dodge, you have to anticipate that slightly before.\n\nSo the mechanic is quite simplistic, but also somewhat brilliant. You have to concentrate quite seriously at times and there are various strategies how to approach different enemy formations.\n\nEspecially if you are striving for a highscore the game immensely rewards playing well, and punishes mistakes brutally. So it doesn't matter how long you are able to survive, 20 seconds of good play will trump 2 minutes of dodging everything. And that's how it should be. Having chains of streaks (shooting 3 enemies of same polarity in a row) will boost your score immensely and the goal is to keep this up as consistently as possible (and the enemy formations allow you to keep this up if you play perfectly).\n\nThe first chapter is quite alright on hard, but the progression from there on is brutal.\n(I probably would have clocked more hours playing it, but there is no Linux port and I currently don't have any Windows machines)", "timestamp_created": 1466461189, "timestamp_updated": 1474624080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23625718": {"recommendationid": "23625718", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995228810", "num_games_owned": 1739, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510152166}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic gets a fantastic PC port.

That's not a joke or an exaggeration. If you think you're going to walk into this game and beat it easily (without unlimited continues) you're wrong. It's very tough but also very rewarding with its dual phase mechanic. If your ship is black, you absorb black bullets and die in one hit. If you're white, it's the opposite. You have to use this mechanic to survive as the enemies will be blanketing the screen in bullets and lasers trying to kill you with alternating colors.

Unlike Radiant Silvergun, there are only two weapons (standard shot, and a series of lasers), and enemies have two color schemes (black and white) as suppose to three (red, blue, and yellow). Ikaruga has several improvements over Silvergun: The game is more fast-paced than its predecessor, as well as greatly reducing the clutter on the controls (you no longer need to press multiple buttons Simultaneously to initiate a special move). It does have its flaws: the game is rather short and can be beaten within 25 to 50 minutes, the visibility between enemies and obstacles can be hard to tell at times, as well as the lack of proper power-ups (as enemy chains only effect the score and rank). Nonetheless, Ikaruga is a fantastic title in its own right and if you're a fan of bullet hell games, or various Treasure games like Dynamite Headdy or Mischief Makers, this game is for you!", "timestamp_created": 1462310183, "timestamp_updated": 1462841791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582069", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22765697": {"recommendationid": "22765697", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980703898", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393159816}, "language": "english", "review": "I NEED RADIANT SILVERGUN", "timestamp_created": 1462212788, "timestamp_updated": 1462212788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22656928": {"recommendationid": "22656928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960414632", "num_games_owned": 938, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515862374}, "language": "english", "review": "shmups at it best", "timestamp_created": 1461730968, "timestamp_updated": 1461730968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22579061": {"recommendationid": "22579061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146561157", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500604432}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc77c\ub2e8 \uafc0\uc7bc.\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uadf8\ub0e5 \ud150\uac00\uc774\ub098 \uac74\ubc84\ub4dc, \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub77c\uc774\ucee4\uc988 19 XX \uac19\uc740\uac70\ub77c\uace4 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uc9c0\ub9c8\ub77c. \uc65c\ub0d0\uba74 \uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uc0dd\uac01\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c0\ub2e4\uac04  30\ubd84\ud574\ubcf4\uace0 \ud658\ubd88\ud558\uac8c \ub420\ud14c\ub2c8\uae4c. \uadf8\ub300\uc2e0 \uc9c4\uc9dc\ub85c \uc774\uac78 \ud560\uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \uc81c\ub370\ub85c \ubc15\ud600\uc788\ub2e4\uba74 10000\uc6d0\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c 100000\uc774\ub77c\ub3c4 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc548\ud560\ub9cc\ud07c\uc758 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1461379471, "timestamp_updated": 1461379471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22537200": {"recommendationid": "22537200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299018805", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489573123}, "language": "french", "review": "Ikaruga c'est...L'enfer !!!

This is game was also released to Xbox Live in 2011. then Steam port was released in February 18, 2014.\n\nThis game doesn't really feature power-ups, but it features a unique mechanic in exchange. This game allows you to change the prolarity of your ship to light and dark. If you chose the wrong polarity for the ship, you're basically screwed.\n\nIkarugua is really known for the challenge. Try playing it in hard mode, and you'll know why this game is seriously difficult. Ikarugua may be known for its difficulty, but it's also really addictive. The levels are really well-made and the music is really amazing in my opinion. The graphics are really good for this year. The Steam port of Ikarugua has gamepad support. I tested this game with a Xbox One controller, and it works pretty well. I'm not sure if this works with any gamepad other than a Xbox One controller, so can anyone please confirm it? The controls were very reponsive and stiff.\n\nJust because this game is really good, that doesn't mean it has its flaws. One of the issues I have about this game is the story seems non-existent. The another issues is because of its difficulty, this game can possibly make someone throw a controller (or keyboard) to the wall.

The paint-like art style has definitely allowed this game to age better than its spiritual predecessor Radiant Silvergun.\n\n- Incredible Music. Every tune is lovely to my ears.\n\n- Easy to learn, insanely hard to master gameplay. It's rather incredible just how many challenges Treasure's designers managed to squeeze out of the incredibly simple mechanics at play here, and it's awesome to see all the creative enemy designs they were able to make with them as well.\n\n- Satisfying as all hell. Seriously, those explosions. I have never felt quite so good when killing a troublesome boss.\n\nCons:\n- A menu annoyances. To my knowledge, once you select a game mode, you can't back out if you clicked something you didn't mean to. Effectively, you have to play a game and kill yourself or reset the game to get back to the title screen.\n\n- No real explanation of the story. There is a plot to this game, and it's not an excuse plot. I won't devote time to explaining it here, but I do think it's quite a shame that there's no signs of the story in this port (again, to my knowledge).\n\n- Chaining. I admit, I have never been a fan of this part of Ikaruga. While it's certainly nowhere near as bad as it was in Radiant Silvergun (There, you had to chain to upgrade your weapons, which was *essential* to defeating later bosses), I still don't particularly like a scoring system that effectively forces you to memorize everything that happens in an entire stage to hit those elusive S++ ranks. Granted, I'm also terrible at chaining, so take that as you will.\n\n\nOverall, Ikaruga has earned its reputation as being one of the greatest shoot-'em ups ever made. Fantastic level design, creative boss designs, good story (in the versions that actually have it), great visuals and music. What else could you ask for?\n\nBefore I go, though, one word of warning:\n\nWhile far from the hardest game in this genre, Ikaruga is still difficult. Like, really, really, really difficult.

Witnessing a second and third release on the Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube in 2002 and 2003 respectively, the legendary Shmup was later introduced to the newer generation after its success lead to a fourth release on the XBLA in 2008.\n\nWhile narrative clearly wasn't the main focal point of the game during the development phase, Ikaruga does feature an interesting backstory that gives appropriate context to the characters' actions. Tenro Horai; the leader of a small nation known as Horai; came across the Ubusunagami Okinokai or 'Power of the Gods', affording her powers surpassing that of any normal human being. With 'The Divine Ones' at her side, Tenro launched a campaign of global conquest. As the Horai felled each nation one by one, a small group of those brave enough to defy the Horai emerged, called the Tenkaku. Using advanced fighter aircraft known as 'Hitekkai', they fought a desperate battle against the Horai, but ultimately proved to be no match for their adversaries and suffered a swift and humiliating defeat. Once thought to have been among the many victims of the Horai's conquest, a young man called Shinra who had fought for the Tenkaku was shot down in an aerial battle high above the clouds. Dragged from the wreckage of his fighter and taken to the village of Ikaruga, Shinra was nursed back to health and entrusted by the village people with a powerful fighter unlike any other \u2013 the Ikaruga. Using the energies of two polarities, the Ikaruga was a versatile aircraft that could adapt to any given situation. With the power of the Ikaruga at his side, Shinra once again took to the skies to battle the Horai and bring about an end to their tyranny.\n\nIkaruga's most prominent feature; and indeed that which sets it apart from almost every other shmup to date; is its polarity system. Enemies appear in three varieties, each corresponding to one or both 'polarities'. White enemies fire white bullets towards the player, while black enemies discharge black bullets. Each boss typically utilizes both polarities and is capable of executing attacks using bullets of either. The Ikaruga itself however, is capable of switching between both polarities mid-flight, on the fly, thus introducing one of the game's most important mechanics \u2013 alternating polarities. While using the white polarity, the Ikaruga fires white bullets and is unaffected by those of that polarity fired by the enemy, though direct contact with black bullets is fatal. Any black enemies hit whilst using the white polarity also suffer significantly greater damage than what they would have suffered, had the black polarity been active. White bullets that draw near the Ikaruga are absorbed and converted into energy used to fuel a powerful homing missile attack. The reverse applies when using the black polarity. \n\nThis clever mechanic encourages a 'risk versus reward' style of play that; together with the game's high level of difficulty; results in a very challenging but rewarding experience that makes Ikaruga one of Treasure's most enjoyable titles to play. The stage design itself is also particularly praiseworthy, both for its complexity and originality. While the first stage is quite easily manageable, every stage beyond it forces the player into a head-on confrontation with intricate mazes of bullets that require one to fully master the polarity switching mechanic in order to stand even the slightest chance of reaching the results screen. Skilled players can try to mix up their polarities by alternating on a regular basis to maximize the damage inflicted on the enemy, a tactic that becomes particularly viable when facing off against most of Ikaruga's bosses. Stage 3's boss stands out as being one of Ikaruga's trickier bosses that requires a more subtle approach from the player, involving the use of a number of advanced polarity switching techniques. \n\nDestroying three enemies of the same polarity consecutively results in a 'Chain', causing a substantial rise in the player's score. Each stage has been carefully designed in such a manner that it is possible for the very best players to complete a 'perfect' run of every stage by carrying a chain throughout the entire level, provided the enemies' attack patterns have been learnt well. \n\nThough the game features a steep learning curve that is likely to deter players who are new to games of the genre, Ikaruga offers a fantastic experience to anyone willing to take the time and effort to master the polarity switching mechanic.\n\nIkaruga's visuals are for the most part very impressive. The vast majority of finely-detailed enemies are well-animated. But what truly stands out is their unique design. Many of the enemies Ikaruga throws at the player look nothing like any enemies seen in other bullet helll games. The boss of the fourth stage is one prime example of the sheer creativity poured forth into the game. Each and every background also benefits from the same level of detail seen in the enemy design, with some of the game's mechanical backgrounds being among the most memorable for that reason. The lighting effects seen throughout the outdoor environments capture an atmosphere that makes every stage as breathtaking to look at as it is to play.\n\nIkaruga's powerful musical score plays a major role in contributing towards the creation of a different feel for each stage. While flights through enormous enemy facilities are accompanied by orchestral music with the subtle; yet highly effective; integration of techno music, massive aerial battles amidst amber-tinted skies are fought to the triumphant sounds of trumpets, capturing the intensity and desperation of the fight. Each boss' defeat is followed by a loud and catastrophic explosion that sounds just as impressive as it is to behold.\n\nIkaruga is the finest example of an innovative bullet hell game that is both a masterpiece in terms of its gameplay and art direction. Those who possess the time and dedication necessary to master Ikaruga and its original gameplay mechanics in order to experience the game to its fullest can expect to find themselves utterly absorbed by Treasure's iconic Shmup for a long time to come.", "timestamp_created": 1443043987, "timestamp_updated": 1444484459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18135603": {"recommendationid": "18135603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154726493", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509144429}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has it all.

She is a love you cannot conquer, she is a complex beauty who demands perfection. Your best will never truly please her, she will make you feel inadequate at every moment, and yet you cannot stop trying to win her heart.

And she will make you furious, she will make you cry, she will drive you crazy, but you cannot stop loving her, because there is nothing else in the world that can compare to what she is.\n\nPros:\n- She is perfection.\n\nCons:\n- You are not.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- achievements are not broken down to different game play modes (easy/normal/hard/prototype mode). Also, Dot Eater is not linked to any level, you can get it in any mode.\n- extra \"double play\" game modes not found in the console version.\n- almost every combination of screen rotations are supported, which is great. It looks incredible on a pivot monitor.\n- the game select at the start does not show the player character anymore (it uses the high score screen background instead)\n- no training mode options to restart a level (you will need this a lot), or to start mid-level (GCN version had this I believe).\n- to unlock a level on any difficulty, you just have to credit feed the game on easy mode. This also gets you the achievements for beating a boss. On the Dreamcast, you could only use training on levels you managed to reach with 1 credit, on the specific difficulty you reached it with.\n- you cannot define analog axes as buttons, so on a non-xbox pad you may not be able to configure a trigger for the laser release. But the game supports just about any non-xinput pad other than this, which is great.\n- when using level select to play the Final stage, the Stone-Like sequence is omitted!

It's got a lot of problems; some of them are subjective and some people may consider them to actually be strengths, but there are others that no-one in their right mind would think to be good unless they are a blind fanboy. \n\nObviously, this is going to be a negative review, so let's start out with the positives. The graphics look pretty nice. Controller support is (mostly) very good. The polarity switching mechanic is... interesting... for the first five minutes of the game.\n\nTo start off the negatives, let's expand on some of the positives. When I say controller support is mostly good, I mean that it's excellent, save for one thing. Like in most bullet hell games, you have the ability to move at a slower speed, if you desire to. The problem is, the only way to activate this slow speed is to only tilt the analog stick slightly, rather than holding a button and inputting a direction, like most bullet hell games. This wouldn't be a problem, except it's very difficult to even get the slower speed to activate; the analog stick must be tilted just so for it to work. In a very intense game that is a bullet hell game, monkeying with the analog stick and trying to get it to behave a certain way is an obvious no-no. So, if you use a controller, you will never be moving at the optional slower speed; it simply doesn't work well enough.\n\nThis brings me to my next issue with the controls. The keyboard controls have issues. Usually I prefer to use a controller when I play video games, but for bullet hell games I prefer to use a keyboard. This doesn't really work with this game. There is no button you can hold to move at a slow speed with a keyboard, so while the option is too poorly implemented on the controller to work well, it doesn't even exist on the keyboard. However, that's small beans compared to a start button not existing on the keyboard. That's right, if you play using a keyboard, you won't be able to use continues. I hope you enjoy 1CCing bullet hell games on your first try if you don't own a controller!\n\nThis brings me to my next point. The buttons can be remapped to basically whatever you want; if you have a working controller or keyboard, Xinput or no, you can remap the controls. However, as said before, there is no option to remap the start button on the keyboard; it does not exist. I've tried pressing every key on my keyboard to continue when the counter appears, and nothing works. Again, it does not exist. Being able to remap the buttons that DO work is very nice, and the customization is appreciated. Another nice thing is that if you use a controller with Xinput, the button prompts change. It seems weird to me that the control options for this game would be so fleshed out, but that something is vital as a start button is completely missing from the keyboard controls. In conclusion, the control options for the game are mostly really nice but some deep errors were made concerning specific aspects of them, as well.\n\nSo, you have to use a controller and the slow speed doesn't work well for the controller, big deal, what about the actual game?\n\nLet's address that by expanding on another positive; the polarity-switching mechanic is interesting... for a bit. Ikaruga features the ability to change your \"polarity\"; being light/blue/whatever-you-want-to-call-it allows you to absorb blue bullets, and being red allows you to absorb red bullets. Absorbing bullets lets you charge up a powerful special attack. Also, shooting bullets at an enemy that is not the same polarity as you will deal significantly more damage.\n\nAs said before, it's interesting for the first 5 minutes. It's really not a big deal. I could only really see someone that was very starved for creativity enjoying it significantly.\n\nThe first stage is pretty easy and allows the player to get used to the concept of changing their polarity. I enjoyed it. I noticed at the beginning of each stage, there will be some text that will tell you what stage you are on and say something edgy about overcoming an ordeal. It's completely unnecessary, makes no sense, and is not germane to any story (not that most bullet hell games even have those). Not a huge deal, though. There wasn't really anything special about the boss, but when he explodes, there's gratuitous slowdown; the explosion couldn't possibly cause lag when the rest of the game didn't. While I frown upon that, it's also not a huge deal.\n\nThe second stage is where I really became disappointed with this game. This is where the subjectivity comes in, and is also my major reason for disliking this game.\n\nI fucking detest environmental hazards in bullet hell games. Walls, giant rocks, things that serve no purpose but to get in the way. I fucking hate them.\n\nSo obviously, the second stage is where the environmental hazards start to come into play. Probably about half of the stage (maybe a bit more) consists of environmental hazards; large square fans and flying metal objects that don't seem to resemble anything specifically. Navigating the stage was more of a bore than fun. The boss of stage two though... that was the icing on the cake, the cherry on top, yada yada. It was extremely tedious. The boss boxes you into a triangle that is about a third of the screen. To damage the boss, you must shoot these cap things that protect it's weak points. They will expand away from the boss the more that you shoot them, and you must get between the cap and the boss to shoot it's weak point as the cap slowly retracts back to it's original position, all while you dodge bullets. It's extremely tedious. Not only is your movement extremely limited, but even being able to damage the boss is a chore. I've already said it, but the word \"tedious\" really describes this boss very well.\n\nSo I soldiered through stage two, hoping that stage three would be better... it was even worse. Worse than I could have possibly imagined.  Basically the entire stage is an environmental hazard. The first part of the stage consists of large, moving square blocks that leave you with very little space to maneuver. Unless you watch someone do this part or practice it over and over again, there's no way to know how to maneuver correctly. Stay back or move ahead? Who knows? You'll end up touching one and exploding, unless you know exactly what to do. This introduced something I also dislike, just not as much as environmental hazards: memorization. The next part of the stage is heavy on both; Pillars will extend from the side of the screen. Some will close, some will leave openings. Again, this requires heavy memorization, because you need to know whether to pull ahead or stay back; there's no way to know if they will fully close or stop and leave an opening. Pulling ahead may result in you hitting one of the pillars that left an opening, stay backing may result in you getting trapped behind a closed pillar. I fucking hated this part. Luckily, the boss of stage three isn't nearly as tedious as the boss of stage two, just a little plain, but it's a huge improvement. Unfortunately, the achievement for beating him glitched and wasn't awarded to me, so that's nice.\n\nI had some lives left after I beat stage three and played a bit of stage four. It didn't impress me, but it seemed to be a lot better than stages two and three. I had no motivation to try again after I lost the rest of my lives fairly early in the stage. There are only five stages, so I figured that I had given this game a fair shake and quit. I proceeded to uninstall it and write this review.\n\nI wouldn't even recommend this game to hardcore bullet hell fans.

Il gioco si rivela un successo (in Giappone, la versione internazionale verr\u00e0 pubblicata in seguito su Xbox Live Arcade) cos\u00ec Treasure si rimette a lavoro su un suo possibile sequel intitolando il progetto \"Project-RS2\" (appunto Radiant Silvergun 2). Ad un certo punto nel suo sviluppo vengono inserite le meccaniche della polarit\u00e0 nera-bianca ed \u00e8 cos\u00ec che \"project RS-2\" diventa Ikaruga diventando comunque una sorta di sequel spirituale.\n\nIkaruga \u00e8 un gioco che se pur simile si stanzia molto da Radiant Silvergun; l'intera strategia si basa sul meccanismo della polarit\u00e0 nera-bianca. Dire che questo gioco \u00e8 difficile \u00e8 ben poco, ogni secondo vale durante il gameplay di questa gemma (oserei dire Tesoro!), un attimo di distrazione e sei fritto! Grazie al suo sistema di polarit\u00e0 nera-bianca \u00e8 possibile assorbire tutti i proiettili/laser/orda di proiettili/orda di laser dello stesso colore della tua nave; l'assorbimento di un solo proiettile del colore opposto costa la perdita di una vita ma per fortuna vengono cancellati dalla schermata tutti i proiettili di tutti i colori in modo di lasciarti il tempo di rivalutare la situazione e scegliere quale strategia adottare pi\u00f9 o meno con calma. \u00e8 possibile scegliere la difficolt\u00e0 del gioco affinch\u00e8 i giocatori meno esperti possono approcciare a questo shmup tutto meno che facile. Nonostante tutto \u00e8 comunque un gioco per veri esperti del genere, sicuramente da evitare se siete solo dei turisti di questo genere o addirittura alla vostra prima esperienza con uno Shmup.\n\nDevo dire personalmente che questa meccanica della polarit\u00e0 non aiuta per niente i giocatori che per prima hanno giocato con Radiant Silvergun. \u00e8 proprio visibile che questo gioco era destinato ad essere Radiant Silvergun 2, ma non tanto per la grafica, piuttosto immaginando continuamente le strategie da adottare se avessimo avuto a disposizione quelle sette armi disponibili in quel gioco (come OGNI VOLTA che arrivano dei nemici dai lati in alto avere quelle bombe che usavi premendo il tasto C del controller del Saturn). Personalmente penso che se questo gioco avesse avuto la meccanica di Radiant Silvergun forse sarebbe stato pi\u00f9 godibile. Purtroppo ho l'esperienza di quell'altro titolo molto fresca, dovrei forse abbandonare questo gioco per un po' per poi riprenderlo in un secondo momento e godermelo di pi\u00f9. Ad ogni modo se siete degli esperti di questo genere (e se non avete ancora giocato a Radiant Silvergun) compratelo senza pensarci due volte, sono ore e ore di divertimento arcade! \n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1434985722, "timestamp_updated": 1434985722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16620544": {"recommendationid": "16620544", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961908404", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434398149}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this classic on the GameCube when it originally released.  Most dub this as a spiritual successor to Radiant Silvergun, another Treasure classic that was released on Sega's system years ago.  Regardless, if you enjoy bullet-hell shooters, then this game will be right up your alley.  The implementation of the black/white bullet gameplay is a nice switch-up and the skill/practice needed to chain together kills with the right color shots.  You can absorb whatever shots are thrown your way if you're in the correct color mode.  This allows you to charge up your super shot also and unleash some heavy damage.  The game starts off relatively tame then gets rather hectic, really quick.  The soundtrack fits the game pretty well and obviously has a convoluted storyline most shooters like this do.  There's the obvious scoring system that perfectionists are going to want to max out out as high as possible.  The bosses were also well designed and get progessively harder throughout the course of the game.  The length is on par with other shooters, and can be finished rather quick if you aren't in it to master the craft and up your score.  Definitely for the niche shooter lover market.

The polarity mechanic works thusly: Enemies are color-coded, and you're immune to projectiles color-coded from enemies which share your present color. This may sound simple on paper, but the game is a bullet hell with little tolerance for failure. Staying alive is a constant struggle and requires unfaltering attention as well as considerable ability to sort out visual noise, so this isn't a good choice for those in the mood for an easy play. Those familiar with Treasure will know that their games are often incredibly simple yet exceedingly difficult and often expect complete mastery of mechanics to progress; Ikaruga certainly carries on the tradition. The game rewards several different approaches to play and has a bevy of settings, providing replay value in droves.\n\nThose who do well enough may find themselves butting heads with a certain stony foe from a previous Treasure game...\n\nVisual and sound design are stellar, with compelling enemy designs and an excellently composed score by composer Hiroshi Iuchi. The spartan black and white design motifs further emphasize (and almost feel like an extention of) the game's mechanics, and the music certainly makes me feel like the last survivor of a botched rebellion going solo against an empire with the power of a god behind it.\n\nAll-in-all, Ikaruga's not going to be everyone's cup of tea since it's an incredibly hectic game, but I feel it's immaculately constructed and that any shmup junkie who hasn't yet ought to take it for a spin.

Games period. Not just arcade games or shooters.\n\nThis is a really unique, artistically powerful and surreal experience to look at and play, and ranks up there easily with your Zeldas, your Final Fantasies and your ICOs in terms of impactful Japanese videogame art.\n\nIt also represents, if not the first, one of the first fully functional, recognisable polarity switching bullet systems in shooters. Personally I feel that the system does render the game marmite-style, in that it adds an extra layer of stuff to think about in a genre where you've normally got 240 different 'things to think about' coming at you at breakneck speed and that'll straight up drive some people insane, but back at it's original release, this game pioneered that mechanic.\n\nFundamentally, I think this game has been surpassed historically now, certainly in terms of fun and playability. This is a game designed to be gradually learned, not picked up and played, and the developer Treasure are notorious for difficulty and awkward complexities within simple genres (beaten Alien Soldier or Gunstar Future Heroes? No? Me neither...), and Ikaruga is no different. To me, you can feel that this game is nearly 15 or so years old not in it's look which is still remarkably fresh and unique, but in the feel of the gameplay. Newer shooters are faster, more responsive and universally easier to actually play well.\n\nIkaruga will punish you mercilessly for getting things wrong. Pick the wrong polarity at any given moment and you will die instantly, respawning in the wrong colour straight into the same bullet curtain that just killed you. Press the swap polarity button a fraction of a second too late and you'll be torn to shreds during the agonisingly 'just. too. slow.' polarity swap animation.\n\nIt also won't let you record any kind of highscore, local or global, unless you play with only 3 lives and no continues. Download the demo and you'll see how utterly cruel a yardstick that is.\n\nFundamentally, if you're looking for any kind of easy ride, or a soft entry point into the genre, buy something else.\n\nThis is a game that entices you in with stunning artwork, amazing sound and a genuinely atmospheric world, and then tackles you to the floor and beats the living daylights out of you. It demands respect, and it is sometimes the complete polar opposite of fun to play because of it's insanely steep learning curve.\n\nBecause of that, I really recommend firmly downloading the demo and playing it over and over until you're sure you enjoy the game. At it's core, this is a mean, vicious, downright insane game that will troll you at every turn, BUT, it is, much like all the best difficult games, very rewarding when you do start to get the hang of it.\n\nAnd dear god, it's gorgeous.

Flawless controls, top notch unique designs and oozing character from every bullet-ridden pore. If more shmups were this good the genre would be a lot more than an almost forgotten relic from arcade days past and a playground for uncreative indie developers (sorry guys, everybody and their moms can make a generic shmup).\n\nIkaruga owes a lot to its grandfather \"Space Invaders\", like any other vertical-scrolling shooter but cleverly subverts the basic concept by giving you a colour-switching mechanic: red/black bullets only hurt you when you are white/blue and vice versa. However if you think this will make the game easy you are mistaken. The screen is filled with artful patterns of red and blue that will give you an intense challenge and plenty of replay value, because you will die and die a lot. There are no power-ups, no shields, just a super shot that fills up by collecting bullets which quickly becomes necessary to survive at all. Get hit once and you are dead of course. The gameplay offers more layers of complexity and challenge when you want to go for the big points. Shooting 3 enemies of one colour in a row will chain your points together. Skillful players can continue this chain from beginning to end of each level, although at first it might seem impossible to newcomers.\n\nThe game can be a bit bare bones if you are not a shoot em up fan with only 5 levels in total, but these blow pretty much the whole competition out of the water. The steam port also offers crisp HD graphics, a selection of unlockable artworks and an incredibly well-made leaderboard section. You can quickly download every playthrough from other players and thus learn how to survive this one of a kind bullet hell extravaganza.\n\nDeveloper support is also great. I bought Ikaruga when it was first released and at first it wasn't possible to play offline or on older Windows XP systems (which were at the end of their lifespan but still supported) as promised on the store page, both were patched in a matter of days by the developers who genuinely want to give players a good experience.\n\nAll in all one of my best purchases on steam. Ikaruga was worth the 9000Yen I paid back in the day on dreamcast, at this price it is a steal.", "timestamp_created": 1423069634, "timestamp_updated": 1423069634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14220570": {"recommendationid": "14220570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998325280", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486072211}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game with a beautiful soundtrack and pixel-perfect controls.

it's glory, with updated HD graphics and achievements!\nPlay solo or local co-op on any of the three difficulties through five challenging levels!\nSwitch your ship's polarity at will to absorb that

Unless you enable Free Play, of course.

However, as with the XBLA version, any deviation from the game's default settings renders high scores invalid, although unlike the XBLA port, achievements can still be earned. As someone who is a fan of bullet-hell but by no means a god, this is a little frustrating as it would have been nice if the game had local hi-scores independent of the game settings and online leaderboards.\n\nAs for the game itself, it remains unchanged. Dodge the opposite-coloured bullets while absorbing the same-coloured ones. This adds a real element of strategy to the game and makes for some truly daunting bullet patterns. Add in the chaining mechanic, where destroying only enemies of a single colour result in massive points bonuses and you'll find yourself dying a lot - partly because of the mind-bending difficulty and partly because of human greed, but crucially, you'll always blame yourself, not the game.\n\nIf you like your scrolling shooters with a bit of thought to them, you can't go far wrong with this.

Stattdessen legt man zwischendurch immer wieder Spielesessions ein. Diese Form von Review spiegelt mein pers\u00f6nliches Erlebnis besser wider und eignet sich ferner sehr gut, um den Spa\u00df und (eventuell) auch den Frust des Spieles darzustellen.\n\nVorweg dennoch ein paar grundlegende Dinge zur Spielmechanik:\nIkaruga ist schwer. Nicht schwer im Sinne von \"ich muss immer wieder zum letzten Checkpoint zur\u00fcck\", sondern vielmehr \"ein Treffer - ein Leben weg. Drei Leben weg - Game Over\". Dieses Spiel macht keine halben Sachen, sondern zeigt dem Spieler von Anfang an, wer hier wen kontrolliert. Dennoch bleibt es bei all der Action fair. Jeden Tod hat sich der Spieler selbst zuzuschreiben. Man lernt schnell aus seinen Fehlern, wird besser und kommt immer ein St\u00fcck weiter, bis man irgendwann Level 1 hinter sich gebracht hat. Erfreulicherweise kann man von da an direkt im zweiten Level starten, wodurch der extrem hohe Schwierigkeitsgrad eher motiviert als abschreckt.\nDie Mechanik mit den beiden verschiedenen Schildarten funktioniert tadellos. Der wei\u00dfe Schild absorbiert helle Gschosse des Gegners, der schwarze Schild dementsprechend dunkle. Man wechselt also st\u00e4ndig zwischen beiden Schilden, um Treffer zu vermeiden und mit dem Absorbieren seine Spezialwaffe aufzuladen. Besonders die Bossk\u00e4mpfe werden durch diese Mechanik spannend und taktisch.\nAbgesehen davon handelt es sich um einen klassischen Vertical Shooter, dem leider die Power Ups fehlen (in der Hinsicht machen es Klassiker wie Gradius und R-Type besser). Dennoch bringt Ikaruga eine Menge Freude: Anfangs habe ich gelacht \u00fcber den abnormalen Schwierigkeitsgrad, sp\u00e4ter kam die Genugtuung nach jedem beendeten Level hinzu.\nSpieler mit einer geringen Geduldsspanne sollten die Finger von diesem Spiel lassen, aber wer das Genre mag und endlich mal wieder richtig gefordert werden m\u00f6chte, der greift hier bedenkenlos zu.\n\n\nSession 1 - Das Kennenlernen:\nVersuch 1: Spiel auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad \"Easy\"gestartet, 3 Minuten sp\u00e4ter kam der Game-Over-Screen. Dennoch habe ich schon jetzt einen Heidenspa\u00df, weil mir das Spiel das Gef\u00fchl gibt, dass ich weiter kommen kann als zuvor, wenn ich lerne, es zu spielen.\nVersuch 2: Diesmal habe ich ein wenig l\u00e4nger durchgehalten. Game-Over-Screen kam trotzdem nach wenigen Minuten.\nVersuch 3: Ist das der Boss des ersten Levels? Ich lerne sein Muster, aber leider nicht schnell genug. Game Over\nVersuch 4: Es ist/war der Boss! Level 1 geschafft. Nach einem kurzen Blick auf Level 2 war's das aber auch wieder ^^\nFazit: Ich bin \u00fcberw\u00e4tigt, wie viel Spa\u00df das Spiel trotz hohem Schwieirgkeitsgrad macht.\n\nSession 2 - Erfolg \"Dot Eater\":\nVersuch 1: Bis zum Endboss keinen Schuss abgegeben, aber auch schon 2 der 3 Leben verloren. Beim Boss den Spezialschuss benutzt und zu sp\u00e4t festgestellt, dass auch dieser f\u00fcr den Erfolg verboten ist.\nVersuch 2: Erneut mit nur einem Leben beim Boss angekommen. Spannender Kampf, den er leider gewonnen hat.\nVersuch 3: Erneut mit nur einem Leben zum Boss gekommen. Diesmal habe ich lange genug durchgehalten und er ist abgehauen.\nFazit: Achievement bekommen und weiterhin viel Spa\u00df dabei gehabt.", "timestamp_created": 1417212046, "timestamp_updated": 1417218304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641532", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13121438": {"recommendationid": "13121438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028363418", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498252191}, "language": "english", "review": "Harder than a priest in a playground.\nBeautiful and fun as hell though.", "timestamp_created": 1417181769, "timestamp_updated": 1417181769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13103121": {"recommendationid": "13103121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135269571", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451651596}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u96be\u7684STG\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u91cc\u5ff5\u4e66\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u73a9\u5f88\u591a\u7684STG\u3002\u5728\u8857\u673a\u5385\u6253\u7684\u6591\u9e20\uff0cEasy\u6700\u8fdc\u6253\u52304\u9762....\n\n\u73b0\u5728PC\u4e0a\u6709\u4e86\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u901a\u4e00\u6b21\u5b8c\u6210\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u5fc3\u613f\n---------------------------\n\n\u987a\u4fbf\u8fd9\u4e2aPC\u79fb\u690d\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u8bda\u610f\uff0c\u52a0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u4e91\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u5f55\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u5361\u6709\u6210\u5c31\uff08\u5f53\u7136\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff09\u3002\n---------------------------\n\n2015 Feb Easy\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u76ee\u6807", "timestamp_created": 1417085564, "timestamp_updated": 1423478162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526494", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13090339": {"recommendationid": "13090339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165063939", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418082837}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "It's a really difficult game, but a must if you like shmups", "timestamp_created": 1417017479, "timestamp_updated": 1417017479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13022789": {"recommendationid": "13022789", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969403127", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484888147}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 - the definitive top-down shooter.", "timestamp_created": 1416535839, "timestamp_updated": 1416535839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505950", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13014664": {"recommendationid": "13014664", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972273179", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "last_played": 1516403260}, "language": "english", "review": "Flip between two modes to absorb the corresponding coloured bullets; it's a straight-forward concept which has been executed to perfection.

I think Ikaruga is overrated in terms of bullet hells with a mechanic not everyone can wrap their head around. With how complex the game can be you're probably better off playing less mecahnically difficult games like Crimzon Clover, Jamestown or even Touhou.\n\nBut with that said as a game by Treasure it is fantastic, definitly one of their best. Like I said before the mechanic of switching between white and black to absorb bullets and deal double damage to an opposite coloured ship is really complex and the most devoted player can do an insane amount of things with it.\n\nThe soundtrack for the most part is fitting to the mood but can be really grand at many points. Graphically I'd say is still the same as it looked on the Dreamcast, Gamecube and original Arcade though a lot more cleaner. This isn't really an issue as the games style still looks really nice even though most of the time it's dodging black and white bullets.\n\nDifficulty is what you expect from Treasure with this game probably ranking close to that of Alien Soldiers type of difficulty which is another Treasure game that's ball bustingly hard.\n\nOverall Ikaruga is definitly a fantastic game that I think is worth it to those who want to devote time to learn the tricks and patterns the game has to offer. However if you want this as your first bullet hell I would recommend finding one that's a little more beginner friendly before trying this game out.

During the game the player will encounter enemies of either one of these polarities, and will soon notice that they may inflict more damage upon enemies if they are of the opposite polarity. Likewise if players are shot by a projectile of the opposite polarity they will die.\n\nAs you can imagine things get a little tougher as you progress through the game, however it's here that the many intricacies of Ikaruga's combination of style and gameplay become apparent. For instance one should bear in mind that it can actually become more difficult to play on Easy difficulty than it is to play on Normal, for on Easy the enemies do not fire any bullets for the player to absorb. Absorbtion of bullets not only add more points to the player's total, but also allows for a super attack that can clear a set number of enemies (depending on the level of the superbar prior to its unleashing and on the polarity of the player and enemies). \n\nLeading on from this one of the most important parts of the game is its 'chain' system which might sound simple enough, but which offers a great deal of challenge from the offset should the player choose. This core aspect centers on shooting down three enemies of the same polarity to create a chain, which adds a multiplier depending on how long the player can keep it up. This invariably leads to players frantically switching during the course of play in order to accumulate points, to not get hit and to maintain that all important multiplier. \n\nWith experience the player can calculate the exact number of enemies that may be dispatched with their super move depending on the level of their superbar, and this is important so that players who are striving for higher points do not accidentally destroy more enemies with the super move than they intend to - thereby possibly ruining the chain multiplier. It gets a lot more intricate than that, but this is where the amazing fun and challenge derives.\n\nA typical Treasure trait is to also incorporate epic boss fights and while it may not be on the same awe-inspiring level as those found in Radiant Silvergun, they do offer a worthy and interesting challenge. As an intersting sidenote, Blizzard later incoporated Ikaruga's polarity mechanic in their Twin Val'kyr boss encounter (which was part of the Trial of The Crusader raid instance), and I feel this is testament to the type of challenges that can be offered by a relatively simple gameplay mechanic.\n\nIn conclusion then Ikaruga is a truly amazing game because it introduces a relatively simple idea for any player to easily pick up, but which at the same time offers many intricacies and challenges for those willing to delve a little further.", "timestamp_created": 1404995040, "timestamp_updated": 1405009008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11150148": {"recommendationid": "11150148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080515741", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484213925}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucf58\uc194 \uc288\ud305 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uba85\uc791....\ucbe4 \ub420 \uac83 \uac19\uc544\uc694. \uc288\ud305 \uac8c\uc784 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2e0\ub2e4\uba74 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \ud574 \ubcf4\uc154\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \ubab0\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc88b\uc544\uc694. \uc800\ub294 \ubb34\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc\uc694......", "timestamp_created": 1404911301, "timestamp_updated": 1404911301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11142340": {"recommendationid": "11142340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027915751", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485320440}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the greatest shmups of all time, from the masters of the shmup, Treasure.

In fact, it's my main genre of choice when talking favourites. After a while shmups all start to look and feel the same, and they become very predictable as you can often carry over tactics from one shmup to the next. Ikaruga, however, caught me by surprise.\n\nIn this shooter, not only are your reflexes put to the test, but so is your brain. Ikaruga is a genius mix of puzzle and action, where touching bullets is ok, in fact, encouraged in order to score high.\n\nEnemies fire black and white bullets, and your ship can change between black and white. If your ship is white, touching a white bullet will absorb it and store its energy in a reserve which you may expend on a large blast that eliminates a large number of enemies on the screen at once. Same goes for when your ship is black and you touch a black bullet. However, touching a bullet of the opposite colour means the destruction of your ship and a loss of a life. Scoring is done by shooting enemies of the same colour in threes, so three whites or three blacks in a row will earn you a point on your chain counter. Breaking the combo with an enemy of the opposite colour destroys your chain and will hinder your score greatly, making the player carefully pick their targets and the best path through the stages, balancing risk and reward.\n\nNow, take that concept and imagine it in one of the craziest bullet hell shooters you've seen. You get a frantic puzzle action game that will confuse your brain so hard and push your mental capacity to its limits!! It's pretty much one of the greatest game concepts of all time, and its execution is absolutely spot on! With its three difficulty settings, even players new to the genre can appreciate this one given some time to learn the mechanics, while the veterans to the genre will appreciate the higher difficulty settings and get plenty of hours worth of game time before they get to see the ending.\n\nIf great gameplay isn't enough, then just know that the game's aethestics are absolutely top tier. Even my friends who generally dislike arcade games are in awe at this title. This game is ridiculously artistic, featuring poetry in between stages, a musical score that while not upbeat, fits PERFECTLY to the mood the game is trying to convey, and some of the most creative stages and bosses I've ever seen in a game. The colour changing mechanic doesn't only apply to the gameplay, but the entire game itself embraces it. Ikaruga oozes with style, and has a way to make you feel emotions while playing. After completing the game for my first time I remember staring at the screen in awe, reflecting on everything that just happened and thinking about all the events that occured all throughout the game. I even shed a tear or two...\n\nPeople argue that video games are art. This game is the perfect rebuttal to any doubts.\n\nBuy it.\n\nNow.", "timestamp_created": 1404478049, "timestamp_updated": 1404478473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11066780": {"recommendationid": "11066780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065682531", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513001224}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u901a\u3057\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u306eSE\u542b\u3081\u3066\u306e\u66f2\u5168\u90e8\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u958b\u653e\u5408\u6226\u304c\u6c7a\u307e\u308b\u3068\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u826f\u3044\u306e\u3060\u3088\n\n\u767d\u3068\u9ed2\u306e\u5c5e\u6027\u53cd\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3001\u5c04\u6483\u3092\u6f5c\u308a\u629c\u3051\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306e\u3082\u3081\u305a\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "timestamp_created": 1404476260, "timestamp_updated": 1404476260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11050484": {"recommendationid": "11050484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005618449", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499316111}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc9c5", "timestamp_created": 1404398196, "timestamp_updated": 1404398196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11014446": {"recommendationid": "11014446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004310333", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427696509}, "language": "english", "review": "Faithful to the prior versions of the game.

What makes Ikaruga stand out compared to other Danmaku shooters is that it has a polarity system that allows the player to change their ship to black and white. When you are in white polarity the player can absorb white bullets and deal more damage to black polarity enemies. If you're ship is black polarity you can absorb black bullets and deal more damage to white polarity enemies. The game also features a complex scoring system called chaining. To get a chain you must shoot 3 enemies of the same polairty, if at any point you shoot a different colored enemy without completing a chain it will be broken and the chain multiplier will reset. While this isn't important for survival breaking your chain is detrimental to achieving high scores. \n\nIkaruga as it is an arcade game isn't very story driven. However, the player assumes the role of a Tenkaku Pilot name Shinra who is nearly killed when his ship is shot down by an enemy force called the Horai. Shinra's plane crashes near a small village named Ikaruga. Being the sole survivor of his squadron he is pulled from the wreckage and nursed back to health. After Shinra was nursed back to health Shinra pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a top-secret fighter plane that they had constructed called the Ikaruga. The Ikaruga was no ordinary ship, it was the only ship of it's kind to integrate both energy polarities and being capable to interchangably change polarities of the Horai ships. \n\nHaving over 100 hours of experience with this game spanning across the Dreamcast, Gamecube, and Xbox 360 versions the PC Ikaruga port is without a doubt the definitive version of the game. The game has never looked soo clean with HD visuals and Anti-Aliasing, It has also fixed the issues the Xbox 360 version of the game had as well. If you've never played this game before and want something challenging that has high-replay value this is the game for you. If you're someone who likes to credit feed a game and once they're done never go back to it then I can't recommend this game as it is only 5 stages long and if you credit feed through the game it can easily be beaten in 30 minutes.\n\n*update*\n\nGames is on sale for $4.99 pick it up while it's cheap", "timestamp_created": 1404074582, "timestamp_updated": 1479946414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498150", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10951342": {"recommendationid": "10951342", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998421866", "num_games_owned": 770, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497207366}, "language": "english", "review": "HOLY SHIT", "timestamp_created": 1404071034, "timestamp_updated": 1404071034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10949295": {"recommendationid": "10949295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016305201", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444227430}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]I am not alive, thus I can't die. I won't give up even if my Ideal isn't fulfilled.\nMy will, just as my regrets, won't ever end.\nMy comrades... it is time.[/i]\n\nIkaruga, developed by a core team of five people at Treasure with some outside help from G.rev, took the setting and foundations of Radiant Silvergun and mixed in the polarity mechanic from Silhouette Mirage thus creating one of the most marvelous shooters in recent times. Words simply cannot express why this game is such a masterpiece, but I guess I can try.\n\nIkaruga is a bullet hell shoot 'em up coloquially known as \"danmaku\", you may be familiar with the genre by other popular series like Touhou but this is more among the lines of CAVE's DoDonPachi or Mushihimesama. Your ship has two polarities and can switch at will, only bullets of the opposite polarity can kill you while same polarity bullets can be absorbed to charge up your homing laser. This simple polarity mechanic adds a whole new layer of depth to a game where you would usually shoot everything and try not to die as the \"Dot Eater\" strategy becomes viable in where you just absorb same polarity bullets and retaliate with your homing laser. Not only that but stages make deliberate use of this mechanic in their design adding a puzzle element to it, where switching polarities according to the hazards becomes a necessity. There's also the chaining mechanic in which killing three enemies of the same polarity awards a \"Chain\" and keeping the chain up nets you BIG scores. Shmuppers and 1CCers will have a grand old time looking how to score high in here while some may pull their hairs hearing \"1 CHAIN, 2 CHAIN, 3 CH- 1 CHAIN, 1 CHAIN\". Reminder: this IS a Treasure game after all so expect the difficulty to be close to masochist levels at times, mostly seen in later stages. The Steam version follows the NESICAxLive version so it's up to date and fixed most of the bugs present in the XBLA version, not to mention that Treasure has been doing a good job in keeping the game updated so far with a Gallery Mode having been recently added at the time of this edit. \n\nGraphically, the game isn't all that impressive but it looks damn good despite it's low technical level of graphic quality. The artwork, on the other hand looks absolutely fantastic with illustrations by Yasushi Suzuki's beautiful choice of coloring and hand painted style. These illustrations are ones I'd love to have hanging as posters on my wall. The real winner here is the soundtrack though, although with limited instrumentation and reusing the same melody motif in most songs composer and director Hiroshi Iuchi has managed to make each song convey a different feeling that is coreographed to match the situation of every stage and it's absolutely glorious. You might already be familiar with \"Butsutekkai\", the boss theme if you've played I Wanna Be The Guy.\n\nOh yeah, there IS a rather cryptic plot explained in manuals and extra material. It's a bit good but mostly nonsensical and has strong ties with Radiant Silvergun's plot since the final enemy is the same as it is heavily implied that Ikaruga and Radiant Silvergun universes are one and the same.\n\nIn the end, Ikaruga is simply a MUST PLAY for anyone. Even if you're not a fan of the genre it should become pretty clear that this game is truly one of the best games ever conceived. I eagerly await more Treasure games in Steam (so how about that PC-exclusive sidescroller you mentioned Treasure?)\n\n[i]Until the day water droplets bore the stone... our path will be fraught with perils...[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1404067540, "timestamp_updated": 1428535417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10949204": {"recommendationid": "10949204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013694010", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465646708}, "language": "english", "review": "15 years on and Ikruga remains one of the best games I've ever played.

I didn't even know Ikaruga existed until I played a Mega Man online flash game that featured the same polarity system. Afterwards I found out what was the origin of the polarity system that was in this flash game, and thats when I discovered Ikaruga.\n\nTo this day, I still don't know what makes Ikaruga such a awesome hidden gem that everyone should play at least once in their life. Is it the polarity system that gives a unique twist to the genre? Is it the challenging \"Bullet Hell\" difficulty that frustrates (in a good way) even the most hardcore of gamers? What is it about this game that makes players want to double play (One person controlling both player ships) until they can S-rank it with ease? Is it the music? The speed? The fact that it's made by Treasure whose past works include \"Gunstar Heroes\" and \"Alien Soldier?\"\n\nI probably will never know the answer as to why I keep replaying the first level to try to improve my chain bonus and better my high score before I move on and repeat the process for level 2. What I do know is this: This is a game that requires (a lot of) time and devotion from players before they can truly appriciate it. Ikaruga's fast pace and increasingly hard level design may lose the interest of gamers, but somehow it motivates them to keep pressing onward towards beating all 5 levels (yes, 5 levels may seem small, but it is a matter of quality over quantity that makes it worth the money.) And when you got a friend playing alongside you, it is just as challenging as if you were going at it alone.\n\nI am very happy to see Treasure listening to its fans and porting Ikaruga on Steam with all kinds of features and giving it the HD treatment.

I will probably never beat it but even attempting the first 2 levels over and over again has been more fun than you'd expect. \n\nIt's a bullet hell (meaning there is a ton of bullets on screen and you're expected to dodge them all) but mixed with a polarity-swapping technique. Enemies are of 2 colors, and you have the ability to be 1 of the 2 colors at a time. You absorb bullets of the same polarity and die to bullets of the opposite. You shoot the same color as your polarity, and shooting enemies with matching polarity does double damage. Shooting the correct polarity across multiple enemies rewards you with a chain, which leads to a higher score (which is the point of this game). \n\nIt's one of the hardest games I've played, and this is supposedly not even nearly as hard as other games in the genre. If you like a challenge you will certainly find it in this game. I don't think anyone with any amount of gaming experience can just pick up this game and get to level 5 even within a few days. It takes lots of practice and memorization and on top of all that perfect execution to proceed through the entirety of the game. \n\nThe level design is basically art. It's amazing how they've used the polarity technique to actually generate level obstacles that, in tandem with the spawning enemies, create an entire level that you're expected to dodge and blow up while maintaining a combo and getting the highest score possible. You can tell a lot of work went into the precise timings and enemy types of enemy spawns. The bosses are very unique and well designed as well. You almost never feel like they've repeated anything in the game. Every 5 seconds you're facing something new. \n\nThis game is easily a 9/10, more or less depending on your individual taste for bullet hells.", "timestamp_created": 1403956012, "timestamp_updated": 1403956012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503776", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10883936": {"recommendationid": "10883936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065777431", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452143161}, "language": "english", "review": "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! makes dark soul 2 looks like a easy game.....", "timestamp_created": 1403902363, "timestamp_updated": 1403902363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10878776": {"recommendationid": "10878776", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998593778", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473305525}, "language": "english", "review": "Hold onto your butts kids, because this game will take you on a wild ride.", "timestamp_created": 1403892776, "timestamp_updated": 1403892776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10874520": {"recommendationid": "10874520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024804833", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403644293}, "language": "french", "review": "Shoot tr\u00e8s int\u00e9resant, le concept est \u00e0 la fois original et efficace.

At first I treated it like any other shooter before I even started learning how to chain combos properly.

I've spent countless hours on the GameCube version of the game and the PC port holds up well. When you get into the groove of the polarity switching and memorize enemy patterns there really is no limit to what you can do next to improve your score. \n\nWhat kept me playing is i never felt like I\u2019ve hit a plateau in what kind of score i could achieve, there is always positive reinforcement to keep playing because you can see what the guy ahead of you on the leaderboard has done... don't go way above your means and watch the number 1 player and think I\u2019ll never be able to do that... watch the guy who's only 2 million points ahead of you and mimic the style he's using... you'll quickly learn that the game that's touted as \"impossibly hard\", is actually very doable to get a high score. \n\nI recommend giving it a fair chance turn the BGM off and play some of your own chillout tunes and enter the meditation that is Ikaruga. \n\nPros\n-very forgiving hitbox often times you feel like \"how did i just survive that?!\", rather than \"oh man how did i die there!?\"\n-mesmerizingly intelligent level scripting. \n-addictive\n-intuitive design\n-perfect integration of the Microsoft controller,  and also very good response when linking a ps3 controller via 3rd party apps. \n\nCons\n-no longer has slow mo, and training that was included in the GameCube release.\n", "timestamp_created": 1403315773, "timestamp_updated": 1403315773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518593", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10589796": {"recommendationid": "10589796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074355010", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504801991}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Fun and quite challenging.

If you're looking for a review about Ikaruga as a game, look elsewhere, there are mountains of praise and critique written about this game throughout the 13 years it has existed on this planet.\n\nThe Steam version is essentially the X360 (and NESiCAxLIVE) version with a few tweaks. You get HD graphics, online leaderboards, downloadable replays, etc. Some of the timing issues that the X360 version had have been fixed here, making this version a LOT more accurate to the NAOMI/Dreamcast verion. In the DC version, I listen to musical cues to know when to burst, change, etc. Couldn't do that in the X360 version.\n\nTreasure decided to enhance the HUD a little bit here. Now, you have a counter showing you how much burst energy you have, and the score is divided with commas. Both of these enhancements are quite welcome, I've found myself using the burst energy counter quite a few times, and commas plus big numbers are never a bad thing.\n\nOne thing I'm quite angry about that Treasure could've easily added here, is the lack of a quick restart option. Just like the X360 version, if you're practicing a stage and want to restart because you messed up, you have to quit the stage, go back to the main menu, and reselect the stage all over again. It doesn't help that the game mode select screen uses these \"cinematic\" transitions which only adds more unnecessary time to a practice session. It would be nice if Treasure could add a restart option to the pause menu. Or better yet, bring back the Conquest mode from the Gamecube version!\n\nAlso, like the X360 version, you can't practice the very last boss, wherein you have to dodge some very complex patterns for 60 seconds. Way to alienate the new generations of players who might want to become masters at this game, Treasure.\n\nThese practice-related complaints aside, overall this version is a very nice packaging of a wonderful game. I applaud Yasushi Suzuki for coming back after 13+ years and adding some brand-new artwork for the main menu. The presentation far outdoes the X360 version (if you can't tell, I quite detest the X360 version).\n\nAs a player who has a lot of experience with the older versions, should you buy this version of Ikaruga? Even though I've memorized basically every pixel movement with the Dreamcast version, I certainly don't regret buying this version. It's been fun seeing how high I can get on the global leaderboard (I'm a bit rusty, yet I'm already in the top 80), plus I kinda like the idea that my Steam friends can see my achievements and know what an ELITE SHMUP PLAYER I am. =P Also, I only have the stock controllers for my Dreamcast, so this is the first time I've been able to use an arcade stick with this game. Now, I can feel extra confident about kicking this game's butt in a real Japanese arcade.\n\nAs for new players? Just try out the demo, or read one of the thousands of reviews that are out there. Just know that there are very strong, opposing opinions about this game, inside and outside of the shmup community.

because i can't recommend it. it's a good and solid game, it really is. but from the perspective from someone who plays mostly adventure point & click and puzzle games. this game was very alien and inaccessible to me, and chances are, that if you are like me you will feel the same. the thing is: i've played a bullethell game before, danmaku unlimited. now that game was good, not only because it was a solid schmup, but because it was very accessible to bullethell beginners. ikaruga is definitly not that, the game is ridiculously hard even on easy free play mode. maybe not to someone that has good twitch skills, but in my case it was simply too hard. also there is no upgrade system, customization or anything like that to keep you intrested. the game just consists of 1. start the game 2. do your best 3. die horribly 4. repeat. basicly that classic arcade score attack setup that i've never really been very fond of. and when you have died enough times and actually gotten good at the game, that is when you can actually complete it. but i do not have the time or patience to grind up my muscle memory. it just starts to feel more like a finger work out than me actually having fun.\n\nTL;DR: Recommended if you're a bullethell machosist, otherwise stay away because this game is not kind to beginners.", "timestamp_created": 1399013077, "timestamp_updated": 1399013277,

Confirm the quality of the port, Ikaruga is a simple game without complex scripting and complex console-controls that'd bring about catastrophic disaster in a port job.\n\n2.) Confirm that this game is balls to the walls and that I am a little nancy that needs to harden the fuck up and git gud, again.\n\nThe bad ass soundtrack, the stylized visuals, the imaginative polarity switching, the no bullshit action? It's all intact in Ikaruga.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with Ikaruga, follow me, my people, into a wonderful world. Ikaruga is a simple game. It has no frills, no fancy scripted cutscenes, just pure action. Ikaruga is a great example of a shoot'em up, or shmup, for most people. It isn't bullet-hell bullshit, but it isn't easy just as a shmup should be. Its difficulty is pretty high but isn't a false difficulty erected by unfair mechanics and super AI. The game's gimmick is the polarity switch; by changing colors from dark to light, your ship will not only become immune to the similarly colored attacks, but also absorb them for your super homing attack. You utilize the polarity switch to jump into the safety of the correctly colored enemy fire, absorb their attacks, then unleash hell.\n\nThis game is awesome.

Maneuver your ship to avoid bullet spreads, while cutting through wave after wave of grunts, to eventually make your way to the boss. Pretty cut and dry, as far as concept goes, right? Wrong.\n\nAlthough it definitely sticks to the mechanics laid down by its predecessors, Ikaruga lays down its own twist, through the bullets themselves. There are two differently colored ships shooting correspondingly colored bullets at you in the game, black and white, and this is where it gets interesting. The color of your ship can be changed from black to white on the fly with the press of a button, to match either of the incoming bullets, and as long as your ship matches the color of the bullet hitting you, you will absorb it into an energy meter to release later as an energy blast upon your unsuspecting enemies. Touch the opposite color bullet of yourself, and you die. Shooting chains of the same colored enemy helps build up your score faster. On top of this, shooting an enemy with a bullet that is the opposite color of them, does more damage, and thereby allows you to plow through them faster.\n\nEasy enough, right? Well it would be if this wasn't a bullet hell.\n\nEven on the easiest setting, this game provides a challenge, having you dodge varying patterns of enemy waves, the occasional obstacle thrown in your path, and of course the ever present swarms of multicolored bullets being peppered at you from all over.\n\nThe game includes a replay system, and leaderboards (I'm not sure if they're only local or across the internet, haven't checked it yet), and is currently here on steam for $9.99.\n\nExpectations aside, I would give this game an 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1395912034, "timestamp_updated": 1395912034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9637606": {"recommendationid": "9637606", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990823767", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498251878}, "language": "english", "review": "I never owned a GameCube or an Xbox, but had heard this game's reputation though various mediums as an excellent and extremely tough shmup (shoot-em-up for those who don't know).

So when this came onto Steam, an immediate purchase was carried out!\n  And it doesn't disappoint. The 'polarity-switching' mechanic is an incredibly simple idea, but it works really well. And the difficulty immediately manifests itself from the beginning (speaking from experience as I have died at least twice before level 1 even started!). Thankfully, the ability to change the keyboard settings is much appreciated, so a comfy gamer position can be assumed before the game completely stomps you! There may only be 5 levels, but each one will take many, MANY attempts to get past.

That being said, you need to use a 360 controller emulator in order to make the game even recognize a different type of controller as the mouse and keyboard approach is odd for this type of game.

I'm the type of guy who bumps up the difficulty on a game I've never played before because it wont be fun otherwise, who tries for 100% completion on the harder difficulty and the most backbreaking tasks. If there's on thing that you have to know, is that this game is hard. I'm sorry, I'm understating it. It is difficult. Unyielding. Strenuous. It is harder than trying to teach your mother how to use a computer (or mine at least). When I first started this game, I was placed balls deep in the most hectic and brvtal experience of my whole gaming career, even more so than Dark Souls. There are five levels in this game, and in the four years that I've owned this game, I have never beat level three. On easy.\n\nI don't mean to deter you by talking about how difficult this is. If you don't like difficult games, then this is definitely not the game for you. But the thing is, I enjoy twitching my thumbs and smashing my keyboard while I play this. It's not difficult in the sense that it's cheating, but that the game mechanics are so cleverly put that you need to gain an ultimate mastery of it. In the screenshots you see of the game, it may seem like all hell is breaking loose and you'll have no idea what's going on, but in reality you do. This is an easy to learn hard to master game, and game that is on the top of my wishlist now that it's been ported to PC.\n\nSo how does the game work? You pilot a ship, and the whole game is built around it's ability to change 'polarities'. It can be either negative or positive, red and blue correspondingly. When you're negative, you fire negative bullets, and so forth. The enemies also work like this, with the grunts being locked in one polarity and the bosses being able to switch. Now at practically all times, the screen is full of red and blue bullets, lasers, missiles, anything. There's no way you can avoid them all, and that's where polarities come in. When you are in a negative polarity, you're immune to negative fire, and vice versa. This idea, this game mechanic opens up for one of the most creative gaming experiences I've ever played.\n\nWant to continue reading for a more in depth review?

If you like oldschool games and ever owned a Dreamcast, Gamecube, or Xbox 360, than you've probably heard of this one.\n\nIkaruga's main twist is the polarity system, in which all bullets come in two colors, and your ship can switch between the two colors at will. You die from opposite colored bullets and power up from same colored bullets, as well as deal extra damage to enemies of the opposite color. It's very simple but is a really cool system that adds a lot of depth to the game.\n\nThe other thing of note about Ikaruga, is that it's a very methodical \"puzzle shooter\" type game. It's very static, and enemies and patterns are often arranged in such a way as to seem like a puzzle to \"figure out\" and deal with correctly. For this reason Ikaruga very much prioritizes pure execution over reflexes. \n\nHowever, even if you're the type of person who prefers games that force reaction and improvisation over static paths and execution (as I count myself), you should still be able to enjoy Ikaruga because...well, it's a damn fun game. The level designs and enemies are varied and creative, the bosses are epic, the pacing is tight, the scoring is deep, and the presentation and music would be worth playing the game for alone.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a must play for fans of shmups and 2d games in general. It might not be your favorite shmup ever depending on your tastes and preferences in gameplay design, but it's an excellent game that's well worth experiencing.", "timestamp_created": 1394404504, "timestamp_updated": 1394432918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9402731": {"recommendationid": "9402731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031782785", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442176446}, "language": "italian", "review": "Avevo la verisone per game cube il gioco e' spettacolare, rivederlo su steam non solo mi ha fatto\npiacere ma e' stata anche una sorpresa. lo consiglio a tutti con una sola parola Epico !!!!", "timestamp_created": 1394395968, "timestamp_updated": 1394395968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9402228": {"recommendationid": "9402228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043544855", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458457916}, "language": "english", "review": "this game gets me sweaty", "timestamp_created": 1394393570, "timestamp_updated": 1394393570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9398695": {"recommendationid": "9398695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978794644", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446646093}, "language": "english", "review": "This game seems like it want's to be Raiden, but playing with a mouse and keyboard is EXTREMELY aggravating.

You can destroy each units by 3 of the same colors in a row, creating Chains, and they'll boost your score dramatically. The game features 5 levels, but don't let that fool you into thinking that's all there is to it, because boy would you be in for a sheer challenge. No joke; this game is excruciatingly tough, converts simplicity into complexity when using the black-and-white concept, and somehow still works really well in the level design and sequence of everything the player goes through.\n\nIt's an enjoyable vertical-scrolling shmup game, but if this is the game you'd start on for the genre, you're in for a very harsh but uniquely incredible treat. My cons are that this particular port ditches the Online multiplayer system, which is a bit understandable considering that it would sometimes lag on the Xbox Live Arcade version for example. It still would've been nice, but really, they should've added it especially considering how severely lagged up playing Radiant Silvergun online on XBLA was. Either way, the bonus side is that the aesthetics, artworks, items, soundtrack, atmosphere, and presentation are all   a blast to consider, but another downside is that this is NOT the definitive version that hardcore fans would've hoped of. There is no slow-motion mode for this port, and it lacks some extras that would've otherwise still been interesting and worthy regardless of such small additions (the Dreamcast and Gamecube versions take the cake for such content amounts).\n\nIkaruga is still a phenomenal polarity-switching shooter game, almost as if it's a subgenre of its own. Go buy it if you are a shmup fan, I cannot urge you enough of it.\n\nMy score for this game: 8.85/10.00 (\"Solid\")\n\n~Azure", "timestamp_created": 1394335691, "timestamp_updated": 1394335691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9385632": {"recommendationid": "9385632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128283801", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488353393}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b3eSTG\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u9ed1\u767d\u5207\u6362\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6682\u65f6\u8fd8\u6ca1\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u5462\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1394291150, "timestamp_updated": 1394291150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9385438": {"recommendationid": "9385438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010563303", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477698906}, "language": "english", "review": "Best shoot'em up ever.", "timestamp_created": 1394289974, "timestamp_updated": 1394289974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9385162": {"recommendationid": "9385162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007391682", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397742462}, "language": "german", "review": "Macher \u00fcberhaupt keine Spass sry!

Very challenging and very rewarding. \n\nThis game is actually pretty brilliant. This game is less shmup and more *strategy*. To be able to score enough for an extra life (and you likely WILL lose your others) you basically HAVE to build your score chain up by shooting colored enemies 3 at a time. This game is hugely replayable because it's not a game where simply surviving and killing everything in sight will cut it. It turns out to be very advantageous to plan out every portion of every mission. I can almost guarantee that on your first run you will NOT get past level 3. Playing this game well is a skill. And it's rewarding to beat your high score. Because there is almost NOTHING about this game that is dumb luck. The level design is brilliant: The enemies flying on the screen are absolutely chaotic but there is ALWAYS a way to systematically eliminate them to build your chain. \n\nOne GREAT feature here is that the online leaderboards include a REPLAY of the run made to reach that score. So you can go to the top of the leaderboards, download the highest score replay, and watch it to see how he/she did it. It does the same for everyone's replays. \n\n10+ years old and this game is pretty stellar. I find that it's just challenging enough to keep me engaged but not so much that I get worked up about it.

It's a game who's sole purpose is a test of skill for who can play the game the longest and shoot enemies in the correct order to get highest rank/score.  If that is not your thing you would be probably better served elsewhere.  Note that Ikaruga doesn't have to be played this way, but the game is designed around it.

Now sure the console versions before the PC version had this option too; but I dare you to rotate a 20\" CRT screen, or a 38\" LCD HDTV! Being on the PC now, there are monitors out there on the market with a stand to rotate your monitor into a vertical portrait position. Not only that, but if your LCD monitor doesn't come with a rotating stand on it, you can hop onto Amazon and purchase a stand or arm with a rotating VESA mount on it! Now playing this game in it's intended vertical screen mode is now easier than ever now it's on the PC!\n\nThe only downside that I found with this game is that there's no quick reset or online co-op as seen in the XBox 360 version of the game.

Mastering a level could be compared, at least superficially, to learning a song \u2013 at the very least, the game\u2019s constant forward crawl and emphasis on perfect timing on a succession of coloured marks shares a lot with the typical rhythm game.\n\nBut this only really explains the long tail of the experience. For all the zen-like, dot-eating mastery that you\u2019ll strive for in the long term, Ikaruga\u2019s early appeal is sustained remarkably effectively by the base elements of gaming that we\u2019re often so quick to dismiss. Developed for the now antique hardware shared by the Dreamcast and Naomi arcade board, Ikaruga isn\u2019t exactly pumping polygons, but it still looks fantastic.\n\nThis world of elaborate black and white mecha \u2013 always accented by reds and blues respectively \u2013 is an alluring invention. The art design gives us a unique science fiction world that is more inventive and arresting than the worlds spun out of a long list of triple-A miscellany. The music is rousing, building to some strangely affecting moments near the tail end of the game. The sound effects are pitch perfect, whether digitally screaming at you on a boss approach or punctuating your deft control with explosions and that impossibly unrepetitious chorus of \u2018MAX CHAIN, MAX CHAIN, MAX CHAIN\u2019.\n\n[...]\n\nDon\u2019t disqualify yourself from playing this game.

This game will have you playing and raging for hours if you are new to bullet hell shooters. But even an experienced player might have it hard to dodge bullets while remmebering to change polarity, because believe me, this game has those impossible moments where getting hit is your only option.\nIkaruga is known to be a rare gem for it's original Dreamcast release, and also for it's Gamecube port. It has since then been available in the Xbox Live Arcade store, but many people, such as me, don't have XBox, and I have been trying to obtain the Gamecube version for a while now, but paying 30-50 dollars for a rare gem is still pricy for me.\nThanks To Treasure you have now have this beatiful masterpiece for 10 dollars.\n\nI highly recommend the game, it is fully epic and will keep you on your toes. The level descriptions have you wondering what purpose you have in Ikaruga, but for sure it will keep you trying until you succeed. While looking for a chance to buy this game on Gamecube, I have been playing it for a few months now on a Dreamcast Emulator that ran at around 40 frames a second, the game would lag behind the music, but it was still playable. As soon as I heard about it going on Steam, I quickly got a hold of it.\n<strikethrough>My only disappointment is that this game NEEDS internet connection for the leaderboards and for it to boot. I spend most of my time offline, and well, the game can not work without an internet connection. So if you really love this game (like I do), I suggest getting a emulator at least for Dreamcast and having that as a backup ^-^. This is the main reason why I want to buy the game for Gamecube, but bidders keep stealing >.> - Haha!</strikethrough>\n \nTHIS GAME NOW SUPPOTS OFFLINE MODE, Thanks to Treasure!

The graphics are gorgeous, though I don't see much of a difference between the PC/console and dreamcast/gamecube versions, but they are amazing nontheless. The music is also exeptionally good.\n\nThe gameplay is unique for a bullet-hell shooter. You have two types of polarities to swap between, white and black. White polarity absorbs white bullets, black polarity absorbs black bullets. Simplez. Deciding when to switch is crucial for survival. This game is more of a memory test, because you only have 3 lives and no continues (unless you change them in the options). You also have a charge shot you can unleash when you absorb enough shots.

The 3D graphics, soundtrack, control and hit detection are all satisfying.\n\nWhen I just bought the game, I thought, \"oh well a dodge-bullet game? It certainly seems good, and I've been playing Touhou(famous dodge-bullet franchise from Japan) for years, so it shouldn't be too hard for me, right?\"\n\nAnd then I found myself to be too naive. This game gave me nightmares. It's too hard. Way too hard. There are 5 stages in total, and even in easy mode, each stage cost me a good number of credits. I can only defeat 3 of the 5 bosses(again with lots of credits). Thank god there's free play.\n\nSo why is this game that hard? The danmaku itself isn't so hard, but I just keep dying and dying. I watched some replays from the in-game online leaderboard, and I think I know why.\n\nThe rules of this game are too complicated. You have to take care of too many things all at the same time. To list some of them:\n1. Dodge all bullets of your opposite polarity.\n2. Try to absorb as many bullets of your polarity as possible, because you need energy.\n3. Watch where you're flying so you don't crash into the wall or get stuck, which happens a lot.\n4. Watch the enemy's life bar and know when they'll die, so you don't get surprised by their countarattack.\n5. Think about when to unleash homing missiles. These aren't just an optional powerup, these are required to get past certain situations.\n6. And keep in mind the chain you are building up if you want a good score. Shoot one wrong enemy and all chain is lost.\n\nOh hell. I actually regret buying this game, because I would prefer an \"easier\" game where you just hold down the shoot button, and then all you care about is dodging bullets. I still give this game a \"recommended\" though, because it is a good game, just too complicated and too hard.\n\nAnother complaint is that the system requirement is too high. Even after an update including video options, the game still can't run at 60fps at lowest settings.\n\n+ dodge bullets like crazy\n+ shooting combied with puzzle\n+ online leaderboard\n- system requirement too high\n- too difficult\n7 out of 10, good.", "timestamp_created": 1392996273, "timestamp_updated": 1404626279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Originally released in Japan on Sega Dreamcast, it didn't find very much popularity in America back in the days of its release...but now, with more people leaning towards the bullet hell genre, its popularity rises once again. \n\nIkaruga is probably up there on one of the harder bullet hell games you'll play. A normal 2D vertical scroller with amazing 3D graphics that you normally don't see on a shmup, this gem will both aggrivate you and keep you entertained for a few hours. What it lacks in length of gameplay it'll make up for in increasing difficulty. \n\nIkaruga is a game about a normal ship with normal rapid-fire bullets...however, the twist on this game is a mechanic called 'Polarity'. There's either white, or black, which you can quickly change with the click of a mouse button or controller button. Your enemies are either white or black, and they shoot like bullets. If your polarity matches that of your enemies, you'll do more damage to them as well as absorbing their shots. As you absorb same colored hits, your energy meter fills up....and with another click of a button, you release hell on earth in the form of homing missiles instantly obliterating anything they touch as well as shooting through obstacles to meet their marks. \n\nHowever, the one shot from the opposing polarity will blow you out of the sky. \n\nThe game is very fast paced and hectic, and with the added polarity mechanic adds even more difficulty requiring your fullest attention. As far as bullet hell games go, you'll either love them or hate them, but whichever one you choose, make sure Ikaruga is on your 'to play' list.

Basically the plot goes like this... The world was taken over by a powerful organization under the control of Hourai Tenrou a man who found an artifact on the small island nation of Hourai, the \"Ubusunagami Okinokai\" also known as the \"Power of the Gods\", buried deep under the earth. After acquiring this ultimate source of power, Hourai Tenrou decided to take over the world by waging war against the ones who would oppose, little by little the world was devoured by the power of gods and so mankind decided to build an resistance to counterfeit Tenrous army. You play as a guy called Shinra, a member of the freedom force who is shoot down with his plane after an excessive battle with the Tenrou forces, however Shinra survives the incident and crashes with his plane on a remote island called Ikaruga. The townspeople of Ikaruga save Shinra and nurse him back to life, after that the towns eldest hands him over their most powerful and advanced space craft called \"the Ikaruga\". So Shinra once again sets off to settle the score with Tenrous space armada and of course to save the world. 8/10\n\nGameplay:\n\nIkaruga is a 3D vertical space-shooter so you control your ship from one stage to another by pulling of very difficult and frenzy maneuvers. Your ship is equipped with a laser blaster as well as a missile launch device and whats the most important thing about Ikaruga is, its unique polarization system, means every enemy force you encounter will either be white or black. You can switch your ships appearance instantly by pressing the right trigger and this will turn your ship from black to white and reverse allowing you to absorb the enemies bullets to power up your missile attacks. Overall the gameplay is very decent and awesome even though most of the people wont like the switching between black and white, I thought it was a very good idea and supports the ideal this game is based on 9/10\n\nControls: \n\nThe controls work like a charm for this game, they are very simple and easy to learn but trust me it takes a hell of a time to master your maneuvering and switching between black/white skills. You can use your directional pad to move your spaceship freely and by pressing two buttons you can either fire your laser blaster or commence your missile attack and of course you can switch between black or white polarization by pressing your gamepads trigger. And thats it, you wont have to bother too much with complicated button combos like in other shooters this is also due to the fact that this game was designed for arcade gaming and was imported to the dreamcast. 9/10\n\nGraphics: \n\nThe graphics may seem outdated for our next gen standards but nevertheless the stages and level designs are very well drawn and the 3D effects and bosses are very smooth and colorful, I think this game fits perfect into the category game with perfect visuals and graphics. 9/10\n\nSound: \n\nThe sound score is great as well and delivers what it should do also it is by far more memorable than other monotone tunes which are overused in most space shooters. You will notice a slight dramatical change in the sound when you advance from stage to stage, blasting your way through hordes of enemy spacecrafts. In short the sound is awesome and is perfectly implied in the whole game and delivers a very intense and thrilling feeling. 9/10\n\nMy Review: \n\nBefore we talk about the game itself and cover the review with my thoughts and regards lets clear some things about Ikaruga first. Ikaruga was originally designed for arcade gaming in japan and wasn't even released in europe or the USA, it was much later that this game actually appeared for the Dreamcast console and was later also released for the Nintendo Gamecube and the Xbox360 download section but I cover the Dreamcast release in my review so I cant tell for sure how enhanced the Gamecube version is, nevertheless it should be on par with the original Ikaruga arcade game.\n\nThe first thing when you hear of the word \"Ikaruga\" and the game itself, there should be exactly three thoughts about this game... One, incredibly hard ! Two, addictive ! And three, very fun !\nAs you are about to start the first stage you can and should try practice mode before even attempting to clear the first level of this tense shooter. Practice mode is a small tutorial which introduces you to the controls and helps you maneuvering the Ikaruga, after that you can choose either easy, normal or hard mode (don't even think about hard mode for now lol) and start your epic flight to the sky. Its very simple and straight forward, you have a space-ship, you have lots of enemies in front of you and of course you have kickass background sound to motivate you shooting your way through them. What do you need more you may ask ?! Well... the magic words here are actually practice (a lot) and of course pure skill which will come handy if you wanna time your laser blasts or want to perform chain combos. One of the best and worse things about Ikaruga is actually the very high difficulty which makes this game a pain in the arse or one of the most challenging games ever, suit yourself. The difficulty is very punishing because one hit and your space-ship will explode to pieces and of course your replay credits are very limited which makes it nearly impossible for casual gamers even to reach Stage 4, at least with little skill there is.\n\nThe game uses a unique polarity system which is really easy to use but will put your reactions into a very heavy challenge. Everything in Ikaruga is based on black or white, means you can switch your space-ship from one state to another also the enemies themselves and the bullets they fire can be absorbed by your space-ship if you can synchronize your polarity with theirs. White enemies will receive more damage by black laser-shots than the white ones, your space-ship can absorb enemy-fire if is the same color an retaliate with missiles and so on. The key is to switch between black and white to either destroy your enemies fast or to absorb their bullets to power up your ship for some powerful missile blast. It will take you time and patience to learn how to react to the enemies attacks and this is why this game is so hard. Another cool thing about this game are the chain combos you can perform by blasting a repetitive amount of enemies without just shooting wild, again ... it requires lots of skill and lots of practice to reach very high chain combos (my personal record was 50 chains and it was very hardcore, I don't think I 'll be able to ever reach more). After completing one stage you are given grades from S++ (the best) to C (the worst), depending on how many enemies you have killed or for completing a high amount of chain combos and so on (my best try was an A grade and wow thats pretty bad lol).\n\nThe game itself offers only 5 stages and can be completed under 30 minutes if you are some hardcore shooter pro gamer which wasn't my type to begin with. As I said Ikaruga was designed for arcade gaming and has a lot of arcade features in it so therefore you will either get hooked up by the intense and flashy gameplay or you will swing your gamepad against your TV screen because of its difficulty. The main reason for people to play this game is in my opinion the soundtrack and the high amount of \"try and fail\" value this game offers, of course you will lose and of course you will try again to see how far you can get and thats all the charm about this game ^^.\n\nFinal Words: \n\nIkaruga is a very unique and tense experience if you are in for some insane and difficult space-shooter or arcade gaming, it offers all there is to offer for its genre and can be easily described as one of the best space-shooters up to date.

It can be incredibly strategic, hard as nails and often infuriating but you will definitely keep coming back for more.

I had this game on GameCube, and I figured that I had \"beat\" it only because I unlocked Free-Play mode, and I had traded it to Gameshit. Because I'm stupid like that.\n\nThank Cthulhu that Treasure ported this game to PC. It could not have been Greenlit fast enough. \n\nSo, for those of you who have never played this absolutely beautiful, intense, and ultimately PUNISHING game that will have you swearing like a sailor by the time you see that dreaded \"Game Over\" screen, Ikaruga is a \"Bullet Hell\" arcade space shooter that has you managing bullet absorption and evasion: You can absorb bullets of the same color, and you can switch between colors at any time. You will be killed by bullets (I say \"will\" because its pretty much inevitable) of the opposite color.\n\nIn this port, Treasure has given us Free Play mode right off the bat, which means that you get as many Continues as you want until you finish the game. I recommend setting Continues to Five, and setting max lives per continue to Five. This, I feel gives new players and those returning to the game a fair chance (as if that phrase belongs here...), but still be punished for failure.\n\nA note on the controls: Keyboard and Mouse work fine here. I first tried using the arrow keys and Z, X, and C to fire, switch polarity, and activate superweapon, until I discovered--much to my excitement--that I can use the mouse to fire/switch polarity/activate superweapon. I also recommend turning OFF the feature that allows you to hit Mouse 1 and Mouse 2 at the same time to activate homing lasers, and just use the middle mouse button for that.\n\nThe game has five levels, and combat is treated more like a puzzle than anything else, much like any good Bullet-Hell shooter. There is a higher plane of existence beyond simply surviving through this unrelenting gauntlet; mastering the Chain system (kill 3 enemies of like color to begin the chain, and keep this pattern for as long as possible) is a completely different animal, and one that I have certainly not even attempted. This is one of those games where even watching someone who has attained a degree of skill make his or her way through is nothing short of an artistic performance. \n\nSeriously, people.

Your ship can take 1 of two 'shifts', able to deal extra damage towards the oppasite shift, and asorb any bullets from the same, but in turn is a 'one hit wonder' towards the other color. With this, along with Treasures '3 same chain' from Raident Silvergun sets this up more as a very dynamic and fast flowing 'puzzle' game then a 'bullet hell'. \n\nInstead of trying to just live, you'll be worrying about the order of enemys you kill to keep your chain going. You'll be asorbing shots left and right to fill your meater up, at times leaving foes alone for this action alone. There really isn't another breed of shooter like this that makes you double take on your approtch, more less REWARDS you for not killing everything the second it spawns on screen.This game thought is hard as nails thanks towards the change in focus you need to make for it, and it alone, and you'll have to sit down and replay stages over and over, learning their patterns towards a 'T' if wishing to get all of those achivements and place well on the global leaderboards.\n\nAs for what this version does that the Dreamcast, Gamecube, and XBLA doesn't:\n-full 60fps with no slowdown outside of the 'intended' doing boss explosions, even on a Geforce 9500 GT, making this the smoothest version yet.\n-It is Arcade perfect in scoring and results, something the XBLA had major issues with\n-Online leaderboards with the ablity to download and watch replays from anyone else who had 'ranked in', allowing you to study from the best without a secondary source.\n-Keyboard, Mouse, and the all desired 'Duel Play' options for controls, giving this version the most freedom of input choices to tweek towards your needs.\n-All of the 'Extra' options are unlocked at the very start, no need to run the game idle for 10 hours to get everything.\n\nIf there are any flaws, it is the lack of background and story information present in the Dreamcast version, more less the artwork relating towards such. The lack of a 'Music Player' option as well is slighty depressing, and of course this version lacks the Online Co-Op that the XBLA had ( thought suggested issues with that version seem to steam from said option... ), meaning the last three achivements will have to be done with ether a friend nearby, or to master Duel Play, a feat only a haldful of people thus far have mastered.", "timestamp_created": 1392812361, "timestamp_updated": 1392812361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9179160": {"recommendationid": "9179160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045162728", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511980210}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply the best shoot'em up game ever.", "timestamp_created": 1392811731, "timestamp_updated": 1392811731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9178949": {"recommendationid": "9178949", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970945037", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487765422}, "language": "english", "review": "Arguably the greatest shmup ever made, Ikaruga is a masterpiece of design and execution.

While it's been some 11 odd years since I last played Ikaruga on the Gamecube I found myself still remembering enemy patterns as I played through a few chapters just now. Granted, I'm not as good as I used to be, but that's to be expected with a game like Ikaruga - it's not a game that's skill in mastering retains in one's husk.

You take control of Ikaruga, a ship capable of changing its polarity which allows it to take hits from bullets of the same polarity without negative consequence. This is the core mechanic of Ikaruga, as you will often times need to change your polarity on the fly so as to avoid death from the constant barage of enemy ships and bullets. One hit will make your ship explode, so unless you dive into the options to make it easier for yourself, this game will unabashedly kick your ass until you get better. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a fast-paced arcade game or those who have enjoyed previous titles from Treasure. They've done an excellent job with porting the game to PC, and hopefully the success of Ikaruga will pave the way for more titles from them on Steam in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1392797653, "timestamp_updated": 1400788050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9177353": {"recommendationid": "9177353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045833570", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514694220}, "language": "english", "review": "Ikaruga is hands-down one of the best shmups to ever be released.  The game achieves the rare feat of appealing to both die-hard shmup fans, as well as those new to the genre.  Although it's not exclusive to Steam, this is easily the best game on the service.\n\nThe PC port is done exceptionally well.  There are plenty of options to tweak the visuals, controls, sound, and various other settings.  Even on an unoptimal setup, I did not experience any lag.  The only downside is that it seems that only Xbox 360 controllers are supported, but there's plenty of workarounds to make your arcade stick, PS3 controller, or whatever else you have lying around work for this game.\n\nAs for the game itself, for those unfamiliar, Ikaruga has a unique \"polarity-shifting\" mechanic.  Bullets are either white or black.  You can change your ship to be white or black with a button-press.  Depending on the color of your ship, you can absorb bullets of the same color, and deal more damage to enemies of the opposite color.  The difficulty options only make minor tweaks, but it changes the game immensely.  On hard, all enemies drop \"suicide-bullets\" when they die.  On normal, only enemies that match your color will drop these suicide-bullets.  And on easy, no enemies drop suicide bullets.  Even easy mode is relatively challenging.  However, with enough dedication, any player should be able to complete this game.\n\nAnd what would a shmup be without a fun scoring system?  While Ikaruga may not have my favorite scoring system out there, it's definitely unique and elegant.  Killing three enemies of the same color in a row will add to your chain.  Break this chain anywhere, and you have to start from zero again.  Figuring out the best way to chain through an entire level almost makes this feel like a puzzle game at times.  And even once you've figured out how to chain every enemy together, there's still a few more things to do to boost your score.  Absorbing enemy bullets increases your score, as does defeating bosses quickly.  Sometimes absorbing ONE more bullet or beating a boss ONE second quicker can make just a slight enough difference to push you up in the leaderboards.\n\nIf you haven't played this game before, please do yourself a favor and purchase it as soon as possible.  Don't wait for a Steam sale.  $10 is a more than reasonable price for what you get out of this game.  Hopefully if enough people vote with their wallets, we'll see Treasure focus their development efforts on PC.  I'd love to see a release of Radiant Silvergun, or better yet: a brand new game from Treasure made exclusively for PC.", "timestamp_created": 1392796416, "timestamp_updated": 1392796416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9177295": {"recommendationid": "9177295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033163141", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431274914}, "language": "english", "review": "Ikaruga is a great game.

No? Stay away from this game, then. Otherwise, please continue reading...\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know about Ikaruga: It was originally a bullet hell SHMUP released in Japanese arcades, and then released on the Dreamcast in Japan. Stateside, it got an enhanced port to Gamecube and XBLA, and now onto Steam. What followed was a bunch of bloody hands and broken controllers. Okay, maybe not, but that's how hard this game is.\n\nBy default, this game has no continues. Ever. And if you're not good at chaining your kills, extra lives will be very scarce. Oh, it's possible to earn them, but they're only rewarded to the ones that are actually experts at the game. So if you're a casual player of the genre (or of games in general), you're going to ragequit this game pretty quickly.\n\nAlright, let's get to the meat and potatoes of the game: The gameplay. As you can tell from the game's trailer, there's a polarity system, where you dodge opposite colors and absorb matching colors. Absorbing bullets powers up your Energy Bar, which allows you to deal a devestating attack to all enemies on the screen, depending on how much energy you have stored up. Shooting an enemy of the opposite color of what you are deals more damage than of the same color, which aids in helping you clear the screen at a more efficient rate. You also build up a bigger score with chaining your kills; killing three enemies of the same color generates one chain, and can be built up with both colors, but will also be canceled out if you hit an enemy of the opposite color of the current chain you're working on.\n\nIs the gameplay solid? Oh, definitely. Maneuvering is a bit slow for my tastes, though it works for this type of game, so I'll give it a pass. The amount of bullets on screen is balanced thanks to the polarity system, and also adds an excellent risk/reward system of which firepower you'll use on your enemies. Chaining is pretty difficult to get the hang of at first, but it adds a layer of strategy for gaining a high score, along with game progression if you need the extra lives. So for once, spamming bullets is actually looked down on. Rather ironic and maybe taboo for the genre, but it truly works.\n\nGraphics-wise, it's pretty much the same stuff from every other port out there. But really, they're fine, as is. All that matters the most would the bullets, the color of the enemies, and your ship's polarity. All of that is already nailed, so there you go.\n\nAudio-wise, I like the soundtrack. I've heard parts of it before on Youtube, but it's good to be able to hear them in the actual game. And it just helps with the mood of the game, as well.\n\nOPTIONS! Oh, TotalBiscuit will be disappointed with no FOV slider and lack of other video options, but face it: It's a game that's been around for over a decade. If your computer is a toaster, it should handle it just fine. But one thing I really like would be the ability to play the game on a vertical display, as how it originally should be. Keep in mind that the full screen mode will be on your first highest-resolution monitor, if you have multiple monitors and plan on using one for playing the game. There are also different ways to set up the HUD, if need be. You can also adjust how many continues/lives you have (warning: No high scores allowed for these changes), along with how often you earn extra lives. This helps if you just want to play through the game entirely without hassle. There's also being able to play the Prototype mode, though I haven't played that yet, so not sure how that goes.\n\nIf I had to have one gripe with this game, it would be the lack of native gamepad support. This game allows for Xbox 360 controllers, but my Logitech gamepad and Mayflash arcade stick don't work with this game unless I use Joy2Key. Yes, while that works, having native support would be nice.\n\nOverall, as a fan of SHMUPs (mostly Gradius), I really like this game. Just know that this game, by default, is really difficult, but a unique take on the genre nonetheless. If you enjoy SHMUPs and/or the bullet hell subgenre, pick this game up. If you're new to the genre, I'd probably go check something else out first, like Jamestown.", "timestamp_created": 1392795167, "timestamp_updated": 1392798775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9177121": {"recommendationid": "9177121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036512625", "num_games_owned": 550, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393591406}, "language": "english", "review": "buy this because treasure owns", "timestamp_created": 1392794181, "timestamp_updated": 1392794181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9177061": {"recommendationid": "9177061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035508708", "num_games_owned": 666, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486039510}, "language": "english", "review": "If you or anyone you know thinks that bullet hell shmups are too intimidating to play this is a pretty good gateway drug.

Ikaruga. We meet again. We last danced on the Dreamcast, you and I. I was younger then, my reactions were better, but my mind was less sharp, I had a less refined palette, and so I was not quite able to grasp precisely what you were trying to teach me, in between the chaos and the madness and the screams of ENERGY MAX ringing in my ears every other second.\n\nMy review, such that it is, is based on a quick loadup to see how it runs and if the port is good, and my experiences based on the game on the original Dreamcast, I doubt there's much else to say given Treasure has done an absolutely stunning job with the port so my opinion needs little modification. Ikaruga is perhaps one of the best known bullet hells among Western Audiences (Cave shooters perhaps more known among the eastern crowd, go look some of them up, particularly Bug Princess 2 if you want to really melt your mind). \n\nIkaruga's selling point was the concept of polarity, in so much as that your ship could flip between \"White\" and \"black\" polarity at any given point, and whatever colour it was, not only was it immune to the respective coloured swarm, it gained energy from it, allowing it to store up, and unleash a mini nuke from the incomming fire. \n\nSheer genius. \n\nThis game enshrined risk and reward in ways so subtle that months and years later people would sink hundreds, if not thousands of hours dissecting the mechanics and perfecting them, youtube runs of mythical S+++ runs showing scary levels of precision and mind meltingly quick reactions can be unearthed for the brave to boggle at. \n\nThe level design was pitch perfect both in pacing and in graphical spectacle, constantly keeping you both entertained and at the very edge of your abilities, regardless of your overall skill level, and the sound, whilst hardly far outside the standard fare for such games, has remained very much as atmospheric now as it was then, giving a real tension and emotional background as you plunge further into the realms of the Horai. \n\nIt runs perfectly and at a rock solid 60fps on the PC, and this port does the game absolute justice, Ikaruga has come home, at last, to the PC. May the dieties have mercy on our souls, because this game most definitely won't.", "timestamp_created": 1392791118, "timestamp_updated": 1392791118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9176747": {"recommendationid": "9176747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993334025", "num_games_owned": 642, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 2959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506179648}, "language": "japanese", "review": "PC\u7248\u7279\u6709\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u8981\u7d20\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u3067\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\n\u7e26\u753b\u9762\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3042\u307e\u308a\u6069\u6075\u306f\u53d7\u3051\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\n\n\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306fPS3\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3068\u517c\u7528\u3057\u3066\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\n\u3046\u307e\u304f\u52d5\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067x360ce\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\n\n\u7d30\u304b\u3044AC\u7248\u3068\u306e\u5dee\u7570\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304c\n2\u9762\u30c6\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u524d\u306e\u65e9\u56de\u3057\u96d1\u9b5a\u306712\u6a5f\u30921\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u5012\u3059\u3068\u97f3\u304c\u304a\u304b\u3057\u3044\u3068\u304b\n5\u9762\u30dc\u30b9\u304c\u5909\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3067Warning\u304c\u51fa\u308b(\u30dc\u30b9\u306e\u30bb\u30ea\u30d5\u304c\u30ab\u30d6\u3063\u3066\u8aad\u3081\u306a\u3044)\u3068\u304b\n\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3069\u3053\u308d\u304a\u304b\u3057\u3044\u6240\u3082\u898b\u53d7\u3051\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\n\n\u6368\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u306e\u969b\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u3044\u3061\u3044\u3061\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u306b\u623b\u3063\u3066\u304b\u3089\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3068\u51fa\u6765\u306a\u3044\u306e\u304c\u82e5\u5e72\u4e0d\u6e80\n\n\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u30b7\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3\u306e\u79fb\u690d\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3057\u307e\u3059\n\n\u8ffd\u8a18\uff1a\nXBLA\u7248\u3067\u306f\u7279\u306b\u4e0d\u8a55\u3060\u3063\u305f\uff13\u9762\u4e2d\u30dc\u30b9\u306e\u5468\u308a\u3092\u56de\u8ee2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u96d1\u9b5a\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u65b9\u5411\u304cAC\u7248\u3068\u9006\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u306f\u76f4\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3059\n\n2014/3/20 \u8ffd\u8a18:\n\u672c\u65e5\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u4e0a\u8a18\u306b\u66f8\u3044\u3066\u3042\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u4e0d\u6e80\u70b9\u306f\u307b\u307c\u89e3\u6d88\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff085\u9762\u306eWarning\u3060\u3051\u306f\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\uff09\n\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306f\u307e\u3060\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u5168\u30c1\u30e3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u3059\u3079\u3066\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306b\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u3067\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306a\u6368\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\uff06\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\n\u3053\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6642\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u306f\u3046\u3061\u306e\u74b0\u5883\uff08Core i5@2.6GHz, \u30e1\u30e2\u30ea 4GB, GeForce GT 220, Win7 32-bit\uff09\u3067300M\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u7b49\u3092\u7acb\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u3082\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u4e0d\u8db3\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f", "timestamp_created": 1392790343, "timestamp_updated": 1396446787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825687", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9176561": {"recommendationid": "9176561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002465535", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425101388}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth it.

Shmups have rarely been known to display a great degree of inventivness; even some of the genre's best offerings adhere to the tried-and-true forumula of \"dodge bullets, shoot ships.\" While there are a number of exceptions to the rule, few have kicked the trend harder, and in a more finely crafted fashion, than the beloved Ikaruga, the product of Japanese Developer, Treasure.\n\nOriginally released to Japanese arcades in late 2001, Ikaruga places the player in the role of the titular aircraft, capable of switching at will between two \"polarities,\" black and white, to enable it to absorb bullets of like color, which will be one of the two previously mentioned. As well, enemy craft will be vulnurable to any of the Ikaruga's bullets which do not match their own. One final addition to the Ikaruga's aresenal is the homing attack, the meter for which is charged by absorbing bullets, and releases a powerful salvo of seeking projectiles proportionally powerful to how full the charge meter is.\n\nThese mechanics alone would make for an interesting game even if the level design was relatively straightforward; however, each level is designed with an attention to detail and care rarely seen in games of any genre. Each stage, progressively harder than the next, plays as much like a puzzle game as it does a shoot 'em up, and watching replays of some of the world's top players will quickly inform you that there is definitely more than one way to win.\n\nBut no high-quality shmup would be complete without a fun and robust scoring system, and Ikaruga has one which not only changes the way you play, but can actually make gameplay more fun while doing it. Skilled players can \"chain\" enemies together, by destroying three consecutive ships of the same color, each chain in addition to the first offering a massive bonus in points, getting you closer to your desired score, and the additional lives at each extend point.\n\nThis game is pretty easy on the eyes, too. All of the mechanical designs present in Ikaruga have a uniquely Japanese, mythic, fantasy/science fiction look to them, all of which come together to make the game feel epic and larger-than-life, with much help from it's memorable sythesized orchestral soundtrack.\n\nIn Ikaruga's long history, Treasure have released the game for a number of platforms, and in each iteration, all the way up to the port for Xbox Live Arcade, provided additional options to improve the overall experience, and the Steam release is no exception. Inlucuded in this already smooth port of the original are leaderboards, acheivements, multiplayer, stage select, prototype mode (which is available from the start, unlike in previous releases), and even the ability to play two-player mode solo, using each of the thumsticks to control each ship.\n\nOh, yeah, the best part? All runs in beautiful 60 frames per second, just like we're used to.\n\nIf there is one thing in Ikaruga that plays to it's detriment, it would be the same thing that has drawn so many hardcore fans to it in the first place: the difficulty. Ikaruga is by no means an easy game; even on the lowest difficulty, it will provide an almost insurmountable challenge for many newcomers, with the remaining settings, and the inclusion of prototype mode, only getting harder from there. Those looking for a relaxing experience will want to look elsewhere. That being said, overcoming the many obstacles ahead of the player prove to be incredibly rewarding, and repeat playthroughs offer more ways to play with improving skill.\n\nTreasure have hit it out of the park with this release. If you already own Ikaruga on XBLA, the additional features may not be enough to justify a re-purchase (unless you're crazy in love with Treasure like I am), but if you're looking to get those online leaderboards, replays, and flexibility absent from previous releases, or you are new to the game and want to see what all the fuss is about, you could certainly do worse than picking it up on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1392781696, "timestamp_updated": 1392781696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529837", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9175720": {"recommendationid": "9175720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035396528", "num_games_owned": 1827, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511492308}, "language": "english", "review": "After roughly 4000+ hours in this game over all the console versions.  I still feel like nobody ever quite explained it as well as Greg Kasavin did, so here's his review.  Notice this is the GameCube version he's reviewing, and all versions have very slight differences, but the XBLA version added the most \"features\" so to speak, and that's mainly what we got with this version.  It fixed a lot of things the XBLA port got wrong from the arcade and DC/GC versions.  My only nitpick is, they didn't include online co-op which the 360 version had, which hopefully they'll patch in at a later date.  And there are people who have latency issues with the game at the moment so hopefully that's fixed fast.  I also really hope Treasure VAC protects the game at some point as well.  Another sad thing I guess is, the previously announced Trading Cards are now no longer happening, apparantly, the store page isn't even listing them anymore even though Treasure themselves confirmed them...\n\nSo, best review of the game ever - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4fzFvQzWtw\n\nGo buy it!\n\nEdit - Has Steam cards now, just to be clear and updated.

Most keyboards do not allow that, which usually means you die.\nI havent tried mouse controls yet, so no opinions there.\nThe game lets you use the analog stick of the controller, although the game was originally only digital, so it might feel awkward to players, who are used to digital controls.\nIn addition to the steering, there are only 3 keys used, shoot, switch ship color and homing laser burst.\n\nGraphics (decent):\nSlightly outdated yet still good looking (the game was made in 2001). \nExcept for Resolutions and HUD modifications, there's not much you can change. I think there is no Anti-Aliasing which makes for some rougher edges, but correct me if im wrong.\nThe game allows you to play at full 1200p or 1080, in 3 modes: \n- top-down leaves the game with huge borders, but unless you can flip your screen by 90 degrees, this will be the desired option \n- left-to-right fills the whole screen but everything is turned by 90 degrees, which feels really awkward.\n- top-down full screen on a vertical monitor: this is what you really want, turn your monitor or tv by 90 degrees and play the game the same way it first appeared on arcade machines.\n\nGameplay(10 out of 10):\nThere are no upgrades, only 2 weapons (straight forward shot and homing laser burst), so what gives this a 10 out of 10? \nIt's the unique black and white system: enemies get to shoot you with either black or white projectiles/beams/etc.. You can evade projectiles of one color by switching the Ikaruga's (your ship) shields to the according color. Instead of taking damage(instant death) your shield actually absorbs the projectiles of the same color, charging your homing lasers, which in turn can be released for a devastating attack against all enemies on the screen.\nBy switching the color of your ship, your projectiles also change their color. Hitting an enemy with the opposite color does double damage, while shooting the same color makes the hostile burst into more projectiles of that color on normal or hard difficulty.\nIf you're into beating high-scores, the game constantly requires you to kill 3 enemies of the same color in a row. Keep doing this and you build up chains multiplying your score. Hit the wrong color and the chain breaks.\nThe game is also quite short, beating it takes about 40-60 minutes (rough guess), but the sense of accomplishment will only settle in, once you beat it without constantly dying.\n\nDifficulty (hardcore/satisfying):\nThere are 3 difficulty modes, easy, normal and hard, but don't let these confuse you, easy will permanently lead you to your death in the first hours of gameplay.\nThe tactics, required to survive, and perhaps even doing so with a good score, will change drastically with each difficulty.\nThe black/white system and the hundreds of projectiles filling the screen will make your brain melt at first, but once you get used to it, it's not all that hard on easy mode. \nNormal mode ups the difficulty by bursting dying enemies of the same color into even more projectiles to fill the screen.\nHard mode lets all enemies burst into projectiles of their respective color, making for a really hard time.\nThere is also nothing random about the game, everything is pre-scripted, which means, you will eventually learn every step required for survival.\nInfinite continues (requires enabling in the settings) allow you to finish the game, no matter how often you die.\n\nMultiplayer(my friends love it, but they keep breaking my high score):\nThe game allows local coop by attaching a (second) gamepad.\nCoop itself is quite fun, and the game becomes easier when your friend covers the other half of the screen, though creating chains for a good score becomes a lot harder. There are also some tight spots that get even tighter when two people try covering in the same spot, in fact you can push your friend to their death which will earn you some angry looks.\nThe ships are quite easy to discern at first, but become a bit harder when a lot of projectiles fill the screen.\nIf you have dual-stick controller, you can also fly both ships by yourself - a very confusing experience indeed.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1392757320, "timestamp_updated": 1392757320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9172016": {"recommendationid": "9172016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031544843", "num_games_owned": 772, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393283389}, "language": "japanese", "review": "XBLA\u7248\u6301\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3051\u3069\n\u7e26\u753b\u9762\u30d5\u30ebHD\u3067\u3084\u308b\u3068\n\u3084\u3063\u3071\u8feb\u529b\u304c\u9055\u3046\u306a\u3042\uff57\uff57", "timestamp_created": 1392757095, "timestamp_updated": 1392757095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9171953": {"recommendationid": "9171953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030253453", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503798178}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic bullet hell, so glad they brought it over to PC.

You can absorb bullets that are the same polarity as your ship and do double damage to enemies that are of the opposite polarity. This game is not for the faint of heart - the volume of bullets rivals that of CAVE's shooters or even Fraxy or Touhou Danmakufu (the latter two being shmups built around player-made bosses).\n\nGraphics: Beautiful but dated. The game was original made for arcade units back in 2001, as well as the SEGA dreamcast, and while the polygon count and texture resolution has increased with subsequent releases the lighting quality has not. Also, this game is hard.\n\nSoundtrack: One of the best. Epic and driving at the same time. Also, this game is hard.\n\nGameplay: Simplicity is a good thing when it comes to shmups - you want to make the game mechanics as easy to memorize as possible so the player can concentrate on what's on screen. Ikaruga definately delivers in this category. Also, this game is hard.\n\nStory: Kinda hard to describe. Think of it as a semi-sequel of Radient Silvergun, in a time loop that deviated from previous loops. Also, this game is hard.\n\nNotes: This game has had reports of crashing on startup, however in most cases simply restarting Steam fixes the problem. This game has been previously released on multiple platforms. Also, this game is hard.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nSoundtrack: 9/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nStory: 6/10\n\nRecommended for: People who enjoy very hard games, fans of bullethell games.\nNot recommended for: People who can't handle losing.\n\nBottom line: An iconic game that is a must-have for any shmup fan.

The game-play is incredibly unique just as it is challenging, and to master this game requires tons of practice and skill.\n\nIn Ikaruga, you pilot your ship which has the ability to swap between two polarities of energy.  There are also enemies that can be either of the two types (or both), that you must kill and avoid their bullets and path.  Within a polarity, you are able to collect (eat) bullets of the same polarity/energy type from a matching enemy, and use that gathered energy to unleash homing missiles.  Keep in mind though, that to shoot an enemy with an opposing energy/polarity color does Twice as much damage to them, but will often leave you having to dodge heavier fire as the sacrifice.\n\nAside from purely awesome gamplay both the graphics and the soundtrack are gorgeous as well, and will definitely leave you remembering the visuals, animations and experience.\n\nIf you're looking for a shooter that will push you to your limits.. this is for sure the game to get!

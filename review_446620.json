Und zwar massig davon!!!\n\nMan selber steht die ganze Zeit in unterschiedlichen Leveln an einen Fleck (man braucht also nicht sehr viel Platz) und man muss au\u00dfer sich mal umdrehen und ducken um bsp. Sachen aufzuheben, nicht gro\u00df vom Platz wegbewegen. (Moiten Sickness sollte da also nicht so schnell auftauchen)\nAnfangs stehen einem noch kleine Waffen zu Verf\u00fcgung, mit ner bestimmten Anzahl an Zombie Kills gibt es dann neue Waffen wie Schrotgewehr oder Ak-47 usw. die Freigeschaltet werden k\u00f6nnen. \nDazu gibt es noch auf nen kleinen Tisch der direkt hinter einen steht nen paar n\u00fctzliche Items zu finden, wie Granaten, Fleisch und Radio (beide zum Ablenken der Zombies) Gasflasche usw.. mit denen sich die Horde der Zombies besser bek\u00e4mpfen l\u00e4sst. Bei Sachen die geworfen werden kann es schonmal vorkommen das man die h\u00f6he der Decke untersch\u00e4tzt, wer also beim zocken ne Lampe oder was anders \u00fcber sich h\u00e4ngen hat, sollte mit seinen Wurfarm also vorsichtig sein, sonst haut man evtl in der hektik des Spiels mal dagegen, das ist aber nen typisches VR Problem wenn man am falschen Platz spielt :D\n\nF\u00fcr Leute die schon immer mal wissen wollten ob sie ihre Pistole wie Lucky Luke schneller als ihr eigenen Schatten ziehen k\u00f6nnen, gibt es noch kleine Extragames mit Global Highscore (der auch in normalen Spiel vorhanden ist)zur Auswahl, wo man dann mit ner Pistole oder ner anderen Waffe z.b. 3 Ziele so schnell wie m\u00f6glich killen muss.(kann man bei Pappzombies eigentlich von killen reden? ^^). Wen man das dann unter 1,5sek schafft mit Zielen die in 3 unterschiedlichen Richtungen stehen, kommt man sich schon bissle wie Clint Eastwood oder Charles Bronson vor :D\nManche in der Liste scheinen wirklich schneller als Lucky Luke zu sein (Nein kein cheat oder Bug oder so, sie sind einfach sauschnell^^ )\n\nAuf jeden Fall einer der besseren Waveshooter, wo man immermal zwischendurch f\u00fcr nen paar Runden reinschnuppern kann um nen paar Pappkameraden in die Ewigkeit zu schicken. :)\n\n\nFalls euch meine Reviews gefallen, k\u00f6nnt Ihr mir ja gerne folgen :)\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/31899521/", "timestamp_created": 1517671752, "timestamp_updated": 1517685118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39742464": {"recommendationid": "39742464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007808181", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477255089}, "language": "english", "review": "I received the game with my Vive.

There are better VR experiences to spend your money.\n\nIt's just ridiculously repetitive and easy. There's no deep strategizing here: throw some steak, shoot. Throw a grenade every now and then. It gets intense, but not in anyway that feels rewarding when you make it through. Contrast this with Space Pirate Trainer, and it's just a night and day difference in how rewarding the gameplay is.

Well worth the time with small progression.\n\nZombie Training Simulator is game of skill training. It is a game that doesn't require you to do much. No fancy dodging, or technical aspects. This is about aiming and shooting! This means practicing your aim to get headshots, as zombies only die from headshots. But fret not! There is a variety of weapons and explosive at your disposal! This means that you have small goals to get to. With these weapons unlocking with kills across all your sessions you can go practice and play their survival games or skill tests and feel like you're accomlishing something. I have unlocked all the guns and each one have fun little differences to them. The final weapons are good fun to enjoy, but the early guns are also good to train with for other games. The survival games each have different maps, routes for the zombies to use and more or less supplies to use. The steaks allow you to survive longer and leads to a bit of chaos as learning when they get finished to throw out another leads to excitement when the zombies all turn and start charging you again.\n\nOverall this is a great game that I enjoy and is well worth the price. The asthetic is nice and charming by having the zombies without much of a \"scare\" factor.

It wasn't exactly free, but it was included in the price of the headset.\n\n[h1]One of the best introductory wave shooters for VR.[/h1]\n\nWave shooters are one of the most common genres in the VR economy of games, but they can be some of the most fun you'll have with roomscale VR.  Zombie Training Simulator is no exception.\n\nZombie Training Simulator starts you in a sudo-main menu with a limited choice of weapons and a few not-so-aggressive zombies.  The zombies are like cardboard cutouts, which is possibly a reminder that a lot of us got ourselves introduced to the possibilities of VR with Google Cardboard... and that's also where the title of the game comes from, I guess.\n\nYou'll unlock more weapons as you kill zombies and rack up your kill count.  Your kill count gets higher, your access to weapons becomes less limited.  You get a basic pistol to start.  You also get a katana, which is located on your back.  You will most likely rack up the zombie kill count slowly at first, but it gradually gets more fast-paced.  You quickly unlock a better pistol that unfortunately has less ammo.  You later get dual-wielded versions of the same pistols.  You also get grenades, shotguns, and some other weapons.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to get higher on the leaderboards for each game mode and each level.  This will be difficult because a vast majority of the Vive owners got this game with their Vive.  Those who did not, well, I feel that the game's worth a purchase, anyway.  It's a lot of fun, and I can't recommend it enough to people who really want a fun wave shooter.\n\n[h1]How does Zombie Training Simulator compare to Space Pirate Trainer?[/h1]\n\nSpace Pirate Trainer is cool and possibly more fun in some ways, but Zombie Training Simulator offers a better feeling of progression thanks to its weapon unlocks and additional meta-games.  Zombie Training Simulator sports a more child-friendly, simplified graphical style which makes it easier to render tons of objects on the screen.  Space Pirate Trainer looks amazingly realistic despite the lack of arms.

Having the zombies be cutouts and various scene objects in 3D, it creates a very good depth effect. The scenery is excellent from the choice of levels you have to choose from, my favorite being the forest, the colors are vivid and jump in your face, zombies are modeled very nice and have a sharp look to them and overall, my system did not experience any hiccups so optimization is good with this one.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou start out by having different game modes such as skill challenges, survival and so on with a pistol to start you off with. Since this is a wave shooter, zombie hordes come at you from different directions with a chance of a massive horde spawning, keeps the game fresh. What sets this apart from another wave shooter is the adrenaline this gives you as at certain times, the screen could be overfilled with zombies and you rush and scramble to reload that gun or find that piece of meat to throw, only to find out you are all out and you must melee them in order to survive the best you could. It is truly a fun experience.\n\nSound:\n\nSound is basic but hits the right cues. Zombies make noises and bi-direction sounds seems to work very well with my surround sound headset. I do enjoy the background music as it adds to the game well.\n\nOverall:\n\nHaving received this product for testing, and considering its current price point of $20, I would recommend anyone who owns a vive to give this game a go. It will suck you in and make you keep going due to its fun atmosphere, intuitive but simple upgrade system, and well-polished shooting mechanics.

The different guns, without actual gunplay mentioned above, just feel like stat differences considering.\n\nThere are a few modes, like \"challenges\", but they don't really have a lot to offer for someone like me. The shooting just feels so bland to begin with that I don't really have any reason to stick around and try out more.\n\nI would pass on this and get something else in the $20 range. If you literally just want to shoot at targets, I'd get Hotdogs, Horseshoes and Handgrenades instead, as the weapons are very interesting to use and have more interactivity.\n\nFor more VR reviews, check out the rest on my Steam Curator page:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/31930555-Auburoks-VR-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1477227346, "timestamp_updated": 1520342551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26177287": {"recommendationid": "26177287", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994281735", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512487962}, "language": "french", "review": "Du fun \u00e0 haute dose!\nMalgr\u00e9 un titre qui pourrait rebuter les bons p\u00e8res de famille, ce jeu s'av\u00e8re \u00eatre un bon vieux \"tir au pigeon\" bourr\u00e9 de fun qui promet de bonnes rigolades!\n", "timestamp_created": 1477205775, "timestamp_updated": 1477205775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26158140": {"recommendationid": "26158140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300874849", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470117760}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoAHedy_cAw", "timestamp_created": 1477118393, "timestamp_updated": 1477118393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26156683": {"recommendationid": "26156683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334162004", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1520802254}, "language": "english", "review": "Sooo koool !!!", "timestamp_created": 1477109498, "timestamp_updated": 1477109498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26156377": {"recommendationid": "26156377", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974500147", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518321326}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just target practice.

The graphics are simplistic, yet detailed and polished. Although they are not realistic, the game is still highly immersive. Because the zombies are cardboard cut-outs, the game allows you to enjoy the same fun that a bloody, gory, zombie, shooter game gives you, without all the blood, guts, and horror (Although it can be very startling when you turn around and see a zombie you were not expecting to be there, #CardboardJumpscare). \n\nZTS includes quite a large variety of weapons including many different gun types, along with a katana you can pull out from behind your back. This allows you to continue to fight off the zombies while your gun auto-reloads. Each gun is unlocked by killing a certain total number of zombies. You start off with a pistol, and can eventually end yourself up with 2 SMGs (one in each hand). There is also gas cans and grenades you can throw, to explode a group of zombies. Steak is also available to you. You can use this to slow down the zombies and bait them to a specific area.\n\nThe replayability level of this game is very high. This is due to the addictive gameplay that ZTS offers. Killing as many zombies as you can to unlock more weapons is very heart pumping and a ton of fun. Trying to get to a greater wave then your previous record is also very addictive, as is attempting to get higher up on the leaderboard to take over that #1 spot. The many different maps, environments, and difficulties, are also main reasons why this game does not get old. \n\nIf you are in any way interested in arcade, shooter style, games, I greatly recommend picking up Zombie Training Simulator. I'm sure you will enjoy it! \n\nNOTE: I do get occasional framerate drops and jittering with my GTX980. Its not enough to ruin the gameplay in any way,  but it is noticeable when I use the explosives or there are a ton of zombies that are gathered in one area.", "timestamp_created": 1467154543, "timestamp_updated": 1467154543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572192", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23895428": {"recommendationid": "23895428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004561095", "num_games_owned": 1246, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469286750}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple but addicting.

Your standard mode is a wave survival style game, you pick a weapon at the start of a game and stick with it for as long as possible. You are always postitioned next to a table containing various supplies to help you fight off the undead hoards including steaks which can be thrown to distract the zombies who will gather around the hunk of meat until it is completely consumed, these are essential to survival as the sheer number of zombies on-screen would overwhelm you if not for this element of control. You also have grenades which explode after a set time when you throw them and shootable explosives like propane bottles and jerry cans which can make you feel like a complete badass if you shoot them in the air.\n\nThe graphics are simple but effective, the idea of the game is to simulate training yourself for the zombie apocalypse, so you aren't fighting real zombies, but instead some very stylised cardboard cutout zombies, these can only be killed with a headshot meaning that this game is more about precision and strategy than wildly firing at the hoards. The survival mode has multiple maps of various difficulties, zombies will have different paths and items on your table will vary from level to level.\n\nThe challenges are all about defeating a set number of zombies in the fastest time possible, Crow's foot is all about precision, eliminating four zombies from both sides in the fastest time possible, where as Zombie bowling has a huge hoard lined up like bowling pins, armed with one grenade and your gun of choice, you have to clear the whole lot in the quickest time you can.\n\nIf you feel yourself getting too well aquanted with the game and want to ramp things up a little, you can switch to night time mode, you gun will have a flashlight on it and this will be the only way you will be able to see, it really changes the gameplay and puts you even more on your toes as it's not as easy to know where the zombies will be coming from.\n\nWith a variety of weapons which can be gradually unlocked by killing a specified number of zombies which can be used across each gameplay type, each with their own leaderboards, there is a lot here to keep you coming back. You get a lot of value from the game and it's easily one of my favourite Vive experiences so far.", "timestamp_created": 1463095968, "timestamp_updated": 1463095968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22919369": {"recommendationid": "22919369", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984280823", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495485639}, "language": "german", "review": "Zun\u00e4chst wirkt das Game kindisch und langweilig.

Damn lies...\n\nIt isn\u2019t the visuals that freak you out \u2013 it\u2019s the sound.\n\nPacked with a multitude of modes for you to play around with, something for everyone, ZTS is an excellent early game for the Vive that is worth every penny of the asking price. A great deal of time and effort has obviously gone into polishing this game and it shows. The graphics are bright and colourful, without being confusing. The zombies actually feel like they are made out of cardboard, shooting chunks off them is satisfying and gives you a great sense of real damage.\n\nYou start with access to limited weapons, a pistol as I recall, and are rewarded with more and better guns as you kill more zombies. It\u2019s a little frustrating that you can\u2019t use all the guns right away but it does give the game a natural progression which might be missing otherwise.\n\nSome gallery shooters on the vive have weapons that feel like toys, and this makes those games feel very lightweight. ZTS\u2019s guns feel great, the animations are believable without being overcomplicated and the use of the feedback in the controllers is good. You can almost feel the bullets smack into the zoms. \n\nThe use of explosives is also excellently handled. Grenades, petrol cans and lanterns can be used to wipe out large concentrations of zombies. Getting the Z\u2019s to stand in one place is managed by clever use of handy meat chunks you can lob out into the range.\n\nOn top of all this the leader board system is excellent. Showing your rank amongst friends or worldwide.\n\nI love this game.

If you want a great shooter, this is the one to get - the feel of the shooting rivals H3VR, even though it is cartoon zombies - the graphics, especially when it comes to the iron sights is crystal clear which makes it a lot more realistic to aim properly than in most other VR shooters I've tried so far.

Gunplay is solid with no complaints. I am a huge fan of the cartoon pseudo 2d theme. It creates an atmosphere the is enganging, but, not tense and draining such as a more horror themed survival shooter such as The Brookhaven Experiment. The cartoony theme and low level violence makes this game suitable for older children. The difficulty settings provide a suitable challenge for any skill ranges. In addition to wave-based survival there is also skill based challenges which test the player's ability to cope with a specific circumstance. The progression system and gunplay make this title enjoyable and something you will keep coming back to for quite a while.\n\nGameplay Breakdown:\nChoose from one of the guns on the table and select your challenge. In Survival, you use the resources on your table and explosives littered around the map to make it to the end of the wave. Meat acts as a zombie magnet. Propane tanks and gas cans are throwable explosives that need to be shot. Grenades are throw-and-forget timed explosives. The objective in the skill challenges varies from one to the next.\n\nPros:\n+Cartoony theme is enjoyable and suitable for older children.\n+Intense zombie gameplay without a tense atmosphere.\n+Multiple maps and skill challenges.\n+Progression system to unlock bigger and badder guns.\n+Throwable resources and littered explosives respawn at the end of the round.\n+Difficulty settings make this title accessible for any player regardless of skill level.\n+Theming is great for people who want to shoot massive amounts of zombies but not have to deal with a scary or dramatically tense atmoshpere.\n\nCons:\n-The weapon system is a bit disappointing in that you can't have both the traditional primary (assault rifle, smg, shotgun) and secondary (pistol) at one time. Because of this there is almost never a reason to use the pistols once you unlock better weapons because they are straight inferior. Being able to swap to your secondary instead of reloading would fix this, and, greatly improve gameplay.\n-The strategy for survival seems pretty systematic. Throw meat to distract the zombies. Throw explosives into large groups if there isn't one littered nearby. Shoot at zombie heads. Throw more meat when the previous one's duration expires.\n-After completion of a skill challenge there is no incentive to replay beyond trying to beat your time.\n-Progression system seems to be a bit of a grind.\n-Unlocking new guns is only achievable through total zombie kills. Pretty boring, as they could have instead rewarded by beating a certain amount of waves on a map or a certain time/score in a skill challenge.\n-I don't know how much additional content is going to be added post-launch.\n\nAll in all I feel that this title was still worth the $20.", "timestamp_created": 1461752495, "timestamp_updated": 1461752495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22622201": {"recommendationid": "22622201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125970252", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500136346}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a total hoot to play.  best FPS so far.

It's a very repetitive game however the devs have been adding more and more cool content so it is definitely a worthwhile purchase now. Previously I was on the fence but now that they have added dual wielding I think there is enough content for the price. It is also fantastic for showing people new to VR as it runs well, the guns are satisfying and the aesthetic is cool.\n\n______________Previous review:__________________\n\nDon't be fooled by the cartoony style - this game is intense.\n\nI would definitely recommend getting this game, it's a charming wave shooter that isn't just barebones.\n\nThe main meat of the game is in the survival modes, and facing giant hordes while managing distractions and explosives is really cool. You can get hundreds to thousands of kills in a good survival session and it really gives the feel of mowing down a horde. What makes this game different to a barebones wave shooter like space pirate trainer is the progression system, the gamemodes, and the different maps. \n\nUnlocking new guns sets a good goal and pushes you to play just a little bit more to try out the next gun, and I'm always  looking forward to the next unlock. Night time mode is also great, and it kind of gives the same feeling I get in the Brookhaven experiment demo - although this has a lot more to do right now and runs a lot better.\n\nShooting feels really good in this game, and my bullets are always going where I feel like they should go. Some other games don't have the gunplay feeling as right, but it feels really good here and you can really hone your accuracy.  \n\nThe zombies looking like cutouts is a really good thing for the game - landing shots has a lot of visual feedback, and the simple look of the zombies means you can have hordes of hundreds on screen at once. \n\nIn terms of performance, it is really good as a result of the cartoon style, which also looks great. The game runs really well. I am getting 90fps and running the game butter smooth even on my old 7950, which is below the minimum spec. Giant hordes and explosions don't seem to make a difference.  \n\nWhile the game is already great, it would be awesome if the devs added more maps, and more guns. I would love some akimbo/duel wield gun unlocks too as most of the game you are just doing nothing with your non-shooting hand save for the occasional grenade/meat throw. However, the game is still awesome and very easy to get into for showing your friends, and I'd say quite worth the price for the amount of time you can get out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1461073790, "timestamp_updated": 1468388078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518900", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22513120": {"recommendationid": "22513120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034071467", "num_games_owned": 1013, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462972969}, "language": "english", "review": "Suprisingly a rather delightful wave based zombie game, its the type of game where if you put enough hours in killing paper cut-out zombies you can get extra guns and such.

Guns reload automatically rather than requiring any complex motions, but that's necessary due to the constant streams of zombies.\n\nOne major drawback: No dual wielding of any weapons.

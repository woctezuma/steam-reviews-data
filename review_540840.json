It does get a bit annoying but not enough to detract from a fun and challenging puzzle adventure. \n\nOverall, totally recommended for Tomb Raider fans - just don\u2019t go into it expecting it to be the same gameplay as previous Tomb Raider games \u2013 remember, it is a turn-based strategy puzzle game with the look and feel of Tomb Raider.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515551310, "timestamp_updated": 1515551310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39208411": {"recommendationid": "39208411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074449972", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 531, "last_played": 1515508028}, "language": "schinese", "review": "BOSS\u6218\u7cbe\u5f69\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u6740\u624bGO\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1515508100, "timestamp_updated": 1515508100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39188354": {"recommendationid": "39188354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011016422", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 430, "last_played": 1515436003}, "language": "german", "review": "Mit 7 Stunden Gameplay ist Lara Croft Go ein relativ kurzes Spiel.

In combination with the great aesthetics, animations (including Lara's classic hand stand), music, ambiants and sound fx, this works very well. \n\nThe puzzles are challinging but not frustrating, with a nice difficulty curve. Mechanics and patterns are introduced gradually. \n\nThere are 7 chapters. The first 5 make up the main game. I completed those just within 6 hours. For those who want more, the extra chapter and the expansion chapter introduce each new mechanics. Chapter 6 was by far the most difficult and most time consuming one. The expansion chapter was rather easy and short, but had interesting mechanics.\n\nCon: Controls. With the mouse, you have the swipe etc to control the game. But since, I didn't discover that at first, I used a controller. Now I suck with a controller, but Lara just moved one too many time inside the bite of a cobra unintentionally. There were also responsiveness issues when grabbing an object.

Du coup les graphismes sont simples mais ils ont eu l'id\u00e9e de faire une direction artistique rendant hommage au rendu graphique des consoles 32 bits. On voit bien les polygones qui constituent les personnages et les environnements, les couleurs et les d\u00e9cors ressortent bien aussi. Le tout reste donc tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il et tourne parfaitement.\nPour ce qui est du jeu en lui m\u00eame, il s'agit en fait de tour par tour en vue isom\u00e9trique. On incarne donc Lara Croft dans de nouvelles aventures arch\u00e9ologiques, on en connait le minimum, on est directement lanc\u00e9 dans un temple \u00e0 explorer. Et ici Lara se d\u00e9place donc case par case et au tour par tour, ce n'est absolument pas un RPG mais plus un jeu bas\u00e9 sur des puzzles \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre pour avancer. En plus de cela il faut faire avec le ennemis qui eux aussi avancent et agissent au tour par tour. Pour progresser et faire face aux pi\u00e8ges il faut un minimum de r\u00e9flexion, certaines \u00e9nigmes demandent m\u00eame un peu de Die & Retry pour bien comprendre leur m\u00e9canique. Au d\u00e9but, la progression et la logique est facile mais plus on avance et plus cela devient retorse, \u00e7a joue beaucoup sur les d\u00e9placements, un peu comme un jeu d'\u00e9chec ou de GO (d'o\u00f9 le nom). Le monde de la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre exploratrice est toujours aussi accrocheur m\u00eame au service d'un jeu aussi diff\u00e9rent de ses habituelles aventures. Il reste tr\u00e8s fid\u00e8le \u00e0 l'esprit exploration/aventure et au monde de Tomb Raider. Ainsi, il vous demandera de trouver toutes les reliques et joyaux cach\u00e9s dans les diff\u00e9rents niveaux pour le finir \u00e0 100%. Et pour satisfaire le fan service, chaque relique recompos\u00e9e donne acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un costume pour Lara, souvent tir\u00e9 de ses anciennes aventures. Il y a ainsi une bonne douzaine de costumes diff\u00e9rents. Deux aventures compl\u00e8tes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rajout\u00e9es en mises \u00e0 jour, ce qui allonge la dur\u00e9e vie du jeu qui monte \u00e0 un dizaine d'heures. Les nouvelles campagnes sont les plus cors\u00e9es \u00e0 ce jour et poss\u00e8dent leur originalit\u00e9 appr\u00e9ciable vis \u00e0 vis du jeu original. Elles ajoutent chacune une m\u00e9canique de jeu qui complexifie grandement la progression et pousse bien plus \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion et \u00e0 l'essai. \nPour finir, le gameplay est dune simplicit\u00e9 extr\u00eame car il permet uniquement d'avancer, de pousser/tirer des objets.

Il faut d\u00e9terminer le bon parcours, effectuer les bonnes manipulations des divers m\u00e9canismes et \u00e9viter d'\u00eatre tu\u00e9 par les ennemis en se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant dans l'environnement selon des trac\u00e9s qui indiquent la distance qu'on peut parcourir lors de chaque tour. \n\nLara doit notamment faire face \u00e0 des serpents, des crocodiles ou des araign\u00e9es g\u00e9antes ; doit veiller aux crevasses et aux pi\u00e8ges mortels ; dispose de pistolets et de lances pour tuer et de torches enflamm\u00e9es pour faire reculer ses opposants. Au fil du jeu, ces divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de gameplay s'ajoutent et se combinent.\n\nIl y a \u00e9galement des tr\u00e9sors dissimul\u00e9s dans les niveaux sur lesquels il faut tous cliquer pour obtenir le 100% des succ\u00e8s.

Contrairement \u00e0 la version Hitman (pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous forme de pions dans un jeu de plateau), les personnages sont ici anim\u00e9s et les mouvements de Lara sont ceux qu'elles pouvait effectuer lors de ses premiers jeux. On peut juste regretter que la plupart des niveaux soient trop faciles, souvent parce que la difficult\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s progressive et que chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de gameplay est exploit\u00e9 au maximum de ses possibilit\u00e9s, mais \u00e7a reste tr\u00e8s plaisant.\n\n\n\n\nPour les amateurs de r\u00e9flexion et les fans de Lara.

It's a puzzle game.  It is neither the flaghsip in it's own IP (Tomb Raider), nor in it's own genre (puzzle games).  It's small, inexpensive, and you'd expect it to be unremarkable.  In fact, you'd expect to regret spending money on it.  You won't.  So long as you enter with modest expectations, you'll be pleasently surprised.\n\n\nWe're all familiar with over-hyped, big ticket, media saturating releases of games from flaghsip video game franchises for well established industry giants.  (They'd be as overinflated as that sentence if it weren't for the money and effort poured into them.)\n\nWe're also all familiar with the bug-ridden, trouble-strewn path those releases can take when post release support is yanked after a less than stellar launch.  Instead of honing a product that will continue to \"sit on store shelves\" for 5 to 20 years, and pull in money the whole time, the funding runs dry when the product doesn't perform like a summer blockbuster at the cineplex.  Unless it's a record shattering success upon release, all the money, time, and effort invested so far give next to no return.  It's doomed, because the people who do buy it can't even play it.\n\nIn that environment, a small, rather modest game released under just such a flagship IP (Intellectual Property)), \"Lara Croft GO,\" would seem insignificant.  Its not.\n\nMovie, comic book, and cartoon franchises often aim to score big money by cashing in with minimal effort spent on developing an actual product worth buying.  Often times the cost of the IP license is so great, the production, and it is a production, is hurt where it can least afford it: development.\n\nWe're also familiar with the results.  Cheap mobile games, (which rake in gobs of cash because, well, there's no justice in the world), lowsy ports, and products that are hobbled in concept as well as execution to save on development costs.  Games that feel like the digital equivelant of an RC car that drives forward, or turns to the left in reverse.  (I hated those cars.  Hated.)\n\nAnd, of course, the bug-ridden, trouble-strewn path of a big ticket, flagship IP product when post-release support is yanked due to a disappointing launch.\n\n\"Lara Croft GO\" manages to buck the trend successfully.  While it's IP's primary products, \"Tomb Raider\" and \"Rise of the Tomb Raider,\" are incredibly healthy, it complements the line by not undermining it's perception of quality.  And I would wager it does it at a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\nAnd that's the key.  When the all consuming bottom line is king, making a quality product with a limited budget is usually more than anyone can handle.\n\nGlory projects gone awry, cheap mobile games, and the infernal franchise cash grab still populate the store shelves.  When someone says \"Lets make a game of,\" they come up with incredible concepts.  But by the time they purchase the license, they seem to have money left to run the lights, coffee machine, and play video games.  Not make them.  The other extreme is a mobile game that charges $2 to accelerate a 12 hour (real-life time) in-game process that took 50 seconds in the 90's.\n\nIn between is where most franchise IP titles land.  They know the license is expenisive, they count their beans, make the most stunningly beautiful game they can, and pay the janitor, utilities, and game designer with what's left over.  The product is limited both in execution and concept.  (Ports? Janitor.)\n\n\n\nThis particular game managed to escape that fate.  Obviously it's not a fully realized \"Tomb Raider\" game.  Nor is it a fully realized puzzle game.  Instead of pouring time and money into this ancillary product, they made a smaller, shorter, less expensive game that delivers a better play experience than we're used to.  The result is a small game from a big franchise that isn't broken or doomed.\n\n\n\nThe key was they limited both scope and concept, so that they could follow through fully in execution.\n\nIn concept its a puzzle game, based on GO.  Limited to movement in four directions.  Three basic actions available: move, use lever, or interact with object.  Locked off camera (I don't think you can rotate it), 3/4 isometric.\n\nIn scope, it's got around 8 chapters, with each split into about 10 short levels.  One trinket to raid per chapter, one new outfit per trinket. 4 different cave environments, about 1 to 2 enemy types each.  About 6 interactable objects throughout.  Art is somewhat low-poly intentionally.\n\nIn execution it shines.  It becomes an adventure game that evokes the fun of playing one of the original Tomb Raider games, if it were a board game.  The levels are easy to solve, but enjoyable.  There are a few head scratching moments.  There's a steady stream of small challenges, and a surprising degree of replay value.\n\nLike the old Super Mario Bros. games on NES and SNES, it plays with the concept of exploring the world, (in this case spellunking), to unlock areas of the overworld (a main passageway) that you can see but not yet reach.\n\nAlong the way you collect pieces of lost sculpture, jewelry, and gems.  The levels play like diaramas, where everything is there for a reason, and the puzzle is in figuring out how to use each piece properly.  There's sufficient freedom to manuever through the levels, so you don't feel keyboard claustrophobia.\n\nArt wise, it evokes a limited pallete of colors, like a 256 color display, but renders it in natural lighting.  Fire, water, shrubbery, stonework, pottery, are all executed in a simple style that's rendered beautifully.  Animations are fluid and satisfying.  Lara herself is cleverly portrayed in a variety of outfits that evoke her classic original outings.  Simplistic by todays big ticket standards, but far ahead of her original polygons.\n\nAnd that's the key to this game.  Artful simplicity that belies the degree of quality.  Its a small game that knows its small and makes the most of it.  Its a short inexpensive game that plays longer than you expected, and makes you feel like you got your money's worth.  Its a pretty game, that implies more than is there, and then begins to deliver.  Its a puzzle game, that manages to transport you into a storybook-like adventure.  Except you get to see the caves, and giant spiders, and the Tomb Raider herself.

It continues the success by placing you in everyone's favorite female explorer, Lara Croft. The game channels early Tomb Raider adventures and captures some gaming magic along the way.\n\nLara Craft Go is simple in design and just when you think you have it figured along comes a puzzle that will stump you to the core. The game is broken into 6 chapters(including DLC) and each chapter has about 9+ levels with 2-4 puzzles per chapter. It's a lot of content but the puzzle area is small so you seem to constantly be moving forward. \n\nAs you begin your adventure your goal will be to enter a tomb and escape out the exit with the treasure without being snakebit, mauled by lizards, crushed by boulders or speared by ...spears. Along the path you will move pillars, jump and climb to avoid dangers while also looking for collectibles which will unlock some classic outfits for Lara. In the world you move one square at a time(left click swipe in direction) as do all creatures simultaneously. Everything acts different so learning patterns is the key. Most of the puzzles range from easy to medium difficulty but you will occasionally run into some absolute brain melters. Luckily there is a hint system built into the game that is easily accessible from a small icon in the left corner. While a lot of puzzle games continue to progress the game with difficulty LC:GO maintains a level keel throughout the game which i appreciated.\n\nGraphically Lara Craft:GO looks terrific. The game is played from an 2.5 isometric view with a painting aesthetic that makes Lara and the various environments look sharp. Background music is done well and has enough tracks to keep it fresh though most of the playthrough. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nA rare game that could turn non puzzle players into fans of the genre, Lara craft Go is a huge success. The game is practically everywhere on every device and deserving of the amount of positive reviews and this is just another telling you what you already know, yea it\u2019s pretty good. \n\nPlayed on my MSI ApachePro laptop 1080P max settings no problems\n\nPositives\n\nGood Puzzle game, not too easy or too difficult\nExcellent use of the Tomb Raider license\nThe right amount of content \nLots of variety of enemies, environments\nNo Hud, looks beautiful\nAchievements attainable without guides\nHint button \n\nNegatives\n\nNo keyboard controls", "timestamp_created": 1510949571, "timestamp_updated": 1510950114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560117", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36504686": {"recommendationid": "36504686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010409755", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511216387}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect puzzle game...", "timestamp_created": 1510632563, "timestamp_updated": 1510632563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36426833": {"recommendationid": "36426833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272950007", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513391978}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite puzzle games.

It's a level of difficulty I personally enjoy in puzzle games, requiring some thought and foresight, but never feeling overwhelming or like you're not making progress.\n\nI worked to a 100% completion which involved finding all the vases and collecting a bunch of stuff and I can't say that part was particularly engaging as it was just a bit of extra busy work.

However, Square Enix Montreal took the high road, and ended up with something much more, and also much less... at least it looked like that for quite a while. Bear with me, this review is going to be of the long-a**ed persuasion.\n\nBy taking the high road, I mean that SqEM invented a completely different environment for the turn-based puzzles of Lara Croft GO. They chose to look like an old-school platform game set in 3D, surreptitiously inserting visual extras like dynamic lighting and smoothed edges into the decidedly low-poly environment. As a result, the game's more closed-in spaces look simply very good, and then they open to beautiful vistas, sometimes containing not-yet-seen (or already seen) parts of the environments. The jungle / cave complex is rather static, so it's all the more intense when some action like unfriendly animals or giant boulders happen. Massively adding to the atmosphere are the excellent sounds like gates crashing down behind, underlining the impossibility of going back, or the restrained soundtrack that's maybe more a soundscape. In short, the game provides one of the best \"being there\" feeling I've ever encountered, and it's pure joy to walk through the game's levels, basically uninterrupted...\n...uh oh. Here's the one problem: the game is very easy. The levels of first two episodes are hardly more than walkabouts, and while the next two need a bit more thinking, they're still not harder than Hitman GO's levels. If you remember, HG provided brain excercise via extra objectives, which are completely missing from LCG. Yeah, you need to find hidden vases. Duh. So by the time you finish the four original chapters, you'll have the feeling of having completed a really superb walking simulator. And then, there are the extra episodes.\n\nCave of Fire starts out with a clever gamechanging mechanic - most of the unfriendlies are made of lava, and they revive after a few rounds. Maybe having anticipated my lines above, SqEM significantly ramped up the difficulty in the first extra episode, and as a result, the levels are very satisfying almost without exception.\nAnd finally, there's the Mirror of Spirits, the second expansion. This one again focuses more on the exploration, there are few puzzles as good as the CoF levels, but atmosphere-wise, it manages to improve on the already fantastic base game, especially when Mirror-Lara enters the picture. And that final image with the Mirror... wow.\n\nLara Croft GO has done one of the best jobs of building atmosphere and creating immersion I've ever seen in a computer game, setting an excellent example that visual design is much more important than technical brute force in graphics. The easy early levels provide with a superb sense of adventure, while the Cave of Fire requires some heavy brain work.

Themed after Tomb Raider, you will send Lara through various challenges to find treasure and avoid hazards. This was a relaxing game for after a long day of work with challenging but not terribly difficult puzzles (aside from the last two bonus missions, those were tricky!)\n\nThe controls were simple enough once you figured out how to move lara to begin with. I assume it's based off the mobile version as you have to hold the mouse and drag in a direction then let go to get lara to move a block. It was responsive and I didn't find myself accidentally killing Lara by dragging the wrong direction more than once or twice.\n\nI got it for $3.39 on sale and I got about 7 hours out of it, taking my time to find the collectibles and not using the puzzle hints to rush through.

Overall a very enjoyable experience.\n\nPROS:\n* Challenging - The mechanics start simple enough, maybe even too easy, but as the game progresses some of the puzzles are quite challenging. In terms of difficulty, there\u2019s plenty of \u201cmeat\u201d for die-hard puzzle fans like me, but there\u2019s also an in-game hinting system if you\u2019re looking for a more casual experience. (I didn\u2019t try the hinting, so can\u2019t comment on it further.)\n* Atmosphere - The graphics and sound effects are spot on. They create a captivating ambience without being distracting.\n\nCONS:\n* User Interface - The game was clearly a port from a tablet game and a tablet is still the ideal medium to play this game. With a mouse it\u2019s click-and-drag to move Lara to each space, which is tiring considering the amount of movement. Movement with the stick of a game controller is easier, but at times didn\u2019t feel precise enough. I mostly used a controller, but there were a few places where I switched to a mouse, when I found using the controller would send Lara down a different path than the one I intended.\n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS:\n* Short - I was able to 100% the game in under 10 hours. The puzzles don\u2019t change, so there\u2019s not much replay value.

This is largely due to the background artwork which fills each level which is accentuated by the removal of the pieces on a board look used in Hitman GO. The music and sound effects are still amazingly done as was in Hitman GO. The core puzzle gameplay remains a strong point in the GO series.\n\nThe 'hint' system is actually a solution system because the Steam version has unlimited hints. There are no settings to limit this so using a hint is pretty much like asking for the solution unless you quit the puzzle and re-enter after you've seen what you need to know. The UI could be improved but it works fine the way it is. Some possible improvements would be putting arrows to indicate you can select levels (when replaying to search for collectibles) or showing the relic / gem count in the pause menu.\n\nFinally, just like Hitman GO this doesn't support the keyboard sadly so it's probably a lot easier / comfortable to play with a controller (or touchscreen if that's supported?).", "timestamp_created": 1499611305, "timestamp_updated": 1499611305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33401990": {"recommendationid": "33401990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037586730", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 302, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499950361}, "language": "english", "review": "Lara Croft GO is a surprisingly good mobile port of a turn-based game featuring lara croft.\n\n+ves\n+ Good low-poly art design of environemnts and characters\n+ The story is one that Lara Croft would be involved in (i.e. some thought has gone into this, they haven't just slapped lara croft on as a selling point)\n+ Good sound design leading to a nice atmosphere\n+ Difficult puzzles in level design requiring you to really think it through\n+ Good variety in the style of puzzles\n+ Some puzzles are tricky enough that there is definitely opportunity for replay value\n\n~ves\n~ Not a platformer in the traditional sense of tomb raider games, it is turn based (I don't see this as a problem but some players might)\n~ Mobile port, so controls require use of a mouse.

The game slowly introduces new mechanics, so it's always fresh and challenging. The first few levels are extremely easy to solve, however by the time you reach the fire levels, the difficulty greatly increases.

Why on earth would you want a turn based puzzle game?\n\nOnce I'd worked out how to move Lara (dragging the mouse to the next square, which is tedious and could have been done so much better with arrow keys as well), I slowly got hooked.\n\nYou move Lara around a series of obstacles and enemies, each with their own properties to complete the level. The introduction of different objects and moves is done very nicely (you usually get to practice something before you need it). You can collect gems and relics to unlock outfits - nice to see some of the classics back again, although some of the other choices are a little baffling (presumably the same developer is responsible for the games mentioned?).\n\nThe only criticism could really be the puzzles. If you're a consummate puzzler who likes tearing your hair out at every opportunity (i.e. Hare in the Hat) then you might find this all too easy.

Each level is divided into a grid, and you move Lara one space at a time. You\u2019ll need to pull levers and push stone pillars to weigh down pressure plates to trigger moving platforms and open doors, while avoiding giant spiders and snakes, crumbling floor tiles, boulders and arrow traps.\n\nThe good\n\n-\tMost of the puzzles are intelligently designed. Solving them gave me that \u201cI\u2019m the smartest guy in the world!\u201d feeling.\n-\tThe last couple of chapters get quite complex and challenging, without feeling frustrating.\n-\tThe game does a good job of teaching the player the rules.\n-\tEvery level has hidden gems and relics to find.\n-\tIt took me 8 hours to finish each level and find about 80% of the hidden loot, which represents good value for money.\n-\tI didn\u2019t suffer from any bugs or crashes.\n\nThe bad\n\n-\tOccasionally the puzzle mechanics don\u2019t make sense with real world logic. You aren\u2019t allowed to simply wait or stand still for a turn, which has an impact on some of the later puzzles that have a timed element. Also, Lara\u2019s guns can only be used in very specific situations (you can\u2019t shoot an enemy that is more than 1 tile away). Sometimes you can\u2019t move to a tile that is next to the one you\u2019re standing on, just because there\u2019s no line on the floor connecting them. Of course there\u2019s always a solution, but you have to be willing to accept that you can\u2019t do the obvious thing and find a way to work within the limitations of the game\u2019s rules.\n-\tI would have really liked an undo move option. Sometimes I\u2019d get almost to the end of the level and realise I\u2019d made one simple mistake which made the level unbeatable, and I\u2019d have to start again from the beginning.\n-\tIf you get totally stuck, there is an option for a \u201chint\u201d, but this actually tells you the solution to the entire puzzle rather than giving you a small clue.\n-\tNo story or dialogue. I need more Camilla Luddington!\n-\tKeyboard and mouse controls are horrible. You move by clicking and dragging, which is probably an attempt to recreate the feel of a mobile phone touch screen.

Surprisingly, it runs well, and even though it was made for mobile devices, the gameplay suits the PC well. One could argue whether there is a story or not, but for the most part there are only puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles are interessting, and get progressivly more difficult as new elements are introduced, and later combined. So if you are into puzzle games, you might want to give it a try. For the most part the puzzles are smart, and as long as you are somewhat smart you should be able to clear the main game pretty easily. The DLCs however ups the difficulity a notch, however, should you get stuck, you should know there is a hint system in place.\n\nI do recommend the game, but I do dislike the fact that some of the more difficult puzzles can't be solved in multiple ways. In the beginning it's all about understanding how the mechanics work, and putting them together to solve the puzzles. This feels great, but towards the end of the game, it seems like you need to solve the puzzle the exact way the developer made it. It seems it's more about timing the boulder and the creatures rather than solving a genuine puzzle. One misstep, and you need to restart. This will lead to some frustrations. Except for that it's a decent game.

Croft GO es un buen juego de puzzle, heredero de Hitman GO en muchos aspectos de su jugabilidad pero que logra innovar y aportar su propio espacio.

I have certainly enjoyed my time with this gem of a puzzle game. Maybe its not to everyones liking, but I certainly loved playing it. I managed to play through each level several times to make sure I collected all the relic pieces and the differant gems. I also used hints at times to help me through some tougher levels. Game plays very well with Xbox controller, OR you can just use the mouse, choice is yours. I actually found using the mouse much better & easier than using the controllers right toggle stick to move the curser around collecting hidden items, so mouse was great for moving Lara and finding the hidden items. The items are hidden very well so look very carefully. [/i]\n\n[i] As far as price is concerned, its worth any price you choose to pay. Right now its 50% off so its a better deal than what I paid, but still I have no regrets paying the full price when I did.

Yes, it was obviously designed as a mobile game. It' just a really nicely done puzzle game. \n\nNow that we have that out of the way... Why do you play games? I play games for enjoyment, and I really enjoyed this game. \n\nThe art and sound is very well done. I think overall the puzzle design, art and animation is pretty true to the world of Lara Croft even if it is a lot more stylized and simple than the jaw-dropping art in Tomb Raider. I played with a controller on my couch through my steam link and it was a great way to unwind for a little while. The controls were good overall, although there were a couple of times I got sloppy with the thumbstick and went the wrong direction. I'm pretty sure it was 96% user error. \n\nThe puzzles are hard enough to be interesting, but not too hard  (and there are solutions out there if you get stuck). You need to realize that you're expected to die sometimes to figure out how things work. There's no penalty, so go ahead and just try that crazy idea to see what happens. The achievements aren't too onerous - I only had to retrace my steps a couple of times. The save points are well placed for the most part so you don't have to do too much tedious repetition to make it through (there was only one annoying level I can think of). I thought the optional \"hidden object\" part of the game where you click vases to unlock outfits and get achievements was a nice way to add a little more to the game without over-complicating it.\n\nI just finished the Mirror of Spirits and really enjoyed that as well.

With a healthy dose of scepticism I decided to give it a try .. several hours later it had me completely hooked!\n\nEasing you in with simple puzzles & tasks, it continues to build on its foundations. Introducing new mechanics, new enemies, larger maps, combining what you have previously learned & adding more & more layers to it. Granted, I found the puzzles for the first half of the game to be fairly straight forward, most still offered enough of a challenge to have to replay a couple times as you discover the nuances designed into each puzzle. Although these earlier levels are quick, there are a decent number of them to complete.\n\nWhile working your way through each level, there are also hidden items to find. Clicking on these will collect them, but as the camera is fixed, so they may only be visible from certain squares. Finding some of these offered more challenge than the earlier puzzles! Collect a set & it will unlock other outfits for Lara. Was a good addition to the main puzzle mechanics along with the few interesting achievements to unlock which are some mini puzzles within themselves. Both offer a reasonable amount of replayablity.\n\nThe automatic camera direction gives scope/depth to the levels even when small. Graphically, the retro low-poly art design looks really good, even if some of the animations are a bit basic.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=868042618 Moving on to the later levels, especially the last location of [b]'The Caves of Fire'[/b], really upped the challenge. I probably spent more time there that all the other five combined, evening resorting to the [i]occasional[/i] hint after getting stumped for way too long [b]:)[/b] The complexity of these later puzzles was impressive, & not was I expected from a small mobile game. Leaves me really looking forward to the next Chapter, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/75836429541845116][b]'The Mirror of Spirits'[/b][/url] coming soon ... & for free!\n\nOne thing I was less impressed with was the control translation. Using an analog stick on a controller, I found the movement to be very sensitive to small movements. This often resulted in accidental miss-steps. Using Steam's built-in controller customisation I was able to reduce this sensitivity to a degree, but I do not know how many times I had to restart a puzzle due to a double step or wrong direction. \n\nIt could have benefited from some more attention to translate the touch style interface into a more precise mapping with a controller. Works fine, if you are somewhat careful but could be better in my view. \n\n[b]Lara Croft:GO[/b] plays to its strengths & doesn't pretend to be anything it is not. For the price, there is a plentiful amount of content, some replayability & a decent challenge to be had. This is one of those rare mobile ports that is actually worth playing & certainly worth a recommendation!\n\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857016/]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1487558886, "timestamp_updated": 1487586830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660587", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30043563": {"recommendationid": "30043563", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982529437", "num_games_owned": 2526, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487880066}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has clean and beautiful visuals and entrancing music.

In this turn-based stylized cell-shaded isometric 3D platform game, you'll have to think, try and retry to find the right path. Enemies move and traps activate only when you move and there is no time limit here, so you can take your time and you can retry indefinitely (or bail and use the hint system).\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Cute art style that looks just as nice on PC as it does on tablets\n[*] Mechanics so self-explanatory there is no tutorial and very little text (and no actual need for either)\n[*] Hint system alleviates any potential frustration\n[*] Relaxing atmosphere throughout\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Die and retry is mandatory (though as painless as possible)\n[*] Awkward mouse controls (sliding in the desired direction is clearly meant for touchscreens, I would advise using a gamepad instead)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nLara Croft had already embarked on a journey through puzzle-adventure games with the Guardian of Light and Temple of Osiris.

new mechanics added as the story progresses. It\u2019s not too challenging but if you get stuck there is a walkthrough mode.  \n-The aesthetic is pleasing and the cartoon fashion will keep it timeless. \n-Story is told without any words but is clearly told and once you face the final boss it gives you great satisfaction. \n-Nostalgia, the game is in all respect a Tomb Raider game, the feel and look of it match that of early games being a true tribute to it\u2019s predecessor focusing on puzzles over mindless action.  \n\n\nCons: \n-The game is a port from phone. It has touch screen controls, meaning you have to click and drag as if you were playing as on a touch screen to move Lara. \n-In addition there are no hotkeys to get to restart you have to go to menu then click restart button. Not a big deal but takes you out of the game. \n-Buggy text boxes. The game has few moments where it introduces a new mechanics and it is explained with a text box however during my play through the text boxes stayed on screen for a millisecond before disappearing. \n\nGeneral Thoughts:\n\tThis game is a wonderful representation of what Lara Croft used to be, if you ever played the original games the main menu screen will tug on your nostalgia strings immediately. The puzzles are of good in complexity if rather simple at times, however the final chapter really testing your skills. The collectables allow you to unlock costumes that Lara has worn over her lifetime making them somewhat worth your time if you\u2019re a fan. The worst part of the game is the port quality and how unintuitive the controls are at the start of the game, I thought my game was broken and with no control menu you\u2019d have to look it up online how to actually play the game. I figured out the click and drag controls by sheer coincidence. The game could have been perfect puzzle game if they put effort into the port and made the controls more intuitive and given a hotkey for restarting levels.", "timestamp_created": 1484416332, "timestamp_updated": 1484446819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29197823": {"recommendationid": "29197823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302695654", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481469741}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u770b\u5230\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7248\u7684\u52b3\u62c9go\uff0c\u518d\u6b21\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u611f\u89c9\u6000\u5ff5\u65e0\u6bd4\u554a", "timestamp_created": 1484201208, "timestamp_updated": 1484201208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29164955": {"recommendationid": "29164955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134398768", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 1377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508774533}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing puzzle game with a great progressive difficulty structure.\n\nGreat visuals.\n\nA variety of different puzzle elements and mechanics that coincide with each other, overall great game, hopefully we'll soon see a Steam version of Deus Ex GO!", "timestamp_created": 1484065471, "timestamp_updated": 1484065471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29151051": {"recommendationid": "29151051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083377131", "num_games_owned": 664, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513455202}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a perfect game: awesome and stylish graphics, fluid animation, atmospheric soundtrack, consistent progression of difficulty and well-though puzzles.\n\nI think it is probably much more enjoyable to play it on a PC than on a smartphone...", "timestamp_created": 1484001933, "timestamp_updated": 1484001933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29117663": {"recommendationid": "29117663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108278798", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489590951}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really fun game, nice puzzles expecially in the second adventure.\nIt is worth buying, maybe not on full price wait for the discount and go for it.\nIf you dont want to colect everything and unlock all achievements the game can\nprobably be beat in about 4-5 hours easy, took me 7 to get all achivements and \ncolected everything.", "timestamp_created": 1483886449, "timestamp_updated": 1483886449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29102876": {"recommendationid": "29102876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978266558", "num_games_owned": 1465, "num_reviews": 231, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488665677}, "language": "english", "review": "It's weird that the Tomb Raider games are about Lara Croft and the Lara Croft games are about Tomb Raiding. This is a really simple turn-based tile puzzle game with a few basic mechanics that are mixed into very interesting combinations.

They're purely action spectacle with no dialog. Visually the game looks great. It has a low poly classic look. You can choose from a few optional Lara Croft outfits from her previous adventures. The audio very subdued, but works well in the background.\n\nInput is a little weird. The swipes are clearly designed for mobile, but once you get into the flow of the game it feels fine.

So I guess if that's an option for you, go that rout instead of picking it up on steam. \n\n2: The puzzles were a lot of fun, although far too simple early on. I realize that's just common game design, teaching you the rules before letting you dive in fully. But in truth, it takes a large chunk of the entire main campaign before they really let loose with any tricky stuff.\n\n2.5: The fifth \"new adventure\" chapter is definitely where the best puzzling is, and where about 3.5 of my 8 hours(for full 100% achievements) was spent... though a huge chunk of that was spent hugely overthinking two specific puzzles.  I've seen another reviewer mention their length to be around 5 hours, and that sounds about right for anyone who \"gets it\" right off the bat(and does everything there is to do without looking anything up... If you skip all the collecting, and achievements, I'm sure you could plow through in a couple hours).\n\n3: I'm sure the aesthetic is going to be hit or miss for a lot of people, but I personally found it to be gorgeous. The music was also perfectly atmospheric. While every aspect of the gameplay is pure puzzling, the game is designed(and more importantly presented) in such a way that it definitely still gives  a strong feeling of thrills and action. Especially towards the end of the main campaign.\n\nHonestly, this game felt like the perfect minimalist companion to the old school Tomb Raider games... and without any of those damn swimming levels to boot. Again, I recognize that it can be found cheaper elseware, but I in know way felt cheated by the 8$ I spent on it. And if you wait for an epic steam sale, it's absolutely 100% worth whatever pittance you'll end up paying for it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1481272078, "timestamp_updated": 1481272078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28266458": {"recommendationid": "28266458", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971923458", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504963098}, "language": "english", "review": "This is real Tomb Raider.

Grafik / Audio\nIch finde die Grafik in diesem Spiel sehr gelungen, da ich solche Cartoon-Spiele sehr mag. Auch der Startbildschirm des Spiels ist sehr cool, ebenfalls im Cartoon / Comic-Stil gehalten. Im Hintergrund h\u00f6rt man eine beruhigende Musik, mit dem ein oder anderen 'Plitsch - Platsch' aus Tropfsteinh\u00f6hlen oder das 'Jungelger\u00e4usch' auf Tropen-Maps. \n\n2. Story\nEs gibt keine richtige Story, jedoch eine Person, die R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen muss ( Lara Croft ). Diese werden von Level zu Level erheblich schwerer, es ist also eine Herausforderung.\n\n3. Performance\nIch habe keine Probleme mit sonstigen Rucklern oder Darstellungsproblemen. Das Spiel braucht keine allzu hohen Spezifikationen und ist auch auf einem 11 Jahre alten MacBook zu spielen ^^.\n\n4. Preis / Leistung\nF\u00fcr derzeitig 8 Euro (7,99 | 20% reduziert) eine solch sch\u00f6ne und coole Grafik zu erhalten, lohnt sich meiner Meinung nach. Es existieren 7 Level, mit je 5-16 unterleveln, was man innerhalb von 20-25 Stunden denke ich mal durchgespielt hat. Da dieses Spiel erst gestern (5.12.2016) rausgekommen ist, kann man das denke ich dem Hersteller nicht \u00fcbel nehmen. \n\nFazit:\nIch bin absolut zufrieden mit diesem Spiel, und w\u00fcrde es jedem weiterempfehlen. Gerade jetzt, wo es einen Sale von 20 Prozent auf dieses Spiel gibt. Ich denke, es werden in den kommenden Wochen / Monaten noch einige Level-Updates kommen. Super Grafik und Performance, sowie sehr sch\u00f6ne Hintergrundmusik.\n\nIch hoffe, ich konnte den ein oder anderen Steam-Nutzer zum kauf anregen, und / oder ein paar offene Fragen kl\u00e4ren.\n\nLiebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe,\nVincent", "timestamp_created": 1480947546, "timestamp_updated": 1480947546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671910", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28202706": {"recommendationid": "28202706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346947242", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490782774}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u9f20\u6807\u5de6\u952e\u5c31\u80fd\u901a\u5173\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd8\u662f\u86ee\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1480943762, "timestamp_updated": 1480943762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28202463": {"recommendationid": "28202463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156615138", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485834571}, "language": "english", "review": "I have put 20 minutes into this game and I can already tell this will be one of the best casual games I can play whenever I have nothing to do.

At first it is a bit clunky because no keyboard controls and you have to drag the mouse around, but I quickly found my way around that. After 10 minutes I didn't notice it much.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend until there is more content (and no, payed DLC doesn't count).\n10 EUR asking price isn't high, and the game is of reasonably good quality, but it really feels way too short.\n\nEdit: I updated my review and changed it to recommend, because after you complete the main cmpaign, there is actually another adventure that I didn't see at first.

The Steam release removes the in app purchases (hints are now free) and also adds controller support, which is fantastic. \n\nThe game distils the Tomb Raider format down to its essence: you'll play through a large number of small(ish) linear levels, where you will have to shoot wild animals, dodge others, and solve puzzles to reach the end and progress to the next level. The game is essentially turn-based, with enemies moving only when you make your move. You can also hunt around (using the right stick on the controller) for vases that contain items, which is great for your inner hunter-gatherer. \n\nIt's a small game that you'll probably finish in a few hours or so, but it's a pleasant experience, with great visual design, and a few fun puzzles along the way. It's an excellent way to waste a few hours and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.

En todo caso, tambi\u00e9n se nos permite jugar con rat\u00f3n, en una suerte de adaptaci\u00f3n de los controles originales. \nNada realmente preocupante, pero deb\u00eda comentarlo.\n\nEn definitiva, Lara Croft Go es un gran juego, excelente en m\u00f3vil/tablet y no menos excelente en PC, a\u00fan a pesar de la adaptaci\u00f3n del control.\nSi te gustan los juegos de puzzles, este es uno de los mejores.\n", "timestamp_created": 1516408124, "timestamp_updated": 1516408124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 562, "total_negative": 32, "total_reviews": 594}}

Harvesters for example, do you go with multipurpose workers who mine and carry like traditional RTS harvesters or stationary harvesters who leave carrying to other worksers? This is just an example of one of the decisions you can make but you can choose how you want to run your won code. \n\nSince there are infinite possibilities for a given situation you can do things in any way. Although there are countless ways to do different tasks, some code is objectively better than others, this creates different levels of play and ultimately introduces competetion, this does not make the game any less fun however as you can easily improve your code based on past mistakes.\n\nFor those who do not want to do a pvp experience, and would rather an empty sandbox or PVE I would open a private server, here you can customize the game to your every desire, you can add or disable bots that are added by the game, adjust tickrate, or even tweak any in game variables like creep lifetime if you know how.\n\nThe only bad thing I can think of is that if you do not know how to code javascript your for all intents and purposes screwed, this does not mean you cannot play the game however I cannot reccomend playing in multiplayer until you understand at least some coding basics about coding and have developed colony scripts. Until then you basicly are dead in the water PVP wise and should stick solely to the simulations and private servers. If your willing to learn to code however I can definately reccomend this game to you and it is great for learning to optimize and upgrade your code.\n\nI would like to emphasize something from my last game, THIS IS NOT A TUTORIAL, if you come here expecting one other than a typical walkthrough that tells you what to do you will likely be disappointed but that is because you simply need to learn how to code elsewhere at first. Once you have done that, definately come here.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the in game code editor makes debugging a slight form of hell, I would love it if it highlighted the point of any contention in red or at least the error message spit out something that was more specific, and easier to read and understand. As of now it does not, it only gives you a generic javascript error that makes it confusing to understand. Another point of contention is the autocomplete is very buggy, it decides when it wants to work and generally doesnt work at all, this makes guessing some of the code you can use and reference tricky unless you know what to look for. Often you cannot autocomplete code in lines and as of such have to make a fake copy out of a code statement in order to try to coax the autocomplete to work. Although these points can be nullified by the game's support for an external code editor, it does not make the issue any less prevelant in game. \n\nOverall this game quickly became one of my favorite games for coding practice, here it can teach you debugging, optimizing, and even upgrading your code. Once youve set up your initial code you can move from the initial stage of developement and initial debugging into a live test which will highlight any issues and exploits that your code preasents to others. In this game your failiures will make you sucessful, and that is something to keep in mind.

So I was really excited when I stumbled upon Screeps. The concept is great, but the execution is unfortunatly very poor.

This is ridiculous as there are maybe 10 creeps to simulate. If I compare the performance to e.g. factorio, which simulates about a million times more objects smoothly, this is really disappointing.  \n\nFurther points: the built in console is really rubbish compared to a modern Firefox/Chrome development console. Commands only seem to run at server ticks (5-10 seconds when online), very poor object printing (no expansion of nested objects).  \n\nSo even though the concept is great, the performance of both the server and client code is extremely poor and thus I can only recommend if you are not easily put off by sluggish performance.\n\nEDIT:\nThanks for your reply.\n\n@1 The code I tested with was with was based on the tutorial, so nothing too crazy going on.

I would like to clarify some points here though:\n\n1) Please note that Screeps engine executes your code every tick, and in most cases it is your code that is the bottleneck. In other words, local server performance depends not on the amount of game objects (creeps), but on your script performance. For example, if you write an infinite loop somewhere, it doesn't matter how many creeps you have, it will consume a lot of CPU every tick. If your script consumes more than 100ms of CPU time per tick, then your server is obviously not capable to run on 100ms/tick rate. This is fully in your control. \n\n2) You are free to use Firefox/Chrome console in the simulation mode, which is executed in browser. In server mode there is no way to expand nested objects, since it would require providing access to server-side debugger port.\n\n3) Server tick rate varies from 3s to 5s per tick depending on the shard, you can see this info on our [url=http://status.screeps.com]status page[/url]. Many players like this slow pace since it allows debugging in real time while fighting. You will probably appreciate low tick rate in your first combat :)"}, "38744528": {"recommendationid": "38744528", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966106251", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 33572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517711611}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell of a lot of fun.

I have no reservations about restarting because at some point I want to join the MMO portion, and I want my code to be strong out of the gate.\n\nIf you like dabbling with code, you'll love this game, but you'll want to get a job as a JavaScript developer after buying it.

Awesome. Especially without the official tutorial to lean on.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review, note artch's response below it explaining:\n\nTutorial doesn't work.\n\nI'm on my laptop. I bought the game about an hour ago. I read the reviews, and I am up for a challenge and spending some time learning a system.\n\nI installed the game in no time flat, and was really excited to start learning the objects and logic used to control the units and make things happen.\n\nTo avoid losing my free month of > 10 CPU server access, I created a local server and started it up. It had four Controllers (spawn locations) and four bots. I couldn't immediately begin playing.\n\nI looked around and found out they have a pretty handy tutorial people seem to like, and I ran it in IE. It loaded, but the game wouldn't display. All the tutorial tips would, the basic UI would, but none of the game world/pieces/whatever were visible.\n\nI was in IE, and something popped up saying they suggest Chrome for Screeps stuff. I hate Chrome. Ever since Google decided to do away with HTML associations, and make them ChromeHTML associations, and break a bunch of registry settings when you uninstall Chrome, and they left it that way for years, I've been actively opposed to them. Truly shady business practice.\n\nHowever, assuming that in the intervening time, Google might have made their software less terrible, and because I really wanted to play Screeps, I installed Chrome.\n\nThe tutorial wouldn't display anything, it just sits at \"Loading....\"\n\nSo I tried Firefox. \"Loading....\" for 5 minutes before I gave up.\n\nI logged onto another computer, my desktop instead of my laptop, and tried again. \"Loading.\"\n\nI decided I could try to do the turorial in IE on the laptop, since it actually displayed some of the stuff, but follow the instructions in the actual game, so I can see what's happening. I loaded the tutorial in IE on the laptop where it worked before.\n\n\"Loading.\"\n\nSo, here we have a game that requires learning how to play (a  good thing) but with a tutorial that simply doesn't work anywhere that I can discern, despite a substantial investment of time and energy to make their website work.\n\nI guess I'll uninstall it and go back to playing less intriuging games.\n\nStupid, frustrating problem to have.", "timestamp_created": 1514038495, "timestamp_updated": 1514403198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432658", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1514064897, "developer_response": "Unfortunately, we were having some temporary server side issues due to Steam sale.

If you're not into programming and need a GUI to place objects, don't buy it and don't leave a negative review.\n\nPlay the demo on the website to understand the basics, then buy screeps on steam. I would suggest to play on a local private server first to create a \"AI\" yourself or use one of the many github.com provided repositories **before** you active the 30 day free subscription on the server. It takes a couple of days before you get the hang of the game and get a script up and running.\n\nYou start with one room, which grows slowly and steady and as your Room Control Level gets higher, you get access to more and more structures. Towers to defend against and heal creeps and to maintain other structures, terminal to trade resources and gain in-game credits, labs to use those resources and boost your creeps. \n\nOnce you reach a higher Global Control Level (based on upgrading the Room's Controller), you can own more rooms and have a higher CPU limit (allowing you to take more time while executing your code). It all comes down to your code: how is it designed (room based, creep based, task based, operating system), how efficient is your code and how are things prioritised. Some areas are more hostile, which requires some extra defensive measurements and offensive capabilities to survive / expand. \n\nUnfortunately, the tutorial doesn't cover much more then the tower and spawn structures and you'll have to figure everything out yourself. On the plus side, this can be interpreted as an incentive to read the docs (and API docs), read blogs from others and check out thousands of public repositories on github.com. \n\nSubscribtion is paid, but it's possible to buy in-game subscription tokens with in-game credits. This could take a while tho. The same tokens are also sold/bought on the Steam marketplace.\n\nAll in all, 10/10 recommended to anyone with an interest in programming with javascript.

You can't fault the AI, for it is *you* who creates it. The penalty for 'losing' isn't terrible; if you code your scripts right, it's a simple plug-and-play into any of the game's 'rooms'.\n\nMy only gripe, and it's a very small one, is that it's subscription-based. However, you'll always be able to play if you got it through Steam, albeit with limited 'CPU'. It forces you to code more efficiently, and rewards those who do with real-world savings.

It gives you the ability and training to make your own autonomous colony, and become a global superpower! Although, with no central goal of the game being forced on you, this is really whatever you make of it. Private and community servers allow you to play with your friends or just away from the main group. The only true downside is that you should pay for a CPU subscription. It allows you to run more creeps and effectively have larger colonies, but it is not required. Without a subscription you have a mere 10 CPU, but you can work through that with a little bit of ingenuity and reasonable persistence. I myself have been working on scripts that work under 10 CPU, in fact.\n\nThere is one major issue I should address, but it's not with the game. If you're the kind of person who lacks adequate attention span, one who doesn't like to do anything that's somewhat difficult, or one who doesn't like to learn and grow as a human being, this game is not for you. I firmly believe that anyone can learn to code, but if you tend to give up at the first sign or resistance, then you should probably look elsewhere for a good time. Now on a more serious note, the game provides a tutorial on how to play and on writing code, not to mention you can play the sim mode without a CPU subscription. It's also important to mention that the 30 days of CPU subscription don't start until you've connected to the main server, so worry not about wasting it before you really grasp the basics of the game.\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful game for anyone who is willing to sit down and take the time to really get into it. If you're looking for something easy, or something that is fast paced, or you just really don't want to have to learn something new, I can't recommend this.

This game is loads of fun to play for me, but there's a bunch of things that might be off-putting to a good amount of people. One of them might be the tick rate. All your code runs per tick, and each tick runs once every 1-5 seconds (depending on the server you join).\n\nThis means, at the start of the game when you create your first unit (called creeps), you have to wait the tick duration of the server for that creep to move 1 space in the direction it needs to go (Note: The amount the creep moves will change the further you get).\n\nAnother thing is that there is no \"run once\" portion of your code, you have to do that part yourself, because all your code runs on a loop. I wouldn't even really call this a flaw or a problem, it could just be a little frustrating for some that are just getting into programming.\n\nHere's my list of cons for screeps:\n\n-Tick rates on servers can feel slow, and can be up to 5 second intervals.\n-Learning curve\n-Not many structure options until late room levels\n-New players need to pick their spawn wisely, or they can be easily destroyed if safe mode is not enabled.\n-All email alerts appear with the subject \"Screeps game notifications\" regardless of severity. (I/E: The subject for both the coding error and the hostile units in your room alert will be the same.)\n-Output in Simulation can be confusing sometimes, and can make testing difficult.

The game idea is great however the studio (which is just one guy) failed us by not hiring consultants or programmers needed to make the game a success. So the actual game fell quite short of original expectations. There are many problems, a poorly designed API for players to work with and massivly over crowded servers. To make matters worse, all of the short comings of the game only help to produce more profit for the developers so fixes are non-existant at the players expense. If you need to purchase additional resources to offset the poor implementation of the API, well that just means more money for the developer, we are more likely to see de-optimization if we see anything at all. Over crowded servers cause huge amounts of lag, but since they can keep packing us in, they dont have to spend any money to upgrade infrastructure.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game gets categorized with all the other scam games and asset flips on steam.

Screeps is a subscription-based game, where all players pay one flat monthly subscription fee, which is the same for all players. We don't have different paid tiers or any paid options in the game. \n\nWe do have a free 10 CPU tier, it should be considered a demo version of the game for those who don't want to compete with others.\n\n2.

Currently we have 3 shards with various game tick rate - from 2 to 5 seconds per turn. Not all players like fast pace, some prefer to play slowly in order to be able to debug their code in real time.\n\n3. Screeps Team is not a one-man studio, we have 5 employees working on the game currently, and a lot of community members contributing to the engine code.\n\nIf you have found any bugs, issues, or got any suggestions regarding our API - please feel free to contact us using \"Report a problem\" menu in the game, or discuss it on our forums.

I mean I enjoy the debugging and the catastrophes my code causes but this is a casual game not more and shouldn't be priced as it is priced now. That's mainly why I can't recommend it at all, not at this price. The game itself should be cheaper and the CPU costs per month are just ridiculous, yes they do say it's just on their servers but it is where the game was meant to be played and 10 CPUs are really nothing so if you don't pay the extras, you're pretty much screwed on their servers.", "timestamp_created": 1507617616, "timestamp_updated": 1507617616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632907", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35576226": {"recommendationid": "35576226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145331997", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507946292}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended for programmers and those willing to interact with programming.", "timestamp_created": 1507477257, "timestamp_updated": 1507477257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35507134": {"recommendationid": "35507134", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995190389", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 44893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3483, "last_played": 1521656498}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an awesome game, and one I really enjoy. \n\nUpsides include:\n- Deep gameplay (how much AI can you write in an RTS? Have you thought of everything?)\n- Surprisingly good initial tutorial (you don't need to know a lot of javascript to play this, any experience scripting will do)\n- A simulation mode that lets you test things out without risking your live empire\n- Multiple worlds (shards) you can play on\n- Co-op and competitive multiplayer (just make sure any allies start the same time you do), with alliances\n- Slack channels, wikis etc, and a very complete API reference mean you can usually get the answer to your question\n- Real sense of progess as you watch your empire develop - even more so if you've got the AI you wrote making its decisions and agree with them.\n- Beating another player because your AI is better than theirs is an amazing experience. So, too, to a lesser extent, is watching your AI systematically dismantle NPC invaders.\n- The community of players IN GENERAL is smart, knowledgable, and nice. Exception: the players near you are quite likely to try murdering you in your sleep using tactics you never thought possible. This isn't because they hate you, though. This is just because you're mining resources they want.\n- If you want practice writing JavaScript, this is an incredibly fun way to get that practice.\n- The ability to write JavaScript is an incredibly useful skill, so even if you aren't attracted to the game for the sake of practice, the practice will still probably be valuable to you at some point. \n\nThat said, there are some downsides:\n- This is a subscription game, in an era where there's essentially no such thing anymore as a subscription game. There's a good argument for it (your scripts run 24/7 even when you're offline), ways to play without paying a subscription (buy it on steam once, get a small amount of CPU forever), even exchange game currency for subscription time. But, ultimately, you are either paying with money every month, or you're paying with time. For some people, the fact it is a subscription game alone rules it out.\n- Combat can be brutal as a new player. While I have been doing fine, the outright majority of players I've seen start in my sector have either been murdered or abandoned their game within the first few days. TIP: if you start playing this, DO NOT start near a well-established player, as doing this means you have little chance of fighting back if they decide they want your resources for themselves.\n- It is very easy to make almost game-ending mistakes. Not got any defense AI when invaders start showing up? Aggress a player you can't handle? Left a bug in your code that causes it to fail to run properly just when you need it? Empires can fall due to tiny mistakes like these. While the tension is sometimes great, some people will find it insufferably annoying that they can lose huge chunks of progress just because of a misplaced ';' in their code. These people should probably not play this game. You have to have some patience for debugging.\n- The tutorial approaches scripting your AI from the wrong angle. While it is somewhat inevitable, given that it is aimed at new players, that it would take the simplest approach, it leads players down the path of having each unit make its own decisions. This works when you have 1 unit. Or 5 units. Or 10 units. It does not work when you have 100 units. At a certain point, if you follow this approach, you will realize that what you need is a sort of 'director' AI that assigns tasks to your units/creeps. This is a whole new level of AI programming that you will have to be willing to engage in to make real progress in this game, and the tutorial never mentions it, which is a major omission.\n- The main server, shard0, has a tick rate of about 5 seconds. This means that units only move or otherwise act once per 5 seconds. There is a second server, shard1, which has a MUCH faster tick rate of about 2 seconds. As well as newer players in general. If you are starting out, you almost certainly want to start on shard1.... but shard0 is still the default, for some reason. This might seem like a nitpick, but it actually makes a huge difference to the game to play it at half speed. Whenever you're waiting for anything... you wait twice as long.\n- This is a 24/7 game. Your empire exists 24/7. Your code runs 24/7. You can be attacked 24/7. There are few things as annoying as getting game alerts telling you that your empire is being wiped out while you're at work, or otherwise busy. Or even worse, seeing them in the morning after you wake up. You can script your AI to deal with this somewhat, but you also have to be prepared that it might, at times (rarely) interrupt your life to push you to deal with some crisis - or you might come back to an empty wasteland next time you sign in.\n- You MUST be willing to read the documentation. You MUST be willing to read a lot in general. There are some things about the game, seemingly minor (like the fact that rooms beyond a certain level attract MUCH stronger NPC attacks) which aren't mentioned in-game, but are on the wiki/API documentation. If you've read the docs well, you will know them. If you haven't, you can get blindsided when the enemies you face are suddenly 4x stronger for no identifiable reason. That's just one example - there are many others.\n- The longer you play, the less your empire changes on a day-to-day basis. You still have work to do, but progress is clearest in the first few days, where you're expanding more quickly. After that, it becomes ever more incremental until, eventually, you will probably settle into a position of relative stability - unless you are willing to go to war with a neighbor to expand further.\n\nWho should/shouldn't buy this game:\n- If you want practice writing JavaScript, or enjoy scripting things in general, definitely DO buy this game.\n- If you don't like the idea of writing code, hate the idea of debugging, or aren't willing to read around, DO NOT buy this game.\n- If you're not sure if you enjoy writing code, but are an RTS fan, I still encourage you to pick up this game and try to learn to write code - its a valuable skill and it will give you HUGE strategic and tactical insight you can use in other games. Not to mention teaching you a valuable skill in a fun way. Plus, frankly, I find it more satisfying to write the code to handle attacking, defending, etc, than I do micromanagement. If you're big into micromanagement (a la StarCraft) maybe this is not for you. If you're big into big-picture thinking, automation, etc (a la Total Annihilation, Factorio, etc) then this may well be for you.\n- If you're not sure if you enjoy RTS games, and have no experience writing code.... play another few RTS games, and try writing some other code for something, before you try this.", "timestamp_created": 1507252878, "timestamp_updated": 1507252878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862518", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35498237": {"recommendationid": "35498237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179279843", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1521365282}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\u4f46CPU\u6703\u4e00\u76f4\u904e\u91cf\u9084\u518d\u627e\u8fa6\u6cd5\u89e3\u6c7a", "timestamp_created": 1507218788, "timestamp_updated": 1507218788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35424953": {"recommendationid": "35424953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101932438", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518960943}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good game!", "timestamp_created": 1506966927, "timestamp_updated": 1506966927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35406195": {"recommendationid": "35406195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326708595", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "last_played": 1521670210}, "language": "english", "review": "For a newbie programmer screeps is a quick and fun way to get your hands dirty and have an awesome feeling of directly looking at what you built. \nFor an intermediate or advanced programmer, screeps is a treasure trove of challenges: \n- From resource collection and supply chain management to automated trading\n- From strategic base defense setup to tactical combat decisions\n- From sneaky raids into neighboring rooms to grand alliances functioning on ratified charters\n- From sophisticated, computation heavy centralized (communist?) code design achieving complicated milestones over several days or weeks, to fast and highly resilient localized greedy (capitalist?) code behavior\nScreeps has it all!!", "timestamp_created": 1506923908, "timestamp_updated": 1506923908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35373089": {"recommendationid": "35373089", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984378169", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 4188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507051921}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad gameplay design.\nNo way for new players to defend from veteran players with multiple rooms and their uber creeps....\n", "timestamp_created": 1506848409, "timestamp_updated": 1506848409, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505135", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1507101717, "developer_response": "Thank you for your feedback.\n\nHave you tried to start playing in a specially dedicated Novice Area?

Playing on the official servers is a whole other ball game, I'm sure.  I'm probably not going to mess with that for a while.\n\nI'm probably going to update this review eventually once my friends and I start getting more into the competitive aspects, but, suffice to say, I recommend it for anyone who knows how to code, appreciates strategy games, and wants a nice break from the sort of click-heavy, fast-paced titles that dominate the RTS genre.  The API is a little clunky and javascript is a poor choice of language for this type of application, but, once you get used to the environment, there are a whole host of interesting mechanics that make this game insanely fun to play.  It's complex, to be sure, but not so time-consuming as you might be led to believe---often, you don't have to do more than a quick check every now and then followed by a short bugfix or livecoding sprint to introduce a new unit type or behavior.  It's easy to get sucked into it late at night, but, other than that, pretty low-maintenance overall.  I could see playing this game with a full-time job and kids, which is not something I'd suggest about most games on the market today.  Again, that doesn't necessarily hold true for public server play, which requires payment of a large subscription fee I suspect the experience isn't worth.\n\n\n\nIf you don't know anything about code whatsoever, I'd learn that first.  This is not primarily an educational game.  That said, expertise with javascript /per se/ is optional; it's more important to have a basic understanding of how the game logic works, and ---I cannot stress this enough---to have read the manual and played the tutorial.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1504046482, "timestamp_updated": 1504046482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557696", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34589867": {"recommendationid": "34589867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011334647", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 27618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505927388}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate JavaScript.

You will have that. A lot. Like always in programing, so keep that in mind. For me, the advantages of actively seeing my steady improving code in a live environment visually outvages the disadvantages heavily. \nIf you ask yourself, can i program in this game with javascript? Can i learn with it?, i have an answer for you. It depends solely on you. You see reviews where people complain this is not for learners, others say it is easy to get into. \nI can only share my experience i had, and i tell you: I've never done anything in javascript. Nothing. I worked a little with C, with C#, PHP, and other stuff, but always just a little. Not that i would call me in anyway some expert, i don't do it for a living. And i can well maintain my colony, you just need to understand logic to program, programing language matters little as you have some code snippets in the api where everything is well enough explained (i used it almost always for everything) as well as more and more users releasing some of their starter scripts where you can copy it, use it, and then improve it to your advantages. So i would say: Go for it, go and buy the steam version without subscription in the first place. But if you know yourself you struggle with simple coding (no matter what language) or just hate to be frustrated because of syntax or non-syntax errors, as well as never haven't programmed even something basic yourself, you may as well be better without it.

I have prob 50 hrs so far prob more (at the time of making this review).", "timestamp_created": 1501299554, "timestamp_updated": 1501299637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33864043": {"recommendationid": "33864043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074385093", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 53333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504532269}, "language": "english", "review": "Screeps is an amazing game for anyone interesting in programming, logic, and strategy games.

Early on you have a lower CPU limit that you are unlikely to hit.  However you need to get your room up and running as quickly as possible.  Later on you have a CPU limit that you'll need to manager, a memory limit, while making sure that multiple rooms are being managed optimally.\n\nThis game is not intended for someone who doesn't know or want to learn code.  It primarily uses javascript and without using code you can do nothing.  Every aspect of the game from spawning a creep(your units) to making a tower attack or a creep do anything has to be coded by the player.  The game's UI allows for some things to be setup without using code, buildings' construction sites can be placed, your initial spawn can be placed through the UI.  You can select a unit and see it's memory pretty easily as well.\n\nEven though the online game is running 24/7 and the game is made to use code that is constantly automating your units you will likely always find something to do and if not you probably aren't being creative enough.  My code has gone through multiple optimizations and will likely always be getting improved.  You can also play on a dedicated private server as well.  A lot of fun seeing a slow start at the beginning and then starting on a new map and seeing how much better the new code runs and how much easier the game is with my newer better code.\n\nIf you like to code, love a lot of flexibility along with sensible limits you'll love this game.

If you can code you'll love it.  I was very hesistant to buy at first because of the subscription and a couple of bad reviews, but unless you're trying to dominate the world you can have a lot of fun from the start.  I started building good harvesters, then builders, then figure how to make them more efficient so I could have more creeps within the 30 CPU you get as a newbie.  Stuff like finding more efficient routes, not getting in the way of each other... actually use the roads efficiently, don't change paths or building targets every 5 ticks, etc.  Now, after a week and about a couple of thousand lines of code I have 15 creeps running with about 12 CPU, so I could go to 30, but my problem is I'm already using all the energy available in this room... So time to expand and go harvest in nearby rooms.

Languages other than JavaScript are supported. See below.\nWarning: building from scratch is time consuming.\n\nFirst I have enjoyed this game a lot.  Good enough that it is the first non-work programing I have done since college.  Like most good programs however this will take time, especially in getting the basic framework up and running.  Not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion but still a hassle.  If you can find someone\u2019s code that you can understand and figure out how to modify after you get a hold of the commands and API I would recommend finding someone else\u2019s already built basic functions code and modify it to your tastes.  There are lots out there and even fully automated complete ones.  \n\nBasic functions include: harvesting energy and minerals, auto build basic buildings, auto repair, auto basic defense with at least turrets and 1 unit type available,  and auto spawn units/ hopefully with a priority que or similar.  Bonus if it includes building, pathing, and harvesting in other rooms.  From there you can tweak the code for optimization all you want and build your custom units/defense and plan your expansion/domination.  It takes a bit of the fun and challenge out of it but it will save your countless hours.  At the time of this writing I\u2019m 75 coding hours into my session and i have only managed to do basic harvesting of energy, build, repair, and poor spawning method without a que yet.  I have much planned and could probably spend the same number of hours optimizing the pathing and functions of the units I have without even getting to defense or attack.  \n\nSecond, I bought this game without realizing that it has a free version which disappointed me as, more than a week in, I have not passed the free 10 CPU limit on the main server so I\u2019m pretty much wasting the extra CPU I paid for.  Check out the free version, get your basic code setup, as soon as you are happy with the basics move on to the main server.  Honestly I\u2019m not even ready for the main server yet but I wanted to give it a go anyway.  you can do almost everything in simulation with unlimited cpu without paying so I would suggest you do that and then if you want to go to the main server and you need the extra CPU buy it them.\n\nThe game is written in JavaScript.  The steam client version has a built in IDE for JavaScript but it could be a bit better.  That is mostly JavaScript's fault however.  I would recommend looking up articles about TypeScreeps.  It shows you how to code in your own IDE with TypeScript for screeps which is a lot friendlier for programers, especially beginners.  There are setup instructions and everything out there.  More importantly it supports some other languages via conversion and even a portion of c natively for pathing and some other stuff so if you would rather use those then I would recommend it. Honestly the steam client version vs acess via web browser is that there is no setup on your computer to do.

I've been looking for a programming based MMO ever since I was introduced to a game called Asheron's Call (now shut down) and the ability to use plugins to script bot control. It was rudimentary, but fun.\n\nScreeps is near exactly what I've been searching for, but it isn't without its caveats. I've been growing, testing, and refactoring my code for some time now, and I can say that it is worth its full initial price, though I happened to pick it up on sale. The API is well documented and thought out.\n\nWhat needs to be said though, is that in its current state, you are better off testing by running in simulation mode, than on the public server (you could also run your own private server for testing). The average tick time on the public server is around 4-5 seconds, where in simulation mode, 100% speed runs at 1 second per tick. As you can imagine, this could make it hard to iterate your codebase. \n\nThere are some plans that have been made public to upgrade the servers, so only once those plans come to fruition would I reccommend purchasing a subscription for extra CPU - if you need it. You may find that if you only plan to expand to 2 or 3 rooms that the free 10CPU you get with the game is enough to sustain you, if your code is efficient enough.\n\nOverall, its a unique game you won't find anywhere else, it is truly in a genre in its own. That can't be said for many other games today.", "timestamp_created": 1499262297, "timestamp_updated": 1511600512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33203532": {"recommendationid": "33203532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046445443", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505847846}, "language": "english", "review": "Screeps is the first and best game I've ever found for programmers. I can get absolutely lost in the gameplay for hours (I.E. writing code) and you can even play the game from the website with no download, so I find myself checking in and making slight modifications to my scripts throughout the day on my mobile phone. The API is very well documented so it's incredibly easy to jump in, and building up your code base can be extremely gradual or very quick, so it's great for experienced coders and for those learning.\n\nI go to work and program in PHP, HTML, and JavaScript for 10 hours a day and yet when I get home, I find myself able to continue programming JS for Screeps for another 4+ hours; just can't get tired of it! This is an absolutely wonderful game for both experienced and nooby programmers. I highly recommend it!\n\nSince this is a review after all, I'll give my one criticism: they do run your scripts 24/7 on a server, so there is a subscription fee for the game. This makes it feel slightly pay to win, because if you play for free you get way lower processing power for running your scripts.

The API to the game is far from being modern and ugly as shit (passing const numbers to functions to alter their behaviour all the time, checking for errors as expected behaviour (eg. do check whether a unit is out of range check for a returned ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE, instead of having - say - a method to check whether you are in range), you are required to give unique names to all units (why on earth would you care for their names?) etc.etc.)\n3. The buildin functions are badly programmed. Eg. you can tell a unit to go to a specific spot and the pathfinding will be done by the game - it will be done on every tick though, even if the old path would still be valid! In the process it will often swap between different paths, many of which are not even shortest paths! It is no wonder you have rent additional CPUs to do anything with such internals (+ point 1).\n\nAll in all I am very disappointed. I was very excited when I first saw the description of the game.

They did make a twitter announcement to switch to pixi.js / webGL which should help tremendously). Has some limitations I'd like for them to close in terms of code, but I can code around it np so whatever! There's also lots of resources available (tutorials, api, blogtorials), open source github AIs, and a very active slack. Overall though there is tons and tons of content already.\n\nYour programming ability far far far outweighs this CPU thing. Don't worry about it (I did). Also there's a market place anyway, but that's more end of game. Also seems the more levels you gain (which are tied to achievements per life, and permenant on your account) the more your CPU limit increases (up to 300 max).", "timestamp_created": 1492459225, "timestamp_updated": 1492459607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31187733": {"recommendationid": "31187733", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981987030", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475725277}, "language": "english", "review": "great concept, It remember me the work of the AI class. \nThe only problem is the js language of designers.", "timestamp_created": 1492379927, "timestamp_updated": 1492379927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31185092": {"recommendationid": "31185092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124961239", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519501906}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0428\u041e\u0411 \u041d\u0410\u041f\u0418\u0421\u0410\u0422\u042c \u041e\u0411\u0417\u041e\u0420 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0451", "timestamp_created": 1492370431, "timestamp_updated": 1492370431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.302746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31116761": {"recommendationid": "31116761", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992747290", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 28142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503068324}, "language": "english", "review": "I found this game only 5 months ago and it is amazing.

How they are assigned to tasks and how would you set this up? Did you ever imagine how would you manage those tasks, and hand them over to free people? Or maybe you wanted to write your own strategic game, but you don't like this part of a project when you must write boring things instead of creating AI and logic? If the answer to any of those question is YES then stop reading, just buy the game.\n\nFor me the game is great, and I love it. Documentation is great (although I would prefer to have it in the game). You can even easily integrate with your IDE of choice (although I'd love to see some autocomplete libs for them, that are not out of date). \n\nThe game is perfect for programmers. Not only it will give you a nice set of challenges, but it has a spot-on focus on optimisation when it comes to so-called \"CPU subscription\". I truly believe it may train some great programmers. \n\nNow, what if you are only a beginner? What if you don't know node.js? What if you have never programmed before? I'd like to say that the game has enough of tutorial for you to skip this obstacle, but I am afraid it's not really the case. Don't get me wrong: if you are patient enough you will make it. But it might be hard and it may require some reading outside of the game, especially about Node.js environment. If this is not a scary perspective for you not only this might be a good purchase but also beginning of great career path. \n\nWhat would be great is when the devs would give us API to create better visuals (e.g via workshop) and maybe to play more with the notion of creating RTS instead of playing one. Maybe some modes where someone could play against other human player using community-created AI? Man, the sky is the limit. I'd like to see this game do well and play more with the conception.\n\nIf you read up to this point and you are still not sure just try the tutorial online.

If you really dive into this game, you'll need a pretty expensive subscription later on, which is one of the major downsides of this game.\n\nEssentially this is a real-time-strategy game, except that you program all your units entirely and have no other way to control them. There are no limited rounds or anything, you just fight till you get destroyed, then you respawn somewhere else, start from scratch, rinse repeat. Essentially a fight of who is the best programmer.\n\nThe graphics are the bare minimum you need to see what's going on, and could definitely use some improvements. The integrated IDE (Atom) works, but you can also use your preferred one instead. Which is about all you can say about this game aside from the programming aspect.\n\nScripting itself is done in JavaScript, which is not the best choice for such a game, as it is inherently slow, yet execution speed is one of the resources you need to manage. The server itself is also written in JavaScript, which reduces the tick time to something around 2.5 seconds on the official server. Good thing this game is simulated even while you are offline, as it can take days at this crawling speed to get things done.\n\nThe API is ok-ish and works for the task, but could use some polishing and additional functionalities. One of the bad things is that you are forced to divide your code into functionality and persistent storage, which makes a lot of code constructs impossible or very difficult. And then re-initializing your structures every game tick from memory eats a good portion of your limited execution time. This should definitely be improved.\n\nAside from the flaws this game is however surprisingly fun. The concept is simple enough to to start immediately, yet leaves enough \"secrets\" for you to discover. Every time you have your new version of your world-dominating script online, you find new ways of approaching things.

If you get through it and still want more, then buy it. \n\nLastly, learning programming can be challenging and you would be suprised how many experienced professional devs have to look things up daily. Learning how to learn and get past a challenge is one of the main skills a good dev has, and if you give up easily, then you'll find it very hard to get gud at programming.\n\n\ntldr; great execution on the concept, but design choice is not for me.

I have faded knowledge of c++ and have dabbled in many languages such as python, php, javascript, perl and so fourth, never realy making anything usefull with them and definately never stuck with any of these languages long enough to say I know them but I am no stranger to programming subjects.  Ive partialy read many books on the subject but never had the drive to use the language long enough to gain real experience.  Now that I am changing careers to a full stack web developer I have to know javascript and this game has given me the hands on practice while making me crave more.\n\nUnlike other games that feature programming this one uses a real world programming language.  The documentation covers everything and the getting started tutorials were not boring like other games are.  The ingame code editor leaves many things to be desired while being enough for most people to get the job done, you can use your own editor or Ide such as sublime, atom and more.  I do not regret paying $17 for this game and will purchase a subscription when my 30 days is up.  \n\nI generaly hate games that have subscription systems but this one is different, you don't have to subscribe to play and if you subscribe to increase your CPU limit I belive this to be a very fair trade because servers are expensive to run and maintain.  Also by subscribing you are funding a game you belive in, and the developers.  If you look at the screeps source code you will apreciate the skill and time that these programmers have invested to make this awesome game.\n\nCons:  If you use your own editor / ide it seems the game periodicaly prompts you to replace your local script, as if somehow the code you write is not always being synced to the cloud.\n\nAs of right now you are limited in naming your creeps, you either have to supply a name at creation or let the game pick but It would be nice to have more options, such as being able to change their name later, or supply a prefix argument or even format rule that the game will use to name your creep.  I can live with it though.\n\nYou will spend more time playing this game than you should and that can cause problems for you if your not careful.\n\nPros:\n\nWell documented/ supported\n\neasy to get started, lots of githubs and other users sharing code and even video tutorials,\n\ncross platform (windows, linux, mac),\n\nyou will feel better about yourself.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488319366, "timestamp_updated": 1488319366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30243267": {"recommendationid": "30243267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011513057", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 153570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508950909}, "language": "english", "review": "As a programmer and a gamer I'm currently hyper addicted to this game.  I was hesitant about buying it because I was worried it would feel too much like work.  Delightfully, it doesn't at all.  It feels like I'm in the honeymoon phase of writing a game where the engine and all the assets are done and I can now happily tinker away at AI for the game.  \n\nThere is a very light touch of Eve Online in this game, where every player shares the same world, there's a market, and a real sense of distance and scale.  There is offline progress, and the excitement of getting up the next morning to see how your creeps did overnight.  There is \"city management\", optimizing how resources flow through your base(s).  Creeps are born, they die, and there is a constant need for resources to maintain a lively base.  There are occasionally NPC raids to keep things interesting, but they stay in one room and if you're not prepared for them, don't worry, they die from old age and you can start anew.  \n\nIn this game, progress is your code, and your global level.  Your base is just a means to those goals, and if you happen to get wiped out (I haven't yet), you keep both your code (so you can start up a new base quickly and efficiently with minimal intervention) and your global level (which determines how many rooms you can claim and how much cpu you can use).  \n\nA fair review lists cons as well, and I can only think of two.  (1) There is an awesome feature which lets you replay the history of a room (so you can watch the entire night's goings-on at fast-forward pace if you want to) but there are unfortunately numerous gaps in the history due to bugs.  And (2) the MMO world ticks at a slower rate (once every 2.5 seconds or so) than private servers can (once per second, or even faster with caveats).  This is because there are so many players being processed simultaneously, even while offline.\n\nOverall, I'm hooked.

Il ne vous reste qu'\u00e0 optimiser votre code un maximum et \u00e0 vous contenter de d\u00e9fendre une \"salle\" ou deux au mieux, ou bien \u00e0 jouer en solo sur serveur priv\u00e9. \n\nPour avoir le plein potentiel ludique du jeu, l'abonnement est de rigueur. Les tarifs actuels sont au mieux sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 6 euros par mois.

You start with super simple tasks such as mining or spawning more creeps, then you slowly add features like dedicated harvesters, haulers, etc. Each feature building upon the last either adding functionality or more efficiency. The game is extremely deep and the number of things you can do (and the ways to do it) is huge. Despite this each task is simple and quite easily tackled (in theory, you could spend days making it 'perfect' :p). \n\nMy only wish was that it explained a gave more information/tips for how you should select your starting room (other than at least two energy sources), something like pick sources that are closer to your room controller to make your RCL/GCL increase faster in the early game.\n\nStill not sure if I'll be buying a CPU subscription since I'm still 23 days away and the private servers seem a lot more appealing to me (set the tick time to .5 seconds instead of the 2.5s on the main server)\n\n[As a note I do have several years of programming experience in half a dozen languages (but not javascript).

This game, as far as I know, is the only one of its kind. You play by coding little workers to execute tasks and create bases.

Screeps is a great way to learn JavaScript if you have experience coding in the past, however, I would not recommend that you purchase Screeps without basic programming knowledge. The game itself plays smoothly except for occasional lag when viewing the world map and other players' rooms. The tick speed is a little on the low side which slows things down a bit and the graphics are meh.

Screeps existe, et c'est sans doute le jeu qu'il vous faut.\n\nScreeps n'est pas un jeu. Screeps est un environnement dans lequel on joue. Un peu comme minecraft. Il y a bien quelques objectifs, incarn\u00e9s par les \"leaderboards\" et les \"levels\", mais en vrai, vous pouvez y faire ce que vous voulez tant que vous gardez votre dernier spawn en vie. Si jamais il est d\u00e9truit, aucun probl\u00e8me, vous pouvez le reposer (vous pouvez m\u00eame le reposer exactement l\u00e0 ou il \u00e9tait).\n\nD\u00e8s lors que vous avez une entit\u00e9 en jeu, votre script d'IA est execut\u00e9, et peut ainsi donner des ordres aux entit\u00e9s. Chaque ticks, votre IA doit piloter les entit\u00e9s en leur ordonnant des actions (move, transfer, harvest, attack, spawn, etc).

Certes, on peut jouer sans limite, (gratuitement) en simulation, sur un serveur priv\u00e9 (au moyen du client steam seulement). Mais pour jouer dans le monde officiel avec les centaines de joueurs, sans payer, c'est mort, tu peux pas tout automatiser. En fait, je crois bien que c'est pay2win, puisque tu peux jouer sans payer, mais tu peux pas gagner sans payer.\n\nVoici pour illustrer le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de mon experience personnelle : \n - On m'a offert le jeu ( mon ami savait que j'allait adorer, il avait raison )\n - J'ai commenc\u00e9 en simulation, puis j'ai spawn une premi\u00e8re IA \"farmeuse\" dans le World, en qu\u00eate de GCL. Je ne joue que le week end, je passe beaucoup de temps a regarder les bases des autres qui ont l'air super forts.\n - J'ai atteinds la fin de mon mois gratuit, mon IA ne s'execute soudainement plus qu'un tour sur 2 (elle utilise en moyenne un peu plus de 10 cpu par tours, car il manque des optis ici et l\u00e0, trop peu de sauvegardes en m\u00e9moire, pas toujours lazy...)\n - Je setup un serveur priv\u00e9 dans le but de m'en servir d'environnement de test pour optimiser mon IA et tester les performances. Je m'y amuse beaucoup plus \u00e0 developper mon IA (plus rapide, pas de voisins partout)\n - Quand je retourne voir ma base dans le World, je vois que je me fais attaquer par le joueur GCL4 qui a spawn dans la m\u00eame noobyzone que moi, qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout impl\u00e9ment\u00e9 (terminaux, labs, links, remote harvesting, etc).

I found it accidently while browsing the steam store. At first it looked like nothing. A game where you program creeps (more like ants) to collect resources and build stuff for you. I was wrong.\n\nIt turned out to be an MMO with a world full of players, all of which are programmers from all walks of life.\n\nWhen I first tried the live demo, my Javascript skills were extremely rusty. Last time I did any real JS work was back in college. I found myself googling lots of JS-related \"how to\" and after a couple of hours I finally had a working AI that could build and use harvesters. At this point I bought the game and never looked back since. \n\nIf you want to start learning Javascript and need a fun way to do it, or want see how your skills hold up against other programmers, you'll like (maybe love) Screeps. Literally everything in the game can be controlled via your Javascript AI. Construction, resource-gathering, defense, attacking, trading, alliances. You name it, your AI can control it. \n\nThe tick-rate on the MMO side of the game isn't crazy-fast, but that shouldn't be a problem if you're not sitting there watching time slowly pass by, because that isn't what this game is about. It's about making an AI that can pretty much play the game for you and beat other people's AI. But if you really want a faster tick rate, you're also able to host your own private server and configure numerous options, including the tick-rate.\n\nThe game is newb-friendly. You'll be given the option to spawn in \"novice\" rooms, which likely have other newbies nearby, as well as receive a safe-mode each time you (re)spawn, which protects you for a short time against attackers.\n\nDeath/losing is another thing the developers managed to get right. Getting beaten by another person's AI feels more like a learning experience instead of an annoyance. Each death reveals a weakness in your AI that you can work to improve over time. Every room in the game records its history, which you can replay to see what went down while you were away.\n\n11/10 - Probably the best accident I've participated in. Also the must fun I've had re-learning a programming/scripting language. :)\n\nEDIT 02/02/2017 - Having been around for more than a month now I can truthfully tell you, the developer really does support this game to the best of their ability. Despite not being early-access, there are some pretty big things on the way.\n\nIf you're wondering why my play time is only 12 hours, its because I mostly play via a browser.

There is no equivalent to the campers in ego shooters here. ALL tutorials on the web where they could copy their code from eventually stop somewhere. That's where skill kicks in. That's where the bad apples get weeded out.\n\nI'm not saying people here are super 31337, what I'm saying is they're dedicated!\n\nLet me finish with a little anecdote:\nJust today I fixed a HUGE bug in my code! I had a nested loop where I didn't need one. That thing ate up ALL my CPU! \nWanna hear the worst part? That bug was there for 5 days straight, but only started affecting me yesterday. And I think to myself  \"damn, I didn't change anything, what is going on?\"\n\nThe sense of accomplishment is GREAT when you fix such things, because you build your code to the BEST of your knowledge.

And try the free tutorial before you buy the game (I am still running code that started out based on the tutorial code, 2 months later).\n\nThe game has deceptively simple visuals, but a lot of increasingly complex systems that you gain access to as you progress within the game, providing interesting challenges for your programming ability. How complex it ends up getting depends in part on how much of it you end up wanting to automate. Pretty much anything you can do, you can get your code to do for you.\n\nLike most programming, you are going to want to look things up in the documentation, which covers all the different elements your code can interact with, and has examples for most functions.\nI also highly recommend joining the excellent and helpful community on the Slack chat.\n\nI recommend that new players spawn in the green novice areas around the edges of the map, so that any combat you get into is at least with someone of relatively similar power to you, instead of getting wiped out on a whim by an established player. You will want to get a tower and some defensive code up by the time your safe mode ends, and remember you can activate another safe mode from your controller if you have any available.\nYour main progression is your continued improvement of your code, most players respawn a few times.\n\nAs for what I think of the game, I love it!\nThis game has really reignited and fueled my passion for programming unlike anything before it.\nThe learning curve may be a bit steep, but that is part of the fun/challenge.\nThe community is great, and I spend a lot of time chatting on Slack and helping people with their questions and figuring out problems with their code. :) (helping people is optional of course, but I enjoy doing that)\nThe developers are pretty responsive, and are continuing to improve the game, and fix issues that may be raised by the players.\n\nI find the subscription model fairly reasonable, and it is even possible to fund your subscription through your in game activities if you are reasonably good/developed. Though some choose to take on the additional optimization challenge of playing without a subscription and the additional limitations that gives.\nBuying the game on steam also gives access to private servers, which is an alternative/additional way to play the game, and is a good place to test your code before deploying it to the live server.\n\nEdit: A year later, I'm still really enjoying this game. It continues to get updates, and even some pull requests submitted by players get merged. Recently I have been enjoying implementing more complete automation in my code to participate in community-arranged bot arenas where players spawn into a small map with all interaction disabled except for the initial code upload, and the code has to do everything on its own and try to beat the other players' code at what ever the goal may be for the round. :D", "timestamp_created": 1480427592, "timestamp_updated": 1511744529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28025203": {"recommendationid": "28025203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962284163", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 14173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516471324}, "language": "english", "review": "Once in awhile my creeps will survive through the safe period.", "timestamp_created": 1480398354, "timestamp_updated": 1480398354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28024598": {"recommendationid": "28024598", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994317691", "num_games_owned": 784, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 34107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520477283}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

You could learn the basics using a seperate course, and this would help with learning javascript, but don't use this soley to learn. \n\nI'm used to programming(Using GML(game maker language), Visaul basic and C#), but completely new to javascript\nI'll describe my expenrience with it:\n\nSo, I played the web browser tutorial after descovering this game and was like \"cool, I'd play this\". Bought the game, found a nice little spot with 2 energy sources in one of the \"Novice area's\". At the start of the game, your room is in \"safe mode\", meaning you can't immediately get picked off by hostile enemies, so they reccomend building your base and some defenses during this time.\n\nI spent 4 hours setting up the harvesters, upgraders and automatic spawning, I had to manually spawn for a little while after cause I messed up the auto spawn and I was getting to grips with javascript. I also had to keep tinkering to make it a little more efficient. \n\nI checked back on it at the end of the day and found that my upgrader's werent spawning, so I panicked and spawned another. If you don't have a creep actively upgrading your controller, you lose control of the room and can't build in there, so make sure this is one of your first priority's.\n\nAfter this, I started some code on builders the next day, I had the most bashed togethers builders ever due to me not knowing how to use the 'memory' variables. They travel to the source, grab one bit of energy instead of filling till their capacity. then wander over to the first construction site that was made to build it,then spend ages walking all the way back. \n\nMy harvesters harvest one specific energy source, so I've set the builders and upgraders to the other one, conviniently the other source is right next to the controller I'm supposed to upgrade.\n\nThe day after, I made my builders build on the closest construction site to them, meaning I got some roads near each source quickly.\n\nCarried on building up my base, and decided to be a bit cheeky and invade some base that wasn't stocking a tower that defends them, my unit's chanting \"VICTORY!\" as I destroyed their resources. After this I proceeded to another room and invaded that.\n\nOverall, I'd really reccomend this if you enjoy programming, may get a bit of getting used to but I enjoy it, might be because I also enjoy dwarf fortress.\n", "timestamp_created": 1480091033, "timestamp_updated": 1480091033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27468498": {"recommendationid": "27468498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035864438", "num_games_owned": 666, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491307910}, "language": "english", "review": "Really interesting.

It's become a problem. If you like programming, get it! It is an RTS game that you program and optimize yourself with the goal being that your AI is self-sufficient. The game runs 24/7 online on a single server to duke it out among players. Versatile creeps, constructed and customized from 7 unique parts and up to a max of 50 appendages makes up your force. Make guys that mine, chop, shoot, build, or whatever you want within the JavaScipt API. There's just something satisfying coding something, then immediately watching something happen (or maybe not happen). Tutorial walks you through gathering resources, autonomous respawning, building, turrets, and upgrading. Other than that there is a chat and the internet! \n\nScreeps.com features the full tutorial for free and play afterwards in that simulation room as long as you want. Steam edition allows for unlimited single player sandbox world vs AI, unlimited private server, or access to the single MMO world. CPU subscription basically means in MMO you get 30 days of 30 starting cpu max, capped at 300, rising by 10 per Global Control Level (Account XP basically). CPU is essentially amount of code used per turn, such as how many creeps you can have simultaneously. Otherwise if you don't subscribe after that it is 10 starting capped at 10 permanently which kind of sucks but its only on MMO server. I saw someone mention code for an enemy AI was available on Github but never found a link.\n\nMy recommendation if you are new to programming (I would do at least a course in programming or the JavaScript tutorial linked by the game before playing) is to go through tutorial (obviously) then take the code from the respawn AI tutorial 4, and the constructing buildings in tutorial 3. This will let you get guys gathering resources, upgrading, respawning, and building while you perfect your code and/or rewrite the tutorial code. th_pion also did a pretty long tutorial series I just found, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edBMmOAfJ-Q&list=PL0EZQ169YGlor5rzeJEYYPE3tGYT2zGT2\n\nEDIT: Saw an old offer for lifetime cpu subscription and that would be awesome to do again as an anniversary deal or something, although I know it was a backer offer.

If you are an expert in some of the other languages that can be compiled down to JavaScript, there is some support for Scala, Fsharp, Dart, CoffeeScript, TypeScript and clojurescript etc. I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to implement the game in other languages if you prefer.  I see the potential for this game as a teaching software but I also see it as a really fun Video game. As a expert JavaScript programmer, I had no problems reading the admittedly skimpy documentation and building some fairly complex AI systems. \n\nThe Cost to play the game could be a gate to stop some people from trying it, but unlike other Sub based video games, you cost is actually justified. The actual CPU/Server cost of hosting this many javascript game loops in a concurrent real-time system is pretty steep. Also, if you want to try the game, just go over to their website and play through the tutorial and simulator.  This will give you a decent idea of if you like this style of game or not. \n\nThere are many ways to approach this game.  You can build an AI system that dynamically shifts based on the rooms you are in and the events that are happening in the world that you can see.  You can choose to make a set of AI that uses just a bunch of simple If/else statments or build up large classes and prototypes.  You can completely overhaul and create your own methods that help you accomplish things that aren't currently in the API. Having to script on the fly when a player attacks you can be quite a bit of fun and can be a bit intense.  \n\nOverall, I can certainly recommend Screeps but only to people who have a solid understanding of programming. If you don't have at a basic understanding of JavaScript or programming in general you might find yourself a bit too lost to be able to fully take advantage of your free first month.

To thoose on the fence regarding programming background - I took a few programming classes in college (6+ years ago), but haven't done anything with it since. I did the tutorial for Screeps, and went through some of the free javascript courses and was able to get into it. The first couple weeks were a struggle as I got all of the syntax down (and was killed once), but since then my code (and knowledge) has grown a lot. Those who are already experienced programmers can get into it a lot faster, I'm sure. \n\nThe fun of the game primarily comes from first figuring out how to get things done (holy crap my creeps are actually mining energy and returning it to make more!), and then for optimizing it (uh oh my creeps are mining energy but are blocking each other....). There's also a flourishing alliance system, with wars being declared on other players/alliances, with WW2 blitzkrieg attacks overwhelming players in a matter of an hour or two, to established alliances/players nuking and fighting back and forth for days at a time, a war of economies and attrition. \n\nLike most multiplayer games, the game will be what you make it. Join the active slack chat, interact with the players/neighbors, ask for help, and it will be a lot of fun.

I have a diploma and a degree. Started building computers around the age of 8 with my father.\n\nDuring my degree, which I just finished recently, I had to program a lot. Most of the time what I would program was for class, so not necessarily useful or interesting. That made me lose a bit of interest in coding. I know many languages and I've gotten to a point where I feel like I can learn any new language. It's just a matter of syntax, I already have the logic dialed in.\n\nJavascript is the most used scripting language on the web. Needless to say that I had to do a lot of it during my degree. I have worked with the framework upon which the game is built: NodeJS. Even made my own chat-server with NodesJS. It was built by google and can be very good for asynchronous operations. I have yet to implement asynchronous functions in screeps but I'm planning to use memory and callbacks to minimize CPU usage.\n\nAnyway, I diverged a bit there, my main point was that the work I had to do during my degree made me lose my interest in coding a bit.. okay maybe more than I can admit. But Screeps, I must say thanks. Thank you to the developers, this sparked my interest back. I am constantly thinking about algorithms, that's where I want to be, using my brains.\n\nI wake up in the morning thinking about my creeps, my new-born AI, how I need to check if everything is going alright. I have all sorts of designs and I cannot wait for the private servers to be available. Definitely going to make my own.\n\nI 100% recommend this to anyone, but my opinion is a little bit biased :P. Steep learning curve if you don't know programming but sooo worth it. Learn how to code in fun.\nMy advice: when you don't know the javascript syntax then google \"javascript function\" and find your answers directly in the javascript documentation. For example array.sort() doesn't belong to the screeps libraries but to javascript. Learn to see those things. (If you can't find it in the Screeps documentation it most likely belongs to javascript)\nWhen you don't know what is going wrong use the console: console.log(whateverisuseful). Debug your code.\nWhen you don't know something about the screeps classes look at the API documentation on support.screeps.com. For example everything you need to know about creeps is in the documentation. Every single property the creep has and every single function. Every single body part you can give... Error codes are listed and even sample code for each function is under the ... \nSame for structures.. Everything is there, you just need to read it carefully and use it with your code. Don't trust people who will not take the time do their homework and who give poor reviews to this game. The documentation is very full and the game is fantastic.\n\nI have played everyday since I got the game and I am pretty sure there was an update every single day.(Today that is three days) The devs are very busy and the game is very alive.\n\nIn case you are wandering about the lifetime CPU limit of 10, it's more than enough to increase your GCL(Global control level) with proper code, and the CPU limit increases with GCL. Gotta search on support.screeps.com to understand better. Basically, if you play well(optimized code and maximal usage of what's around you), you can increase your CPU limit without paying anything. \n\nA little bit more about GCL. Basically, every room has a controller which has a controller level. To increase the controller level you need to upgrade it. Every \"point\" you put towards upgrading the RCL(Room control level) counts towards upgrading the GCL. With one room you can upgrade your GCL, thus upgrading your CPU limit.\nThe GCL does not decay so if you managed to achieve a certain CPU limit you will keep that for lifetime. The one month CPU limit of 30, that you buy with the game is mooooore than enough to increase GCL and get setup for future games. Increase it as soon as you buy the game and then you will be able to come back and get setup more easily.\n\nEDIT: It seems your GCL increased CPU limit is only active while a subscription is active. So even by playing there is no way around paying. Shame.. Oh well there is still the private servers. \n\nOh if you want to see screeps videos they are a looot easier to find at support.screeps.com under \"what's new\" in the monthly \"world reviews\".(The entire screeps world gets reviewed on a monthly basis and top activity is shared)\n\nIf the CPU limit still deters you think about this: \n- EDIT: The private server is now released! You can play on your own server without limits.\n-You can also do like me and test the demo on screeps.com then decide.\n\nThis is not a game that will teach you how to program per say. It will teach you the basics of how to manipulate the world but you will learn by yourself how to program. You will have a sandbox to experiment with. You'll see your code function/or not. You'll see it grow or perish! It is very rewarding. Even just the first steps.\n\nHope this review helped! I'ma go check on my creeps :P.

(creeps are the little minions you program) So another option would be to subscribe for one month on the screeps website and get a real feel for the game and if you like it purchase it on steam.\n\nI'm waiting for the local system to come out because then i can see the real fun, of coding up A.I unbothered by anything else. \n\nSo overall it can be entertaining BUT it's a VERY slow game that you don't actually play.\n\nIf they had a ~ (meh) rating i would have clicked that.\n\n--OH BIG NOTE TO NON-CODERS/PROGRAMMERS -- \nThis game requires some knolage of programming so don't jump into this thinking it will teach you. Your best bet is find some basic programming lessions online (I suggest looking at java/javascript because thats the language used in this game) then if you get the game it will be a matter of learning the API of the game \nand slowly learning your javascript sytex.\n\n#--UPDATE--#\nSo the local server is awesome, invited friends in turned up the speed a little and love it.

A large part of your AI is the management of your economy, which becomes progressively more challenging (respawn creeps, build roads, exploit other rooms, settle other rooms, combine minerals, and so on). The mechanics feel very fun and polished, and the devs have plans to add more challenges for experienced players.\n\nAt the beginning, you control just one room, and start in a novice area where you fight for domination with other new players. The area opens up over time, becoming part of the whole world over 30 days, where you compete or trade with all other players,  and build an empire spanning more than 30 rooms. Even if you're wiped out, you can quickly reach your old strength, as the number of rooms you can settle never decreases.\n\nAs this game is one of its kind, there are a few things to consider if you want to play it: \n\nAlmost all interaction is done by writing JavaScript modules, so if you don't consider programming fun, you won't enjoy Screeps. You can start even as a complete programming novice, but you will need to invest a lot of time if you want to go beyond the basics.\n\nAlso, if you spawn close to a more experienced player, she will kill you easily if she wants. So if you're unlucky, you'll wipe repeatedly until you know how to defend your base, and where it is safe to spawn. This will be challenging and frustrating, so be prepared for that.\n\nA third point is that the progression of the game is rather slow; you will build only a few buildings each day, and settle a new room every week (up to a month later).

Unfortunately, there is no way to enable them in the Steam version, but you can use your Steam account to log into the web version as well.\n\n[quote]* Poor API documentation[/quote]\nWell, it's subjective, and many players find our documentation rather comprehensive. All properties and methods are fully documented, but we're working on enhancing it constantly. If you're lacking something particular, any suggestions are welcome.\n\n[quote]* API objects aren't unit testable (no dependency injection)[/quote]\nIt will be possible using our open-source standalone game engine, which will be available after the full release (see Early Access notes on the store page description).\n\n[quote]* software syncing UX is poor[/quote]\nThe Steam version simply commits all files from your local folder to the game when they are changed.

You love to compete with code. You like strategy games? I have good news: this game is for you! Don't let the simple graphics fool you, this game has huge depth. Essentially you are programming the AI of the game \u2013 or rather _your_ AI, competing against the AIs of your opponents.\n\nFind you starting place, decide on your strategy, pour it into code, and see your colony die, because you forgot to think about a special case leading to a deadlock when collecting ressources. Fix the bug, extend your code and find ways to do things more efficiently.\n\nMy harvesters and builders were standing in front of the energy source if I didn't use up the energy in my spawn. Blocking the harvesters or builder and upgrader. My creeps didn't get anything done over night. My colony almost died, because the builders blocked access for the harvesters, So I could not create new creeps to replace those who died of old age. Now they park at the spawn, when full, allowing free access and depositing the energy as fast as possible when needed.\n\nMy builders were first programmed to repair buildings with the least percent health. Result: Move to building (wall) repair for one tick, move to next building. In the end it was horrendously inefficient, as the builders were mostly just moving back and forth in my cell, painfully slow. A little modification et voila, way more efficient.\n\nRight now I am looking for my first prays. Yet I need to find out, how to actually efficiently fight them. Like: How only brake a small hole into their wall, walk through end get the actual objectives.\n\nI love this game.

And without even knowing it :D\n\nSeriously: \n\n* if you can already program and like RTS-ish strategy games: Don't doubt a second and buy it!!!! Persistent Open World and all :)\n* If you want to learn programming and like RTS games: Try the free demo version first (link below), check out some other players code and tutorials, and buy it if it catches you. Great learning and great fun!\n* When you like RTS games but all code looks like gibberish to you and you have no intention to change that: Stay far away from this game ;)\n\nDemo version good for everyone ofcourse, but Im saying this because the programming is really programming.... Not some simplified game version. So it will require a lot of googling if you are really new to coding, as in more than actual playing time if you want to get stuff done after the tutorial.\nThe tutorial is very helpful in providing very basic starting code though, and with some clever copy pasting you can always get quite far (pro-tip! ;) )\n\nSo the Awesome, potential turnoffs and the improvement points. The game is still in early access, i trust most the improvement points will be fixed:\n\nAwesome:\n\n- Programming! And real programming, not some simplified version.\n- Persistent Multiplayer World. And the world is regularly expanded with to accomodate new players\n- Semi-Newbie-Friendly (Semi because: Programming...). Your own zone is blocked off for about a day, and you (can) start in a new player zone that has about 25 days of protection. Optional though, so if you feel adventurous... ;)\n- Total control over your minions\n- Lots of player code available on GitHub\n- Web client so you can manage your Screeps anywhere\n\nPossible Turnoffs (Not my opinion, but will make some people not like it):\n\n- Real programming, not easy to pick up\n- Subscription for the Main Server necessary once you get a decent amount of Screeps and code (no option for private/community servers yet, but will be added in the future)\n- Very basic graphics. Might improve slightly but will never be AAA\n\nImprovement points:\n\n- No audio whatsoever. Could use a very subtle background track and some event sounds. Or triggers for us to link our own :)\n- Web client Code Entry near impossible on (my) android devices atm due to keys not always mapping correctly (and I found out making small code changes on the road is something I apparently want to do :P )\n- Documentation not always easy to find yet\n- some glitches\n\nBut yeah, great game overall! Will update review if something drastically changes :)\nCheers!\n\nWeb Trial/Tutorial: https://screeps.com/a/#!/sim/tutorial", "timestamp_created": 1467062296, "timestamp_updated": 1467067035,

The big advantage over the web client, will be the option to play on custom servers, those are not implemented yet, though. Since it is really easy to connect the accounts, I recommend starting on the web client and potentially switch to the Steam version later.\n\nThe gameplay itself is really cool. You write scripts to control your units called Creeps. Those scripts run on the server 24/7 which means the game continues playing even when you are offline. All players are on one server, on one big and it's basically a realt time strategy game. You harvest resources to upgrade your controller, which allows you to build more and more advanced buildings.

Do you enjoy learning programming languages in your spare time? Or do you want to learn Javascript but you are really not looking forward to slogging through a hundred coding examples in a five pound book.\n\nScreeps is an RTS where the only interaction you have with your creeps is code. You write every line of code that governs their behavior. That defensive tower? It won't shoot if you don't program it to. Those harvester creeps? They won't mine energy unless you code them to move over to the mine and harvest it every game tick.\n\nThe tutorial gets you through the basics, but beyond that it's all up to you. You can guide your creeps by laying down construction sites for them to build (assuming you wrote the code to have them build!), drop flags to guide their behavior (if you wrote the code that has them do something with flags!), and modifying their memory so they know what role you want them to have (if you wrote the... yeah, you get the idea).\n\nI've spent far more time in Screeps than this indicates because I've been doing most of my coding in a separate IDE. They even have hooks to allow you to pull your code directly from Github. This is a game by programmers, for programmers. Unless you already know about callbacks, inheritence, hashmaps, profiling and a lot of other coding constructs (or you are in this to learn them) then this is not the game for you. Beyond the basic tutorial, there is no handholding. It's all your code, and the unforgiving universe.\n\nThe MMO portion of the game has a separate monthly fee for normal CPU amounts, but you get 10CPU just for buying the game. This is enough to operate one or two rooms of creeps... to grow larger, you will need a subscription, or be very good at optimization. If you don't want to participate in the MMO side, local play and the ability to run your own server are planned but not yet complete (as of the Early Access release).", "timestamp_created": 1466613526, "timestamp_updated": 1466613526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23707416": {"recommendationid": "23707416", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967177551", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502523470}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been following the development of this game for quite a while and playing for a few months now on the web client, and supported the campaign to bring it to steam and opensource it in the future. \n\nLet me first get one thing out of the way: If you are no programmer, AND you have -no- interest in learning a programming language (JavaScript in this case) whatsoever, no interest in learning to code, this is not the game for you.\n\nBut If you want to learn JavaScript (or already know it), this game is brilliant though. While it does not teach you JavaScript itself (you will need to make an effort yourself to learn, though there's good online courses for it like this one: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript), but it provides a platform to experiment on, and exposes you to a rather modern style of JavaScript development via NodeJS, it does not require any complicated setup, and it makes it excitingly fun seeing the fruits of your work in front of you, not just immediately, but also over the course of weeks and months. It will give you a great platform to experiment though. You will write a few simple lines of code, and suddenly a little virtual creature called creep will walk across the screen and start harvesting energy. A few more lines, and it'll bring it back to your Spawn. A few more lines here, a few more there, and before you'll notice you will have spent hours, days, weeks coding your perfect little empire, optimizing it, trying out various strategies and ideas; you'll have armies of little creeps working on harvesting energy,  increasing your controller level, harvesting and processing minerals, defending your borders, trading with your neighbor or even waging wars against that other, more annoying neighbor. \n\nAnd ofc, even if you are already experienced with JavaScript, there's always something new to learn and try. Experiment with Grunt to prepare and deploy your scripts, write out-of-game tools to interface with the game, plot charts for the performance of your little creeps - there's always something to do : )\n\nThe game also has a great, incredibly helpful and patient community, answering questions in the game's forums or the dedicated chatroom, about the game as well as about programming in general, giving tips, sharing experience and even sharing code. Forge alliances, or start wars, it's up to you. \n\nOne last thing: You will probably not get it right the first time. Maybe not the second time. You'll scrap your code and start over. Or somebody attacks, wipes you out and forces you to start over. Thats okay. The game can be tough. It certainly isn't always fair. We all went through that. Think about the lessons learned, not so much about the progress (though you will keep your global control level forever, so you'll never loose everything). And each time, you will do better than the last time.

The subscription model. In an era where subscriptions have almost been wiped out. I think subscriptions are heavily outdated and expensive, however in this case it is justified. After all, this game is clearly going to have a fairly small niche playerbase, and they have to run servers powerful enough to run everybody's code 24/7, so relying on income from sales alone is impractical.\n\nI also let the subscription model off for a big reason. Once the game releases from early access (1-2 months from now) the devs are open-sourcing the server and allowing anybody to host their own. In doing so, the subscription model is removed and you can try your AI against friends with as much power as you like (or have).\n\nThe developers also seem to be very engaged with the community - due to its relatively small size they are able to respond to the majority or forum posts and many suggested features are added.\n\nFor those who are put off by the standard MMO playerbases, this one is pretty civilised.

Actually I'll let my github activity chart speak for me: http://i.imgur.com/MaBBLLN.png\n\nOn to the review. There is nothing else to compare this game to, it is a shiny gem sitting all alone in the genre it just made up. As the description talks about, your job is to program an AI to do your bidding in the world of Screeps. You are not alone. There are other AIs inhabiting this world, some programmed for evil, some for good, and some with tons of bugs (mine). If the idea of of a RTS MMO where you control your units, base, combat, and resource gathering 100% through code intrigues you, then you are exactly the type of player this game was made for.\n\nPros:\n-Completely new game concept that appeals to programmers or people wanting to learn programming\n-Friendly community to pester with questions\n-Well-documented API\n-Balanced game mechanics that rewards more seasoned programmers without punishing newcomers\n-A chance to be a clever bastard with your coding skills\n-Best way imagineable to learn Javascript, if you've been meaning to\n\nCons:\n-Pricing structure might be a bit confusing, subscription is likely needed for MMO play\n-Early access game, occasional bugs, mostly cosmetic\n-Pretty steep learning curve that won't be forgiving for casual players or those who aren't really into programming\n\nJust a word about the pricing. Basically you are paying to have your code run 24/7 on a remote server. In light of this, the 10 free CPU is fairly generous and would be enough to have a smaller-scale operation in the game world. Half of the fun is optimizing your code, so it would be possible to participate and enjoy the MMO from that angle. But if you want to be a kingpin in the MMO world, you are going to want a subscription, plain and simple. It isn't like Guild Wars where you buy once and have lifetime access AND be on the same footing as everyone else. I think the devs could be a bit more clear on that.\n\nIf you don't know Javascript, you are probably wondering if you should even try. Learning Javascript was actually the main reason I was interested in this game. I can't think of a more engaging way to learn a new coding language. I wish the had a game like this for all the languages I wanted to learn/maintain. There are nicely padded novice areas where you can start and learn at your own pace.\n\nIf your main interest is the RTS elements and you are hoping the coding thing won't get in the way, you'll probably want to avoid this game. You'll easily spend 1/3 of your time in a text editor/IDE, 1/3 observing the game world, and 1/3 in the IRC chat asking questions or looking things up in the API. If that actually sounds FUN to you, get this game right away.\n\nedit: as another reviewer mentioned, there is a risk-free way to find out if this game is right for you, you can do the tutorial at https://www.screeps.com/", "timestamp_created": 1466432805, "timestamp_updated": 1466452680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 103, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861004", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23667903": {"recommendationid": "23667903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120487619", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466784957}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is amazing, true if u dont know code it would be a bit difficult to get to grips with this game.\ni had never used javascript before but i am pretty good with C# C++, so im using this to learn javaScipt.\n\nif u enjoy programming or arent afraid of using your brain to play a game, then play this one.", "timestamp_created": 1466425844, "timestamp_updated": 1466425844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23666914": {"recommendationid": "23666914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006875996", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477492832}, "language": "german", "review": "Best game for Programmers and those who are interested in learning programming basics, automation and artificial intelligence!

This is good for a small group, one or two rooms and that's it. If that's all you plan on doing, which you can reach within 30 days, then you're good. However to go beyond you will need to pay a subscription fee.\n\nNow - you can also get a 30 day 30 CPU limit demo which again, is more than enough to get up and beyond the 10 CPU limit and warrent the purchase of the subscription.\n\nThus, purchasing this is a waste of funds. Go to their site, try the demo and if you enjoy the game, pay the subscription. You get nothing else with this at this point and your money is better spent elsewhere.\n\nThe reason for the downvote is that features were promised, and not delivered in the time they were promised. These features were the sole reason I purchased this version since I already had a subscription on their site. Now, I feel ripped off. But read the logic for yourself - it's solid advice.\n\n** Edit ** Changed to up vote\nThe reason for the change is because the personal servers are now available and you are no longer forced to pay a subscription to play the game. As it is, the game is really fun and a great way to get into programming.

Un mundo donde absolutamente todo mi imperio debe ser programado por m\u00ed. \u00a1Fant\u00e1stico!\n\nAunque el lenguaje de programaci\u00f3n que se debe usar es Javascript, los desarrolladores indican que se puede utilizar cualquier lenguaje que compile a Javascript, personalmente pienso que es un poco confuso hacerlo as\u00ed y es preferible utilizar Javascript desde el principio.\n\nLa curva de aprendizaje no es demasiado extrema, pero existe. Al principio cuesta un poco adaptarse ya que la documentaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda ser bastante mejorable (adem\u00e1s hay muy pocos ejemplos) y algunos c\u00f3digos del tutorial son para echarse las manos a la cabeza, pero en l\u00edneas generales est\u00e1n bastante aceptables. La principal dificultad al principio es conocer todas las mec\u00e1nicas del juego para poder trabajar con ellas y todas las clases que podremos utilizar (creaci\u00f3n de esbirros, controles de movimiento, tareas de recolecci\u00f3n y mantenimiento, etc).\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, lo veo un juego con potencial que puede llegar a ser bastante entretenido, sobre todo porque tampoco requiere tu atenci\u00f3n constante, ya que programas algo, cierras el juego y se mantiene haciendo las tareas 24/7. Este punto me ha gustado bastante.\n\nLEER ESTO (IMPORTANTE): Por \u00faltimo decir que adem\u00e1s de recomendar este juego, cualquier persona que tenga m\u00e1s dudas o busque a alguien para aprender o jugar, puede agregarme perfectamente a Steam.\n\n\u00a1Un saludo!", "timestamp_created": 1466413966, "timestamp_updated": 1466413966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766963", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 594, "total_negative": 70, "total_reviews": 664}}

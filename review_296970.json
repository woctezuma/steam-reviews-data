The basic gameplay of jumping from node to node and having events at each one is pretty good, and there is such a vast amount of content that it takes a very, very long time to experience everything that every expedition has to offer.  It does have  a non-trivial amout of repeated content because each node is a story, and certain common nodes will come up every time you attempt an expedition, but 1) the fast skip of text is on point and 2) the \"combat\" is nuanced enough with the 3 damage types and associated moods and things that it just doesn't get old.  Additionally, even though I suck hard at video games, new content unlocks after every game (at least for the first many (20+?) expeditions, even with a small RNG associated with the unlocks), which keeps things new and fresh with interesting campfire tales.

But, at the end of the day, the game just isn't actually very fun to play, and that's the most important thing about games, right?\n\nSo let's talk a little about it.\n\nIt's got a really neat system whereby your explorers have traits. Things like Diplomat or Quick Thinking or Naturalist or Survivalist. These traits have sub-traits, things like Nimble and Reflexes for Quick Thinking or Customs and Language for Diplomat. You can gain multiple sub-traits, even for traits your explorers don't normally have, a variety of ways and trying to get a team with the right mix of sub-traits (and therefore the right mix of traits) seems initially like a fun puzzle.\n\nThe unfun here comes from the fact that there are SO many traits (not to even mention sub traits) that you either make a team that can do a little bit of everything (and therefore can do nothing at all well, which is the surest route to disaster ever) or you make a super specalized team and 25% of the time you automatically succeed at whatever you're doing and 75% of the time you automatically fail.\n\nCombat is also another area that seems neat at first but quickly becomes unfun. See, tactics and proper managing of the mood system and what not just isn't enough. In fact, it's almost irrelevant (with some exceptions for when a boss becomes basically impossible to kill if you're in the wrong mood). Gear is really all that matters. Do you have amazing gear? Combat's a cake walk. With even slight attention paid to mood, you'll likely be able to do just about any combat without taking any significant losses. Do you have medicore gear (not bad, just mediocre)? You're gana get 1-2 shot and take 2-3 shots to kill the lowiest mook.\n\nParty composition is another huge issue. It seems like there's tons of options, tons of ways to make a valid party. There isn't. You HAVE to have a real healer, someone with a special ability to that heals for >100% of speech score. That means that one of your three slots is more or less required to be one of about 5 characters. Also, not only do you have to balance your crew around having the right mood composition, but you have to balance around your captian's ability as well. In other words, if you pick a Captain who isn't a healer, you have to pick a healer that matches that Captain. Since there's only about 5 choices for healer, and since not all healers are good with all Captains, you're likely picking from 1-2 of the 5. Then you're last slot has to match both your Captain and your Healer, maximizing your chosen win goal (which has to be picked at party select effectively AND stuck to all game come hell or high water), but one that also compliments them in combat AND fills in any combat weak points you may have. It effectively stops being about choosing a fun party and quickly becomes \"well, I get to choose a Captian and after that my choices are pretty much made for me if I don't want my party to suck.\"\n\nThere are lots of other issues along these lines as well. Things that seem fun at first but which just aren't. You'll spend FAR more time with this game angry at your crew for not having the skills you need/failing to succeed when you needed them too, and far more time pulling your hair out in combat because you didn't gold focus harder than you will actually enjoying the fun stories, characters, locations, and adventures.\n\nAnd that's a shame too, cause the game has so much going for it. Great music, great stories, lots of interesting (if ultimately unfun) systems, cool characters, great art, etc, etc, etc. But at the end of the day, you'll be more angry or frusterated than delighted and satisfied with this purchase. So either wait for a REALLY good sale or just don't get it at all.\n", "timestamp_created": 1518623138, "timestamp_updated": 1518623138, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39929852": {"recommendationid": "39929852", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999683581", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518530550}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very cleverly designed; an absolute joy to play if you like roguelikes, exploration, and/or tactical combat rpgs.", "timestamp_created": 1518096505, "timestamp_updated": 1518096505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39921632": {"recommendationid": "39921632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070800287", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496331964}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Chinese please\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1518060719, "timestamp_updated": 1518060719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39873041": {"recommendationid": "39873041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001732857", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517879602}, "language": "english", "review": "Rogue-like turn-based tactical-combat focused game with lots of variety in characters and strategy.

It does take some effort, but given how unique the whole experience is, it is time well spent.\n\nYou start by assembling a crew, and that in itself is quite an unique experience. At first you have 4 captains, but as you play with other characters, they are also unlocked for that role. Each character brings an unique benefit from being captain, ranging from very useful to fairly situational. There are three very viable paths to build you crew around, with them being Friendly, Devious and Aggressive. It might seem strange to be able to fight the same battles with a friendly alignment as you would with an aggressive one, but this is exactly the charm of the game. The textual outcome of encounters describes how the enemy reacted to your attitude, giving  a sense of cohesion to the plot.\n\nThere are many systems and subsystems happening in parallel, but they all pretty much feed into each other. So for example, the diverse skill pool of your characters gets supplemented by treasures found on the map, training they may receive in towns, and research that can be done inbetween missions, and vice-versa.\n\nThe game is quite replayable, as each crew will face the same challenges in a different way. It is perfectly possible to come back to a scene you've been to before and find a completely different outcome due to having another set of skills and personalities at hand.\n\nThe game also offers two very distinct modes, Discovery and Adventure. I spent almost all of my time on Discovery, which allows you to save at any time and peruse options at your own pace, also being able to negate a very unlucky skill roll, because those will happen... you have a 97% chance to accomplish a task and it fails. You just reload. That is not an option in Adventure mode, which is the original mode and the hardcore option, I guess. Back when I had infinite time for games that might have been an option, but I'm perfectly happy with Discovery.\n\nIt is charming, it is unique, and it is a good investment of your money.

It has a nice rogue lite feeling with captains to unlock. You have a good variety of explorers to choose from to create your crew of 3 explorers.\n\nThe game is also very unbalanced, building defense is pretty useless as you will use all your ressources to build a \"tank\" that will be easily destroyed anyway. To give an exemple, someone with 100 in resistance (which is huge) on the last map will be hit for about 15, when someone with 0 will be hit for about 25. This is totally useless to invest in it, since with 100 offensive power you will oneshot pretty much anything. And even if you want to get a tank to soak all that damage, it's useless because ennemy characters will focus the lighter ones, totally ignoring your tank, and you can't do much about since all good characters can attack through you anyway.\n\nThe downside of the game is that despite the variety, it's very quickly repetitive. Your characters have very few skills to use (only 3, a bit more with leveling) but most of the time you can only use 1 or 2 because of the context (malus, resistances, immunities of ennemies), not many choices... You keep these 3 characters for the whole run, so fights are really repetitive.\n\nThe city system between explorations is boring, then you get thousands of bonuses, of \"get more status per encounter, get more status per campaign, get more science per... There are so many bonuses in the end that you can't plan anything, you just try to focus on one thing and there's no real strategy.\n\nAnd the worst is that the last map is always the same, same 3 palaces to get the same 3 keys, same final boss that is insanely difficult compared to the difficulty of the last map.\n\nI had planned to do lots of different things on this game as I do with most rogue lites, but after 2 runs I'm already bored.", "timestamp_created": 1515704634, "timestamp_updated": 1515704965, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471513", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515933528, "developer_response": "Hey there!

(take a look in the community challenges or discord to see some examples) I admit that the battles aren't always that interesting too. Certainly a place where the game could do better.\n\nHowever, the thing about tanks strikes me as weird. The formula for defense is that damage is halved with each 50 points of defense. So 25 damage on a 0 armor character does about 25 damage, but 25 on a 100 armor character does about 6. A tank would survive 4 times more hits like that. If you hover over the armor, you'll see it's current damage reduction in %. (should be 75% for 100) Are you positive that you were looking at the correct damage type?

Even though the rogue-like mechanics are fairly simple and after a while you start seeing the repetitive formulas in every map, event and quest, Renowned Explorers has just enough flavor and charm to convince you into at least pretending every character on your team is truly unique, every map is a different exotic location and every treasure is a one-of-a-kind priceless artifact, even if you've already seen them all before. TCE doesn't really have that sense of wonder, and after you've figured out the clockwork behind it everything starts to blend together a bit.\n\nThe game mechanics in RE have a good balance of complex and simple. \n\nCharacters offer plenty of variety in skills, though over repeated playthroughs you'll probably have developed a set of favorites. Unlocking characters as expedition captains (which grants them an unique bonus) requires beating a few missions with them as regular team members, so it's an incentive to keep trying new combinations in your team in order to get those captain boosts that best fit your play style.\n\nCombat is a straightforward rock-paper-scissors system of punches, insults and compliments, but there's a lot of combinations, buffs (and debuffs) and consequences (both within and outside combat itself) from taking one approach over the other, so a good deal of strategy is needed on the higher difficulty settings.\n\nExploration is a risk-and-reward guessing game with some fairly basic resource management, but some characters, perks and equipment can tip the balance in your favor. Although each map is more-or-less unique in setting, treasures and plot, the layout itself is randomly generated. Since you can only cover part of the map on each expedition, this means there's always the potential of a secret treasure or challenge you might have missed.\n\nAll in all, RE is a pretty great fit for exploration-themed roguelikes.

Aesthetically this is not your typical high fantasy game, but instead you pick a team of 3 individuals to 'explore' various locations, meeting various people and creatures you have to defeat. Second, a full game will last around 3 hours depending on difficulty, and there isn't an emphasis on story like you might see in a game like Banner Saga or Jeanne d'Arc. But it does have its own charm; you can choose between 20 different character with their own personalities and back stories, however superfiscial. There are at times even interactions between different combination of characters. \n\nBattles themselves are also unique. Every character has 3 different attacks: Physical, Demoralizing, or 'Convincing' for lack of a better term. Either beat them into submission, talk them into submission, or convince them you are agents of good. It doesn't matter in the end; each of these 'attacks' will drain a standard health bar on a given creature, your goal of which is to reduce to zero. How hitting someone on the head with a shovel, and then telling them how awesome they are 'defeats' them is anyone's guess. But it doesn't really matter. The important part is [b]tactically[/b] there are big consequences to choosing one attack over another, even if they all work on the same health (the game calls it 'spirit') bar. In addition to 3 primary attacks, each character will gain 2 special attacks that run the gammut of your typical RPG abilities: Stun, AoE spells, group heals, debuffs, etc. While there is a rock paper scissors mechanic to battles, it can get deeper when you are offered a greater reward for demoralizing them instead of befriending them. Or maybe the enemy is weak against demoralizing, but none of your characters have strong demoralizing attacks.\n\nWhile most of your gameplay will be ensuring you survive battles, there are 2 other gameplay areas: The Adventure Map, and the Global Map that exists between adventures. On the Adventure Map, your crew moves from point to point trying to gain as much treasure, knowledge, or status as possible. Each time you move to a node you use up food, and as you are limited in the amount of foood you have, it's impossible to cover everything. Each Adventure Map ends in a boss battle before you are sent to the Global Map to reap your rewards.\nThe Global Map is where you choose how to spend your spoils. Money buys equipment, knowledge unlocks various buffs, and status recruits 'helpers' that buff your party in various ways. While there are 3 different resources, there doesn't feel like there's enough difference between them. \n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society is good enough. It's probably worth it on sale.

Little did I know that I was depriving myself of one of the more fun, clever, and unique titles in the genre. The two misconceptions I had initially were...\n\n1) That the game boiled down to rock, paper, scissors. While this mechanic is present (it works similar to how the Fire Emblem weapon triangle does), it's just one of a whole slew of things going on during the game's many encounters.  There are resistances, weaknesses, buffs and debuffs, character and enemy statuses, various rewards for handling encounters in different ways, and on and on. Once you get your footing and start understanding the game's many systems, combat becomes a real delight: a strategic (and sometimes literal) dance that requires balancing a dozen or more factors to reach a desired outcome.\n\n2) That everything seemed a bit simplistic. Don't let the cartoonish look fool you, Renowned Explorers features great depth on both the strategic and tactical layers. I've played for over 30 hours and only just feel like I'm getting a real strong grasp on advanced gameplay and how to maximize my score. While the fact that a single game only lasts maybe 3-4 hours was initially a disappointment, so much of the joy from the game is playing around with different crew combinations and taking on different challenges that I've come to appreciate that games can be completed briskly. This also makes it palatable to play 'Adventure Mode', which features auto-saving and permadeath.\n\nGenerally, I'd recommend ignoring the \"Discovery Mode\" that allows for save-scumming and lower difficulties and just diving in to Adventure Mode on Classic difficulty, the game's recommended setting. While you'll take your lumps early on, the failures will be quick and you'll get to experiment with a variety of teams. Plus, the first time you succeed will really feel like an accomplishment. And I say this as someone who is generally too much of a wimp to play Ironman in games like XCOM and the like.\n\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend this for anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy!", "timestamp_created": 1513553226, "timestamp_updated": 1513553226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38291664": {"recommendationid": "38291664", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980946986", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520307765}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, lots of different combinations for your party, the new expansion has a lot of replay value.

Or complimented a mummy on his wrappings? Or engaged in a battle of charms with a vampire? Unless you\u2019re leading a way more interesting life than the rest of us, or have already played Renowned Explorers, the answer should be never. And that should also be the big reason you ought to play Renowned Explorers, because the battles are nothing like you\u2019ve ever experienced. They\u2019re far more than battles of wits, far more than rock-paper-scissors strategy, and support a game far more charming and entertaining than most adventure jaunts you\u2019ll find.\n\nThe Renowned Explorers are a club of intrepid adventurers brought together by a common love of antiquities, danger, and glory. They hold annual competitions to see who can amass the most prestige for themselves, and you just happen to want a piece of that. Assembling a crew with two other like-minded explorers, you embark on a series of five expeditions around the globe to uncover treasures and secrets for the world. If you play your cards right and use every tool at your disposal, you can claim the title of Most Renowned. Otherwise, you\u2019ll leave behind little more than rumors of your last great journey.\n\nAt the heart of this title is something of a text adventure. Each of your expeditions sees you leading your crew around to points of interest in whatever region you\u2019ve jaunted off to. At each point you\u2019re given a description of what\u2019s happening, and a load of choices in response. Depending on your decisions you might end up finding a hidden treasure, scoring some gold or research, battling bandits or natives, or pulling yourself out of some other dire predicament. These story snippets are the gears that power everything else in the game, and considering how many systems that covers it can be daunting to figure out how best to approach a simple text prompt.\n\nYour options at each stop are usually presented with a percentage of how likely you are to succeed, which is heavily dependent on your crew, their skills, and other decisions up to that point. Characters are loaded with six different stats, a list of skills across multiple disciplines to learn, and slots for different pieces of equipment. Challenges may call for specific skills, completion of previous encounters, or sometimes just the luck of the draw. Success means scoring tokens which are converted to currencies used to gear up between expeditions, while failure can cost you stat penalties, supplies which are used to traverse the map, or resolve which works as your extra lives in combat. While the text portion of the game generally won\u2019t end a run on its own, it can tee up a defeat in combat with mounting penalties.\n\nCombat isn\u2019t the main focus of the game, but it\u2019s perhaps the most unique element. Encounters play out on familiar hex(ish) maps where you and your foes take turns moving around and using skills. The difference here is that instead of different weapons or attacks, you have three schools of abilities with wildly different effects. Aggressive actions are attacks, devious actions have negative emotional impacts, and friendly actions have positive ones. All of these when used on enemies deplete their spirit, and reducing it to zero defeats the unit. But everyone also has an emotion meter that tracks whether they\u2019re happy or sad, and what specific emotion that puts them in. Furthermore, there\u2019s an overall mood determined by the predominant actions on both sides which can incur huge (like 50% huge) bonuses and penalties depending on how the two teams are feeling.\n\nThe interplay between these different approaches affords a wealth of tactical options. Each mood affects attack and speech stats, so a clever player will make their enemy enraged before hitting them to lower their armor, or sadden an enemy that\u2019s about to attack to lower their speech. Items can play a part in this as well, boosting key stats or even giving bonuses when attacking enemies with certain emotions. Really you have enormous control over the approaches your team can take, but to succeed in more difficult areas you have to focus on one or two and stack up your bonuses for it.\n\nThe same is true for the resource game, as winning the game requires you to accrue enough renown to beat out the other explorers. Renown is earned from most things you do but there\u2019s a ton of ways to boost your earnings, and ways to focus on a few resources to really pump your results. Gold is used to buy items, status lets you recruit an entourage that provides further bonuses from tokens earned, and research lets you unlock studies that produce all kinds of powerful effects. Choosing how to spend these currencies to build your renown machine is the real meat of the game, and mathematically-minded players may find plenty to chew on here.\n\nWith a design this tight there\u2019s not much to critique, aside from seeing the same encounters over and over as you sink more and more time into the game. The variety comes from the different crews you can assemble, and the different choices you make in building them up, but you\u2019ll still end up reading the same passages again and again. It\u2019s an issue the developers seem keenly aware of if the different expansion DLCs are any indication, and there are so many treasures to find and unlock anyway that it shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue. Wrapped up in such a charming presentation, it\u2019s doubtful you\u2019ll have any bones to pick until at least a dozen or two hours in. The unique strategy and combat may take some getting used to, but once it clicks you\u2019ll have a hard time stopping yourself from launching just one more expedition.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

All encompassed under the umbrella of a fantastic exploration theme.\nDifferent party configurations lead to different \"story\" moments within the expedition and the colorful cast of characters, their personalities and abilities, add to the replay value of the game. No two expeditions are the same. And while they are indeed perilous, the difficulty can be tweaked to your liking:\nThe Adventure Mode is the recommended way to play the game. Fail an expedition and you are done! The game saves at specific points and when you quit.\nThere is also a Discovery Mode that pretty much removes the rogue-like aspects. You are able to save whenever you want and are free to retry any failed expeditions and battles lost. This is useful if you just want to learn the stories behind the characters and wish to avoid wasted time if something goes bust. Do note that luck and percentages play a part in the outcomes so be wary! If randomness irks you in videogames, this mode might ease the pain.\nIn addition, both modes include four difficulty settings that affect turn-based battles and the skill checks of the challenges/trials that you face. They range from Easy to Impossible.\nWith or without the DLCs (though I recommend both of them), the game encourages multiple runs.

Zu Anfang w\u00e4hlt man sein Team bei dem es mit 20+ einzigartigen Charakteren genug Auswahl gibt um verschiedene Strategien verfolgen zu k\u00f6nnen. Mit diesem Team versucht man nun auf einer Expedition m\u00f6glichst viele Token/Ressourcen zu erringen, um mit diesen dann Verbesserungen freizuschalten (Forschungen, Spezialisten, Helfer, Items) und damit dann wiederum auf der n\u00e4chsten Expedition noch mehr Token/Ressourcen zu verdienen.\n\nZu erw\u00e4hnen ist nat\u00fcrlich, dass der Gl\u00fccksfaktor in diesem Spiel eine entscheidende Rolle spielt. Die Chance die verschiedenen Aufgaben zu bestehen l\u00e4sst sich zwar duch das Verbessern der F\u00e4higkeiten der einzelnen Crewmitglieder  positiv beeinflussen. Dennoch gibt es immer wieder diesen frustrierenden Moment, wenn die 98% Chance fehl schl\u00e4gt und man ohne Artefakt weiterziehen muss. W\u00fcrde allerdings alles immer nur nach Plan laufen w\u00e4r's stellenweise wohl zu leicht. Der Mix aus rundenbasierten K\u00e4mpfen und den gl\u00fccksabh\u00e4ngigen Aufgaben stellen meiner Meinung nach einen guten Ausgleich dar.\n\nMir gef\u00e4llt an dem Spiel, dass es sich selbst nicht zu ernst nimmt und mich immer wieder zum Schmunzeln bringt. Seien es die Geschichten der Charaktere und ihr Verhalten untereinander oder auch allein schon die Tatsache, dass man die Gegner dadurch besiegen kann, dass man sie zum Weinen oder Lachen bringt. Die Grafik ist zudem in einem passenden und optisch gut anzusehenden Cartoon-Stil gehalten. Einzig die Laute, die die verschiedenen Charaktere w\u00e4hrend der K\u00e4mpfe von sich geben, empfinde ich pers\u00f6nlich nicht so gelungen.\n\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] gro\u00dfe Auswahl an verschiedensten Charakteren f\u00fcr eine hohe Variation bei der Crewbildung\n[*] guter Mix aus Rundenstrategie und Gl\u00fccksfaktor\n[*] Strategie auf mehreren Ebenen (Crewbildung, Kartenerkundung, K\u00e4mpfe, Ressourcen)\n[*] humorvoll gehalten\n[*] netter Cartoon-Grafikstil\n[*] jeder Durchlauf des Spiels ist anders\n[/list]\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[*] die Sounds der Charaktere sind nicht so gelungen\n[*] zum Teil kann der Gl\u00fccksfaktor an wichtigen Stellen frustrierend sein\n[*] kein Multiplayer\n[/list]\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\nDieses Spiel h\u00e4lt mich dadurch an der Stange, dass ich die Expeditionen mit allen nur m\u00f6glichen Teams bestehen will. Und ich will sie nicht nur eben so schaffen, sondern zudem auch noch mit einer m\u00f6glichst guten Punktzahl. Es macht auch einfach unheimlich viel Freude viele viele Tokens einzusammeln und diese dann am Ende der Expedition ausgewertet zu bekommen.

The combat is like the rock-paper-scissors thing where one kind of attack defeats the other, so you actually  have far less choices  than you think to how you want to tackle the situation regardless of your team's strength, which is a very bad thing. It has a lot of different skill rolls to see wether you can successfully complete a random task or not and the prize is either money, fame, or research points, and one of those 3 thing will be used to calculate your total expeditions point called Renown. You win the game with high enough Renown point. This game is awfully childish, the writing, the encounter, the dialogue, awful.I can actually see how this game be a very educational game for younger players, maybe to learn different english words. And the developers, while they are not as imaginative and original as they think they are, is actually a bunch of people full of passion and dreams, but still. you should buy this game only if these two criteria is fulfilled first:First, you have to be very young, most preferably not older than 15 year-old. I am not saying that older men cannot enjoy this game, it is just this game is quite childish, and I am a 34 yo Asian male from a developing country, so I know that my childish might not be your childish(i doubted that), please judge this accordingly. Second, if you decide to buy this, do not buy the whole thing including the DLCs like I did. I bought it all and found out the game is too childish to my liking so I never played the DLC at all. Buy the base game, play it for more than 5 hours(this is very important, you must play it for sufficient amount of time) and then buy the DLC if you still find the game enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1510975612, "timestamp_updated": 1514100369, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515933981, "developer_response": "Hey there!

Each character has different perks/abilities and they each have a different bonus when selected as captain, which gives them all a different playstyle and they all have different synergies with other team members.\n\nYou take your selected team to 5 different expedition locations, which you pick from a growing list of options and move across randomly generated maps, resolving encounters with skill checks from party members or in tactical, turn-based fights. \nThe combat involves a unique \"mood\" mechanic, where abilities/attacks used affect whether your team is Aggressive, Friendly or Devious and the same applies to the enemy. This creates a shifting rock-paper-scissors game, where one mood will be advantageous giving a buff or a debuff, but use of another ability may shift the mood to a different buff/status. Additionally individual units have emotions such as Excited, Enraged, Saddened, etc that add extra buffs/debuffs.\n\nEnemies have different weaknesses and resistances to various emotions and some react differently to changing moods as well. The amount of interplay between skills, emotions, moods and positioning/attacks all adds up to interesting gameplay with a lot more depth than the cheery cartoon artstyle may hint at.\n\nOnce you get used to the gameplay, a full run only takes a few hours, but the RNG nature of the map layouts and loot placement, as well as the large roster and combinations of team members, perks, items, skill bonuses, etc gives a huge amount of replayability. The developer support is great as well, with new daily and weekly challenges rotated in, which gives incentive to try out new team compositions/strategies than you may be used to.\n\nA note on the RNG for skill checks throughout the game - the breakdown of whether or not a roll will succeed in the game is excellent. It shows you what your chance is, what the skill check is based on, as well as the contributing factors from character skills, items, buffs, etc are, so if you want to boost your chances/eliminate RNG you are given the information to do so. \n\nOverall, an excellent game with some great and innovative design choices and mechanics. Great replayabilty and definitely recommended.     \n", "timestamp_created": 1509428015, "timestamp_updated": 1509428015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556560", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36153599": {"recommendationid": "36153599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048615656", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 2669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510515404}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really weird in a way, that, until you actually play it, you will likely go \"Eh?

I give it an unequivocal thumbs up, but that's not to say it is perfect or the formula could not be improved, thus my Pros & Cons are as follows.\n\nPro: The game is set in a  cartoonish Victorian world before everything was discovered (and subsequently 3d mapped by Google) where Explorers with big personalities and bigger egos still scoured the earth for fame and plunder.\nCon: The game is set in a cartoonish Victorian world that makes exploitation of indigenous  peoples  seem like a fun and harmless pastime. Personally, I  take the game with a huge grain of salt. If the developers had made the 19th century explorers politicaly correct to appeal to 21st century senibilities , how historically relevant would that be? ...Not very.\n\nPRO: There is a good deal of depth to the strategy and economy of RE. Things that are fuzzy at first will become clearer the more you play and you begin to see the logic of it all.  \nCON: The game is more complicated in my opinion than it needs to be. The number of commodities, tolkiens  and  systems will make your head spin.  For instance a Jouralist in your entourage will not join your expedition but works behind the scenes to give you positive  press. Cool idea but the journalist has no personality being just an icon that gives you a bonus and the entourage  system is way too convoluted. I think it would be be better if members of your entourage would show up occasionally, like a camp followers, on the battle screen, and give you aid. \n", "timestamp_created": 1509294394, "timestamp_updated": 1509294394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36115117": {"recommendationid": "36115117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022419491", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514896318}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun great little game about exploring both people and environments, lots of ways to play with great replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1509291253, "timestamp_updated": 1509291253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35971400": {"recommendationid": "35971400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264362698", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509010441}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u4f60\u73a9\u7684\u4e5f\u5f88\u5f00\u5fc3\n\u867d\u7136\u6211\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\u4e5f\u6ca1\u770b\u61c2\n\u5e0c\u671b\u5b98\u65b9\u5feb\u51fa\u4e2d\u6587\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1508865106, "timestamp_updated": 1508865106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591837", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35953898": {"recommendationid": "35953898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132949771", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507466650}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u043e, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0444\u0435, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c. 10 \u0438\u0437 10 \u0442\u0438", "timestamp_created": 1508793567, "timestamp_updated": 1508793567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35952043": {"recommendationid": "35952043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242620500", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1521135060}, "language": "english", "review": "Looked pretty fun when it first came out, and when a DLC and steam sale came around I decided to buy it.

But you can also resolve matters in a friendly way, or break the spirit of those opposing you with mockery and intimidating words. Each style \u2013 peaceful, agressive, and mocking \u2013 work like a \"weapon triangle\", meaning one of them is weak against another one and strong against the other. By resolving more and more conflicts in a certian manner you get more \"inclined\" to this style which starts giving you bonuses for resolving conflicts \"your way\".\n\nOn adventurer mode, you can generally afford to \"lose\" your teammates twice per expedition until it's game over, so you have to be careful and cunning with your tactics and decisions. It's a good thing you don't actually need to reset because the game prompts you to do so anyway, which is might be a minor thing, but is still a very nice minor thing. Classic mode is absolutely brutal: once your part loses all of its resolve, it's over for you \u2013 forever. Resources you have to carry out expeditions are also limited, and you get penalties when you run out of them, so you have to plan where you go around the mission level in a careful manner. Boss fights could prove to be quite challenging, especially when you have debuffs and AOE-casting mobs keep swarming your party. While the stage design is nothing to write home about, some of the stages have classic choking points and \"healing tiles\" that can end up being your downfall.\nThe places you explore, aka expeditions \u2013 as they're called in the game \u2013 are all very varied, with their unique setting, opposing forces you confront, and local mini-plots. I especially liked the expedition to this Peruan-looking place where my explorers ended up finding an ancient treasure, banishing a necromant girl and overthrowing the government, all in one fell swoop. \nThere are also RNG challenges that utilize your team's traits: diplomatic, athletic, archeologist, etc. Those traits aren't only used to pass skill checks, but also offer some combat bonuses. Some of those skill checks are simple events, some of them are a series of skill checks. It's important to know your team's traits and keep an eye on opportunities to enhance them, as leveling characters doesn't have an effect on that area, but on their skills in skirmishes only.\n\nThere's plenty of characters to chose from and teams to form; some of the character combos even unlock some sort of short story snippets and give those characters some kind of bonus. All characters have a preference for two ways of resolving combat situations, so it's important to make a team with the same dynamic, as well a teammate who's efficient at \"healing\" in critical situations. Interestingly enough, you can also neglect \"healing\" completely and go for an all-out agressive playstyle \u2013 there are plenty of variety to the character roster to be able to pull that off. \nThere's a simple overarching story about how you're supposed to beat this Disney's Lady and the Beast Gaston-lookalike for... Uh... Fame, I guess, and you sometimes confront his goons on some of the expeditions as well. I'm pretty sure the story part might as well not exist because it's just so meaningless, and it's definitely not the game's strong point.\n\nOverall, gameplay is top-notch and is surprisingly challenging. Exploring different places the world has to offer that all look so varied and unique is also a blast. Trying out different playstyles and party combinations helps a lot with the game's replayability. The fact that the soundtrack sounds very boring and uninspired and the overall plot feels kind of random don't really do much damage to my impression of how good this game is.", "timestamp_created": 1508624498, "timestamp_updated": 1508624498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35886313": {"recommendationid": "35886313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025642643", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509893412}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u8fdb\u653b\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\u654c\u4eba\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6709\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u4f5c\u6700\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c[spoiler] \u5c31\u662f\u4e3b\u89d2\u4eec\u7684\u5168\u7a0b\u989c\u827a[/spoiler]\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1508578794, "timestamp_updated": 1508578794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35829587": {"recommendationid": "35829587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130562680", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517767735}, "language": "english", "review": "Add a 'casual' tag and it's everything you'd expect.\nComic-book look, play and writing.\nIt's hard to care at all what happens except that it's always interesting to see what's next.

This game is such a hidden gem in the sea of indie games. You form a party of 3 characters with different backgrounds and specialties from all over the world.

The game consists of three segments: exploration, combat and the world map.\n\nOn the World Map you can set the location of your expedition, spend Insight(which you earn through expeditions) to get resources, hire helpers or specialists to help you on your journey, do research to benefit your party and buy trinkets to boost your power. All the tokens you get and the treasures you find also give you Renown. After you are done managing, you are off to find secrets and treasures on your adventure.\n\nWhen you start your expedition, you start to explore the island, each tile using supplies. Exploration is fun and intriguing; forcing you to make decisions depending on your overall goal, the side goal and your supplies. On most tiles you will get events. The stories and the writing is engaging and the decisions you make will reward you with tokens -which you can use on the world map- and treasures -which give you Insight and other rewards of your choice-. Another positive is that although the game is still random, the randomness is reduced by how you build your party. Such as a \"Diplomat\" having the chance to persuade your enemies. But during most cases you won't be able to escape from the encounter and that brings us to combat.\n\nThe combat is very unique in which you can not only win aggressively but also by talking things out or mocking your enemies. Your approach, combined with your enemies' approach will determine the mood of the battle such as Tense, Friendly or Brutal. These moods give your party buffs or debuffs depending on the rock, paper, scissors-like combat triangle.

Unless you prefer to go hardcore (Adventure Mode) where progress is saved automatically and you can't revert to previous save states\n+ 4 difficulty settings for the game \n+ Great for all ages\n\n\nCons:\n- Only around 8 maps and locations you can go\n- Eventually the replayability slows unless you have a leaderboard mission to top the charts\n- Can be frustrating\n\n\nTL;DR:\n8/10\nTurn-based Rock/Paper/Scissor treasure finding strategy/adventure game with a large variety of unique, lighthearted humorous characters and simple animations.", "timestamp_created": 1508186305, "timestamp_updated": 1508186305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35777103": {"recommendationid": "35777103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004279309", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511275441}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't stop", "timestamp_created": 1508174637, "timestamp_updated": 1508174637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35764188": {"recommendationid": "35764188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008058188", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504161192}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic unique game well worth you time and money.", "timestamp_created": 1508125120, "timestamp_updated": 1508125120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35762128": {"recommendationid": "35762128", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963624833", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514825880}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting concept, but generally repetitive, unbalanced, and ultimately too frustrating to be worth wasting time on.", "timestamp_created": 1508115750, "timestamp_updated": 1508115750, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35751562": {"recommendationid": "35751562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019838342", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470680308}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked the game, it's a non-violent turn based strategy/exploration game.  You use a combination of compliments, insults, and other dynamics (or just kill them).  I would definitely recommend playing it.  You explore maps, and then have movement based combat where you try to deal with enemies, or just locals who you have to use diplomacy with.  It was really a cool game to play.  The art is nice too, good animation and coloring, etc.\n\nHowever, I just wanted to give a heads up to the developers about two things that made me quit playing early that hopefully they could remedy for the sequel (because I would buy a sequel if these two were smoothed out):\n\n1)  You are discouraged from exploring each part of the map because you run out of supplies much too easily.  As a title with exploration in the name, I like exploring, but I missed out on little bits and felt I had to rush to the end.  At least give some option to customize your explorers easily so that playstyle is a viable option (not just an option, but viable).  Hand of Fate the game had a mechanic where you could explore every tile and be rewarded for it (exploring).\n\n2)  The campaign (I believe) was just a hard race to the end and if you got behind too much, you would still be playing to the end but you would have really lost about halfway through (I'm not sure if I'm explaining that correctly).  Especially when you are learning, it feels tedious to be exploring mechanics (because you are learning the game) and then know that you're going to have to start over just because you weren't playing the \"right way,\" for instance, exploring a lot.  For instance, instead of a hard fail, perhaps do gradations.  For instance, in some games, instead of a hard countdown to failure (it's effectively a countdown in this game), SteamWorld Heist has security levels, where the longer you spend in the level (and not every level, only some), more and more turrets show up to make it harder to escape the level alive.  This way, people can explore, and even give themselves a challenge, without a hard fail.\n\nHopefully there's a sequel, it was a very cool mechanically funny and interesting game!  I know I wrote a lot about my two biggest pet peaves, and didn't write enough about the good parts, but it's only because I want to buy the sequel and have the sequel be even better than the first!

The crew were dispirited and exhausted. Then we reached a village, where the locals attacked us not with spears but with encouraging words and smiles. My crew got cheered up so much they decided to stay for an \"indefinite vacation\".\n\nOn the second attempt, we had much better luck, but I committed a cultural faux pas that I really should've seen coming. (Not a bad random roll, but a bad decision.) At least I got extra supplies out of it. We'd traveled around enough to have multiple encounters with the natives, which gave everybody a boost to their conversation skills. Yvonne had misgivings, though, because I'd stolen a mask and she felt bad about it. When we reached the overly friendly village, this time we dazzled and praised them until the grumpy chieftain gave us a treasure to go away. Winning in a friendly way had different effects than devious or violent approaches would've had. At no point in either attempt had we hit another person, although we severely hurt the feelings of some scorpions.\n\nI have fought hundreds, maybe thousands of fantasy battles where the assumption is that slaughtering all in my path is the only victory.

It's a real thing.\n\nRenowned Explorers is in the same vein as FTL for general structure. You go on adventures, choose what course of action to take based on each situation, and get urged toward the ever present end of the game by a timer (in this case, supplies) counting down a punishing you severely for milling around in search of goodies too much - and these adventures are periodically broken up with combat. And if you lose, you start over from scratch in rogue-lite fashion (unless you're playing on the easier adventure mode). That's about where the similarities end. \n\nRenowned Explorers combat is tile-based tactics-RPG style battles that feature a roshambo style \"mood\" system. Characters can use either weapons or words to do battle, and depending on how they use either, the general attitude of the combat can shift to be friendly, deceptive, or aggressive (read: actual fighting.) So, yes, you can actually befriend every enemy you come across instead of shooting them in the face. Or call them mean names until they're too depressed to continue fighting. You monster. But you might not want to stick explicitly to one strategy, because your approach also changes the prizes that come with a successful battle. There's a lot more complexity to it that I really can't touch on in a brief review, but the whole battle system works strangely well.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys adventure roguelites like FTL and Convoy, I implore you to give Renowned Explorers a try - it might just be your new favourite.

Then another 50 hours working out those systems and starting to actually game the game.\n\nNow I'm getting more value out of the thing by actually planning, in detail, my expeditions before I run them. This approach reveals the sheer genius behind the game design and exquisite balancing. \n\nFor each expedition, you're trying to work out a sweet spot between (a) your choice of three characters (from a menagerie of 24 total), (b) your expedition pathway - five expeditions per game, selected from 14 expedition locations, (c) your character upgrade pathways; (d) your campfire chats; (e) your approach to encounters - aggressive? devious? friendly\"; (f) the items you are intending to prioritise getting, and what bonuses to pull off them; (g) your town-building options (research pathway and entourage). \n\nSorting out the interactions among all of these interrelated systems is loads of fun. You always have to make some compromises, you can never quite cover all the skill bases you'd like. Basically you're trying to set up a snowball of resources that continues to build throughout the game... sometimes the snowball grows way faster than you imagined it, other times it seems to just run flat. \n\nThe joy of discovering an unusual approach to all of the above - it's just immensely rewarding. I only just managed to finally get a score of over 10,000 - which is sort of the ultimate accomplishment in the game. Now I find out reading on the forums that scores of over 17,000 are possible - so clearly I still have a long way to go building a better snowball! \n\nAside from the strategising, the game is wonderfully atmospheric. The cartoon graphics have grown on me a lot, they are full of personality and I can only congratulate the character designers (text and graphics) for creating 24 highly evocative mini-characters with just a few strokes of the pen, and a few sentences of text.\n\nAny cons? Not many... I have encountered some glitches, and the game crashes on me about one session out of 20. Some of the encounters are a bit too vague and could use some more imaginative drafting. That's all I can think of!\n\nI can only recommend this game in the highest of terms for anybody who enjoys strategy, puzzles, and adventure games, and who appreciates a game that can be played quickly, but can also be meticulously planned for a deeper experience. \n\nOh, and you have to be happy with randomness! If RNG makes you aggro, seek elsewhere.

Once in a while the party gets an encounter, which plays out as a turn based battle on a randomized map.\nDifferent characters have different abilities belonging to one of the attitudes aggressive, friendly, and devious with a particular damage type. Characters may be more or less vulnerable to particular damage types, and depending on which category of skills your party predominantly use to solve an encounter different rewards may be given.\n\nOn the maps a lot of tiles are skill challenges where the skills of the characters determine chanse of success. There are many kinds of skills - enough that you're probably not going to be good at everything. \n\nEvery playthrough plays slightly differently thanks to how the maps are randomized; while the highlights of a map are always present somewhere it is never obvious what the best way to traverse the map from the start to the end node\nis, and as the party only has a limited amount of rations (one is consumed every turn on the map, and if you run out a random character gets a random cumulative penalty for the rest of the expedition, some challenges may give some rations as a reward) luck is a big factor in how well an expedition turns out.\n\nIn between expeditions the party goes to a world map where gold can be spent on buying equipment giving better stats or bonus skill levels, fame can be used to recruit followers giving the party some kind of bonus, or research points can be used to write papers giving the party bonus stats, and it is the only way to obtain additional rations.\n\nThe game features a lot of funny writing, and some events may vary slightly depending on who is in your party.  Different party compositions do better in different areas, and different areas of the same difficulty have different kinds of rewards and enemy attitudes.\n\nIt does not require a lot of energy to play, and is a great way to relax when you are tired.\n\nI do have some complaints too; Due to how combat is set up a lot of enemies can one shot the weaker characters, even while wearing armor. AI will attack characters randomly, so glass canons quite often get killed, and there doesn't seem to be much to do to prevent it from happening. This typically becomes a problem after you have already completed 2-3 expeditions, but can still bite you earlier than that if you're unlucky. It just feels cheap to have someone randomly walk up to one of my characters and just keep knocking them down. Each time a character is knocked down a unique resource that is hard to replenished is reduced by one, and when you run out it's game over. Characters can be revived by another character, but many boss battles are lost because the boss randomly decides to keep whacking the weakest character, and there is simply nothing to do about this if the character is to contribute at all.\n\nThe themed maps leave little choise for a party - an aggressive focused party is for example not going to have a good time fighting a ghost they are unable to hit, so for every party there is  a fairly obvious path that is optimal, and deviating from it typically quickly puts an end to the expedition due to one shotting enemies.\n\nThese are fairly minor complaints about an otherwise very nice game, but they begin to grate after a while, and I hope the developers will some day patch the combat to be a bit less unfair.\n\nI strongly recommend this game if you like rogue likes.", "timestamp_created": 1499357203, "timestamp_updated": 1499357203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33309592": {"recommendationid": "33309592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031925785", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499933989}, "language": "german", "review": "Cool Game, but it crashes every 30 minutes :-(\n", "timestamp_created": 1499343053, "timestamp_updated": 1499343053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33273102": {"recommendationid": "33273102", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996658128", "num_games_owned": 1550, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507808771}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like watching your passive-aggressive friend haggle in a touristic holiday shop for a cheap souvenir that you know it's not going to survive the plane ride.", "timestamp_created": 1499257991, "timestamp_updated": 1499257991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33264049": {"recommendationid": "33264049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035810852", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501911590}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely wonderful game!

In this case, in addition to straight up physical attack, you can also try to charm enemies, seduce them, or drive them to depression. Your actions affect overall mood of the encounter, which in turn affects how the enemy will respond, as well as significantly swings all friendly and enemy stats in one direction or the other. It's a fantastic system, that lets developers deliver character and story exposition through gameplay without even needing any dialogue. Ingenious!\n\nOn top of that the game sports a great sense of humour, incredible lovely art style (my favourite in all 2D games I played so far), and a great pace. The devs have also added a lot of extra free content since release and there are some DLCs available, that I'm actually gonna go buy (didn't know they came out already).

It makes for quite a good mix.\n\nYou pick 3 explorers from a selection of about 20 with each explorer having different strengths and skills. The goal in each playthrough is to complete 5 expeditions while trying to get as high a score as you can. The expeditions throw up different encounters and events which can net you resources or treasures but you run the risk of losing supplies or resolve.\n\nThe combat encounters also have an interesting twist. Each character has three types of attacks aggressive, devious and friendly which work like rock,paper and scissors. To add to this each battle has a mood that changes based on the types of attacks used. Different moods will either hinder or buff your party. It adds another layer of depth to the combat.\n\nSo overall Renowned Explorers is an interesting game which is surprisingly deep adnd challenging.

But in the end, it isn't enough.  Remember that part about dry?  This game is more than dry, ultimately it is boring.  \n\nAfter putting about six hours into it and trying several team members, I have lost interest.  The settings change, but other than that, the expeditions don't.  Choose a path, follow it, read some text and hope you brought the right expert for the RNG/Price is Right wheel spin.  Succeed, get a treasure where it is not clear how its buffs really help you.  Fail, maybe take a ding to one of your stats.  Either way, more often than not you will next enter the fight mode.  \n\nThe fight mode will be familiar to anyone who has ever played Heroes of Might and Magic.  Walk your guy across a hexagon grid, choose your attack.  Despite there being three main schools of attacks, the type you prefer really doesn't matter.  If you do something violent, deceptive or friendly, there is no real long term effect on your character or game.  Just pick the one that does the most damage in the current situation.  \n\nAnd that is the rub.  The designers have put a lot of time building up the three types of attacks, with all the requisite buffs.  They also added something of a \"mood\" system, meaning your enemies will react differently to each school, both at the start of the battle and while it wages on.  For instance, you can start off with friendly \"attacks\", but after a little while of complimenting the enemies and otherwise buttering them up, you will get a 25% boost to deceptive attacks.  This mean is it in your interest to now start insulting your enemies instead.  Kill one of them?  Don't worry, go back to complimenting the rest and they soon forget you ran their buddy through.  So long as you ignore heavy specialization, you will be able to pick whichever takes the most off the enemy health bar at the moment and ride out the fights.  \n\nThey should have sacrificed the complex buff system.  Honestly, unless your are really into minutiae or min/maxing, there is no reason or incentive to learn it.  Instead, they should have made the three attack schools much more unique and meaningful.  The type of attack your character uses should have real ramifications both inside and outside each micro battle. \n\nTLDR; Pros: graphics work for the game setting, dry humor.  Cons: Quickly repetitive and boring.  Needless detail in attack schools and buffs fails to really affect your game, so no real reason to learn it.

this game on my 'recommended' list for a while but was put off by the cartoonish and casual look. When I finally got it during a steam sale a few weeks ago I wasn't expecting much but felt I would get a dozen or so hours out of it before it became stale. My first few runs were indeed fairly standard casual fare. By the third run I had beaten the game (a lucky run) and felt I had seen everythiing this game had to offer. I was convinced that it would be shelved along many of the other games that once beaten I would never return to again.\n\nThat's when I saw the weekly community challenge. I was intrigued, especially when I saw the huge scores some people managed to submit. I was miles away from those score and couldn't immediately understand how people did this. So I went back and started to analyse the game mechanics in more detail. And that's when I realized that below the casual look was a very deep and complex game with many interlocking components. To get one of those high scores you had to understand those relationships and plan ahead. Both character development and resource management were important and balancing short-term vs long-term advantages was key. And most of all I started to realize that while luck and randomness do play a role, good preparation could mitigate this to a degree where it never became frustrating. My next few runs were all focussed on maximizing my chances of succeeding in challenges, starting to get a feeling for what perks would be best suited for which expeditions and events and which resources were best to invest in for each playstyle. \n\nWhat strikes me the most is that despite the fact that the same challenges and events come up after a while it never really feels repetitive. At each point there are real and meaningful decisions to be taken. I cannot quite put my finger on it but there is something here that means that each run feels very different. And going back to the community challenges, those are a great way to keep the game fresh, forcing you to approach the game slightly differently.\n\nThe combat too is quite well thought out, mixing both standard turn-based tactics with a attitude management system that again looks simple on the surface but is actually quite deep once you understand the mechanics. A seemingly overwhelming encounter can be beaten by shifting the mood to constantly keep an advantage over the opponents. \n\nI don't have the expansions yet, I hear they add a lot to the game, allowing even more options and advanced strategies, but even after 75 hrs I still have enough fun with the base game that I don't feel I need them yet.\n\n10/10 - Would impress Sheep again!", "timestamp_created": 1496453208, "timestamp_updated": 1496453208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32111186": {"recommendationid": "32111186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025176317", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496019124}, "language": "english", "review": "This game just exudes charm with its whimsical, freewheeling adventures and approach to character.  Despite the relative short length of any one campaign, no two adventures are exactly the same and I found myself coming back for more just to see if I could pass a skill check that I failed before, and what would happen if I did? \n\nSimply moving across the various maps and encountering the little stories+skillchecks is fun enough for me in itself, but it is also a tactical RPG and in that the game excels more than I was expecting. The novel approach to tactical gameplay in Renowned Explorers is incredibly interesting--instead of focusing on, say, weapon types, encounters revolve around setting and reacting to the mood of the battlefield.

Like the other more detailed reviews say the combat is rock-paper-scissors style and each attack generates an emotion from the enemy which effects how strong different types of future attacks are.

The game is also deceptive because the art style looks like something you'd get while playing a phone app. The expeditions start to finish take me about 3 hours each, maybe a bit longer if i am struggling.\n\nThe best way to describe it is think of the game like a choose your own adventure book.

Cercher\u00f2 quindi di presentarvi solo un piccolo scorcio di quello che si cela dietro questo titolo indie a mio avviso molto interessante, lasciando alla vostra curiosit\u00e0 il compito di prendervi per mano nella scoperta del quadro nella sua interezza.\n\nIn RE:IS vestiremo i panni di un gruppo di esploratori membri di una esclusiva societ\u00e0, per l'appunto la Renowned Explorers International Society. Viaggeremo per il globo visitando i luoghi pi\u00f9 disparati alla ricerca di misteriosi tesori e antiche reliquie, in modo da accrescere la nostra fama e il nostro prestigio e vincere la classifica degli esploratori a discapito della nostra nemesi, l'odiato (e odioso) esploratore francese Matthieu Rivaleux. \n\nIl gioco \u00e8 essenzialmente uno strategico a turni, con una serie di caratteristiche che ci permettono di ascriverlo nel novero dei roguelite, il cui gameplay pu\u00f2 essere diviso in 2 macro-fasi.\n\nLa prima fase \u00e8 quella della pianificazione della spedizione. In questo frangente potremo valutare i diversi siti da esplorare, ognuno dei quali sar\u00e0 contrassegnato da un indice di difficolt\u00e0 e riporter\u00e0 una serie di suggerimenti sulle migliori strategie di approccio; avremo inoltre a disposizione diversi \"store\" in cui acquistare equipaggiamento per i nostri esploratori, sviluppare veri e propri skill tree come nella migliore tradizione degli RPG, o ancora \"acquistare\" dei seguaci che ci seguiranno nelle nostre missioni e ci garantiranno risorse bonus durante l'esplorazione.\n\nLa seconda fase consiste nell'esplorazione vera e propria, in cui potremo sondare il terreno (inizialmente avvolto da nebbia di guerra) alla ricerca di diversi tipi di risorse e preziosi tesori nascosti. La parte pi\u00f9 interessante del gioco \u00e8 senz'altro il libero girovagare sulla mappa, che ci porter\u00e0 ad imbatterci in una miriade di incontri ed eventi generati randomicamente che metteranno a dura prova le abilit\u00e0 diplomatiche e/o belliche della nostra cricca. Ogni mossa all'interno della mappa di gioco avr\u00e0 un preciso costo in termini di rifornimenti: questo aspetto ci spinger\u00e0 a pianificare minuziosamente il nostro tragitto, pesando attentamente i costi e i benefici di rotte differenti. Attardarsi nell'esplorazione senza approvvigionamenti causer\u00e0 infatti delle conseguenze spiacevoli all'interno del nostro team che ne limiteranno l'efficacia nei combattimenti e in alcuni casi rischieranno di compromettere il prosieguo della nostra avventura.\n\nI combattimenti, o per meglio dire gli \"incontri\", sono l'aspetto in cui RE:IS mostra tutta la sua originalit\u00e0. Ciascun componente del nostro gruppo ha una tendenza innata a risolvere le dispute in modo amichevole, ambiguo o aggressivo, e persistendo nell'utilizzo di abilit\u00e0 della stessa tipologia finiremo con l'instaurare un \"mood\" specifico. Lo stesso discorso vale anche per i nostri avversari: i mood di entrambe le parti verranno confrontati secondo una logica in stile sasso/carta/forbice e ogni accoppiata potr\u00e0 garantirci un \"mood effect\" positivo o negativo. Per fare un esempio pratico: se terremo un mood amichevole mentre il nemico ha un atteggiamento ambiguo le nostre difese risulteranno aumentate; se terremo un mood aggressivo viceversa subiremo un malus alla difesa.\n\nDal punto di vista della grafica lo stile di RE:IS, con i suoi colori colori sgargianti e il suo tratto moderno e vivace, ricorda molto da vicino alcuni cartoni animati di Nickelodeon. Un punto a favore del comparto grafico \u00e8 l'estrema leggerezza dell'engine, che lo rende accessibile e pienamente godibile anche a chi (come il sottoscritto) non dispone di hardware di nuovissima generazione. Nella mia estrema pignoleria ho trovato i caratteri dei testi non particolarmente ispirati: un font meno anonimo avrebbe dato quel quid in pi\u00f9 all'esperienza visiva, ma si tratta tutto sommato di osservazioni di poco conto in quanto in generale RE:IS rimane un piacere per gli occhi di chi sa apprezzare i videogiochi dal disegno di stampo fumettistico.\n\nRE:IS \u00e8 una ventata di aria fresca, un piacevole diversivo sia per i \"rogueliker\" pi\u00f9 impenitenti *alza la mano*, sia per gli appassionati di TBS pi\u00f9 canonici come i ben pi\u00f9 famosi Civilization, Age of Wonders o Heroes of Might & Magic *rialza la mano*. Come anticipato in apertura, vi invito a prendervi il vostro tempo per metabolizzare le meccaniche di gioco principali, magari dedicando qualche minuto agli ottimi tutorial in-game: la curva di apprendimento \u00e8 piuttosto ripida ma non impossibile, e la vostra perseveranza verr\u00e0 premiata con momenti di spensierato divertimento che vi faranno perdere la cognizione del tempo.\n\n[i][b]Se questa recensione ti \u00e8 piaciuta clicca \"Segui\" sulla [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogamingcafe/curation]pagina del Curatore[/url] del mio gruppo: sarai sempre aggiornato con i miei personali consigli e le recensioni dei migliori titoli indie/retro/roguelite in circolazione![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1495496618, "timestamp_updated": 1498653230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31904960": {"recommendationid": "31904960", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992552621", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518473714}, "language": "english", "review": "Renowned Explorers is an Exploration game with a Choose Your Own Adventure style story and Tactical Combat. I like it very much and it \"feels\" almost like FTL (exploration) mashed up with Civ V (Tactical Combat, Multiple Paths to Victory) to me, but is unique enough to stand as its own thing. \n\nThe game is played by choosing a location to explore, traveling from node to node while managing your supplies and trying to get the most rewards out of a location before heading to the final confrontation. Sometimes a thing just happens and you get a reward, sometimes you have a challenge which you must pick a charecter and roll on the adventure wheel for success with a higher chance of success based on that charecters skills and the choices youve made, sometimes you must face combat which can be resolved in one of three ways: Aggressive, Friendly or Devious. Ultimatly you are looking for treasure and rewards which also help to make you stronger for future expiditions. After 5 sussecsful expiditions the game completes and if you managed to get enough Renown you win the game.

A solid title, currently an 8/10 that would become a 9/10 with some more updates.\n\nDespite seeming like a simple board-game, combat is surprisingly strategic and requires significant planning and thought rather than some boring hack and slash. You have to take into account the mood and combat tactics you and your enemy are using, gear for your party, specific weaknesses the enemy might have, status effects that you apply, taking advantage of AOE effects and much more. \n\nThe characters that you can select have quite a few overlapping skills (a few more new skills assigned to different characterws would be appreciated), but it's not too bad. The biggest saving grace here is the incredible stylized art which makes every scientist, soldier, scout, or speaker feel unique in their own way. You've got the big, burley (but well-meaning) Russian bear, a stuffy, German school-teacher, the beautiful Latin seductress (Hola!), the insane eletricity-obsessed scientist, and much more.\n\nThe number of \"expeditions\" could be a bit higher. Considering that the game is rogue-like and you'll be replaying quite a bit, the game suffers from a feeling of redundancy too soon that could be remedied with additional maps. Currently there are 3 maps for every challenge rating (total of 13 I believe, there are only 2 five-star and four-star challenge expeditions), but after your first 6 or so runs it may get a bit stale.\n\nThere is a bit of a learning curve, but that's to be expecting in a rogue-like game. Your first three or four adventures will end in disaster, but you simply accept your mistakes and improve upon them the next time!\n\nOverall, great game for it's price, especially on sale. The two main gripes one may have is if you are not keen on luck-based games (which a substantial portion of this game is based on) and the medicore number of expeditions. (note, they are slowly making more, but some are hidden behind paid DLC) Still, the positives far outweight the negatives.", "timestamp_created": 1495437668, "timestamp_updated": 1495437668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31895554": {"recommendationid": "31895554", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980869734", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503090483}, "language": "english", "review": "A cross between tactics games and FTL-style exploration, RE:IS is a fun and humorous game about exploring exotic locations and preparing for the next journey.

I enjoyed TCE, in spite of some harsh flaws, and noted that many reviews mentioned \"Renowned Explorers\" as being a similar and superior version of the idea. It went on sale, and I took the plunge.\n\nIt's a bit prettier if you don't like seeing aliased edges. Looks like vector art to me, coupled with some cut-out style ragdoll animations. I can see how some might find that objectively superior to little blots of pixels that wiggle a little and pop up and down once to indicate a combat action. It wasn't an issue for me.\n\nRE also has a more tactical combat. TCE's combat system is pretty bad: it's simple, heavily random, and leans toward brutal outcomes. I still like it more, because RE's combat isn't even combat. It's a combat system that pretends you're all really just having a row. The outcomes aren't brutal, they're mostly carebear. You win by emotionally overwhelming your opponents. Yes, most of your attacks are either meant to make your opponents feel so bad they run away in tears, or feel so grateful to you for pumping up their ego that they wouldn't dream of interfering. \n\nAnd you have to deal with their mood. Yes, your strategy changes depending on whether the bad guys are friendly or cranky. Except, it doesn't. Mostly it's just a matter of which type of attack you use most. Sometimes it's the red button. Sometimes it's the blue. Sometimes it's the green. It all depends on which one will break their spirit the most, as determined by what kind of spirit they brought you to break.\n\nThere's another couple layers of rock-paper-scissor tacked on, so that there are different buffs/debuffs for different... (*sigh) moods. Yes, the vibe in the air, the interaction of the opponent's emotional state and the emotional state your opponents percieve you have, has a 25-30% influence on some action or another.\n\nThere's a small novelty value to the window dressing at first--but only as long as you think of it as quirky window dressing. If you actually think of it as a game where most battles are won by alternately praising and verbally abusing or intimidating your opponents, then suddenly it's somewhere between catty and psychopathy. Do you really want to roleplay as someone who gets what they want through bullying and emotional manipulation? Is that even someone you want to pretend to be? If so, good news! They finally made a game for the pathologically passive aggressive, and this is it!\n\nIf, on the other hand, you prefer to pretend to better than you are, or much much worse, this isn't going to cut it. The paladins are going to puke their armor, and villains are likely to be dissappointed at how little damage they get to do, and how shallow the manipulations are. It's not like you're weaving together a detailed conspiracy and watching your puppets dance as you tug their emotions with subtlety from the background. It's more two groups of children shouting on the playground and alternating between \"poopy head\" and \"Hey bae!\" with the occasional \"I'm gonna bang your mom\" for good measure.\n\nThink I'm exaggerating? I don't blame you. But keep in mind most of these emotional attacks also inflict (yes, inflict) emotional states ranging from enthusiastic to enraged to terrified, and most of them also have buffs or debuffs.\n\nDid I mention your party members heal each other by saying nice things to one another? And the battle resolution is never about death or injury, they just run off the field weeping in joy, fear, anger or confusion about all the mixed signals. Basically it's a little too close to how I see people resolve conflicts in real life. Not the sort of realism I was looking for. \n\n\nEven worse is their boss encounter system. Most encounters are mop up type missions where you keep going untill everyone else has run off in some flavor of tears. Boss encounters continue until the Boss is weeping, sometimes into the shoulder of a consoling henchman. Excuse me, hench-person. They all summon more henchpeople during the fight. That's what makes it a boss encounter. That's the main difficulty lever.\n\nGranted, it does make the combat tougher. It doesn't keep it interesting.\n\nRenowned Explorers does stand above The Curious Expedition in variety of storylines. I saw lots of repetition in the first hour or two of TCE. In three hours of RE, I was still seeing new storylines and events.\n\nHowever, I think RE might have ruined this niche genre. No, not rogue-likes--this is not a roguelike. That would be like saying tag is like cribbage. This genre is \"popularity contest\", the realization of which is what has killed my interest. \n\nIt's not as obvious in TCE, where your primary means of gaining popularity is returning from adventures abroad with a shipload of treasure and lots of exciting stories to tell. But in RE, where about a third of your resources go to hiring an entourage provide buffs to your income--and you purchase them with 'status'... it's a little too blunt for me.\n\nIn TCE, you spent your money on real equipment: rope, climbing gear, torches, food, etc. In Renowned Explorers, you buy accessories to improve your stats.

Hier geht es darum, 5  Areale zu bereisen und dabei m\u00f6glichst viel zu entdecken, um schlussendlich zum ruhmreichsten Entdecker gek\u00fcrt zu werden.\n\nDie gro\u00dfe St\u00e4rke des Spiels ist dabei die Abwechslung. Jeder der 2-3h langen Durchg\u00e4nge ist anders, sodass das Spiel eine Menge Wiederspielwert bietet. \nDas beginnt schon bei der Auswahl der Crew. Jedes Crewmitglied hat unterschiedliche Eigenschaften und F\u00e4higkeiten. Zum Beispiel ist Harry ein \"Rogue\" und/oder \"Beguiler\" und kann so gut als Schurke agieren (Schleichen, Schl\u00f6sser knacken etc.) und Leute bequatschen, aber keine Aufgaben erledigen, f\u00fcr die es einen Kraftprotz braucht. Gleichzeitig hat er eine Pistole mit 3 Reichweite, was ihn eher f\u00fcr ein \"aggressives\" Team pr\u00e4destiniert.\nDas Kampfsystem ist vielschichtig und voller Humor. Wenn Harry z.B. mit seiner Pistole einen friedlichen Dorfbewohner beschie\u00dft, ist er im Vorteil. Allerdings sind aggressive Gruppen anf\u00e4llig gegen Provokationen. Provozierende Gruppen haben es wiederum schwer gegen freundliche Gegner. Und dann gibts noch Auswirkungen, wenn Gruppen gleichen Gem\u00fcts aufeinandertreffen (z.B. Beleidungsduell mit Affen). Wer im \"Kampf\" dann auf einmal statt freundlichen Worten dem Gegen\u00fcber die Faust ins Gesicht schl\u00e4gt, ist dann schnell \"aggressiv\". So kann man das Kampfsystem zu seinem Vorteil nutzen. H\u00f6rt sich alles furchtbar kompliziert an, spielt sich aber einfach. Die K\u00e4mpfe sind aber nur ein Teil des Spiels. Wer mag, kann vielen K\u00e4mpfen auch einfach aus dem Weg gehen. \nEs wird einem n\u00e4mlich angezeigt, was einen (grob) erwartet, wenn man ein bestimmtes Feld bereist. Beispielsweise ist auf einem Feld ein Kampfsymbol und ein Forschungssymbol. Wer nur nach Gold sucht, schickt seine Helden also lieber woanders hin. Auch hier sei nochmal die Abwechslung erw\u00e4hnt. Die Areale, die man bereist, sind n\u00e4mlich weitgehend zufallsgeneriert, deswegen findet man auch beim vierten Mal auf der Karibikinsel einen neuen Schatz.\n\nInsgesamt betrachtet ist das Spiel immer f\u00fcr eine Runde gut. Irgendwann merkt man dann, dass man hier viel mehr Zeit verbracht hat, als bei so manchem Vollpreisspiel. Und man bereut es dabei keine einzige Sekunde, wenn man mal wieder ganze Inseln pl\u00fcndert, sich mit Highlandern anfreundet oder einen Riesenaffen so lange traurig macht, bis man ihn einsperren kann.", "timestamp_created": 1494151493, "timestamp_updated": 1494151493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31600497": {"recommendationid": "31600497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008464852", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507981154}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun roguelike game.

There's no right way to play it, and any play style is rewarding and fun.  There's quite a bit of depth to the encounter system where you have to carefully manage the mood of your party, your enemies, as well as the general mood of the encounter.\n\nThe character system is well done, using a simple ability 'tree' to decide how to customize your characters as they gain experience, as well as a very pen and paper feeling perk system to highlight the skills of your characters.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the character system can feel a little shallow, with few choices and levels, each character has a very limited spread of paths they can take.  Some people would likely argue that the simplicity makes it more appealing, but I've always prefered more depth and complexity to games.\n\nThe campaign is fun, and relatively short (a few hours to beat it).  Much of the premise of the game revolves around the idea of the game being highly replayable, and while superficially it appears to be, after a number of plays, I find that the game begins to grow stale.  In terms of content, there are only 11 expeditions in the base game, 3 of which are mutually exclusive (you play the one that is most suited to your team's playstyle as the first expedition, the others can never be chosen), leaving you with only 8 choices for the rest of the game.  Within each expedition, there's quite a bit of variety, and no single expedition ever takes the same path, but they always reach the same destination.  Once you've played an expedition once, you always know how it will end and this takes away a lot of the fun of exploring.  After a few campaign playthroughs, its likely that you've played every expedition multiple times and have seen most, if not all, of the optional events within.\n\nThe campaign also offers a marathon mode, which allows you to continue exploring with your team, until you've completed every expedition, however the level cap is usually reached after 5, leading to no additional character progression, beyond events within expeditions.\n\nOverall the game is excellent, and very worth the price.  Unfortunately it is lacking in content, which takes away from its 'endless adventures' premise.  The devs have released one expansion pack as of this review, with 2 new expeditions, and other is due in a few weeks with a 3rd new expedition, but I do not believe that a few new expeditions are going to be enough to improve the long term gameplay enough.  I would like to see them add additional variation to each expedition, allowing the random generator to also randomly generate the goal of the expedition, and add in a number of new goals and treasures to that end.  It would go a long way to improve the general randomness and unpredictability of the game, and greatly extend the game's lifespan, in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1493606918, "timestamp_updated": 1493606918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31472790": {"recommendationid": "31472790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051994866", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493944799}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pretty nice game.

It's by the same studio that made Reus, and there are some familiar elements, unsure to what extent it takes the \"you need to have the wiki open to play this\" style that Reus had but I can say it's not zero. As far as this niche of fire emblemy rougelites goes, this looks like it might be the best of them.\n\nEdit: After playing a lot more, I'm happy to recommend this as an excellent rougelike. Once you know the game pretty well the mechanics come together in a very coherent package, and many of the elements that make this genre work for me are present:\n-Really encourages greed. The map is basically the same as FTL, except rather than just being stuck when you run out of fuel, you can keep moving but acquire a temporary debuff each move. Since there's always a boss at the end of each area, acquire too many of these debuffs and the boss will mulch you... but so many shinies! There are similar opportunities to be greedy in all the other scopes of gameplay.\n-Adaptively set your own difficulty. Relating to the above, the basic goal of the game is actually pretty simple (get 2.5k points in 5 runs). Then the game gives you a subtle \"but what if you got 10k points???\" and thus you get to balance maximizing your score while not getting completely stomped because greed.\n-Diverse playstyles. I've got a main team, and quite a few ideas I want to try. There's a big aspect of building team compositions, and most of them are viable depending on how greedy you are.\n-RNG that creates variety but doesn't usually screw you. In terms of procedural generation, it makes the maps unique but all the things you'd want to prepare for are guaranteed and obvious in advance. The dice rolls can mostly be bypassed, and don't kill you outright so much as make combat harder (and you're gonna do that to yourself anyway).\n-Informed decisions. Play for 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean.\n-Nuanced combat. Sure early on you can just oneshot everything, but once you start getting greedy you'll have to find depth in the combat, and there's a lot of it. It's fire emblem except you can control enemy aggro, and have several emotion systems to leverage to win a 3v10.\n\nSo yeah, if you're into this sort of roguelike, pick this up.

I'll also preface this with one very important thing: [b]If you enjoy darkest dungeon, and can cope with the complete reversal of style, YOU NEED THIS GAME.[/b] It's like a way more colourful and slightly less 2d darkest dungeon and it will probably feel very familiar.\n\nSo what kind of game is Renowned Explorer? It describes itself as a rogue-like, but that's not strictly true. It's not a classic rogue-like, and arguably it doesnt really [i]feel[/i] like one. The game is split into three distinct modes, the expeditions themselves, combat during them and preparing for your next expedition. Combat is self-explanatory, pitting your team of explorers against many fantastic enemies. From angry Scotsmen in the highlands, to Voodoo Pirates in the Carribean, to.. well, some of the more incredible fights are actually best left to discover for yourself. Let's say you may be uncovering the truth about a few famous myths and legends!\n\nThere's three (and a half) currencies you earn throughout the game, each giving you some sort of boon when you spend them in between expeditions. Gold buys you items, either plain old armor and weapons or little trinkets which benefit your explorers in some way. Status buys you friends, either generic helpers who can make it so you earn even more money/status or ones that can do stuff a bit more unique. Research acts much like skill trees in any other game, in simple terms. You unlock a tree and then spend exponentially increasing amounts of research to improve it. The game does a really good job of explaining it so don't worry if that doesn't make sense.\n\nExpeditions feel a lot like a choose your own adventure campaign, I'd honestly liken it to dealing with encounters in DnD. The map is split up into nodes and each one will (usually) have something on it. Sometimes your team stumbles upon a bunch of gold coins. Sometimes you come up against angry scorpions. Sometimes your team has a bit more of a choice.\n\nAs an example (and I'll spoilertag the end bit because it's really one of the best moments in the game when you find it - and actually its in one of the DLCs anyway which as an aside YOU REALLY SHOULD BUY): At one point in the game you find yourself face to face with someone blocking your path down a mountain. He insists that you must beat him in some ancient game. You can face off against him fairly, and having someone who knows tactics will do well. You could cheat, but, is cheating on an ancient boardgame really ever a good idea? OR: [spoiler]if you have someone who's a really good survivalist, you can [b]take the game board and surf it down the mountain. It's an absolutely awesome moment that you really need to see for yourself.[/b][/spoiler]. I'm spoilertagging that because it's a hidden choice, and the game is full of them. There are often points where it seems like you'll never be able to get past this normally and you're resigned to your fate, until you go there with a certain explorer...\n\nDifficulty wise? It's hard, but it's not frustrating.. most of the time. It can be a bit annoying when you wipe to an encounter you really should have prepped better for, but since a full game takes about 1 to 2 hours, its no big loss. If you love achievements, there are a ton in this game. You only need to beat the game on the hardest mode with every single explorer for a captain!\n\nAnd lets take that to talk about the characters. God, every single one of them is so fun and unique and full of charm. Each has their own upsides and downsides and, with the More to Explore dlc, their own campfire story which gives them a little bit more characterization than you'd normally get. It's hard not to feel your heart melt when you see your other two party members cheer on Emilia, the shy botanist from Poland, as she finds a super rare flower that she's been looking for forever.\n\nSeriously, not only are the characters each unique and charming, they're also diverse. Honestly, how many games can you name featuring a main character from Ghana? Kwame is a diplomat hailing from an Ashanti tribe and he fits in perfectly with the rest of the cast. Bia is a freedom fighter from Greece. Kiwi came to the society from Samoa, making her own damn boat to sail to Australia and then on to London! The Emperor's Challenge DLC adds Phaillin, a deceptively charming speaker from Thailand and Suh Min-Jeong, the very young Korean scientist. I think you get the idea. Abbey Games should be commended for creating such a diverse and interesting cast! (well, there's no explicitly gay character yet.. although the charming Maria gets a campfire story that causes another crew member of any gender to fall in love with her- although she'll reject a female crew member saying she's 'out of that phase' now, which isnt great but its something at least)\n\nIn closing, I really really recommend this game. If any single bit of it looks interesting to you, you should buy it. Right now, it's 60% off which is an absolute steal in my eyes. Please buy this game.\n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492984615, "timestamp_updated": 1498231917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525692", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31313867": {"recommendationid": "31313867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292930117", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501597853}, "language": "english", "review": "Seduce nuns! \nBeat wolves with shovels!  \nInsult mummies by saying they've soiled themselves! \n\nAll three of those are things you can do in Renowned Explorers. \nYou have your four classes (Scientists, Fighters, Speakers and Scouts) and they all work pretty much like any RPG.

There's three main facets to this game:\n\nFirst, there's a series of text-based events describing the people, places, and artifacts you encounter on your expeditions. You can make choices about how to respond, with the skills and personality traits of your crew unlocking extra options or providing bonuses.\n\nSecond, there's grid-based tactical combat. They've got a medium-weight combat system where each character has 3 basic moves and learns more specialized techniques as they level up. You can defeat opponents by beating them up, or by breaking their spirit with taunts and insults, or by winning them over with compliments and friendly banter. The moves you choose to use change your party's overall attitude, which can provide combat bonuses or penalties, influence enemy tactics, and change your rewards for the encounter.\n\nThird, there's a resource management system. As you journey, you collect gold, fame, and research that can be used to upgrade your equipment, recruit an encourage, and research new abilities. Many of the things you can buy feed back into resource generation for future expeditions, so it's got a growth-optimization angle that reminds me a little of Civilization and similar games (though the actual mechanics are thoroughly different).\n\nThe skill system is notable: characters have skill ratings in general categories like Archaeologist, Diplomat, or Athlete, but your rating is simply a count of how many individual skills you have within that category (for instance, the Diplomat category has things like Languages, Customs, and Politics), which are sometimes individually important and also influence how you can rank up (there's no benefit to getting Diplomat: Languages from 2 different sources, but there is a benefit to getting both Diplomat: Languages and Diplomat: Customs).", "timestamp_created": 1492576934, "timestamp_updated": 1492576934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485944", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31218171": {"recommendationid": "31218171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002251822", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 15709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503943914}, "language": "english", "review": "Just...One...More...

It's a turn-based strategy game with a really interesting mechanic: moods and attitudes. Each side of the battle (you vs. them) each have one of three attitudes (friendly, devious and aggressive), and the combination of your attitude and the enemy's creates an overall mood (ex. hostile = both parties aggressive or persuasive = you friendly and them devious). Each mood has bonuses or penalties, and there's a rock-paper-scissors system so you know which way to shift your attitude to get the bonuses and avoid the penalties. (Friendly beats devious, devious beats aggressive, aggressive beats friendly.) You win battles with your built-in powers. There is some overlap between characters on the powers, but not a lot. There are area attacks, line attacks, and single-target attacks, and by default every character has one attack from each attitude, plus some bonus ones that fit their own personal strengths and personalities. (Yes, seduce is an attack you can actually use, and no, it's not gender specific). It's good for all kinds of different playstyles.\n\nBut that's just the battles! \n\nThe other main part of the game is exploring. You have 5 expeditions to a campaign (you can do more after that, but most of the achievements are turned off for anything past 5). Each expedition puts you on an island with tons of people to interact with, and depending on which three characters you have in your party, the outcomes can change. Ex. If you don't have a character with a high enough level in archaeology you won't find a really cool thingamajig, or there is one boss I didn't even realize I hadn't actually faced because I couldn't get past the skill checks to fight him. The options are basically things like \"This person needs food. Help this person out (Lose 1 supplies. Reward: Gain status)\" or \"Help them out, but for a price (Lose 1 supplies. Reward: Gain 1 Collect)\" or \"Don't help them and move on.\" You can also do things like punch people in the face and start a fight, decide which people to send on supply runs, whether to skip a fight at the cost of supplies, etc. Your choices often require a spin of a chance wheel, with your various applicable skills increasing your percentage chance. Certain islands/areas that you travel to will have research, money, or status collectibles, each of which will help your party gain renown and come out on top in the eyes of the Renowned Explorer: International Society and beat your rival. There are also treasures you collect, which have special one-time or permanent bonuses (if you get the DLC you get to choose the bonuses from a list), which add to your renown.\n\nThere are also a ton of difficulty levels: easy, normal, classic, and impossible. Easy might make the battles easier, but I've still died plenty of times, and after 100 hours of play (including the DLC), I still haven't found all the treasures. In addition to the difficulty, there are two ways to play: Discovery mode (where you can restart a battle if you kill your party or run out of \"resolve,\" which you can also collect), and Adventure mode, which makes it more like a Roguelike with no restarts. There are also TONS of achievements for both modes, and there are 20 achievement for winning the game with each of 20 characters in any mode and then 20 more for doing it with each of them in adventure mode, so there's going to be a lot of replays if you want to go to 100%.\n\nOverall:\n\nPros:\n+Great art.\n+Adaptive music. Much of the music repeats, but it's adaptive, and will become more aggressive when the mood changes or more laid back when the mood drops back to more friendly terms.\n+ TONS of depth. Playing with just one different character in your party can open up new avenues for the same interaction. Finishing a battle with a different attitude can give you different treasures, or open up new avenues of exploration like hints to hidden treasure.\n+ Skill upgrades. Each character comes with a few built-in skills, which you can upgrade. Your character can be super amazing at one skill, or multi-talented in a bunch.\n+ Items to purchase! Items give attack bonuses, defense, or additional skills. You have to upgrade shops with money to get better items, but items come with really good bonuses or tons of extra skills.\n+ Entourages. You can spend status points to gain helpers and specialists who give you bonuses in research, collect, and status.\n+ Research trees! Spend research points to collect renown faster, get bonuses for ending battles with a certain attitude, get extra skills, etc.\n+ Unique characters! 4 classes, 5 different characters in each class, all with different weapons, behaviors, skills, homelands, an designs. No photocopied characters here. There's even more background to them in the DLC. Personality traits even affect your choices in interactions. Ex. A greedy character in your party will, in one case, go back for more treasure and decrease your chance to escape through a closing tomb door in time.\n+ Your choices matter! You can only go on 5 expeditions. The first one is chosen at random, then you have your choice of 2-3 new expeditions, then after that one you have 2-3 additional choices, etc. So although there are a limited number of choices, you can decide whether to play it safe and explore only easy islands, or go for the big rewards and go for the hardest ones. Some of the expeditions are suited to different types of parties or attitudes (aggressive, devious or aggressive), or they may be tempting because they are high in money, or research, or status. Once you're on an island, you have a limited amount of supplies, so you can't search everywhere for treasure without getting serious penalties for the boss battle. Luckily, each spot is labeled with all the possible types of events that could happen there, so you have a hint of what may come, and can plan your route accordingly.\n+ DLC is great. There should be another one coming out eventually, but the current one has two new expeditions (with tons of treasures and new mechanics, plus Charles Darwin riding a raptor). There are also collectible campfire stories to get more bonuses, skills, and backstory for your crew. These campfire stories do make it easier to beat the game without dying quite so much.\n+ Great sound design. Characters don't talk, but they do make Sims-esque, barely intelligble noises during battle that are great.\n+ TONS of achievements.\n+ Interesting fight mechanics (see earlier)\n\nNeutral:\n~ Great variety of difficulty settings, but even easy is not free of death or total party death.\n~ Some people might get bored by the lack of a long campaign. Just 5 expeditions and the game is *basically* over and you have to restart, and there aren't a ton of different exhibitions. I've played 117 hours thus far, so it doesn't bother me.\n~ A lot of reading. It's nice that you can cycle through it really fast, and it has great flavor to it, and sometimes hints as to what choice to make for which outcome, but I skip it most of the time and just look at the choices. It often means missing vital information.\n\nCons:\n- You can't move after you attack? What the hell?\n\nYou will collect a metric sh*t-ton of stuff. You will murder friendly sheep. You will slap people. Dinosaurs will wiggle their butts at you in taunting. Scotsmen will punch you. You can die via friendly thumbs-up. Just play this game. It is fun. It will make you smile.

Et je ne regrette absolument pas cet achat.\nDans [i]Renowned Explorers: International Society[/i], on g\u00e8re une \u00e9quipe d'explorateurs dont le but est de devenir la meilleure \u00e9quipe d'explorateurs au monde, et pour \u00e7a il va leur falloir acqu\u00e9rir de la renomm\u00e9e \u00e0 travers 5 exp\u00e9ditions durant lesquelles ils vont faire des d\u00e9couvertes, r\u00e9colter des tr\u00e9sors et trouvailles, et amasser richesses, \u00e9tudes et r\u00e9putation.\nCela d\u00e9pend comment on joue, mais comptez entre 15 et 30 minutes par exp\u00e9dition, pour souvent une partie entre 2 et 3 heures. La force et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du jeu c'est sa rejouabilit\u00e9, parce que en fonction des personnages que l'on prend et la fa\u00e7on dont on veut jouer, certaines destinations sont plus adapt\u00e9es que d'autres, et surtout les \u00e9v\u00e8nements varient en fonction des personnages et de leurs classes/comp\u00e9tences, donnant acc\u00e8s \u00e0 d'autres actions et tr\u00e9sors.\nNiveau personnages justement, il y a 4 classes : scientifique, scout, combattant, et orateur (\"speaker\"). Avec 5 personnages par classe, cela nous donne 20 explorateurs diff\u00e9rents avec chacun leurs caract\u00e8res, comp\u00e9tences, attaques, et animations bien s\u00fbr. Et comme pour faire une \u00e9quipe il faut d\u00e9signer un capitaine et deux autres membres, cela laisse beaucoup de combinaisons possibles.\nConcernant les combats, il y a 3 approches : amicale, vicieuse, ou agressive. En fonction des attaques et \u00e9motions des personnages et ennemis, les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts et effets seront diff\u00e9rents. Et en fonction des diff\u00e9rentes approches, les \u00e9v\u00e8nements et choix et seront diff\u00e9rents pendant les exp\u00e9ditions. Encore une fois ici, c'est \u00e0 vous de choisir comment vous jouez parmi une multitude de choix.\nEn bref, il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de contenu dans ce jeu et \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de possibilit\u00e9 dans la fa\u00e7on de jouer.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 musiques et sons, c'est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able et r\u00e9ussi, l'ambiance est au rendez-vous. Graphiquement, \u00e7a a son style particulier et \u00e7a fonctionne vraiment bien. Notez aussi une grosse dose d'humour dans le jeu, que ce soit dans les dialogues, situations, personnages, animations et autres dessins.\n\nN\u00e9anmoins si je devais critiquer quelque chose dans le jeu, ce serait sa r\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9. C'est-\u00e0-dire que m\u00eame si il y a plusieurs fa\u00e7ons de r\u00e9soudre/approcher/subir un \u00e9v\u00e8nement, l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement en lui-m\u00eame reste le m\u00eame, donc on est souvent amen\u00e9 \u00e0 revoir les m\u00eames choses \u00e0 chaque fois qu'on va dans une destination, l'impression de nouveaut\u00e9 n'est plus trop l\u00e0. Mais bon c'est in\u00e9vitable dans ce genre de jeu. Il y a aussi assez peu d'exp\u00e9ditions \u00e0 faire. Il y a tout de m\u00eame une bonne dizaine de destinations diff\u00e9rentes, mais lors de la deuxi\u00e8me partie on fait celles qu'on n'a pas fait pendant la premi\u00e8re, et \u00e0 part 2 ou 3 autres destinations tutos inclus on a fait le tour une premi\u00e8re fois. C'est une critique sans en \u00eatre une, c'est plut\u00f4t une remarque, l'impression que j'ai eu en jouant, je m'attendais juste \u00e0 plus de destinations je pense.\n\nMais malgr\u00e9 \u00e7a, [i]Renowned Explorers: International Society[/i] est un super jeu que je vous recommande vivement.

C'est un peu un m\u00e9lange des genres. On retrouve des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du rogue-like, du RPG, du jeu d'aventure mais aussi un peu de gestion.\n\nConcr\u00e8tement, une partie se d\u00e9roule en cinq exp\u00e9ditions. Durant chacune de ces exp\u00e9ditions, vous aurez un certain nombre de d\u00e9placements et de rencontres sur un plateau, jusqu'\u00e0 arriver \u00e0 un tr\u00e9sor.

One playthrough of the game only takes about 5 hours, but this isn't a game where you just play it once. You need to play through it multiple times to get the most out of it. The good thing is that there is tons of replaybility to the game.\n\nFirst off, you have 16 characters to choose from in order to make a team of 3. Each one of those characters has unique starting stats, and different skill sets divided into four different classes. On *top* of that, each character has a special ability that gets put into place when they are the captain of the team, but in order to unlock 12 of the characters to use as captains, you need to play through one full game using those characters. So you have plenty of incentive to try different teams to see who works well together and unlock the additonal characters as captains.\n\nIn addition to that, since there are multiple locations you can visit in a single playthrough, but can only visit five in total, you can taking a totally different route each time. Even if you take the same route, the nodes on the maps can be different each time, or you might end up being able to tackle different challenges with different team members, or being able to take a different approach to certain situations can change things up significantly. In each of the five playthroughs I've had, I've experienced very little repetition.\n\nOh, and one more thing. You have multiple difficulty settings, ranging from Easy, up to Impossible. There's also two modes available; Discovery, which allows for saving/loading anytime, and Adventure, which is an Ironman-style, every decision counts type of mode that turns this into a roguelike. Since you can use any of the four difficulties on either of the two modes, you effectively have EIGHT different difficulty settings.\n\nOf course, there has to be enjoyable gameplay to make you want to play through it again and again, and this game offers that in spades. You have a world map, where you can spend 'Insight' that you earn to acquire resources like status, gold, and research, all of which you can then spend in various shops to improve your crew members. \n\nFrom there, you go to one of the expeditions, travel through various nodes exploring what you can based on your supplies, which deplete as you travel. Each node can offer different challenges and encounters that will reward you with resources and treasure as you progress towards the final boss of the map.\n\nNow, your ultimate goal in all of this is acquire more then 2500 renown and become the worlds most renowned explorer, and you earn this renown through treasures, and from the various resources depending on how you play the game. It is actually fairly deep and complex so I'll leave it to you to figure out yourself, but once you get it figured out, it's very rewarding.\n\nThe most enjoyable part of the game, at least for me personally, is the encounter system. It's based around emotions; you can be aggressive, which is your standard just 'beat the crap out of everyone' type of thing; but then have devious abilities, which consist of taunting and mocking your opponent to make them angry, sad and scared; or you can even use friendly moves to make them worship you in amazement, or convince them that your cause is the best one. The battles can change drastically depending on which mood you use, and what your opponent decides to use. Also, resolving specific encounters in different ways offers different rewards, and depending on who is in your team of three, you might be better suited to one type of mood or another. There's a bit of a rock/paper/scissors deal with the emotions, but sometimes it's not as simple as using the right emotion at the right time. Again, I'll leave the intricate parts of this system for you to figure out.\n\nIf you hadn't figured it out yet, I 100% recommend this game to everyone who's a fan of turn based games, as this offers something completely different from the normal stuff you find. The replay value alone is worth the money, along with excellent developers, a welcome community, and weekly challenges available from the forums that you can try your hand at for bragging rights. \n\nBottom line: go buy the game and get to exploring!", "timestamp_created": 1488506202, "timestamp_updated": 1488506396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30265071": {"recommendationid": "30265071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044376754", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516090446}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cool little game that combines rouge-like elements with tactical RPG battles.

It's pretty difficult, but certainly rewarding.  \n\nAlso in regards to the battle system, I think it's really cool that fighting isn't the only way to solve conflict.  You can get through battles by being 'nice' or 'devious' in addition to just smashing the opponent.  These three techniques are kind of a rock-paper-scissors kind of thing, so be wary of which one you're using for each encounter.\n\nI'm only ~12 hours in at the time of this review, but I'm confident that I'll be playing plenty more.

With cartoonish charm, they have reduced death and violence and substituted  manipulation, charm and seduction instead. A welcome change to killing everybody all day all night! Violence is one of 3 options. Instead of Hit Points, the battle is won when Resolve (the will to go on) is reduced to 0.\n\nWith four classes to choose from, you create a team of 3 exlorers and send them on 5 expeditions, returning to town in between. In town, you improve your gear and skills and level up your toons. After 5 expeditions, the game is over. There are a few maps to choose from but not a huge number, but you can replay them with a different team, skills and gear later. There is some randomness to how the maps are generated and play, but each map is a story, and the bullet points of the story are the same each time. Each time you play the Hungarian Fort map, you are seeking The Alchemist, for example.\n\nAs an older gamer, I find some of the graphics and sound effects a bit childish but simultaneously charming. And the ability to use speech instead of violence is totally overdue in this kind of game - VERY refreshing. This game will not be a life-replacement game for most people, but it is fun, solid and without any bugs that I could find. None. Very easy to get 50 hours of fun. I will probably get 200 out of it utlimately. Some people complain about the RNG, but I did not find that to be a problem.

However if this excites you then go ahead and buy Renowned Explorers: International Society ASAP; it might just be up your alley.", "timestamp_created": 1488083917, "timestamp_updated": 1488083917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30185881": {"recommendationid": "30185881", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991875201", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507712863}, "language": "koreana", "review": "FTL+\ub355\ud14c\uc77c\uc988+\ud0dd\ud2f1\uc2a4 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c \uac8c\uc784\n\n\uc138\uacc4 \uacf3\uacf3\uc744 \ub2e4\ub2c8\uba70 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uba85\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc5ec\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\ub97c \uc81c\uce58\uace0 1\ub4f1 \ubaa8\ud5d8\uac00\uac00 \ub418\ub294 \uac8c \ubaa9\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8\uc740 \ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c\ub77c\uc11c \uc138\uc774\ube0c, \ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\uace0 \uc8fd\uc73c\uba74 \ub05d\ub09c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc77c\ubc18 \uac8c\uc784\ucc98\ub7fc \uc138\uc774\ube0c, \ub85c\ub4dc\uac00 \uc790\uc720\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub514\uc2a4\ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \ub35c \ubc1b\uace0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud560 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4.\n\n\uacfc\ud559\uc790, \uc2a4\uce74\uc6b0\ud2b8, \ud30c\uc774\ud130, \ub2ec\ubcc0\uac00\uc758 \ub124\uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c1\uc5c5 20\uba85\uc758 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc911 3\uba85\uc744 \uace8\ub77c\uc11c \ubaa8\ud5d8\uc744 \ub5a0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uc9c1\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ubcc4\ub85c \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\uace0 \uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\ub3c4 \uae38\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ub2ec\ub9ac\ud574 \uac00\uba74\uc11c \ub2e4\ud68c\ucc28 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4.\n\n\uc77c\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc11c\uba74, FTL\ucc98\ub7fc \uac08\ub798\uae38\uc744 \ud55c \uce78\uc529 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc774\uba70 \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub3c4\ucc29\ud55c \uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc8c\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \ub54c\ub85c\ub294 \uc804\ud22c\ub3c4 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc704\uc8fc\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc601\uc5b4\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uc5b4\ub835\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uc120\ud0dd\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uacb0\uacfc\ub098 \uc131\uacf5\ud655\ub960 \ub4f1\uc774 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ud574\ub2f9 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc744 \ub3cc\uc544\ub2e4\ub2c8\uba70 \uc218\uc9d1, \ubc1c\uacac, \ud559\uc2b5, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0\ub294 \ubb3c\uc790\ub97c \uc18c\ube44\ud558\uba70 \ubb3c\uc790\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc774\uba74 \ub2a5\ub825\uce58\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ubbc0\ub85c \uc798 \ub530\uc838\uac00\uba74\uc11c \uc774\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb3c\uc790\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4. \n\n\uc804\ud22c\ub294 \ud0dd\ud2f1\uc2a4 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc5d0 \uc880 \uce90\uc8fc\uc5bc\ud55c\ub370, \ubd84\uc704\uae30 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub780 \uac8c \uc788\ub2e4. \uc804\ud22c\ub294 \ud3c9\ud654, \uae30\ub9cc, \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 3\uac00\uc9c0 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294\ub370, \ud3c9\ud654\ub294 \uc801\uc744 \uce6d\ucc2c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc790\uc2e0\ub97c \ubf50\ub0b4\uac70\ub098 \ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744, \uae30\ub9cc\uc740 \uc704\ud611\uc774\ub098 \uc870\ub871 \ub4f1\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744, \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub9d0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc758 \uc804\uc758\ub97c \uaebe\ub294\ub2e4.

I'm not even a good example to review this product, since this this is not my game genre, but when I bought it I decided to take a shot in the dark and, oh boy, was I glad I did... This game can suck an entire day out of your life simply because you are having too much fun with it and not even realizing. The sense of progression (the RPG part) is extremely satisfying: Every time you get a new perk or a new item for your charecter, you end up rediscovering the entire game. The sense of a strong party is also really good, since after three or four \"encounters\" (battles), you get a hold of your entire deck and understand the roles which your charecters will assume once in battle to achieve maximum efficiency. Of course the game's focous is the adventure you see yourself in and the infinite deck of possibilities is what really makes it fun. Choosing who is going to do what in a certain event decides everything you'll get from an exploration. To top it off, I'd just like to add how the devs perfectly integrated a dynamic combat system, with nine different variables that affect the gameplay, all of which depend on a charecters emotional strength, mood and defense power. You can learn more about this in the store page or just buyin' the game already, cause that is going to be my final point: Even if nothing in this review called your attention, many other things in-game will, being why I strongly suggest that you should buy Renowned Explorers: International Society.", "timestamp_created": 1488053263, "timestamp_updated": 1488053263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30168347": {"recommendationid": "30168347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060103458", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487850074}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u82f1\u6587\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u969c\u788d\u53cd\u6b63\u73a9\u591a\u4e86\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53bb\u770b\u5267\u60c5\u3002\n\u524d\u51e0\u904d\u73a9\u90fd\u662f\u5f88\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1488032308, "timestamp_updated": 1488032308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30129656": {"recommendationid": "30129656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043876765", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487639949}, "language": "english", "review": "What a fun and inventive game!\n\nPros:\n-The campaigns are quick and fast\n-Highly addicting, you will always want to beat your last score\n-Tons of replayability\n-High amount of character choices and combinations\n-Really funny and interesting scenarios\n-Plemty to collect\n\nCons:\n-Not intended to be very long\n-Wish there were a few more places to explore\n-Will feel repetitive after a while\n\nThis is absolutely a game to buy for some light casual fun, and it serves it's purpose!", "timestamp_created": 1487892563, "timestamp_updated": 1487892563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30127451": {"recommendationid": "30127451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043597674", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492801962}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game on a hungover sunday for some casual treasure hunting. \nProceeded to do 'one last expedition' till 4 in the morning. \nWork on monday was a blast...\nCame home from work, bought the expansion.\nNo regrets.\n\nCool game that really took me by surprise!", "timestamp_created": 1487884587, "timestamp_updated": 1487884587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30105024": {"recommendationid": "30105024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996147260", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487788129}, "language": "english", "review": "RE:IS takes a simple idea that is feels similar to many other TBS games, and elevates it to a new level.

Each play-though can be done with different characters, each with their own personality quirks, and the maps will change with every new game. This means that there is a good deal of randomness which takes each short play-through and turns it into a springboard to enhance your subsequent play-through.

The game is set in a vibrant and quirky version of the late 19th century where both magic and quasi-steampunk technology abound, making for an incredibly colorful and interesting world full of weird and wonderful people and places to discover. It is well written, thoroughly enjoyable to play, and suitable for all ages.\n\nThe goal of the game is to achieve the title of \"Most Renowned Explorer\" by assembling a team of intrepid adventurers for the purpose of collecting treasures from various exotic locations around the globe. Each location has its own set of mysteries and treasures to uncover, and every character has his or her own individual backstory and unique personality that can affect their synergy with other characters, your interactions with the environment, and thus your overall chances of success. The team you choose and the decisions you make along the way will determine whether or not you rise to unprecendented heights of fame and glory, or fade into total obscurity... or worse.\n\nThe game also features an innovative turn-based combat system that incorporates emotion and mood into the tactical gameplay, allowing for battles to be resolved peacefully as well as by the usual violent means. The result is a 'rock, paper, scissors' style element to fighting that adds quite a lot more depth to combat than the standard RPG fare of merely switching between physical attacks and magic attacks. Choosing to resolve certain conflicts with a particular method can even unlock new dialogue and treasure-hunting opportunities, which makes having to choose between a well rounded team and a highly specialized one all the more compelling.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this title to anyone looking for a truly one of a kind, lighthearted, and endlessly replayable adventure/resource management/strategy game in the spirit of FTL: Faster Than Light or Reus.

Which is not to say it's without some flaws.\n\nRE defies categorization.  You'll see it described as a \"rogue-like\" but I think that's a misnomer.  It certainly doesn't feel like one to me.  There's greater characterization and better narrative, and you have a distinct goal (win-condition) beyond just surviving for as long as possible.  Rather, it reminds me of big, theme-heavy adventure-RPG boardgames like Arkham/Eldritch Horror, Runebound, Fortune & Glory, etc.  Collect a party of heroes with different skill-sets, send them to unique locales where they will face challenges (i.e., skill checks) and gain experience & loot.  Then, level them up, buy better equipment, and set out for a tougher but more rewarding expedition.  GIven that I love boardgames, it's perhaps not surprising that I quite like RE.  \n\nFor brevity's sake, here's my quick list of pros and cons...\n\nPros:\n1.  The length of a single \"campaign\" feels just right to me.  In order to win, you need to complete 5 expeditions - with the additional goal of accruing enough Renown to rank higher than all your competitors.  In actual playtime, this can take you around 1-3 hours (depending on how leisurely you are about shopping).  That's perfect for a relaxing Saturday morning with a cup of coffee.\n\n2.  There's a nice ebb and flow to RE.  You go on an expedition, which will involve ~7-15 \"encounters\" - some of which are battles and some of which are skill-checks.  You'll win most of your skill checks, but there's enough chance for failure that it's still tense when the RNG kicks in.  Combat is interesting and maybe a little muddled (more on that below), but you'll have only a few battles per expedition and, again, that feels just right.  Once the expedition is over, you fly back to London to spend research points, buy better equipment for your crew, and gather an entourage (which boost your ability to collect resources).  The back and forth between exploring and leveling feels great.\n\n3.  There's a fantastic selection of characters to choose from, and it's here where a lot of the replayability in RE comes from.  There are different classes that comes with different starting skills (scientists, scouts, etc.).  There are glass cannons and tanks and everything in between.  You'll want to try another run-through with an entirely different cast.  And these crews will largely determine how you approach combat:  with friendly diplomacy, devious emotional manipulation, or outright violence.  Once you learn the systems of the game, you can start seeing synergies and possible strategies (e.g., choose 3 characters with the ability to terrify and unlock the research tree that enhances the power of terror). \n\n4.  The difficulty seems tuned just right.  It's tough to win a campaign, but not so tough that you're discouraged and wondering if the designers are sadists.  It took me 3 play-throughs to win my first campaign on the \"classic\" (hard) difficulty.  It felt good winning and I thought that I had made a lot of solid decisions that helped me get that far.  After 15 hours of play, you'll be able to win most of the time unless you take big risks to try and max your renown.\n\nCons:\n1. There's maybe not enough variability in the expeditions themselves.  I'm already a little tired of seeing the same locations and fighting the same bosses.  This game will really benefit from DLC and mini-content updates.\n\n2.  There's definitely not enough variability in the equipment.  I was disappointed to discover that shops always carry the same stuff, and it never varies between games.  That seems like a missed opportunity to make every run-through feel different.  As it is, I'm already finding myself gravitating towards the same items/build-order on each playthrough.\n\n3.  The combat is opaque at first - and once you discover how it works, I'm not sure if the added complexity is worth the price of admission.  It all depends on whether you're looking for another position-based tactical game (X-COM, etc.) or whether you're willing to try something new.  There's less emphasis on positioning and % hit-rate, and much more emphasis on trying to maximize damage output via manipulation of the innovative emotion system.  On your first couple playthroughs, you'll be largely confused about the variety of effects and modifiers - but if you persist, the tactical layers reveal themselves in a very satisfying fashion.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend the game.  A great mix of adventure-RPG-tactical gameplay.

You can be friendly, devious, or outright aggressive, meaning that talking is not a free action anymore and can in fact defeat an opponent, whether through messing with their head or convincing them that you're awesome and they should help you.\n\nI highly recommend this game for its unique approach, its humor, and its art.

It's a fairly fun tactics game that has a unique twist on your turn-based battle system. I think the aspect of non-violent victories is interesting, and I love the diverse cast of characters to choose from. Mechanics are enjoyable, although a bit chance based. I actually rather enjoyed the gambling aspect of encounters and also being able to mitigate luck through skills.\n\nHowever, the issues I've found is that for a game designed around multiple playthroughs, and from having different win possibilities, the gameplay starts to feel a bit repetitive. There big plot points remain identical through playthroughs without new dialogue or different outcomes. I will admit that there are a variety of locations to pick from, and plenty of perhaps unexpelored encounters i did not see that do add variety, but it all funnels back to the same ending for that respective location. Still, overall, a fun game, but if you're like me and bad at these sorts of games despite loving them, you will find yourself dying and starting campaigns over fairly consistently which can be a bit tedious due to the repetition.\n\nOne other note I'd make is this game is not optimized well for Mac. I'm on a brand new macbook pro with graphics card and memory both fully upgraded and I still had graphical issues in the skirmishes. I've researched the issue and it seems the general answer from the developer to mac users is to run it through bootcamp with Windows OS.

Without offering too many spoilers, in this game you can:\n\n-Take a team of archaeologists to Egypt, ransacking treasures like the glory days of colonial nostalgia\n-Help a sailor grow a beard\n-Insult sheep to advance the game\n-Have your German professor get everyone drunk\n-Punch out a nun and have one of your characters feel awful about it for the rest of the game.  \n\nBonus points from this anthropologist for having anthropology be the encounter-based research field, even though even 19th century anthropologists rarely engaged other cultures with their fists.

The art style is cartoonish and playful, and the mechanics are smooth and easy to use. The idea of three different approaches (Friendly, Devious, or Aggressive) to your expedition is unique, and it's fun seeing how your choice of emotion affects your opponents. The variety of characters is enjoyable as well, as they all have different personalities and looks. \n\nBut as nice as this all sounds, I can't recommend this game. My initial impression was \"oh man! With this many characters and options to customize the difficulty, I'll be playing this game forever!\". Unfortunately, I was wrong. After one incredibly short playthrough (took me about three or four hours), I was satisfied. Two days later I started a new game with new characters and a new Agressive approach. To my great disappointment, I found myself terribly bored within the first Encounter (what the battles are called in-game). All the dialogue and text between encounters was almost exactly the same, not to mention the story and plot stayed as dull as ever. I played on, but could not get myself to be nearly as intruiged as I had been during my first playthrough. \n\nI'd rate Renowned Explorers a lowly 4/10, giving it credit for unique gameplay style that the developers did not expand nearly enough on and the aesthetic art style. The game definitely isn't worth it full price, and hardly worth it on a sale.

Manage a party of explorers, choose different ways to deal with enemies and challenges, unlock mysteries, and try to become the most renown explorer ever. There's a lot to do and find - and you can play an entire game in an hour or less . . . then do it again.  A must-buy for fans of good adventure/SRPG games.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society takes place in a fictional 19th century where Exploring is the big thing, and most countries get along to sponsor investigations of the mysterious phenomena of the world - and find all sorts of amazing treasures.  You're running one of these adventuring groups seeking fame, fortune, and of course to show up that complete jerk Rivaleux with the great hair that keeps ruining EVERYTHING by finding it.\n\nPlus, you get to do this your way.  The game is all about choice:\n\n* Select a party of 3 adventurers from 4 differnt types (Scientists, Scouts, Fighters, and Speakers).  Each adventurer is a unique personality with special abilities, skills, looks, and even backstories you can unlock.\n* Send them forth on adventures where you travel strange lands seeking fortune, fame, information, encounters, treasures, and occasionally lost sheep and llamas.\n* Face assorted challenges that will test your skills and planning (or at least risk management), and weigh your options wisely.\n* Exchange campfire stories to boost your abilities or find out more about your crew - and watch them develop\n* Have them enter into conflict with assorted inhabitants and enemies, and decide how to handle the issues - friendliness, deception, or aggression.  Abilities and your options change as you use them and as the \"mood\" of battle shifts.  You could find yourself sending an enemy home in a body bag, off crying, or have them decide you're a great person and leave you alone.\n* Improve your characters as they gain experience, with new skills abilities.\n* Return home with treasures you find or select.\n* Upgrade your research, hire helpers and specialists, buy equipment, and even deliver lectures to raise resources.  As you explore more, Exporer groups will help you out, further increasing options.\n* Head towards the inevitable conflict with famous explorer and walking smug grin Rivaleux to show him up as best explorer!\n* As you play keep unlocking more possible lead characters, extra stories to tell around the campfire, and more.\n* Try and find every treasure and campfire story.  Oh and beat Rivaleux!\n* Participate in various weekly challenges.\n\nRenown explorers packs in adventure, mystery, choice, resource management, three kinds of conflicts, and plenty of humor - and a campaign takes at most an hour to play!  Since each game often unlocks more options after you play, you can try it again with a new mix of characters, new leaders, new stories, and randomized settings.\n\nAlong with the great game play is excellent graphic design, with a colorful cartoony world, a good soundtrack, and snappy writing.  The game is even self-aware of how bizarre it's world is, with characters commenting on and embodying old tropes of pulps and victorian adventure with gleeful self-awareness.\n\nOn top of all of this there's a great tutorial and clear controls, so it's easy to pick up for people who aren't always into the tactical RPG genre.\n\nSo who should by this game?\n* First and foremost, if \"easy to play/hard to master roguelike cartoony Tactical RPG with base management\" pushes your buttons you should buy this.\n*If you like a good character-optimizing and exploration-focused adventure game, you'll enjoy this.  Getting things \"just right\" is a challenge.\n* If you're looking for a fun rouglike RPG - though this is more map-point exploring than corridor-crawling with tactical battle over simple click-and-fight.\n\nIt's hard NOT to reccomend this game to people, it's that much fun, that easy to pick up, that challenging.

You can get started right away, the tutorial blends in nicely with the campaign and is not too long. Also, if you don't play for a few weeks you won't have forgotten how to play or where you were in your campaign. The combat system is very creative and cute, easy enough to learn but you can play it the hard way if you want to. Replayability is high because of the many different ways you can build your team and the different approaches you can take. Since the expeditions are slightly randomized you can visit them again and again, with different teams and different approaches. It comes as a cute clicking game, but has actual depth and demands you have a plan and some tactics. \n\nThe graphics are absolutely cute, I love all the explorers, the other characters and the little animations of their attacks.

Also like Reus, it is a pleasantly unique and colorful game which art style is adapted to any age while gameplay definitely has some suitable to a mature audience depth to it. Note that I only played the game with the DLC \"more to explore\" and is fully part of this review.\n\nSo in RE you manage a team of 3 explorers from a pool of 20 and from 4 different classes each with it unique abilities, bonuses and (minimalistic) skill trees. You start with choosing a captain which gives you a specific bonus and 2 crew member and you jump in directly into the adventure with the supplies you have. Your main goal is to reach a point of the map where your final encounter for this expedition is while trying to gather as much tokens, treasures and bonuses as you can. At the end of each expedition, your tokens will be automatically converted into the 3 ressources of the game which are used to buy gear, hire helpers and specialists and perform research (all of which provides you various bonuses). You will also get \"renown\" from many of your actions and from the token conversion, which is actually a reflection of your score.\n\nBetween expeditions you can use all those ressources, plus one that is called \"insight\" which allows you to perform jobs to receive extra tokens, to improve your characters and team but also improve the token rewards for the next mission. Unfortunately a run in the game is pretty short as you will do 5 expeditions for the ladder ranking and you can then finish all the expeditions on the map if you like and this \"reward at the end\" system pretty much is not backed up by an actual proper game ending, as when you do your last expedition, unless you care about the score, you will simply not care about gathering anything and will just go to the end encounter as safely as possible.\n\nAnother thing I have noticed in my own (succesful) playthrough is that you may end up with too much of a ressource and no use anymore for it. Typically, with an economic and fame oriented team I ended up with several thousands of gold and reputation in reserve and nothing to spend it on in the last few expeditions so it was just accumulating. There as well, there could be improvements.\n\nThere is a nice system of unlock which is motivational as you need to complete some expeditions with some characters to be able to use them as captain and also unlock \"campfire stories\" (cards) which can give significant bonuses to your party. So there is plenty to do and some replay value in the game, although once you got a bit of experience you will easily recognize (and predict) all the events and encounters that you may find on each specific expedition, although randomly placed on the map, those are rigid and linear scripts. A bit more diversity/procedural generation would not hurt there as well as maybe more customisable starting options (i.e. expanded ladder for more expeditions).\n\n\"Combat\" phases can be difficult especially when you want to keep a specific \"mood\" for the fight, as even with high defenses you are almost always outnumbered by the opponent forces and it comes down to placing and getting rid in anyways of enough opponent as fast as possible. The friendly, devious and aggressive stances are an interesting system as it encourages you to use certain abilities instead of others and in certain proportions even when the opponent are highly resistant (or even immune) to the attacks of those stances. Quite challenging are Boss fights and elite encounters which keep spawning minor mobs and are about balancing between eliminating reinforcements and taking on the high damage and life (spirit) boss to end the fight.\n\nSeveral events trigger the RNG god and the odds are determined by the skill composition of your team members and it is up to you to decide (although sometimes you just have the choice between bad, worse and very worse) to have an audience or not with the divinity of randomness. Some of those events may even cause you to lose \"resolve\" (your life pool, which means game over when it reaches 0).\n\nDespite the replay value (due to unlocks, as the content itself is pretty easy to discover in just a few runs), you can already feel the game is definitely meant to be further expanded (the world map has much more empty space to fill) by some other DLC(s). I hope that some of the game mechanics of the base game will be improved and some of the \"issues\" I highlighted (i.e. ressources becoming useless in the end game, lack of procedurally generated nodes, bad end game mechanics, etc.) will be acknowledged by the devs and fixed.\n\nThough I may sound pretty critical of the product I still highly recommend it. If you are an optimizer or completionist, there is definitely material here to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. If you are just willing to go through the game once, well it is a very enjoyable experience and considering you may have to restart a few times it will also keep you busy for a bit of time.", "timestamp_created": 1481273384, "timestamp_updated": 1481540306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28266220": {"recommendationid": "28266220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049796948", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473457596}, "language": "english", "review": "Form you unlikely team of adventurers to explore the world", "timestamp_created": 1481267849, "timestamp_updated": 1481267849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28218753": {"recommendationid": "28218753", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961118844", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520089032}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me of an old boardgame I used to play as a kid which was an adventure game on the quest for an unique diamond.

The most obvious thing would probably be the interesting artstyle that makes the game very unique and helps it stand out from its rogue-lite competition.  \nHowever there is a bit more to the game than just repeating similar procedually generated environments over and over again. Most rogue-likes I have seen so far, do not have a really indepht combat system, but RE:IS is one of the rare exceptions to that. The turn-based strategical combat system has an asounding amount of depth, even though it is relatively easy to explain and get started in, really getting the hang of the system and using it to its fullest potential takes time, but esspecially on the higher difficulties you will not be able to succeed unless you make use of every possibility you have. I will not lie, the game is not easy and there are random elements at basically every corner, but one thing the game is very clear about is always showing you exactly how high your chance of succeeding is and in most cases bowing out of the risky challanges is an option aswell.  \nThe game is centered around repeating playthroughs, each time starting of with a new crew. This of course means that there is mostly no influence from your previous playthroughs, except your own increase in skill and understanding. Even though different team compositions will generally result in different playthroughs, even playing the same team can give you a different experience as there are slight changes made to the events you might encounter each time you start a new campaign. This increases the feeling of never beeing 100% certain what you will find in a certain location, even though you have played through the game several times, which ties nicely into the exploration theme. \n\nOverall this is a really good game that ties tactical combat and FTL style exploration into one neat package.", "timestamp_created": 1480187599, "timestamp_updated": 1480187599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27713699": {"recommendationid": "27713699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002853044", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514067122}, "language": "english", "review": "Just do yourself a favor, play this game!

Late into the night, I find myself wondering WHY OH WHY I have been compulsively playing Civilization for hours, when there's hardly a lick of story to care about as you progress and battles are formulaic.\n\nNot so Renowned Explorers! I picked up the game primarily for its adventure-explorer narrative; as a person who named their pet rabbit after the leader of the \"Kon-Tiki\" expedition, how could I not? The premise is remarkably well done: it's full of tongue-in-cheek humor and bizarre excursions to exotic locales, vying for the renown of the global exploration community. \n\nWhat really shines about this game for me is the blend of mechanics. First and foremost, the fact that you can choose three different styles of combat for most of your encounters (Friendly, Devious, Aggressive) provides a fun and engaging challenge. Part of the reason I love RPGs is because they offer alternative options to combat such as talking your way out of trouble. Renowned Explorers pulls these approaches into its combat scenarios by providing characters with separate stats for physical combat and \"speech\" combat. Balancing the different strengths of your crew in each encounter makes it more nuanced than just having the biggest guns in the game. \n\nIn addition to more varied combat options, crew set-ups make this game extremely replayable. You pick three people as your expedition crew, and the characters' different skill sets make each combo play very differently. \n\nFinally, this is an adventure game afterall, so strategy elements, while present, don't take up all your time. You can buy gear, perform research, recruit assistants, and give lectures to earn strategic resources. The options available here are enough to impact your expeditions, but they truly are secondary to them.\n\nI do have two minor complaints. First, each game \"ends\" before you complete all of your available expeditions. I expect that was done to allow people to complete more playthroughs with different crews and strategies, but it makes the game seem too short and a little incomplete. Yes, you can play the rest of the expeditions on the map after you \"win,\" but you'll be past the point where you can unlock new strategic resources, and a lot of the battles get pretty easy. \n\nMy second - and again, minor - complaint, is that the character's speech combat animations don't make much sense and add little to gameplay.

Probably not, that is quite a specific niche of a game but if so (or if that sounds interesting) then I would point you towards Renowned Explorers: International Society. A game that has so many events, character combinations, and challenges that its bound to give you at least 8 hours of gameplay just in trying to finish each mission alone. There is even more replaybility in choosing different crews to take on the expedition and challenging each mission with a different disposition. The dispositions are made up of Friendly, Agressive, and Devious which create a Rock-Paper-Scissors style of strengths and weaknesses and different crew members have different abilities that affect a certain disposition. Even deeper into the encounters is a mood system which gives debuffs or buffs based on the person's mood and also affect a general positive negative balance. This is barely scraping the surface of the encounters and not all events lead to encounters and most tend to rely on percentage chances based on crew skills and stats. Inbetween missions you get to allocate resources towards improvement of your crew and your ability to gain more resources. The goal is to collect treasures (i.e. the collectibles) in an attempt to beat your rival in popularity but you must carefully balance this with crew resolve and supplies to avoid a game over.

To do so, you need to select a team of 3 explorers, among 20, with their own stats and skills, and try to gather as much \"renown\" as possible by collecting treasures during the expeditions.\n\nAn expedition is a semi-random map of interconnected nodes containing various ressources and treasures gated behind skill-checks and/or fights, and must be completed by reaching and defeating its associated boss. You have a limited number of free moves or \"supplies\" to explore the map, with some potential resupply here and there. You can explore beyond these free moves, but doing so will net some random penalties to your crew's stats. Too many penalties and defeating the boss may become impossible!\nBetween each expeditions, you can spend your hard gained ressources on various improvements: team stats, skills, supplies, amount of ressources or renown obtained etc.\n\nA full run will usually take 2h, or around 30 minutes per expeditions. The first expedition is set (sort of) but you get to decide the next 4 among the 8 available in the base game (10 with the More to Explore DLC). They all come with different difficulties, skill-requirements and themes. The harder they are, the better the rewards.\n\nOf course, a game about exploration wouldn't be complete without a world to discover. Renowned Explorers offers a colorful, lighthearted and witty one.

The developers have encouraged community driven weekly challenge events that have brought together the most positive gaming community that I have ever seen. The players are constructive and the deleopers are responsive to feedback. It's easy to get advice from the pros and trolls are delt with in a calm manner.\n\nThis game is great and the only complaints that I have seen are in regards to the length.

After selecting a team from different roles (Speakers, Scouts, Scientists, and Fighters), you go out into the world to find treasures and meet new characters to become the most renowned explorers. Every team composition has the ability to be great at Fighting, being Devious, or being Friendly to your enemies, and how to end each encounter (Aggressive, Devious, or Friendly) has the potential to grant extra rewards... or extra hardships.\n\nThe game's unique battle system puts phyiscal and verbal combat together into one unique system that works so well. Each side has an attitude that creates an overall mood in the battle that can give your characters unique buffs or debuffs depending on the rock-paper-scissors style attitude system: Being Aggressive beats being Friendly, being Friendly beats being Devious, and being Devious beats being Aggressive. Adjusting your battle styles will change the moods and attitudes of the battle, granting boons to your side and more favorable end battle results. The battles can be very hard, and you typically are out-numbered, so mastering the mood system and how to coordinate all of your attacks together will help you overcome the difficult encounters ahead.\n\nThe game awards you with tokens that grant you money, research, renown, or status that you can spend to improve each character and your crew as a whole. The tokens have some RNG associated with their values, but depending on the outcomes and choices you make in the game, those values can increase, leading to very potent rewards if you decide to focus one or the other. The beauty of this game is how you are able to even pick the same team and go to the same locations but still do something completely different each playthrough. You can focus on one reward type over another or try to balance all of them.\n\nThe game overall does have a somewhat steep learning curve, but if you are able to master all of the different systems inside the game, you'll be able to go into the higher levels with relative ease. Also, each game session tends to be somewhat short (~2 hours, give or take), but the game is meant to be replayed... a lot. Try out new teams, new paths, new areas, new combinations, new research... the replayability of this game is incredible.\n\nThis is a game that I have greatly enjoyed and definitely recommend it to those who like unique turn-based RPG games with a little exploration and rogue-like aspects to it.", "timestamp_created": 1479957996, "timestamp_updated": 1479957996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27003528": {"recommendationid": "27003528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046463032", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508640714}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games of the year!

Oftentimes, a sharp, well-tuned \u201clittle\u201d game can outshine most triple-A titles. This is one of those times. \n\n[i]Renowned Explorers: International Society[/i] hits on a lot of levels for me, I love Indiana Jones, roguelikes, upbeat humor, and pop art. If any of those things don\u2019t interest you, this might not be your game irrespective of anything I have to say. If you\u2019re still interested, lets hit some pros-and-cons.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\nMore Fun(ny) than a Barrel of Colloquialisms\n\nFantastic Art that Complements the Experience and Conveys the Characters\n\nReplay Value that is Actually Worth Replaying\u2122\n\nDeep Combat Strategy and Dozens of Characterful Combinations\n\nAn Ever-Faithful Adherent of the All-Wonderful, All-Good RNG (long may he reign)\n\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\nCons were a lot tougher to come up with, and so I\u2019ve written a bit more than word-bites for them, but it is important to recognize flaws in even those things that we love.\n\nI don\u2019t much care for 1000% voice acted titles, Morrowind had plenty enough of the talky-talky for me. Plus, you will always be able to tell more story with the written word, and that\u2019s really what we want... more story, more game. This particular game\u2019s sound is pretty good, but in a game that punches this far above its weight, the sound becomes a key weakness in an overall above-and-beyond style title.\n\nRemember that deep strategy? It comes at something of a price, the emotional rock-paper-scissors that carries the strategy behind this gameplay can break your party without even asking nicely (it\u2019s a hazard of roguelikes but can hit out of the blue like few other titles I\u2019ve seen), and remembering what\u2019s-good-for-you-and-bad-for-those-guys can become burdensome after a few back-to-back playthroughs.\n\nI understand that it\u2019s more roguelike and only RPG-lite...but I will always complain about not-robust-enough RPG features. If character build and customization options are absent, I\u2019m angry; if they\u2019re limited, I\u2019m mad; and if they\u2019re as-robust-as-all-hell with a side of Grim Dawn meets Skyrim\u2026 I\u2019m still mildly annoyed. For the record, this game only makes me mad.\n\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nMy conclusion is that this game is nearly as good (and better in some ways) than FTL; it perfectly captures what a roguelike should be, brilliantly evokes a setting often overlooked, and manages to inject a heavy dose of that good old fashioned just-one-more-turn. So, my hat\u2019s off to you Abbey Games, the modest game you\u2019ve made is nothing less than a modern masterpiece. \n\n\ntl;dr: If I could only pick five games to play--for the rest of my life--this would be one of those games. \n\n[b]9.5/10[/b] would explore again.", "timestamp_created": 1479949917, "timestamp_updated": 1479966324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26971432": {"recommendationid": "26971432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965213894", "num_games_owned": 1073, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1549, "last_played": 1521343571}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible game with a variety of gameplay.

Here's why:\n\nYou start your game by picking a group of three explorers from a colorful and diverse cast of characters. Some of them are archetypes that you might have seen before, but they truly come to life in the fun and colorful designs, distinct and amusing animations and unique traits which influence your adventures with them.\n\nOnce you've selected your team, you'll be thrown right into the game. You're in a previously unexplored location, and your team is going to get famous exploring it. Each map features a main goal you'll need to get to within a set amount of turns. You'll be using up your supplies and need to plan your route carefully - if you run out, it's not an immediate game over, but your explorers will be weakened significantly, making it much harder for them to succeed in the final challenge awaiting you. On the road there, you'll have plenty of encounters, which can either play out as a turn-based combat or a Choose Your Own Adventure-like story, forcing you to make choices based on your team's individual strengths.\n\nThe turn-based combat will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has played any other game featuring it. However, where RE:IS manages to put a completely unique spin on it is in the stories it tells through the combat. See, instead of differentiating between your characters' attacks through using swords or guns or magic, here all your attacks and abilites are neatly slotted into three categories: Friendly, Devious or Aggressive. This means that when you encounter some enemies, instead of beating them into submission, you can also get them excited about how cool your group of explorers is! Or you can seduce them (even if your enemies are a group of llamas). Or you can insult them and tell them that they stink like rotten fish. No matter which option you choose, the game still plays out like a typical combat situation. The enemies lose \"spirit\" rather than health, but in terms of gameplay mechanics it's exactly the same. Thankfully, Abbey Games managed to still make the system interesting and distinct by letting the Friendly, Devious, Aggressive element work out like Rock, Paper, Scissors. How many actions of one type you take influences the overall mood the two parties of the encounter have. Different moods are weaker and stronger to others, and give you buffs or expose you to specific attacks. It'll be a while until you actually pick up on the intricacies of the system and learn when exactly in a turn to use a specific kind of ability, which strategy works best against a specific enemy or how to compose a team to suit a specific playstyle you might want to go for (there's certainly a very strong RPG element to the game, especially in how you compose your team, and the interactions and backstories you imagine for the characters having been put together in specific combinations).\n\nThe story encounters meanwhile, give you little well-written flavor texts about your explorers discovering an ancient crypt or a well-hidden forest grove. They can be a funny showcase for your team's personality to shine, as well as intriguing mysteries you'll be excited to uncover. You're often given choices on what to do, but the focus here isn't morality, it's your character's individual strengths and abilities. An Archeologist character may be able to decipher some glyphs, whereas an Athlete may be able to quickly make a run for it and escape traps in case the aforementioned Archeologist didn't manage to decipher those glyphs quite right after all. You're always given a percentage for how high your character's chance of success in a challenge will be (based on their skill level), which helps you make an informed choice. Then, you'll see that chance of success or failure play out on the Adventure Wheel. Which is awesome. It's so awesome. Much like in a game show, you're watching and waiting for a wheel to land on the spot that ensures your characters success. And sometimes, it ends up being so, so close. It really is a genius addition to the game and makes the story encounters that much more exciting, as you wait with bated breath, hoping your character won't fail and possibly risk the success your entire expedition.\n\nAfter you've made it to the end of an expedition, you'll be taken to a world map. Here, you can track your overall progress on the quest to become the most Renowned Explorer (which is your endgame goal, as well as a highscore you climb) and select which expedition to take upon next, but also spend the resources you've gained on your previous trips. At the University, you can research papers, which give you various buffs and traits, such as having more supplies available. You can also gather up an Entourage that will teach your explorers various skills or give them certain rewards for exploring specific areas or completing encounters in a specific way. Finally, you can buy items that your characters can equip and gain various stats or skills from.\n\nIt sounds like a lot. And it is, but the game never felt overwhelming to me. It eases you in and you slowly get to discover how all the pieces of the game fall together, learning more and more with each playthrough. Yeah, in case you missed it on the store page, the game features permadeath and the maps you explore are randomly generated in typical roguelite fashion. But you totally can play the game without permadeath, if you prefer that. I found that it adds to the game. It encourages you to try out new team combinations, and having characters of different skill sets means you get different options to choose from in encounters, leading to new stories and discoveries. Also, with each expedition you take a character on, you work towards unlocking them as a team captain, giving you unique advantages. Yeah, if you get far into the game and your expedition fails, it's disappointing. But having that threat there also makes the expeditions all that more exciting. Plus, despite its many layers, the game plays very quick and fast, once you've gotten used to it. It's a great game to hop into and just play for a few minutes, taking only a couple of turns (although you'll want to keep playing for longer). I played the game on my Surface while riding the bus! That's how easy it is to jump in and out and how addictive and engrossing it is.\n\nDefinitely pick up the DLC though. Eventually you will get to a point where you'll have already seen a bunch of the encounters, and so having two new expedition locations as well as new event types to spice up your adventures really adds a lot to the game (and I'm super excited for whatever DLC the developers will put out next). Even if yeah, the game moves fast enough that going through things you've seen before does not feel tedious (unlike, say, moving between the opening missions in Sunless Sea).\n\nTo sum it all up, Renowned Explorers: International Society is fantastic. It's incredibly charming, thanks to some lovely artwork and funny writing, but also the unique setting and ideas. It's quick to learn and hard to master, and incredibly addictive and enjoyable to play. My playtime in the game kept going up and up, and it always left me with a smile, because it's simply one of the most engaging and joyful games I've played. I love it, and I can only highly recommend it to anyone interested in the setting or gameplay.\n\n\nOne final anecdote: One of the characters you can play in the game is a child magician. Another character is an old teacher. If you pick the child magician as your team's leader and put that teacher on the team, you'll discover that oh hey, she now has -1 Spirit because, \"Ugh, I can't believe I'm being led by a child. I'm a teacher, not a babysitter.\" It made me laugh out loud when I first saw it, and it's the perfect example of the game's humor and charm to me.", "timestamp_created": 1479941677, "timestamp_updated": 1479941690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26919094": {"recommendationid": "26919094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063130823", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480908709}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game.

I would recommend taking a look at the forums as well if considering this game; as you will quickly see why I feel it is a point worth mentioning.\n\nI'd also like to add that the developers are extremely devoted to the game, regular updates coming frequently, both introducing new content and resolving issues players have raised. Indeed, the 50th weekly challenge occured just recently, which the developers ran as a communal challenge, where additional content would be created for each point threshold the community met as a team.\n\nSummary: Whether you want a quick, enjoyable romp through the Egyptian desert or if you prefer a deep, tactical and long-term planning challenge, or even just a chat with others who enjoy Renowned Explorers, this game can suit you either way - just set the difficulty as you prefer and enjoy! (Be warned, the 'Impossible' difficulty is not one I would recommend until you are well-versed in both the game's strategic and tactical layers!)\n\nMy comparitively low hours played on Steam is due to the fact that I originally purchased and regularly play the game on GoG, where I have more than 1600 hours clocked up.", "timestamp_created": 1479932095, "timestamp_updated": 1479932095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26848832": {"recommendationid": "26848832", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983044888", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494644226}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought the \"More to Explore\" bundle, which I think is the way to go for this game.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a great game.

One of my favourites that I've stumbled upon in Steam.\n\nI dabbled in rogue-like/turn-based rpgs before (FTL, XCOM, etc.) but Renown Explorers really cemented my love of that style of game. It takes an already pretty established motif and takes it in different directions. \"Encounters\" can be solved with violence or diplomatically in a constant juggling act of moods and emotions (enrage your opponent to cause them to be less effective at dealing damage, or excite your allies to make them greater speakers, etc.); be aggressive, devious, or friendly and reap the benefits of each play style. Each character plays differently (with different strengths and weaknesses, abilities, and interests) but they also play differently WITH other characters in your party too (especially thanks to some of the new dlc available to the game that increases the interactions between characters); maybe one character doesn't like another, or maybe they really admire them, or maybe one person wants to teach another what they've learned (skills, etc.), and so on. Bosses, battles, and scenarios are tough and challenging (especially at tougher difficulties like Adventure Mode) but I never felt like the game was impossible. There is a lot of variety and a lot of replay value here. I've played about 60+ hours and will properly sink much more than that into it before I'm done. I've geared each of my play throughs around gaining certain Steam achievements (mostly to help narrow my team selection, etc.) which has forced me to learn and adapt each play through (I sit at about 70-75% completion right now).\n\nBuy this game and get out there and EXPLORE!\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1479175967, "timestamp_updated": 1479175967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26586640": {"recommendationid": "26586640", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993860568", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519762636}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.

It's deceptive in that it starts off fairly simple like all games but then ramps up the difficultly so you're always thinking of the best strategy to approach conflicts with. At the core of most battles you engage in is a rock, paper, scissors type game.\n\nFirst off you choose your adventurers. There's many to choose from, all having various strengths and weaknesses. I wish I could choose more than 3. But that's part of the challenge of rouge types. You gotta make the most of the hand you're dealt or in this case deal yourself. So now that you have your 3 explorers your goal is to discover the most artifacts and become the most famous explorer IN THE WORLD!!  Naturally you have a rival who will do anything to become more famous than you. \n\nSo you play the game by going on expeditions to different parts of the world. The more difficult the journey the better the reward. You and your team get put in some random spot on the map you chose and you have a limited number of moves like a game board to reach your goal.\n\nThere's so many aspects to this game because each trip is it's own story and things happen along the way that you have to choose to the best option for your skills. There's also many ways you can approach situations and customize your characters skills. Using brute force alone won't get you far. I've tried, playing aggressively is the hardest way to beat this game. You have to kill your enemies with kindness and sometimes put the fear of god into them. \n\nThis game is really challenging and it's hard finding the right balance of powers and skills given the limited number of moves.

At first glance, this is a cute but simple tactics game about launching expeditions, hunting for treasure and exploring the world. This was my initial impression. However, as soon as I hit the start button, I began to notice, that the game has way more depth than I thought. Decisions in Renowned Explorers require quite a lot of thinking through or you might end up losing horribly. Think Darkest Dungeons levels of complexity.\nThe basic  premise of the game is that you pick up three characters out of a pool of 20, with one being team captain. Each character has a set of skills, perks, hidden traits and captain bonuses. Your goal is to become the world's most Renowned Explorers (d'oh!). You do that by launching expeditions (5 per game), which give you artifacts, status, gold, research and - most importatnly - renown, of which more than 2500 is needed to win the game. After each expedition, the player has a chance to spend the resources aquired to improve the party. Do it wisely - spending resources haphazardly almost always ends in utter failure. And you will fail. At the start of the game, you get 2 points of Resolve. Lose them all and it is game over.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Adorable graphics. Each character is distinct and easily recognisable. Animations for every character do a lot to show off that character's personality.\n+ Interesting combat system based on attitudes. There are three: aggressive, friendly and devious, and they work similarly to rock - paper - scissors (aggressive beats friendly beats devious beats aggressive). Switching between attitudes at just the right moment is key to survival and may net you different rewards depending on which of the attitudes is dominant.\n+ Sense of humor. The whole game is tongue in cheek. Many dialogues are genuinely funny, over the top or absurd. Enemies are amusing - from sheep, through posh Brits to easily scared vampires. Plus, some of the things the player can do are simply hilarious. At one point I was able to body slam a T-Rex. A bloody T-Rex.\n+ Lots of depth and replayability. Due to the complexity of the various systems and stark differences in playstyles, the game can be played many times over without the risk of getting bored.\n+ Surprises at every corner. I have finished this game more than 10 times and I still discover new events, character interactions and hilarious encounter results.\n+ Difficulty level variety. The game has 4 difficulty levels and two modes - one of which involves permadeath. So, if you are not a fan of dying and losing all of your progress, you can go with adventure mode, with save games.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n~ The number of possible expedition locations is limited. Even with all the DLC, there are only 13 of them. Seems like a lot, but after a few games you will learn them all by heart. Still, the differences between expeditions are huge, and each of them has a couple of hidden surprises, so i can't complain much.\n~ The tutorials could use some work. I feel that the tokens expecially aren't explained all that well. Keep in mind though that this is really a game you learn more as you play than from reading any tutorial.\n~ Even though characters are distinct, their attack skills aren't. Many characters have the same combat skills, though with different animations.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Lots of graphical glitches. They are not gamebraking in any way, yet annoying still.", "timestamp_created": 1478359910, "timestamp_updated": 1479994694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26433487": {"recommendationid": "26433487", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961441722", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478222094}, "language": "english", "review": "This game looks like it would be great...but I gave up after being dumped into full Civilization-level complexity with no tutorial.

If you are a completionist, you will have fun designing parties with hopes of getting the one or two elusive treasures that requires just the right party to pass the challenges.

It's nice to play a rogue-like with good graphics.\nCombat/Gameplay:\nCombat is grid-based.  I love grid-based gaming concepts.  It makes for great strategy.  Characters rely on 3 emotions.  You can physically fight, positively persuade/inspire, or deviously sadden/confuse/frustrate your opponents to achieve victory.  \nIn a world where every game follows the model \"kill stuff and get stuff\" - Big Kudos to the designers for creating a game that allows you to win and be rewarded by using means other than physical combat!!!\n\nOther than that, the devs and community are actively involved.

The missions are small enough and the campaigns short enough that I can pick up where I left off without spending a great deal of time trying to recall my plans.\n\nEssentially, this is a board game about risk management. There are three attack types with a sort of Paper, Rock, Scissors relationship: Friendly, Devious, and Agressive (yes, friendliness is a form of attack in this game); however, the rewards for each encounter vary depending upon which of the three you favor. Choosing a party that specializes in only one of these attacks can make victory more likely, but may leave you resolving some encounters with little or nothing to show for it. Similarly, your players can level up in a number of skills that increase their chances of winning rewards in the wheel-spinning challenges scattered throughout each mission. Focusing on a small number of skills can make winning the challenges that need them much more likely, but you will be extremely unlikely to win challenges that call for skills you lack.\n\nThe tactical combat is interesting, but the real meat of the game is in strategic decisions like these.

This game is nuts.\n\nSo I wrote a review for Abbey Games last project Reus and gave it a negative review. It wasn't a bad game but it was underwhelming and I found it boring. This game however, gets my hearty reccomendation.\n\nReus and Renowned Explorers actually have some similarities, altough it may not appear that way. The setting, concept and aesthetics for each game is very different but both games are based on fairly simple systems and concepts, and the gameplay is centered around the player exploring the variations and nuances in those systems.\nThe thing is in Reus, I had no desire to explore those variations, because I found it incredibly boring, but in Renowned Explorers I love it.\n\nThe concept of Renowned Explorers is a Saturday Morning Cartoons-looking bunch of people are part of a society of explorers and adventurers in the age before colonialism stopped being fashionable.\nYou lead this band of explorers across various landscapes looking for treasure, fame, and science.\nThe game is played in two phases, the world map phase and the expedition phase. The world map is where you can manage resources, supplies, build up your team and perform odd jobs. It is also from the world map that you can select where to adventure next.\n\nWhile you're in the expedition phase you lead your party across a map in a specific region, like Mali, Hungary, The Andes, etc. You have a specific goal in each region but there's also a fair bit of random encounters and treasure to gather and explore. You can't always find everything because you're limited by the amount of supplies you have but that in itself encourages replayability.\n\nThe game is fairly rogue-like, in the sense that you are not meant to do everything in a single playthrough, and when you do fail or reach a certain point, you are encouraged to just start over with different characters and a different approach.\n\nThe game is also interesting because although \"battles\" happen in a turn-based tactical layout, the game gives you the option to solve these encounters with diplomacy or manipulation as well as straight-up combat.\nI've been seeing trends like this a lot lately. I wonder if the influence of Undertale is to blame.\n\nI liked the idea of having options to my battles, but the thing is, the most successful I've been so far, is with a team of explorers focused on a friendly diplomatic playstyle. In my opinion the game seems to push somewhat towards that sort of playstyle, which I find a bit annoying, as my aggressive playthroughs have been the least successful so far.\n\nOverall, if you're in for a rogue-lite experience and like the aesthetics and concept, this game is a lot of fun.\n\nOne of the things that I hope more developers realize in the future, is that story can act as a reward for the player. The reason why exploring this game's depths and variations, even if they're relatively minute, is because I was always excited to see how the game rewarded me with the story elements involved. I wanted to know about the places I was visiting and the characters I was playing as or meeting.\n\nThis is a really fun game, and although I think Abbey Games has stopped support on it, I would love it if more content was released for it down the line, or perhaps if they expand on the concept in a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1473194619, "timestamp_updated": 1473194619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25371270": {"recommendationid": "25371270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012111055", "num_games_owned": 794, "num_reviews": 226, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502130094}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Renowned Explorers nos convierte en exploradores de la \u00c9poca Victoriana en busca de desaf\u00edos que superar y exploraciones que completar. Espera un momento... \u00bfesto no es lo mismo que el juego Curious Expedition? Pues s\u00ed, es exactamente lo mismo y si lo miras desde fuera pueden parecer juegos iguales pero \u00a1de eso nada! \n\nNuevamente estamos ante un juego con una especial importancia el texto y que hasta donde yo s\u00e9 s\u00f3lo est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s, as\u00ed que si no te defiendes en la lengua de Shakespeare te lo pierdes.\n\nRenowned Explorers me ha recordado a un juego de tablero supervitaminado. Hay un reglamento aparentemente sencillo, a base de habilidades, cartas (sobre todo con la expansi\u00f3n More to Explore) y tiradas (m\u00e1s bien ruletas) con el que puedes enfrentarte a distintos desaf\u00edos e intentar completar el circuito de expediciones antes de que tus rivales te superen. Existen una serie de escenarios predefinidos pero cada una de las expediciones se genera de forma aletoria con una serie de eventos distintos. Ojo: que la base del reglamento sea simple no quiere decir que sea f\u00e1cil... hay que tener cierto arte para saber que combinaciones son las m\u00e1s beneficiosas.\n\nY es que mientras que en otros juegos similares lo m\u00e1s importante suelen ser las decisiones que tomas durante la aventura (el citado Curious Expedition, por ejemplo, o el FTL) en este caso la parte m\u00e1s importante es la planificaci\u00f3n de la propia expedici\u00f3n. Es de vital importancia como invertimos, despu\u00e9s de cada viaje, nuestro dinero y conocimiento para obtener las habilidades, objetos y consejeros que nos den m\u00e1s opciones de  sobrevivir a los encuentros. Si fallas en la planificaci\u00f3n entonces el viaje est\u00e1 condenado antes de que des el primer paso. En la dificultad recomendada por los creadores (modo Aventura con dificultad Cl\u00e1sica) supone un buen desaf\u00edo. \n\nMuchas de las situaciones se resuelven mediante una serie de opciones en las que tendremos un porcentaje de \u00e9xito dependiendo de nuestros personajes, equipo y habilidades (de ah\u00ed la importancia de la planificaci\u00f3n previa). Pero siempre habr\u00e1 ocasiones para el combate.\n\nEl combate por turnos me ha parecido muy original porque combina varias cosas. Por un lado tenemos la actitud de nuestra expedici\u00f3n y del oponente. Podemos jugar de forma agresiva (a mamporros de toda la vida), provocadora (a base de insultos, vamos) o pac\u00edfica (intentando camelar al oponente). Por su parte nuestros enemigos har\u00e1n lo mismo. Dependiendo de lo que hagamos unos y otros se crea un 'ambiente' de combate que dar\u00e1 bonos o los quitar\u00e1. Por ejemplo si nuestro oponente es pac\u00edfico y le damos un sopapo agresivo entonces se montar\u00e1 un ambiente violento donde tendremos bonificaciones al ataque agresivo hasta que nuestro oponente cambie su actitud. Es algo bastante curioso y que le da un toque muy personal al juego. Adem\u00e1s con las subidas de nivel nuestros personajes ganan habilidades espec\u00edficas dependiendo su estilo de combate. Como podr\u00e9is suponet tambi\u00e9n hay distintos tipos de defensa ante ataques f\u00edsicos y verbales. \n\nEl juego tiene su parte humor\u00edstica, as\u00ed que tanto os pod\u00e9is encontrar peleando con salvajes t\u00edpicos de las aventuras victorianas como discutiendo con ovejas que no quieren que saque\u00e9is la tumba del Pastor que Hablaba con las Ovejas. \n\nAl igual que Curious Expedition es un juego con mucha opci\u00f3n de rejugabilidad porque aunque los escenarios son limitados las escenas de cada uno son aleatorias, as\u00ed que no jugar\u00e9is dos veces la misma aventura. Aparte de eso los desarrolladores ya han sacado una primera ampliaci\u00f3n bastante completa, que a\u00f1ade cartas de campamento (una mec\u00e1nica nueva), otra zona de aventura, nuevos enemigos, etc... \n\nSi dud\u00e1is entre Curious Expedition y Renowned Explorers deb\u00e9is tener en cuenta que pese a que parecen similares son totalmente distintos. A m\u00ed personalmente me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s Curious Expedition pero ambos me parecen igual de recomendables. \n\nMi an\u00e1lisis de Curious Expedition si os interesa leerlo est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed: http://steamcommunity.com/id/chemoumbria/recommended/358130", "timestamp_created": 1473110574, "timestamp_updated": 1473110574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673467", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25370416": {"recommendationid": "25370416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166053164", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473107044}, "language": "english", "review": "What a Fun Game! <3 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1473107170, "timestamp_updated": 1473107170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25367723": {"recommendationid": "25367723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032881477", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473091492}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game... and for once i can recomend a game i play, for children...

With that being said, however, there is a lot to bother the would-be explorer. \n\nFor starters, don't be fooled by the cartoony, zany exterior, this game plays hard, even for a rogue-like. I don't mind permadeath, per se, as long as it feels fair. On normal to classic difficulty in adventure mode this game will whip your ass. I found that playing on normal in discovery mode (more forgiving) was much more fun over all. The gamemakers love to tout that you have to master the mechanics, but honestly the game isn't really that deep over all. Attacks only fall in three categories and there are only a handful of emotions. The deepness of the game is questionable, the cheapness of it at times is not. \n\nNow, after getting that big huge dump on the game out of the way, what is good about it? Is it worth buying? I say it is worth buying, but only at a discount of 50% or more. There is fun to be had in this one, especially in exploring the different lands. Still exploration only runs so deep, you can see all the areas in a 2-3 hours, probably even less time if you're real good. For most, discovery will stop there. A couple of things that may keep folks coming back is the plethora of different characters and all the treasures to find. The game is only really randomized to a certain extent, so for many I would guess that a playthrough or two is going to be where folks check out. \n\nWarts and all, I have a lot of respect for this scrappy game company.

With a Fire Emblem-like combat system, if a bit more complicated, it is reminiscent of that series if you're a fan, with a rock-paper-scissors combat mechanic and turn-based combat; however, it operated on hexagons as opposed to squares.\nRenowned Explorers is extremely quirky and sets out a number of different ways to resolve any conflict, and it's entirely possible to do so without spilling blood (tears are still a distinct possibility however.) There is one boss fight where my crew complemented and hugged their way from the grips of a vengeful ghost pirate and convinced him to abandon his vendetta. At the same time, there were instances when poor Tibetan demons that just wanted to tease and blow raspberries at you got their fair share of mutilation from my crew, which had low speech defense and needed to get rid of them ASAP. This game is also surprisingly deep, with an intricate combat system with an aforementioned rock-paper-scissors mechanic that can be buff or debuff your team depending on how you behave during the fight by \"Moods\", which will give you different opportunities or force you to rethink strategy. For example, it could give you -25 speech defense, or it could make physical attacks +50% more effective. To beat the game you have to learn how to manipulate these moods. \nIt has art style that is pleasing to the eye, is surprisingly esoteric, a bit of history thrown in, and best of all, your arch nemesis is a pompous, cheating Frenchman which you must best to beat the game in time.\nThis game is a hidden gem, I highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1472849334, "timestamp_updated": 1472849334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542931", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25312291": {"recommendationid": "25312291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010197981", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472848899}, "language": "german", "review": "Wirklich witziges Spiel.

All\u2019inizio \u00e8 facile trovarsi un po\u2019 spaesati, ma baster\u00e0 terminare le prime spedizioni per capire come i valori pi\u00f9 importanti siano i tre atteggiamenti possibili: aggressivo, amichevole e subdolo. Infatti, qualsiasi abilit\u00e0 che potremo usare ricade in uno di questi mood, identificando da una parte le intenzioni del nostro gruppo e influenzando dall\u2019altra parte come i civili e i nemici reagiranno alle nostre azioni. Un esempio pratico: durante l\u2019esplorazione di una zona scoprite che in un tempio nascosto si trova un prezioso tesoro appartenente a un ordine di sacri custodi. Una volta dentro scoprite che l\u2019ultimo custode vi separa dal bottino: lo scontro \u00e8 inevitabile, ma la risoluzione dipende da come porterete a termine l\u2019incontro. Usando le abilit\u00e0 amichevoli, potrete farvelo amico, riuscendo cos\u00ec a convincerlo che sia pi\u00f9 giusto che siate voi a tenere il tesoro che lui stesso vi dar\u00e0. Usando le abilit\u00e0 per raggirare, lo farete sentire uno sfigato, rimasto solo soletto a proteggere qualcosa che ormai solo lui conosce (e quindi riuscendo a farvelo consegnare); mentre la scelta di combatterlo con armi e pugni potrebbe risultare nella sua sconfitta e la necessit\u00e0 di cercare manualmente l\u2019oggetto attraverso una girata di ruota della fortuna (con la possibilit\u00e0 di non trovarlo).\n\nProprio cos\u00ec, oltre agli scontri a turni sul campo, durante l\u2019esplorazione delle varie location potrete incappare in diversi eventi, alcuni dei quali vi richiederanno un \u201cgiro di ruota\u201d per sancirne il risultato. Le facce della ruota saranno influenzate dalle abilit\u00e0 dei vostri personaggi, quindi una prova di archeologia con un personaggio che ha almeno un tratto in questo campo vi permetter\u00e0 di ottenere un successo con il 50% delle probabilit\u00e0 (5 facce di ruota identificano la vittoria, 5 la sconfitta), un personaggio che ne ha 3 o pi\u00f9 aumenta anche all\u201980% o 90% anche in base al possibile campo di specializzazione (Sopravvivenza -> Creare rifugi vi dar\u00e0 il 100% nel caso in cui dobbiate nascondervi in una casa abbandonata) e, nel caso in cui nessuno dei vostri personaggi abbia quel tratto, solo una piacevolissima botta di culo potr\u00e0 salvarvi dal subire l\u2019effetto negativo della sfida. Ogni incontro, che si tratti di prove con la ruota, scontri o pi\u00f9 semplicemente dialogo con la gente del luogo per scoprire qualcosa, vi fornir\u00e0 dei token di diverso tipo: non li elenco tutti perch\u00e9 la lista \u00e8 lunga, ma sappiate che questi andranno a influenzare 4 diversi campi, ovvero i soldi guadagnati dalla missione da sperperare in equipaggiamento, i punti di ricerca da spendere per migliorare la propria preparazione (e aumentare i token ricevuti nelle missioni successive), i punti stato per assoldare aiutanti, lobby e migliorare i negozi e i punti fama, quelli che determineranno la vostra posizione nella classifica degli esploratori pi\u00f9 importanti.\n\nVieni a leggere la recensione completa su TheShelterNetwork.com:\nhttp://www.theshelternetwork.com/renowned-explorers-international-society/", "timestamp_created": 1472642366, "timestamp_updated": 1472642366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25262763": {"recommendationid": "25262763", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995629098", "num_games_owned": 800, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511299430}, "language": "english", "review": "I will write a more thorough and thoughtful review for this game in the future, but seeing as it is having a sale, I wanted to write a quick review to any one I know considering getting it.\n\nThis is definitely one of the most fun strategy roguelike games I have played.

You pick a crew of three adventurers (who all have their own personalities, perks and skills that will help in various challenges), you travel around an adventure board, encountering combat and dialogue challenges, leveling your characters up, collecting treasures and moving on to the next adventure which you pick from a world map.\n\n Between adventures you return to the Society headquarters where you can buy various specialists that either grant a benefit or make the game play slightly differently and place research points into a civilization like tech tree that does the same. You can also buy items for your characters here that do everything from simply adding attack and armor to adding new perks and skills. There are a lot of different ways to win the game, and there's dice rolls on everything that you can weigh in your favor with specialities, treasures and craftable/salvageable toolkits.\n\n The devs are still supporting the game with new content and tweaks so things are still changing all the time.

Nonono. This game is, underneath the big fluffy cuddly exterior, much like a house cat, and like any house cat, it has paws made up of TEENY TINY KNIVES which will dig their way in and cause much horrible pain if you're not paying attention to the various mechanics at work.\n\nIf you've never had the joy of living with a house cat, it's the most wonderful experience, and they'll slowly destroy everything you own, but you'll never be able to get upset with them, because they're made of fur, and wuv. Even when it comes to cleaning their ears and they rake nice red lines into your forearm so you look like you've been on a self harm trip.\n\nThis game is very much like a house cat, you don't own it. It owns you. Often as a matter of fact. I've played the better end of hm, fifty attempts, often getting to 4* or 5* difficulty expeditions and then it all goes horribly horribly wrong. Oh it's call cute and cuddly in the beginning with nice scottish highlands and pirates treasure out in the carribean but just you wait, wait until you're knee deep in Transylvania, hungry wolves and digging into the legends of one Mr. Dracul who turns out to be a real charmer with the speech and can WRECK a diplomatically inclined team in seconds because as it turns out, your strength just became a phenomenal weakness.\n\n[H1]*AHEM* Back on topic Senor Hobbes?[/H1]\n\nOkay, let's pull the camera back and do a breakdown of the game. It runs in three distinct \"beats\", first and foremost is the World Map, this serves as your transition between various adventures, it's where you kit out your explorers, spend insight and convert that into \"Useful materials\" for expeditions ahead, and then spend gold, status, and research on \"Things that will help\" such as equipment upgrades (armour helps a LOT, so do trinkets), your entourage (who acts as a force multiplier and offers special conditions in the case of the named entourage members), and unlocking areas of the research tree that yields additional supplies, and other useful benefits, again, making the ride through the game that much smoother. It's your HQ in effect, but there's a lot to do between adventures, and a lot of discrete choices to make as to how you want to \"build your team\", so it's not like a case of \"Click click done\".\n\n[H1]Doing the FTL dance in a very focussed way, and with more Sheep[/H1]\n\nSecond beat comes in the form of the \"local adventure\" map, which once you've selected WHERE you want to go, is then a zoomed up version of the location, say, an area of land or an island, part fogged in and part visible depending on how much terrain you've covered, each map has points of interest (think FTL) and the idea is you move around the points of interest, solving challenges. \n\nMost of these are \"Roll\" challenges where a % chance to succeed is based on the skills of the team, more skills mean more prizes, in some cases simply having ENOUGH skills in a specific tree will unlock whole new options, which are coloured in and take you down new routes with additional rewards. The limit on simply being able to clean the map is \"Supplies\", the cap is soft, you can go below zero, but each point that you do, imposes a very steep penalty on your ability to fight. You can get away with one or two points, but more than this is just -begging- for a game over.\n\nThe stories for each area are well written and the narrative is cohesive, it's good enough that you'll be able to get a feel for what goes on in each area and you'll pay some attention to the choices presented (there's usually clues in the text as to what's a good choice and what's a bad one), sometimes you'll end up with a case of \"Best of the worst\" options which can be a tad irritating but that's RNG for you when you don't know what you're going to draw from the story deck for a given area.\n\n[H1]And then I got into a shouting match with a nun...[/H1]\n\nFinally, there's the turn based fighting sequence, which kicks in on an encounter. This is not just a case of move and shoot. You have three options, one agressive, one devious, one friendly, the game KINDA works like rock paper scissors, however, there's more than just the fight atmosphere to consider, because if you want the optimal rewards you may have to finish a fight in a specific manner. \n\nIn other cases you may face opponents who change their own approach when you munchkin the game mechanics (in other words, attempt to game the boss and the boss games YOU), and each of the RE:IS members have their own specific strengths and weaknesses meaning some just don't work out that well for a specific strategy in one way, but are great when used in a different approach. Using a one dimensional \"Oh I am gonna stack the board with speakers\" seems great in principle, but then Mr. Dracul comes along and \"OH GOD I'M GOING TO GET MY FACE TORN OFF\", so it's not always the greatest plan to put all the eggs in one basket.\n\n[H1]A wonderful cast of heroes and villains[/H1]\n\nIn fact you'll probably have so much fun with the various boss encounters and the foes like the Smuggler Boss (who you can reduce to tears) and Mr. Dracul that the real goal, beating the obnoxious champion of the International Society will take the back seat as the moment to moment stories you find yourself in matter more, Riveleaux can wait, I've a vampire to convince.\n\n[H1]Closing thoughts[/H1]\n\nSo here's the big question \"Curious Expedition\" or \"Renowned explorers\" - Me? I'd say both. They're wonderful games both of them, but if I had to make a choice? I'd take the house cat over the darker sibling, and ONLY JUST. Because it's the house cat, and it's \"Heartwarming\" (and yes, that's something you can DO to your foes in this game).\n\nI love my cats. I love this game so very dearly.

It is a roguelike exploration game similar to FTL which you create a party of three explorers from a good amount of available ones and hunt for treasures across the world while beating challenges game throws at you with various skills of your explorers and occasional combat. But don't think you just beat everyone opposing you when I say combat, because in REIS words can be sharper than a sword from time to time. Insults or compliments can be more than enough to discourage someone from fighting you and can be a better solution.\n\nWhat makes REIS shine though is its' insane replayability; your crew and captain selection changing how you play and your winning strategy completely, random generated maps and each map having tons of different events which you need to play a map over and over again to see all of them, highscore chart and weekly challenges. Another thing is Abbey still supports the game with adding new events and treasures, even after being nearly a year since its' release. A great thing when they could just move on and start to work on their next project.\n\nEven after playing this much I still didn't see many events in the game and there is still lots of treasures I couldn't manage to get. There is lots of strategies I still didn't try. And I don't do weekly challenge's even because I couldn't find time to work on them yet. That's a good enough example of game's depth and replayability I think. And as a last note its dlc, More to Explore is a great addition to the game. It's new maps are great and it's campfire system adds a whole new strategic layer to the game, giving you new choices you can tinker on. So don't worry, it worths that price tag easily.\n\nRenowned Explorers is one of the best games I played in last years and easily worths its price.

The combat that was supposed to be the one thing that gives the game it's edge. Despite all the hype, the combat isn't as complicated as one would think at first. Whenever I see an incoming combat on the map, my first reaction is the save and quit. The combat is too sluggish and takes too long, not to mention several other things I personally disliked, but are irrelevant here. And the system of different attack types isn't as good as advertised.\n\nAnd the maps are always the same. Period. \n\"Procedurally generated\" IS a straight out lie. The maps are always the same, that always have the same key places in them. Some less meaningful places change places and content, but those things are too irrelevant to matter.\n\nCharacter customisation is almost non-existent. You may be able to buy a few items for your team here and there, but they really don't seem to matter all that much. Buying items for the tank is pointless, since all the enemies (almost) always spawns around your team and they always ignore the tank completely and run straight at your glasscannons. And buying more dmg for these glasscannons is pointless, because then bosses will one hit them.\n\nThe game has one of the best, if not the best in-game manuals that I ever rememeber seeing (which is awesome, since I hate browsing through wikis to be able to play a game). And as I originally said, the game has so much good things going in it, but they all become irrelevant when the combat takes all the fun out of it.\n\nThe negative tone here is probably due to me not being the correct audience for the game, at least considering the amount of positive reviews it has (I bought this after playing FTL, I'm guessing I was expecting a bit too much).", "timestamp_created": 1471368985, "timestamp_updated": 1471368985, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614034", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24936840": {"recommendationid": "24936840", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965522334", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465057166}, "language": "english", "review": "A breath of fresh air to the genre.\n\nGreat theme with many interesting gameplay elements.\n\nDon't be put off by some of the screenshots - the visual style blends really well with the theme and gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1471277728, "timestamp_updated": 1471277728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24900718": {"recommendationid": "24900718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008749599", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471137463}, "language": "english", "review": "Renowned Explorers is a unique blend of exploration and turn based/hexagonal combat.

The goal is to be the top explorer and beat the present #1 - a task that I couldn\u2019t achieve even on normal difficulty. To be at the top you have 5 expeditions to rack up more Renown than the top explorer (2500). Expeditions get harder towards the end with the last one being super hard to beat. Expedition maps are procedurally generated so every replay is different, and so can be your approach since there are multiple ways you can choose to take your playthrough. Focusing mostly on Research, Status or Gold or choosing a combination of heroes that focus on different playstyles.\n\nBut the combat is where it\u2019s at. It takes a different approach than any other turn based game out there. There are 3 ways to beat your opponents - Aggressive, Devious or Friendly. You choose your approach based on your opponents mood since one mood is advantageous to the other.\n\nSo becoming a top explorer is not an easy task when you have all of these things to worry about and find the perfect blend.

The Tutorial is simply great and allows you to get to know the game and explains everything extremely well. Gameplay is solid and certainly different than other games, which is a big plus. See it as a bit of settlers of catan, where you need to earn resources in order to win the game. Tie this in with a bit of D&D and you get this game.\n\nI PERSONALLY got tired of the game pretty quickly, this is because I am not a completionist, once I have seen something once I have little desire to visit it again, so if you are like me consider waiting for a sale as the full price might not be worth it. The game CAN be completed in as little as an hour to a couple of hours depending on the difficulty you set it on. There are about 8 \"Maps\" that you can play on and without the DLC that adds 2 more there is not a lot of variance in the game. The only variance is the different runs you do on the same maps over and over by only changing characters, this is what I didnt enjoy myself. If you are someone that likes to collect achievements, unlock all of the characters or visist 100% of evey map I can easily tell you that over 100 hours of fun await you in this game.\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nIn the end I would definately recommend this game, If you are someone that doesnt like replaying games wait for a sale, are you a completionist this game is an absolute steal even for its current price.", "timestamp_created": 1470165668, "timestamp_updated": 1470165706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665507", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

Each class brings something unique to the table, and the 5 characters within each class are all wildly different from each other.\n\n- Areas: There are 11 in all (plus an additional 2 in the More to Explore expansion), but you can only explore 5 in a single run-through. Different characters will be better equipped to deal with different challenges, and each map will also be slightly different every time you go through it.\n\nI only have a couple of complaints, and they are very minor ones. First, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to proofread such an immense, complex, branching script thoroughly, but I have found quite a number of typos and grammatical errors throughout. None have yet affected clarity, though.\n\nSecond, there are a few sidequests in each area, with clues peppered about the map to help you solve them. However, because the maps are generated in a mostly random fashion, it is entirely possible (and often not especially difficult) to solve a sidequest before encountering its associated clues. When this happens, the script/NPCs will still give you the clue, not acknowledging that you don't really need it anymore. If the developers had found a way to acknowledge when a player has completed events out of sequence, and adjust the script accordingly, it would make the game seem that much more polished. It isn't game-breaking, nor even really a problem at all, just a missed opportunity.\n\nBottom line, if you like lighthearted RPG/strategy/adventure games, I highly recommend Renowned Explorers. I've probably done 8 or 10 run-throughs as of this writing, and I still don't think I've uncovered even half of what there is to see in this game. Every campaign leaves me wanting more, and thinking about what I'll do differently next time. I have not yet played the More to Explore expansion, but I just downloaded it and I'm excited to try it.

How you achieve this is up to you. Do you want to be known as a devious researcher, a prized fighter or perhaps you simply want to bask in your own glory. There are several different ways to play, with various different expansions giving the game hours of replayability.\n\nEncounters are relatively simple, yet also fun and engaging. Buffs and debuffs become very important and the mood of the battlefield has consequences. Trying to be friendly to an aggressive opponent for instance, would put you at a disadvantage. \n\nEach team has a cptain that offers various perks to the expeditions and can help boost your final score significantly. Each character (16 in total) has their own perk. As you play the game, you can unlock more captains to add more variey. Crew members also have a set of skills that will assist you in finding treasures, not every treasure you find on the map will be yours; you need the right people for the job. The skills are further developed and acquired as you progress in the game. Certain characters traits, being mean, guillable or even hating coffee even come into play with additional dialogue options or events in certain places.\n\nThe actual exploration at first is amazing, while the number of expeditions is static, the maps are somewhat random and certain things don't always spawn. Lategame, this can also be quite frustrating when you're trying to farm that one treasure you don't have. This will take quite some time to achieve, though.\n\nThere's also quite a bit of humour in here, which adds to an amusing experience.

The world is randomly generated and there are always numerous strategies and paths you can take to try to be in the best position possible.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Graphics[/b] | This game is really colourful and this is one of the biggest advantages of this game. The characters and the items look good and all the animations are amazing as well. I also like how well this game depicts different environments and attracts the player to the game with it.\n    [*][b]Replayability[/b] | Expeditions are randomly generated, which means that your journey and your experience will be different every time you start a new game. Obviously, this contributes enormously to the replayability value of this game. It's not as replayable as The Binding of Isaac, for example, but it does get pretty close. Above all, you even unlock new things with each go, which means that the replayability even grows.\n    [*][b]Characters[/b] | There are a lot of characters you can use on your journeys. They all have unique characteristics and they are all interesting to play with. Depending on your preferred style of playing (aggressive, peaceful ...), you can choose different characters that fit you the most. After playing a certain number of rounds with each character, you may also pick they as the captain of your expedition crew.\n    [*][b]Exploring[/b] | Exploring is so fun in this game! There are always interesting decisions to make and uncovering secrets is always super fun.\n    [*][b]Friendliness[/b] | This game is extremely friendly to new players. When you start playing, you are served with a lot of tutorials, in-depth explanations and as soon as you're done with those, there are rarely any things left that you wouldn't understand. You don't need to spend multiple hours learning what on Earth should you even be doing, instead, you can just enjoy the game itself.\n    [*][b]Support[/b] | This game is still receiving a lot of support from the developer, including patches, added content and much more.\n    [*][b]SteamOS + MacOS Support[/b] | You can explore and reach fame on all three major operating systems. You can't run it on your ironing board, though.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Luck-based Gameplay[/b] | How most actions end depends on your luck. You can help you chances by using characters with best skills for certain actions, but I think that luck still plays too big of a role. Sure, it's exciting to see the wheel spinning and waiting to see if you're in luck or not, but I guess more things should depend on player's skill.\n    [*][b]Difficulty[/b] | I sometimes feel like some battles are a bit too hard, but I guess that improves later on when you get better. It's not a big issue.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The final verdict:[/h1]\nOverall, this game is extremely fun and good-looking. It has a lot of replayability value and, so you should be good for many hours. It's quite easy to start in this game as it has an excellent tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know to get started. Although I think that luck is too influential, it's not a major problem.\nIf you're looking for a fun exploration game, this is most certainly the game for you. If not for the full price, definitely consider buying it when it's discounted.\n\nWith love,\nBirdCute\n\n[quote]Note that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Abbey Games is a great company, and I'll be looking forward to playing more of their games.\n\n\nBalance: 9\nThe separate difficulties provide incredibly balanced gameplay.\n\nGraphics: 9\nThese Indie developed games are drawn up with low-end display, but my god these are top-notch animations.\n\nAudio: 8\nEvery punch, kick, and event have  different sound effects. Plenty of great work shown.\n\nContent: 5\nSadly, I couldn\u2019t get enough of this game. It has a lot of packed in features but needs better longevity for each expedition.\n\nControls: 8\nIt takes a little while to get a handle on the game, but they have an in-depth tutorial for those that want to spend several minutes following it.\n\nGameplay: 10\nMore. I wanted more of it. That is how high quality the gameplay is right now.\n\nOverall: 8.2\n\nCheck out a more detailed review on my blog, or check out my YouTube video by going to the following links:\nhttp://newsgeek.us/2016/06/21/renownedexplorers/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zuyLqxOQkw", "timestamp_created": 1466551100, "timestamp_updated": 1466551100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23680449": {"recommendationid": "23680449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148854157", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507924985}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game that is great for anyone who likes choice based games.

I'd tell you regardless, jeez!\"\n\nAnd if you were a normal person and ask me to tell you what games this was like, I'd have to say it's like...Fire Emblem with elements of Civilization 5?\n\nFire Emblem in the sense of the tactical movement of your characters, the RPS style of combat. Civ 5 for the very simplified map movement, discovering new resources, upgrading and progressing through tech trees, etc.\n\nGameplay starts off by assembling a team of exploreres. First you pick a captain, then two crew members to round out the team (usually in ways that compliment the captains strengths/weaknesses). Then you set off across the globe to look for treasure and adventure!\n\nThe game offers multiple encounters and choices based off who you have in your crew, what you've chosen to level up for those characters, their equipment, and previous interactions during your adventure, So it really begs for multiple play throughs to see what combinations yeild the most interesting results.\n\nThe game is exceptionally fun, and I highly reccomend it, especially to those that enjoy rouge-lites, tactical RPGs, and management games.\n\nAt it's current price point (21.99 CDN), I'd say it's well worth full price.", "timestamp_created": 1466444711, "timestamp_updated": 1466444711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23667367": {"recommendationid": "23667367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157686171", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511828079}, "language": "english", "review": "> Picked a crew;\n> Started expedition;\n> Grab saxon treasure;\n> Improve crew;\n> Travel again;\n> Oh, some nuns have a treasure;\n> Beat the **** out of them and the abbess and grab it;\n> One crew member felt guilty;\n> Transylvania this time;\n> Dracula wants my Captain (good he doesn't discriminate)...\n> but no thanks, instead be in my entourage;\n> But it doesn't even matter, my crew got distracted and is playing with the dogs...\n\n10/10 would beat those nuns again xD", "timestamp_created": 1466422777, "timestamp_updated": 1466422777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23664276": {"recommendationid": "23664276", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964982166", "num_games_owned": 1276, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466402589}, "language": "english", "review": "Had fun playing it.

At the beginning you pick 3 units out of 4 categories to make up your party. At the beginning there are only 1 units per category unlocked.\nThe game consists of four parts in two phases. You can try 5 levels to reach the highscore, each having different properties.\nWithin the levels you have the discovery part, wherein you navigate a graph which has fog of war, with a vision distance of 1.\nYou can see what possibly awaits you at next nodes and movement is limited by a resource. (I've seen this in a similar game with a similar name.)\nThe level's exit is marked at the beginning and running out of fuel makes it so every move reduces the party's stats for the level, so you wanna avoid running out of fuel.\nNodes have stat checks, where you pick one party member and roll the dice. You see the percentage chance before rolling so you just pick the highest.\nThe other part in this phase is combat. It's turn based combat on a hex grid. There are 3 types of attacks which complement each other (we've seen this in many RPGs). The prevalence of a type determines the type of combat (which can frequently fluctuate) which changes stats. The different types of attacks also have buffs and debuffs. The game tries to bash \"violence\" and so one of the 3 types is aggression, which often results in fewer resources after the fight and has it's own stats, whereas the other two types, being verbal violence and compliments, sharing their stats, making it easier to gear up for them. The \"non-violent\" attacks work exactly the same, they just have a different presentation. A very superficial change. You cannot gain inforrmation on enemy units and you cannot tell by their looks if they have ranged attacks, since those can be \"verbal\". This makes combat rather frustrating as you can get easily surrounded and gangbanged by enemies whom you thought were out of range.\nAt the end of a level, there is the second phase on the world map. Here you can spend your 3 resources. Purchase gear with gold. Unlock general bonuses with resarch. Increase resource acquisition with reputation. Then pick the next level.\nThe whole game has an adventure/indiana jones theme.\nThese kind of boardgames are fun at the beginning and rather random when you play them more often.\nI liked that the game let me skip the tutorial completely.\nI disliked that the game literally told me to \"Stop being so entitled!\" and to \"Check your privilege!\". \nThe hamfisted denigration of physical violence by slapping on a veneer of verbal violence and \"pacifism\" was pretty meh.", "timestamp_created": 1466176831, "timestamp_updated": 1466176831, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23605688": {"recommendationid": "23605688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095093023", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468437077}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is thouroughly enjoyable for the fans of an FTL-like experience.

In conjunction with being able to design your party fairly freely (either maximized to exploit one of these tones, balanced to handle whatever the enemy throws at you, or anywhere in between those two extremes), this encourages experimentation during combat and creates scenarios in which careful considerations must be made.  In addition to tones, both players and opponents might be put into certain moods by moves used upon them (Excited, Furious, Sadness, etc) which function as a conditional status effect that makes certain moves more or less powerful, adding more calcuations into the decision making process during the player's turn.\n\nPros: Endearing art style.  Multiple challenge tiers to provide a tailored difficulty.  A large enough cast of characters (all with their own individual skillsets and level paths) and scenarios to choose from to foster replayability.  \n\nCons: Animations become repetitive quickly.  Many non-combat encounters resolved by a % die roll that's not always clearly defined stat wise and will heavily influence your success or failure regarding the overarching goal.\n\nWould Recommend To: Anyone whose a fan of turn based strategy games.

I've found that there are some graphical goofs (not quite glitches) that impeded the flow of the game. Things like character portraits weirdly off-center or obstructing other portraits (I'm looking at you Agatha and your poofy hair!), and mechanics that aren't necessarily intuitive like the unique traits some characters have affecting certain encounter choices.\n\nSome of the locations/encounters tread a little close to stereotyping, but nothing terribly offensive; I think the story could benefit greatly from incorporating more homages to real-world historical artifacts as possible treasures.\n\nIn the end, I enjoy Renowned Explorers very much.

Its cheerful and cartoony, but has very tactically fulfilling and difficult gameplay. The more I play the game, the more depth I discover in manipulating the emotion systems. The larger strategic elements- the planning and preparation between expeditions, and the actual exploration- also do not disappoint.\n\nThe adventure mode ends after five expeditions, which is just at that sweet spot where its not so short I feel like I only just started to get rolling, and not so long that I'm discouraged from replaying or restarting after mistakes wipe out my expedition. Theres a good variety in the expeditions, but obviously I'm hoping they continue to release more support or DLC for the game.\n\nSpeaking of which, I whole-heartedly endorse the More to Explore expansion. The campfire element, which reminds me of Darkest Dungeon, and the character stories add a lot more narrative and strategic depth. The additional two expeditions (Andes and Lost Island) are also some of the most entertaining with multiple ways to complete them. \n\nFinally, I really like that the game presents options other than violence for achieving your goals. I mean, you can still stab and shoot your way to riches if you really want to, but you don't have to. Friendliness is just as (if not sometimes more) effective. \n\nI picked this up on a whim, and its quickly become one of my favorite games!", "timestamp_created": 1465527287, "timestamp_updated": 1465527287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23473713": {"recommendationid": "23473713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000601914", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465503659}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game that scratches the exploration and team building itch quite nicely.

(Luckily I got it on sale, but even at half off retail I think I paid too much and am disappointed.)\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, but it's terribly important to know certain things about it before spending money on it.  With that in mind, I'm putting the CONS list first.\n\nCONS:\n  ... Staggeringly short.  I tend to take my time, but in less than 10 hours I've started four playthroughs and beaten the game twice on the standard difficulty (classic difficulty, no saves, permadeath).  You get to go on 5 expeditions, most of which are limited by supplies to about 10-12 moves.  (I'm generalizing; there are ways to make individual expeditions last SLIGHTLY longer.)  The first of the five is chosen for you, and is also shorter than the rest (about 7 moves). \n  ... Repetitive.  There are very few expedition options.  They prompt you what sort of things you can expect to face and find, and it frequently happens that there are no good options for a party's strengths or an expedition's needs.  Also, while each one is partially randomized, the draw pool is small and I got the same \"random\" scenarios multiple times.  The network of possible moves changes, the rewards change, but the bulk of each expedition stays the same each playthrough.\n  ... Limited.  You pick three explorers from the provided 20.  There's a degree of diversity between them, but most of it is in hidden features that may or may not even matter.  (My wrestler was devout, which mattered in exactly one conversation option.)  My friendly gold obsessed party with the Scout captain was functionally identical to my aggressive research obsessed party with the Scientist captain.  There are obvious gaps, like characters who are glass cannons and fit in a certain sort of party, but without sturdy characters to defend them who also fit in that sort of party.  Each character has a couple of options in encounters, but it's pretty common for disimilar characters to have exactly the same attacks, so everyone plays pretty close to the same.  Each character can also be upgraded slightly (you get one of two options at each level, and I commonly finished with character at level 4), but a lot of the options are minor and there's no way to level up in the field.  There's a research tree with six small branches, but you can only choose from two of them at first, so most of the \"options\" won't have time to affect much, assuming you devote enough time to Research to unlock any of them at all.  There's equipment to buy, and its very important, but there aren't real choices about it, so gold is mostly the illusion of a mechanic.  There are followers to hire, but they do minor things that you may not even notice unless you invest a lot in them, at which point they only provide their marginal effect on your last expedition.  In short, so much of the game felt like discovering that a lake is really a puddle.  It's broad and looks refreshing, but it's too shallow to do much in.\n  ...Vague.  A lot of information could be useful, but isn't available anywhere.  Monster attacks are the most typical example of this.  Fights involve a lot of splashy (and whimsical) pictures that mean nearly nothing, combined with wildly unpredictable attack strength and a bevy of ignorably irrelevant status effects.  Perks are similar.  It isn't uncommon that you'll get to choose new perks, not knowing if or how those perks will help you.  My favorite is choosing between two perks of the same type, each with a stylish but vapid name.  How are they different?  They probably aren't.\n\nPROS:\n  ... Interesting concept implemented well.  I really liked the entire exploration idea, and the game is built on it from top to bottom.  Everything works together to point back to that central conceit: stepping out on adventures into the mysterious unknown.\n  ... Interesting mechanics.  The game has some really unique combat mechanics--(attack types, approach types, moods, feelings)--which are challenging but rewarding to manage.  The best of these is the encounter outcomes, trying to resolve an encounter in a friendly, devious, or aggressive manner to achieve different rewards.\n  ... Solid platform.  I haven't encountered a single bug.\n  ... Whimsical atmosphere.  Everything from the art design to the quests is pretty lighthearted.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1465189849, "timestamp_updated": 1465189849, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586533", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23410476": {"recommendationid": "23410476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104700675", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520295356}, "language": "english", "review": "I punched a nun, made a god cry, befriended a yeti, and beat people up playing as a little girl. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1465172354, "timestamp_updated": 1465172354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23410336": {"recommendationid": "23410336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032476027", "num_games_owned": 1502, "num_reviews": 479, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508688547}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c", "timestamp_created": 1465171468, "timestamp_updated": 1465216296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23408818": {"recommendationid": "23408818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013484867", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462740571}, "language": "english", "review": "This a great little rogue-like game!", "timestamp_created": 1465163883, "timestamp_updated": 1465163883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23408520": {"recommendationid": "23408520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067140873", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497053008}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game. It is a turn-based RPG that is essentially a very unique spin on Fire Emblem. There are three ways to combat your opponents in fights: Attacking, Friendliness, and Bullying. It sounds rather dumb but it's pretty charming to play with. The amount of times you do these actions can change their effectiveness as well as the other 2's in battle, implementing a Pokemon-esque weakness system that is dynamic.

I want to, I really do, but it is unbalanced in a few, yet crucial, ways that transforms a charming and novel experience with a lot of promise into sheer frustration, or, more frequently, shock and disbelief. Make sure you've made your sacrifices to the random number generator gods before playing this one. There are (at least) two things that need to be re-worked: 1) the Resolve mechanic, and 2) the attack power of minions. You start each expedition with barely enough Resolve to survive it. The early expeditions are easy enough, but then sometimes you die on the first encounter of your first expedition. Even hardcore rogue-likes are more balanced than that. Failure is often so unavoidable mainly because Resolve is reduced for each character that falls, and once you hit zero Resolve, it's 'game over'. This is also due to minions doing nearly as much \"damage\" as bosses, and respawning at a considerable rate with no perceivable limit to their quantity. Because some encounters railroad you into certain strategies, and because your party might only be really good at other strategies, you can end up with a highly skilled and decked-out party who is just up shit creek in some encounters. And that wouldn't be so bad occasionally, but since the result is 'game over' and you really had no chance, it's more than a little confusing and frustrating. So to save yourself from this fate, you'll find yourself just doing whatever your party is best at, regardless of whether it's appropriate to the situation.\n\nIMO, the worst kind of gaming experience you can have is really wanting to like a game that has some genuinely great ideas and a lot of potential, but not being able to because of the despair it engenders via meaningless \"are you feaking kidding me?\" and \"I'm not even mad anymore, this is just ridiculous\" moments, in spite of your level of mastery.

I absolutely and completely enjoy the concept of picking a team of explorers and going out exploring the world trying to discover as many secrets of the world as I can before the most renowned explorer award is given, trying to out due the pompous arch-rival, Matthieu Rivaleux. This game is very much like a board game in its systems, and that is a great thing. It tells you for the most part a different story each time you play given the different makeup of the team you put together and the semi-random elements of the location map.\nThe graphics are made of the typical Abbey Games design of very colorful, playful 2D graphics. There is a lot of character put into the drawings and combat aminations. It would have been nice for the graphics to have a little more animation besides the very fun and personable nature of the animations during encounters, but that is a very small criticism to the overall package.  The graphic design is outstanding, it is clean and clear what you should be doing with all the information the game can throw at you in its tooltips as well as a very subtle color coded system based on the different moods. The music matches the game perfectly being exciting and fun. \nThere is no voice acting which can make one feel a little lonely on these adventures, but again the rest of the game quickly makes you forget you are sitting in front of a computer. The rest of the sound effects are standard click feedback, nothing special but done well so you don\u2019t notice them; which should be the praise for click feedback sounds.\nThe gameplay is really what makes this game standout for me. There are two main phases of the game; The World Map is where you buy upgrades and equipment to prepare for you next adventure, and the Location Map where the other half of the game spends most of its time. \nThe World Map gives you different locations(shops) to go around and spend your different tokens you have gained in your last adventure. You have research from your study tokens that works like a standard tech tree in most other games, giving you bonuses that lets you specialize and get more tokens and supplies so you can explore more efficiently and longer. You can also spend renown to gain tokens based on what city and character you have (I would recommend doing this first before spending any tokens but after you spend your research). You can then spend status tokens to buy helpers that will make those tokens worth a bit more. Finally, you want to spend your gold on items to improve your characters. After you finish with all of your upgrading you pick your next destination based on the one you think you can handle then rinse and repeat until hopefully you complete the four trips to complete the game or you run out of resolve and lose.\nThe other half of the game involves going on adventures. These happen in two parts, the location map where you run into narrative effects collecting tokens, gold or taking part in encounters, where the interesting part of the game takes place. The map events are often reading the event then choosing what to do next. Most of the choices are based on what skills the event is looking for and how good a character you have is at it. The game gives you all the information you need to make a good decision including the percentage chance of success along with what you might get and what may happen if you fail. Most of the time it\u2019s an easy choice, other times do you really want to risk a resolve on a 50% roll?\nThe encounters take you to a strategy combat map, where you move your characters around and choose an attack for them to use on enemies. The attacks are mostly linked to one of the three different moods in the game; aggressive, devious, and friendly. There are bonuses linked to if you win the encounter by keeping the overall mood to one of these. But you also need to keep in mind that each character is good at curtain moods while being weak in others. There is also a paper, rock, scissors kind of thing going on with each character\u2019s mood that can weaken or strengthen their play. I\u2019m slightly mixed with this part of the game, I understand this allows the \u201cnon-combat\u201d characters to be useful in battle and sometimes even better if going against curtain enemies. It makes sense but requires you to stop trying to make sense of a battle that is emulating diplomatic conversations; it\u2019s the weakest of the gameplay, but it\u2019s still good.\nThat is the gameplay overall, it\u2019s a great game in my opinion. It\u2019s fast and has plenty of meaningful decisions with a good level of difficulty with the high score \u201cgood\u201d winning condition.

It has captured my attention. From the very first run through of the game, to the second and third, I have been captivated, and rightfully so. The graphics, audio, and gameplay - all of it is absolutely stunning.\n\nWhen I first placed RE:IS on my wish list I knew I had discovered a gem. Turn-based strategy games were, however, never my forte and I was hesitant when I found out RE:IS was one. Plenty of other TBS games have sat in my Steam library - gone unnoticed - but somehow, this one screams for my attention.\n\n\"Why?\", do you ask? Well... let me try and answer that.\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nVery basic in that you try to gain the most treasure within 5 explorations in ordered to be known as 'The Most Renowned Explorer'. You achieve all of this through a turn-based system, working with either a friendly, aggressive, or deceptive approach. Bonuses can either bolster or hinder your team, and it is up to you to determine what is best. With over ten characters to choose from, the possibilities are endless.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nDon't let RE:IS' graphics deter you from playing this game, although I'm not sure why it would in the first place. While comical, they are what make this game unique, fresh, and complete. You honestly can't go wrong with this type of art style.\n\nEvery aspect has been paid attention to: from the facial expressions due to a failure or wealth of luck, or the different attack styles and use of abilities on opponents. I applaud the developer's for putting so much effort into this aspect.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe sound effects for this game can be considered  \"cutesy\" and refreshing. There is a unique sound for everything and it all fits. From the whooshing of the ocean slapping the seashore, to the \"ca-ching!\" of coins being exchanged, RE:IS delivers quality sound effects and tracks.\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ High replayability value\n+ Great use of audio and music\n+ Graphics are great and unique\n+ Ability to take down a bully, make them cry, and wipe the smug smile off their face\n+ The sheep are darn stinkin' cute. They love you and your cause (as long as you're friendly)\n+ Weekly challenges offer something to do all the time with the RE:IS community (goes hand in hand with this game having a very friendly fan base)\n+ This can go both ways, but I appreciate that this game actually takes skills to play. You will have to think ahead - plan ahead - and adapt accordingly\n+ For the amount of content that is offered, the price is spot on. While I got this from a bundle, I would gladly pay full price knowing that this title is very enjoyable\n+ Extra content is provided for free, no charge at all; shows that the developer's care for their creation more than the money going into their pockets. That type of dedication is hard to find, so another plus one to the developer's for love of their product\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n\u00b1 For the achievement hunters: the achievements are both easy yet difficult to obtain. On one hand they'll be pouring in, on the other, it takes skills and perseverance to get the rest\n\u00b1 Can become repetitive over time, but there are new treasures to be uncovered, dialogue to be said, and areas of the map to be explored. This is enough to keep me coming back, but I can understand others may feel differently\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- There are not enough places to explore! Rest assured though, the developers are currently working on this\n- Credit to another gamer: a character voiceover option would be great for those who prefer that! I would very much enjoy listening to each character's individual voice myself\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\nThere are few titles that really catch and hold my attention for this long. RE:IS has done just that, however, and I'm glad to have been blessed enough to come across this game. While I still actively play to this day, I dread the day the expansion comes out... I will be too busy becoming a Renowned Explorer once again to care for anything else!\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with the comical style. Maybe even a little dash of charm, or the dedication and attention to detail and style that makes RE:IS what it is. Whatever the case, this game has won my heart, and I hope it does yours too.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n9.5/10\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1462922954, "timestamp_updated": 1501214083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736402", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22897945": {"recommendationid": "22897945", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968996485", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496327277}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Like the artstyle of the game and as well the feeling of being an explorer", "timestamp_created": 1462897886, "timestamp_updated": 1462897886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22892609": {"recommendationid": "22892609", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985736281", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457736777}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, many-faceted experience.

It sounds weird, and it is, but it's also really interesting and unique.

Science points lets you advance passive skill trees (similar to culture policies in Civilization V), and you can buy gear, improve your future resource income and more.\n\nAfter about five stages a run is over, and you get a score as well as checking if you beat your smug rival, what's-his-face.\nYou choose a team of 3 explorers each run, and the combination makes you best suited to certain strategies.

Never has this been more true than for Renowned Explorers. Assemble a team, weigh up their pros and cons, and start making meaningful, important choices. \n\nI feel like some may bounce off Renowned Explorers due to its unusual and unique ''combat'' system. It's really more of an ''encounter'' system, where you're looking at the emotional mood of the encounter and weighing up how to approach it advantageously.  These african villagers are being friendly? Let's be aggressive and exploit their weaknesses! These Caribbean pirates have us at gunpoint? A devious approach will disarm them! You get the idea.\n\nWith a choice of 16 playable characters, I'm still discovering new combinations to exploit, new configurations of teams that work well in certain situations. Each character has their own unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. It's up to you to decide which combination fits your play style. \n\nThis play style extends to the ''overworld'' where your expedition stakes a path across whatever far-flung wilderness you've found yourself in. Supplies are limited, so the choice lies with you as to how to proceed. The game is generous with information, and makes clear the risks you might be getting yourself into. A 98% chance is still a chance. And sometimes everything will go south on you. Wonderfully though, it never feels unfair.

I was happy to find that the board game elements that you see in the trailer video are not just window dressing for the game, but evidence of some definite knowledge by the designers of some of the best trends in current hobby tabletop games.\n\nIf you are a board gamer like me, then think of this as a \"Solo Co-Op Adventure Game\", the kind that is in the vein of Pandemic.  If you are not the sort of person that goes really old school and game at a table with dice/cards/pieces, then this game is best thought of as a cousin to games like FTL.\n\nPlay focuses on managing supplies as you explore a random mixed map, with conflicts mostly taking place in turn based combat where you position yourselves and attack with character qualities like \"Friendly Compliments\", \"Ranged Combat\", or \"Personal Insults\".  Characters have different strengths and weaknesses in combat, as well as areas of expertise that help you gain advantage from non-combat encounters.  Make your way to the designated goal on the map and try and use any accumulated bonuses from the search to complete the final challenge.\n\nThe adventuring is broken up by periods of downtime where you can spend money, research, and prestige for new advantages and abilities.  All of this is framed in a theme of an idealized early 20th/late 19th century where diversity is celebrated and the baddies are easily recognized.\n\nSo, who would like this sort of game?  It's the kind of title I think would be good for a parent looking to have something to play with a child who is already into games like Minecraft or reading Jules Vern or Harry Potter.  It's also a solid game for anyone who likes to play for 2-3 hours and then be done to do something else.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it for tactics gamers who focus on the 4X style games or military tactics exclusively, as the combat is focused most on relatively quick resolutions and a lot of elements are abstracted for the sake of flow.  Also if you get turned off by the idea of winning through the forging of friendships or pulling sneaky Scooby-Doo style tricks to fool your opponents, then the tone and theme here will not be for you.\n\nIn the end, I enjoy it because it has a lot in common with board games I enjoy with my friends, it's a good break when I just need something different, and there's legitimate challenge in winning a game without feeling like I can only get to the end by finding every exploit possible or just because of a few lucky rolls of the virtual dice.", "timestamp_created": 1460929339, "timestamp_updated": 1460929489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22482612": {"recommendationid": "22482612", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979451393", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487395025}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, unique mechanics, appropriate for all ages", "timestamp_created": 1460914054, "timestamp_updated": 1460914054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22475413": {"recommendationid": "22475413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028086778", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484518969}, "language": "french", "review": " Ce jeu me plaisait beaucoup et a de bons points :\n\n- Graphismes sympas quand on aime le dessin ou le pixel art, ce qui est mon cas.\n- Ambiances et musiques \u00e9galement sympathiques.\n- Bon principe de jeu.

This game is AWESOME!\nThis is an absolute GEM!\n\nPROs:\n+ Very good gameplay. The combat, RPG and management systems are very nice. Simple to use yet hard to master. My 1st campaign was good but once i reached end game it was not enough. Which pushed me to think harder and plan more on my next one. (recommend doing the tutorial 1st time)\n+ Great Cartoon Art\n+ Tons of characters and team combinations. Which lets you experiment and try different styles of play.\n+ Very interesting emotion (rock-paper-sccisor) combat.\n+ REPLAYABILITY! Not only do you have different styles and many characters but the randomized maps and expeditions allow for tons of replayability. Theres hundreds of treasures to uncover so you can safely play the game many times and enjoy it.\n+ The random generation of levels keeps each map fresh.\n+ Alot of achievements if you wanna challenge yourself more.\n+ As far as i can tell developer working on more content <3 <3 <3\n\n\nCons\n- A bit overwhelming at the begining. I was lucky to decide and do the tutorial. Took me 1 campaign to get my head around things.\n-Too early to tell but i feel like the base locations are too few. Ive done 2 campaigns and my early and mid game expeditions were the same i just chose different places to go.

If you like either of those things, I highly recommend it. \n\nThe good:\n- Transparent dice rolls. You're given your exact change to succeed and a breakdown of why you have that chance, along with (most of) the consequences of success or failure. \n- Depth discovery. The tutorial does a good job of introducing you to the main mechanics, but doesn't attempt to give you strategies for winning. You'll understand how to play immediately, but winning strategies will take a few games to really understand on the suggested difficulty. \n- Progression. 4 different resource currencies to spend after every expedition on at least a dozen options each and 5 levels per character with two choices each. There are a massive number of different ways to play even with the same crew. \n- Choices. Most characters can play two of the three styles well, and there are 20 characters across four classes. You get three per game, and while not all combinations are viable, hundreds are. You'll also make meaningful choices at almost every exploration node. \n\nThe bad:\n- Could use more skills. Most of the combat skills are shared with other characters, which somewhat takes away from their uniqueness. \n- Massive final boss difficulty spike. Like FTL, the final area is exponentially harder than anything preceeding it. Unlike FTL, you can win (but not the best way) without going there. I'd still like to see a smoother transition. \n- Typos and grammar mistakes galore. English is clearly not the devs first language, and it really could've used a pass from a native speaker to fix some of the mistakes. You'll always know what they meant, but it can be distracting. \n\nOverall recommended at full price or otherwise.

Do not let the cutesy look of this game fool you, it has depth in it's gameplay, and it is hard. There is also tons of replayability, as each expedition is a bit different each time. This is good, because you are going to fail a lot, but do not be discouraged, as that is partly the point; It can be cruel, but very fair. To try those combinations, those different strategies, to find what works. It's an amazing feeling when you see that smug Rivaleux sitting in 2nd place after all of your efforts.\n\nThere are two downsides to the title, both of which are minor gripes. First, while very replayable, once you start running in to the same situations more than once, the dialogue becomes stale, and makes me wish I had more expeditions to choose from, which the expansion will hopefully remedy. Second, when you begin play, you do not get to choose your starting expedition, and since all of them offer more of a specific currency for gameplay, it has a lot of long-term ramifications on the rest of your run unless you constantly restart to get the one you want. Either having there be a choice in the beginning, or a change to make the islands more even in their resources, would be a marked improvement.\n\nI'm glad I found it, and I hope others share a similar experience, it's been a lot of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1459936565, "timestamp_updated": 1459936565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22266139": {"recommendationid": "22266139", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973674949", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482820095}, "language": "english", "review": "What a fantastic game!

Reus, the previous game from the same developers, was one of my favourites despite finding god games in general to be hit and miss. I loved the intricate systems of Reus, with a ton of different resources, strategy, depth and complexity, because it was handled in an intuitive way through tooltips and fun tutorials that never dragged the game to a screeching halt. Unlike some strategy games where you have no idea what resources go where to build whatever while advisors badger you incessantly, Reus gave you the notes and tips you needed to understand every system, but never shoved it into your face. Really, it was the pinnacle god game for me.\n\nRE:IS is like Reus, but instead of being a perfect game in a so-so genre for me, it's a perfect game that's also a mashup of my favourite mechanics, genres and themes. It's like this game was tailor made for me.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society is sort of a roguelike, but there's a lot more to it. It has the overland mechanics of a good old fashioned D&D hexcrawl, the battle systems and trinities of a Fire Emblem, random written events and challenges a la Eighty Days or Tales of the Arabian Nights (the best board game ever), Civ-like research trees, time management, RPG loot. Throw in a steampunky Indiana Jones aesthetic, and I'm so very very sold. It's so good.\n\nBetter yet, like Reus there are a ton of different systems. A elemental trinity of physical, diplomatic and taunting attacks. Status effects based on how cranky or cocky you are. Twenty unique characters to pull from. Tons and tons of traits and subtraits. A dozen tokens and currencies, each with a different purpose. \n\nBut also like Reus, the intricate web of synergy is completely demystified by the tooltops and the UI. Forget what a Discovery token does? Highlight over it, and it will break down the numbers based on your current stats and upgrades. Need a referesher on status effects in battle? Hover over the icon and get informed. Forget what to do between expeditions? The concise in game manual is only a click away. Combined with tutorials that a) don't treat you like a moron and b) are done within five minutes, RE:IS strikes the perfect balance between providing information and beating you over the head with it.\n\nOne great example is the way unlocks are done. In Sunless Sea, which is a fairly similar texty roguelike mashup I quite enjoy, you get thrown in the deep end with a ton of traits and unlocks and places to go and stats to pick from before you have any idea what they do. RE:IS purposely keeps your pool of captains small; every other character is unlocked, but only as a secondary assistant. They explain abilities, they suggest synergies, they outline strategies your captain excel at. But as you play, you get a better grasp on the rules, and your most used secondary characters are soon unlocked as new captains complete with their own traits and strategies.\n\nAnd despite all the tooltips and synergy help, it's still a challenge. I've yet to win on the classic difficulty, but it's never felt unfair when I've died. There are setbacks from dice rolls, sure, but I'm always in control and they always give me the odds, so it's up to me to build a better team and make better investments next time. And a complete game is five expeditions, which only takes two or three hours, so it's closer to a short game of Civ than, say, a long haul XCOM campaign.\n\nOne last point: when rolling percentile chances, your characters spin a giant Price is Right wheel.

Pelin kulku koostuu yhteens\u00e4 viidest\u00e4 tutkimusmatkasta, joiden vaikeusaste vaihtelee, ja tietenkin niist\u00e4 saadut palkkiot vaihtelevat reissujen vaikeusasteen sek\u00e4 suorituksen mukaisesti.\n\nReissuilla kuljetaan kartalle merkittyjen pisteiden v\u00e4lill\u00e4, joista l\u00f6ytyy aina jonkinlainen keskustelu, aarre, taistelu tai muu sattumus, joka pakottaa pelaajan tekem\u00e4\u00e4n valintoja.

Saman genren aallonpituudella kuitenkin liikutaan: esimerkiksi tutkimusmatkojen kartta sek\u00e4 niiden aikana tapahtuvat eventit n\u00e4ytt\u00e4v\u00e4t hiukan samantyyppisilt\u00e4 kuin FTL:n jump point -kartta.

My\u00f6s, edellisen tapaan, randomisointia l\u00f6ytyy t\u00e4st\u00e4 pelist\u00e4 paljon, mutta kuten tyypillist\u00e4, osa asioista on skriptattu tapahtumaan vain tietynlaisissa paikoissa.\n\nVarsinkin taisteluiden mekaniikka on RE:IS:ss\u00e4 t\u00e4ysin uniikki, enk\u00e4 ainakaan itse ole miss\u00e4\u00e4n n\u00e4hnyt vastaavaa. Jokaisella omalla sek\u00e4 vastustajan hahmolla on tietenkin tietty m\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4 hipareita (spirit), jota niilt\u00e4 isket\u00e4\u00e4n pois erilaisilla iskuilla ja erikoisiskuilla, miss\u00e4 nyt ei sin\u00e4ns\u00e4 ole mit\u00e4\u00e4n kummallista. Taisteluissa on kuitenkin my\u00f6s yleinen ilmapiiri, joka on aina jotain yst\u00e4v\u00e4llisen, vihamielisen ja ep\u00e4varman v\u00e4lilt\u00e4 ja t\u00e4h\u00e4n ilmapiiriin vaikutetaan joko yst\u00e4v\u00e4llismielisill\u00e4, kieroilla tai jopa aggressiivisilla iskuilla. Eri tyyppisten iskujen tehot riippuvat merkitt\u00e4v\u00e4sti vallitsevasta ilmapiirist\u00e4, eli aggressiivisenkin vastustajan voi voittaa ilman suoranaista fyysist\u00e4 v\u00e4kivaltaa. Lis\u00e4ksi jokaisella hahmolla on taistelussa \"fiilis\", joka voi olla negatiivinen tai positiivinen, jonka lis\u00e4ksi eri kyvyt aiheuttavat henkil\u00f6iss\u00e4 erilaisia tunnetiloja, esim. surullinen, suuttunut, itsevarma jne. joilla on omat vaikutuksensa heid\u00e4n suorituksiinsa fiiliksen mukaan.\n\nPelin grafiikat ovat sympaattisia ja persoonallisia, mutta mit\u00e4 v\u00e4li\u00e4. T\u00e4t\u00e4 on pirun hauska pelata. Viimeist\u00e4\u00e4n siin\u00e4 vaiheessa, kun Transilvaniassa asuva vampyyrikreivi kokee kettuilusi j\u00e4lkeen itsens\u00e4 ulkopuoliseksi ja haluaa mukaan tiimiisi bonuksia antavaksi erikoisavustajaksi, koska olet vaan niin cool, on pakko hiukan her\u00e4ht\u00e4\u00e4 nauruun.\n\nJos jostain pit\u00e4\u00e4 antaa pient\u00e4 miikkaa, niin eri tutkimusmatkoja on ehk\u00e4 hiukan v\u00e4h\u00e4n, varsinkin pelin loppuvaiheilla. Pelattavaa niiss\u00e4 riitt\u00e4\u00e4 silti.

Thats 6,840 different combinations! With over a hundred treasure to collect you will find yourself sinking countless hours and playthrough into this game to master every detail. Plus the devs are constantly improving the game and adding more content!\n\nThere is more than one way to play. Combat is its own unique formula utilizing a rock-paper-scissors weakness chart creating different moods that effect your team. But even this gives way to more depth after you master the basics. Perhaps that boss that is easy to defeat deviously gives a different reward if you are friendly, but becareful because friendly abilities only do half damage to him. \n\nThe art and the story are both fantastic and the events continue to be amusing even after you've gone through them before. With an active community and weekly challenges there is always more strategies to try and scores to improve.\n\nIf you like turn-based strategy and roguelikes this is a game for you.\nIt quickly became one of my favorite games to play and I am still learning more and more about the secrets of hidden treasures.", "timestamp_created": 1457492650, "timestamp_updated": 1457492650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21718809": {"recommendationid": "21718809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985743356", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 70, "last_played": 1520900566}, "language": "english", "review": "It's high adventure in the golden age of exploration, with bright, colorful graphics and a tongue in cheek tone.

A wide variety of characters, their improvement, intense battle, good stories of action, lots of treasures. However, there is a small minus - is of course the same small number of places to travel. But it is fixable. The game just need to develop further and to add as much as possible of all.\n\nIt will be cooler if the game to add a workshop and User Content. Imagine what the characters can be added to the game and send them into terra incognita. For example, the cartoon characters from Disney's Atlantis, Imagine Milo and his friends go to the caves in search of Atlantis.\n\nI feel that will be the best game about discovery. You can not rest on our laurels. Develop, Develop and Develop again.\n\nWho also wants the game Workshop and Custom Content - THUMBS UP.", "timestamp_created": 1455444167, "timestamp_updated": 1455444167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21199334": {"recommendationid": "21199334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100061123", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455450153}, "language": "english", "review": "played it for a day, but never touched it again.

Look beyond the anachronistically inclusive pastel Victoriana and the fact that you can win fights by hurting everyone's feelings. Fuck being \"hard,\" this game is complicated. It is also just straight up hard though. \n\nThe combat is very deterministic. While there is some very minor variation in damage output, so that you can sometimes gamble on killing someone that might otherwise take two hits, the RNG is mostly living in the encounter layout. Once you've seen the board, you really do live and die by your decisions. Everything that matters, including aggro, is something you can manipulate once you know what you're doing. And it's always open to you to say \"Hell with this\" and burn long-term resources so that you don't have to really watch what you're doing in a given fight. Likewise, even if you're down to your last handful of reserve, if you know what you're doing and aren't up against the final boss, you can usually get through. \n\nWhile the tactical side is all good and everything, the strategic layers are where this thing sings. Every single node event is interesting, with a variety of possible solutions. But you can't build a party that can do everything, and you can't always choose what you need to do.  Even before you're picking your actual battles, you have to pick your battles. Throughout, the writing is solid and transparent. Figuring out how to milk a map, calculating how many debuffs you can handle before the boss is confronted, this is great fun. \n\nAnd then on top of that, your entire map behaviour is influenced by a complex of tech trees, stores, and social groups. Spending resources almost always makes the campaign at hand easier in the short term, but resources are almost always more valuable later in the campaign. Is it worth 200 gold for this guy to be great at archeology if it means I can't buy him the best armour later? Should I melt these tokens now to make sure I get through Mali, or gamble that I can beat it without them because the payout will be better after? These are meaningful choices, and you are obliged to make them constantly.\n\nThis whole game is just lousy with interlocking systems, and they all work extremely well together. It's possible there's some one optimal group and strategy that snaps the game open, but as far as I can tell this just is about the best-designed game of its kind since FTL. It's a bummer that because all its chrome screams \"CASUAL\" people are unlikely to give it the time of day, but it's genuinely balls hard as a game and the fluff is really entertaining. I would strongly recommend this game to literally anyone; you will find a difficulty setting that makes it fun for you.", "timestamp_created": 1455430476, "timestamp_updated": 1455430476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21168434": {"recommendationid": "21168434", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968283028", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518335429}, "language": "english", "review": "This is such an excellent game!

The devs helped me out on how to resolve the problem and I haven't had the time to say thanks because the game is just fantastic. It is a very niche game, combining the light-heartedness of indie games and the strategy elements of games like civ5 and Heroes, yet the result is fascinating when combined with the explorers theme. The fun thing is that you can choose to play any mode, depending on your level of concentration and time available. I even played it with my girlfriend, who hasn't any experience in turn-based strategies (or almost any games), and she enjoyed it a lot. We are doing ironman mode (no saves) on hard together now and it is going great.\n\nThe game is certainly in my top3 games I would recommend to anyone due to its vast spectrum of opportunities and possibilities.

They also listen and discuss suggestions made by players to continue improving what's already a strong base package. \n\nREIS is a fantastic game made by fantastic devs. It is worth your time and money and I encourage anyone who is at all interested in tactical games and rogue-likes to give it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1454402166, "timestamp_updated": 1454493734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20900894": {"recommendationid": "20900894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051127483", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467584219}, "language": "english", "review": "If I had to describe Renowned Explorers: International Society in one word it would be 'weird'. It's not a bad game, in fact it's a rather good game and my first impressions are promising. That said it's like nothing I've ever played before. At face-value it's a turn-based exploration and combat game. Explore the overworld until you either get a text-based encounter or a combat encouter. There's more to the encounters (combat in particular) though, you can be aggressive, devious or friendly. Certain moves will affect your enemies emotion, and the attitude of your moves will affect the overall mood leading to certain buffs and debuffs. The combat system is fairly easy to come to grips with but leaves much room for strategising and planning. \n\nOn top of the aforementioned mechanical pleasures the game is a joy to look at. The art style is not only beautiful but also funny and over-the-top, cartoony even. The facial expression of the characters and the way the move is reminiscent of a Saturday Morning cartoon.

Le jeu consiste \u00e0 battre Rivaleux, l'explorateur Fran\u00e7ais (pourvu d'une magnifique moquette blonde !). Vous avez 5 exp\u00e9ditions pour y arriver. Chacune d'entre elles consiste \u00e0 faire circuler votre \u00e9quipe de noeud en noeud sur une carte de la r\u00e9gion \u00e0 explorer. Sur chaque noeud, un \u00e9v\u00e9n\u00e9ment, une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements, une rencontre peuvent advenir. Leur nature, les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e0 en tirer (en cas de r\u00e9ussite), leurs enchainements m\u00eame d\u00e9pendent de la constitution de votre \u00e9quipe et des comp\u00e9tences de ses membres. Le nombre de noeuds \u00e0 explorer est limit\u00e9 par les approvisionnements emport\u00e9s par l'\u00e9quipe, chaque noeud visit\u00e9 avec le ventre creux imposant de lourds malus (cumulatifs) \u00e0 l'un des explorateurs. \n\nCe que RE:IS nomme 'rencontre' est ce qui tient lieu de combat, \u00e0 la nuance pr\u00e8s qu'il existe plusieurs approches pour d\u00e9nouer ces rencontres : votre \u00e9quipe peut \u00eatre amicale, manipulatrice ou agressive, et elle peut modifier son attitude en cours de rencontre. Chacun de ces 3 modes correspond \u00e0 1-3 comp\u00e9tences (de \"combat\") par protagoniste. L'attitude choisie, combin\u00e9e \u00e0 celle de l'adversaire, d\u00e9termine des bonus-malus (attaque/d\u00e9fense, physique/verbal). Les coups port\u00e9s font \u00e9voluer la \"sant\u00e9\" de l'adversaire mais aussi son humeur, celle-ci ayant en retour ses propres cons\u00e9quences en termes de bonus-malus. Les rencontres consistent donc \u00e0 g\u00e9rer au plus pr\u00e8s tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour \u00e9liminer/convaincre l'adversaire le plus vite possible. Les m\u00e9canismes, simples \u00e0 comprendre, sont \u00e9galement assez d\u00e9licats \u00e0 maitriser compte tenu du nombre de combinaisons possibles. \n\nLes 3 personnages de l'\u00e9quipe acqui\u00e8rent de l'exp\u00e9rience au fur et \u00e0 mesure des \u00e9v\u00e9nements et rencontres. Et il y a d'autres param\u00e8tres pour parvenir \u00e0 la victoire. \n\nLe jeu offre deux modes : roguelike ou avec sauvegardes, ainsi que plusieurs niveaux de difficult\u00e9 pour se faire les dents. \n\nRE:IS est, en ce qui me concerne, la bonne surprise du mois.

My review, rather focuses on what is important to me, which is replay value. For the lazy who don't like to read, I have condensed all my points below (Pros, Cons and Warnings). My final verdict is that I love the game. It's a must try if you like turn based strategy, rogue-likes, high score games and high replayability.\n\n-Pros-\n+Wonderful Artwork\n+Deceptively deep and challenging turn based combat system\n+Strong replay value due to treasure collection system, a large amount of characters and good variety of different strategies you can employ to win the game\n+Developer is active on the message board, talking to and getting ideas from the fanbase. Free patches and content are constantly released to improve the game.\n+Very easy to pick up and play. \"One more turn syndrome\" is very easy to catch.\n\n-Cons-\n+Game is constantly being rebalanced which may alienate people who hate change. Some characters are overpowered and some are underpowered. At a high level of play, players may discover a lack of choice because of the balancing. There is little reason to go on certain expeditions because they don't offer as much score as the \"meta\" ones.\n+Most of the replay value comes from the wealth of different character combinations and strategies. The expeditions, after playing them a few times become predictable despite the fact that they are randomly generated as you'll see the same events often. \n\n-Warnings-\n+Stubborn players may become disillusioned with the difficulty of the game. On the default settings, the turn based combat becomes difficult in the late game unless you learn the deep combat system. This can easily be solved by lowering the difficulty but this will not matter to prideful gamers who refuse to lower it.\n+Like any rogue-like, there is a healthy amount of RNG (your success is around 40% luck). If this bothers you, this may not be the genre for you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis game consists of choosing a three person team of explorers and going on 5 expeditions (you get to choose different locations around the world) in a bid to survive, find treasure and ultimately beat your rival by outscoring him by the end of the game. The amount of treasures and resources you gain during a playthrough are converted into a overall score called Renown.\n\nDuring an expeditions, there are nodes that you move along that have random events on them. A resource called Supplies is reduced by 1-2 everytime you move with heavy penalties if you run out forcing you to make strategic decisions on how much loot you want to collect before you go to the final node which results in a boss fight and ends the expedition. Combat is surprisingly deep with a rock, paper, scissors system where you can defeat your opponents with aggression, friendliness or deviousness. Massive buffs or debuffs can be applied to the entire battlefield depending on whether you are winning or losing the rock, paper, system system, making combat challenging. Simply rushing in and attacking will not go well in the later expeditions and boss fights.\n\nOutside of expeditions, you can use resources you gained to purchase items to improve the stats of your party, buy items and followers with perks and more.\n\nThis game was a giant hidden gem to me. I was randomly browsing Steam for roguelikes and found it deep within the dark depths of Gaben's labyrinth. I purchased it just to try it and next thing you know, I had nearly 25 hours of gameplay in a few days. There are a ton of different carrots to keep you playing for dozens of hours. Unlocking all the captains, beating the game, beating the two secret endings and finding every single one of the treasure hidden in the game.\n\nThe game feels very rewarding with many layers to master. \"My run is average and I'm not sure I'm going to get enough score to beat my rival. Do I go to a 4 or 5 star difficulty expedition which has great rewards but risk dying? Or do I just do another 3 star expedition which is easy but I may not get enough score to win the game?\"\n\n\"This boss is weak to aggression so I could physically attack it to do massive damage. But it also has a perk that causes it to transform into a more powerful form if it gets physically attacked which will put my party at risk.\"\n\n\"One of my party members has a greedy personality. Do I risk visiting a ruins where I know there is alot of treasure? It'll drastically increase my score but my party members who has a greedy personality may grab all the treasure and set off a nasty trap risking the run\".\n\nIf these sorts of scenarios and choices excite you, then I think you'll enjoy the game alot.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453503930, "timestamp_updated": 1453503930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20674573": {"recommendationid": "20674573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044850613", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451950037}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun casual game that you can complete in a few hours.

It boils down to two things.\n\n1 - Many roguelike experiences are built around the question, \"Will you live to cross the finish line?\" It can get really depressing to die and fail over and over again. RE:IS (on its standard difficulties anyway) asks, \"How cool will your adventuring career be?\" I rarely straight up lose a run, but it isn't about winning or losing. It's about the first time you finish with 2500 Renown. Then 3000. Then 3500. You'll get a little better at squeezing more efficiency out of your runs each time you play, and you won't need an unbreakable spirit to want to keep trying.\n\n2 - Another factor hampering many roguelike experiences is that there's only one paradigm for interaction. The whole game is dungeon crawling. No single gameplay system can entertain you forever. RE:IS has three different types of play: Roleplaying as you travel from node to node and decide how to handle incidents, Combat on a turn based grid with a handful of subsystems that don't overwhelm, and Resource Management as you spend your hard earned gains on things that synergize with your strengths and shore up your weaknesses. You'll constantly rotate between these 3 activities, so none of them ever overstay their welcome.\n\nRE:IS is amazing.

To be honest, I like this part the least, but its fine and pretty complex as well. In fact, on the first few runs, it might appear overwhelming.\n\nThen, there are expeditions themselves, full of random encounters and adventures and witty dialogues. They're amazing, and so far I can't say that I have become bored even from visiting the same areas. The layout of the expedition changes each time you play, and the special locations present there vary from one run to another, and of course, the outcome of events is often different for different teams and runs.\n\nThe third layer is tactical battles. Well, you don't get too much of them to become tired, there is always a final encounter at the end of the expedition, and typically two to four aside of it, depending on whether you are looking for fight. At first, the battle mechanics might appear complex and TERRIFYING, but as you grasp the basics (it takes a few encounters) and become more CONFIDENT, it becomes quite EXCITING. I guess any tactical battle system that operates with terms like 'attitude', 'mood' and 'emotions' is definitely worth giving it a try. Oh, and I like the form of field grid too.\n\nSome people might say that the battle mechanics is not really a big deal and devious and friendly abilities can be replaced with say ice and nature magic, the notion that I don't exactly agree with. Even if technically that might be true, the path you choose to resolve encounters is reflected back onto the adventure level, and affects how your quest continues, which I find pretty cool.\n\nAs for drawbacks, the only thing I might think about is the number of available expeditions and well, their tight concentration in just few geographical areas.

Un petit ovni comme on n'en croise pas souvent et pourtant il poss\u00e8de \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de tr\u00e8s bonnes qualit\u00e9s.\nUne partie dure entre 1h30 et 2h (cela d\u00e9pend de l'\u00e9tendue de votre connaissance du contenu) o\u00f9 l'on incarne un groupe d'explorateurs venant de diff\u00e9rentes nations. On commence par choisir un capitaine d'\u00e9quipe qui sera un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant au niveau des points que vous remporterez puis on l'accompagne de 2 autres \u00e9quipiers. Chacun poss\u00e8de ses forces, faiblesses, attaques et traits particuliers.\n\nNous sommes alors entrain\u00e9s dans une course folle \u00e0 la renomm\u00e9e contre des rivaux dont les premiers dans le classement seront les principaux ennemis num\u00e9ros 1 : Les Rivaleux.\nUne fois l'\u00e9quipe construite, le jeu se d\u00e9roule en 5 manches (hors introduction) dont chacune est compos\u00e9e de 3 parties :\n- Une phase de pr\u00e9paration\n- Une phase d'exploration\n- Une phase de comptage des points\n\nLa pr\u00e9paration est d\u00e9terminante et est tr\u00e8s certainement la plus importante des 3 m\u00eame si pour la plupart des gens elle ne sera pas la plus fun. Le but ici est de pr\u00e9parer son voyage afin de rentabiliser nos d\u00e9couvertes lors de la phase d'exploration. Pour cela il est important de connnaitre les diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories de \"d\u00e9couvertes\" ou jetons gagn\u00e9s en exploration :\n- La campagne publicitaire (rapporte des points de statut)\n- La r\u00e9colte d'argent (rapporte de l'argent)                                           => d\u00e9couvertes standards\n- L'\u00e9tude (rapporte des points de science)\n- L'exp\u00e9rience militaire (rapporte un mix de tout les autres points)\n  ----------\n- Le tr\u00e9sor (rapporte des points de statut et de l'argent)\n- Le secret (rapporte des points de science et de statut)                      => d\u00e9couvertes avanc\u00e9es (plus rares)\n- La d\u00e9couverte (rapporte des points de science et de l'argent)\n\nChacun de ces jetons rapportent aussi des points de renom qui constituent vos points de victoire.\n\nLa pr\u00e9paration consiste alors \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer les bonus : des personnages, de points rapport\u00e9s, de jetons gagn\u00e9s, etc. \u00e0 travers les points gagn\u00e9s en exploration (par exemple la science r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9e grace aux jetons \u00e9tude, d\u00e9couverte, secret et exp\u00e9rience militaire permettent de d\u00e9bloquer une publication en science, l'argent permet d'acheter des \u00e9quipements pour am\u00e9liorer ses personnages...)\n\nUne fois ceci termin\u00e9 vous \u00eates par\u00e9s pour une prochaine exp\u00e9dition dont on choisit la destination. Commence alors la phase d'exploration o\u00f9 l'on se d\u00e9place comme sur un plateau de jeu sur les diff\u00e9rents points de la carte. Sur le terrain, les personnages vivent leurs aventures au travers d'un r\u00e9cit bon enfant et essaient de faire le plus de d\u00e9couvertes possibles. Cela va des jetons jusqu'\u00e0 des tr\u00e9sors uniques mais \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne soient donn\u00e9s gratuitement, il faudra vaincre les obstacles par des combats ou par une roue dont vous pouvez augmenter vos chances de r\u00e9ussites en fonction des traits de votre personnage. Ainsi un Scientifique qui aura le trait Biologiste sera plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de d\u00e9couvrir les secrets que cache la nature de la jungle alors qu'il sera moins utile lors du d\u00e9samor\u00e7age d'une bombe.\n\nArriv\u00e9s \u00e0 destination, le jeu comptera vos points r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s lors de l'exploration et vous \u00eates par\u00e9s pour la prochaine manche.\n\nCeci n'est que le d\u00e9but de la profondeur du jeu car je n'ai pas mentionn\u00e9 comment fonctionne le syst\u00e8me de combat qui est loin d'\u00eatre facile \u00e0 prendre en main d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'il soit intelligent et tr\u00e8s amusant. Le jeu est totalement randomis\u00e9 concernant les \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui peuvent vous arriver sur vos destinations et 5 manches ne suffisent pas \u00e0 tout maximiser, il faudra alors vous sp\u00e9cialiser et synergiser vos pr\u00e9paration avec les endroits que vous souhaiter d\u00e9couvrir si vous voulez battre Les Rivaleux.\nTout comme Reus, ce jeu est tr\u00e8s intelligent, la p\u00e2te graphique est absolument somptueuse, les musiques font de bonnes ambiances, l'univers est g\u00e9nial et le replay value est immense.\n\nJe note tout de m\u00eame quelques petits d\u00e9fauts :\n- L'accessibilit\u00e9, le jeu pourrait mieux se faire connaitre s'il n'avait pas que l'anglais disponible. Bien que ce ne soit pas une barri\u00e8re pour moi, un jeu aussi subtil n'est absolument pas facile \u00e0 prendre en main pour une personne qui \"se d\u00e9brouille\" en anglais s'il veut en tirer toutes les ficelles du jeu. On pourrait penser que le jeu est simpliste \u00e0 la simple vue des graphismes, qu'on se le dise tout de suite : il n'en est rien. C'est un jeu complet et qui demande d'y rejouer pour y prendre du vrai plaisir parce qu'on SAIT comment y jouer.\n- Le tutoriel, je n'ai rien contre d\u00e9couvrir un jeu mais il a des traits de jeu de plateau complexe et sans un livret de r\u00e8gle du jeu on ne comprend rien. Je ne dis pas qu'il n'y a pas de tutoriel, je dis qu'il devrait \u00eatre + complet notamment concernant la phase de pr\u00e9paration.\n- Les bonus, on devrait pouvoir acc\u00e9der aux bonus que l'on poss\u00e8de. Je pense notamment aux bonus de l'arbe de science qui n'est pas disponible lors de l'exploration, j'ai personnellement fait une partie en science et j'avoue qu'apr\u00e8s 2 arbres d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s, \u00e0 part les grands traits (comp\u00e9tence initiale et finale) je me souvenais plus de ce qu'il y avait dedans.\n- Pour finir l'\u00e9tendue du jeu : les destinations. Pour l'instant je n'ai rien \u00e0 y redire mais il est vrai qu'apr\u00e8s 4 parties j'aurai aim\u00e9 voir d'autres endroits. Mais la bonne nouvelle est que la team est active et souhaite \u00e9tendre le jeu.\n\nEn somme : tr\u00e8s bon jeu.", "timestamp_created": 1452466052, "timestamp_updated": 1452466052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20453668": {"recommendationid": "20453668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059972965", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452653676}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a good time playing this game.

It\u2019s a strategy game with turn-based combat and resource management, great replayability and an active developer to boot, who\u2019s working on a big update at the moment (January 2016).\n\n[h1]The game[/h1]\nYou assemble a team of three explorers that you send on five expeditions in the quest of becoming the most renowned explorers. To become \u201crenown\u201d you need to find treasures but also resources that enable you to attract an entourage, conduct research, and buy equipment in between the expeditions. And of course, you also need to survive the encounters.\nYou can play in [u]two modes[/u]; one lets you make saves, the other ends with your death. The latter is the way it is meant to be played and, in my opinion, the only way to play it. If you want to ruin the game for you, use save-scumming. \n\n[b]Your team: [/b]The first step is to assemble your team. You can choose between [u]20 diverse characters[/u] with very unique skills and perks that belong to one of [u]four classes[/u] (scientist, scout, fighter, speaker). The combination of classes, skills and perks that you have in your team can greatly influence your success in the game. There isn\u2019t one character that is just better than the rest, one character can do great in one team and be a bit useless in the next, and depending on the strategy you want to follow during the main part of the game, you might need a different combination of classes anyway. Trying out new teams is a big part of what makes this game so much fun and adds a lot of replayability.\n\n[b]The expeditions:[/b] You can choose between a few destinations that all have their unique styles, events, treasures to find, and requirements. The [u]destinations are procedurally generated[/u], you move FTL-style from node to node, using supplies as \u201cfuel\u201d, and are confronted with different events or encounters. There is a big variety of events that are also influenced by which classes and perks you have in your team and the choices you\u2019ve made, so it doesn\u2019t get boring fast. I\u2019ve played over 75 hours by now and I still get events I haven\u2019t seen before and I\u2019ve only found half of the unique treasures in the game, so there is a lot to keep you interested. \nSome events require luck, where you have a certain percentage to succeed based on the skills and perks of your characters. There\u2019s also luck involved in the events that you get, some of the rare ones can be great if you find them, although they usually also involve a severe penalty if you fail. \n\n[b]The encounters:[/b] Turn-based combat that reminded me of X-Com. There\u2019s a lot of depth to the combat system, much more than immediately obvious. Your characters and your enemies have [u]three main classes of attacks[/u], friendly, devious and aggressive. The type of attack you and your enemies use influence the overall [u]mood during the fight[/u], e.g. if you are both devious, the mood is tense, if they are friendly and you are aggressive, the mood is brutal. \nSome of these moods can be beneficial to you, e.g. give you more defence, while others can be negative. So, manipulating the mood by the attack-types you choose is very important. \nEqually important is [u]mood management of your characters[/u]. A friendly attack can leave your character in an impressed mood, which lowers your defence against speech attacks. So you might need to use a friendly attack on your own team member to heal them and change their mood to confident, which adds 25% to their aggressive attack. Obviously, you can use the same principle against your enemies, by using attacks that put them in moods which provide debuffs. \nAnd finally, sometimes you want to end the fight in a specific mood because you\u2019ll get a bonus if you do. \nAll of these effects are explained in [u]excellent tooltips[/u] that you can access during the encounter, there are no hidden effects, very little luck is involved and a lot of strategy. Great! \nYou might \u201cwin\u201d the game by just doing your thing and ignoring all these details but on higher difficulty and during the more difficult expeditions you will have a very hard time if you don\u2019t use the moods to your advantage. \n\n[b]In-between expeditions:[/b] During an expedition you earn [u]collect, campaign, and science tokens[/u] that you can exchange for gold, status and research points after the expedition and use to upgrade your equipment, conduct research and hire an entourage. [u]Equipment[/u] can give you more perks and/or add defence or offence stats. [u]Research[/u] lets you get more of the resource that you want to focus on, can give you more supplies, can give you extra bonuses if you end fights in a specific mood, etc. [u]Status[/u] lets you hire an entourage which will let you get more out of your tokens and can also provide you with more perks. \nThe success of your overall strategy (which destinations do you want to visit, do you want to focus on a specific resource, ...) will be very much influenced by the choices you make here.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]: Fun game that requires a lot of strategy and a bit of luck (although it is very rare that you\u2019re getting completely screwed over by RNG), with more depth to it than you\u2019d think. You can easily finish one game in one evening, although if you\u2019re like me you\u2019ll likely want to start a new one immediately. \nThe only drawback is that there could be more destinations, but as the developers are already working on a big update, I'm hopeful that this will be fixed soon. And as I still haven't seen everything there is to see after 75 hours of gameplay, I can't really complain too much, anyway.\n\n[u]I wholeheartedly recommend this game.[/u]\n\nIf you like this game, there is a DLC available:\nRenowned Explorers: More To Explore", "timestamp_created": 1452331341, "timestamp_updated": 1479933095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20411515": {"recommendationid": "20411515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018720115", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452306851}, "language": "english", "review": ";If you're looking for a short(ish) game that allows you to play through one set of adventures in a few hours, this is perfect.  There are a lot of parallels to FTL, from the semi randomly generated maps, to the resources collected, to the semi random upgrades, but I feel that RE:IS has a lot more depth than FTL does - both are enjoyable in their own way, and both will take a while to master the tactics, but RE:IS just feels like there's more there.  The different combat powers, the way you can affect your crew and the enemy based on mood and how you 'attack' is very nice.  I like the different options you've got for upgrading between expeditions and how there are plenty of different paths to follow.  The game isn't perfect, but it's got plenty of enjoyment in it, and I'm definitely looking forward to more content.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice, gentle difficulty curve, it seems like it might be there, if you pick the right crew and know the right order to take the expeditions in, but it seems to win, you're going to have to hit some of those nasty, RNG difficulty spikes and let fate have a big hand in the final decision.  I like the fact that you can 'finish' the game without winning, but there are also situations where you end up in a fight where you very quickly realize you're over your head, and unlike FTL, there's no way to run away and have the chance to lick your wounds, your game is over (assuming you play adventure mode).  This does seem a little harsh, even in a roguelike with permadeath, being locked in a fight where you know you can't win, which will end the game, but you still have plenty of resources if you could run away and try something else is more than a little frustrating.  I wish there was a 'run away!' option from encounters, but that's pretty minor.\n\nIf I have any complaints about RE:IS it's that there's very little map content - there only seem to be a few of each 'difficulty' map, and within those maps, the variability is somewhat limited, so you're going to be playing the same mini adventures over and over again.  FTL has so many different encounters, this seems to be less of an issue there.\n\nAdditionally, the only ongoing 'unlocks' that you can obtain in RE:IS are getting crew members to the point they can be captains - though this is similar to FTL's unlocking of new ship layouts and new ships, since you start with all the crew, this somehow, to me anyway, feels less like an accomplishment, but it doesn't take anything away from the enjoyability of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1452308319, "timestamp_updated": 1452308319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20399167": {"recommendationid": "20399167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029239842", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509383964}, "language": "english", "review": "As of writing this review, I have something like 40 hours (yes, 40) into this game, and still haven't beaten it.

I've heard the FTL: Faster Than Light comparison - and there's a lot of similarities - you'll never feel like you've got QUITE enough resources to tackle the curveballs the game sends your way. You'll lose far more often than you win. \n\nStill, where I found FTL to be frustrating, RE:IS is rewarding.

There are many types of attack (cone area dmg, ranged etc.) but most inflict dmg and one of those emotions. Furthermore those attacks have an effect on the general combat mood which can give you major buffs/debuffs. So if you are Devious and your enemy is Aggressive you get a big evasion boost and so on.

There are so many animations and so much work put into it. For example, every character you come across, down to the sheep have 9-10 different facial expressions depending on their mood.\n\nThe music and sound effects are varied and interesting. Some of the songs I've found myself humming to after stopping playing.\n\nThe controls are great. I love games that you can play solely with the mouse.\n\nThe atmosphere and story is lighthearted and fun. You play a group of explorers searching the globe for rare artifacts. Think Indiana Jones. The characters (there are 20 of them) are each so unique. Rare in a roguelite game, you actually feel like they have character.\n\nThe gameplay, which is the core of any gaming experience, is some of the most original I've seen in years. You have 3/4 different things going on. First you have your character selection. You choose from 3 among 20 characters. There are so many combinations and synergies here it's ridiculous. Then you have the preparation for expeditions, which is akin to X-Com. You manage your crew, giving them jobs, hiring supporters and specialists, outfitting your explorers, then sending them on expeditions. Expeditions follow an FTL-like system of branches, but unlike FTL there's more strategy involved in how you make progress. Each path costs a different amount of supplies, and you have a better idea of what your headed into. Planning your trip becomes a major strategy factor in itself. Most places you go will have branching multiple choice paths. Some of these are very in depth with numerous paths. Depending on your explorers' skills, more opportunities are available to you, making each game very different. Finally, there's the combat which is imo the best part. It's a highly original turn based tactics game where you have a rock paper scissors dynamic of friendly persuasion, devious demoralization, and of course, outright beating the crap out of the enemy. Every character has one basic skill in each of these three, with most being best at one. Then two unique moves. Usually these are very complex with multiple ways to use them. Then 1-2 unique passive moves. Oh yeah, then the passive abilities that the equipment gives you. Oh, I almost forgot, and every character, including enemies, will have different moods which influence their stats. All this combines into a tactical combat system with more depth and variety than just about any other. It's fun as hell.\n\nThe only con I would give this game is that I wish there were more expeditions to go on (there's about 10 right now). But this is mitigated by the variety within each one, being randomized each playthrough. This fault is being remedied though, in that even in the short time the game's been out they've added a free one, and have more DLC planned. This is why I'm writing this review, please support this game, I want to see it thrive and expand.

However, the characters have a lot of overlap in abilities and the available equipment is constant across runs, leading to very few distinct-feeling characters. And one of the three characters in your party has to either be one of the 5 starting captains or a character that you have already used a lot. Still, there's enough variety to keep things interesting at the start.\n\nThe combat works in emotions and diplomacy in addition to violence, which is interesting and innovative at first. Ultimately, though, it's just a rock-paper-scissors elemental system by another name. It's also frustrating that each character has one style of combat that they suck at, meaning that you're essentially playing rock-scissors and just having to grind things out whenever your enemy picks rock. The splash-damage abilities are a little disappointing, too. Since regular attacks often one-shot weak enemies, a splash attack that hits multiple enemies for a third of their health is frequently useless. Once the novelty of winning a battle with kindness or insults wears off, what's left behind is underwhelming.\n\nThere are actually very few adventure paths in this game. You get one of three random ones at the start, then three new options open up (same each game), then three new ones (same each game), then two more (same each game), then one more (again, same each game), and that's it. The unique treasures, events, and dialogues are quite cool. That is, of course, until you discover that they aren't unique. You get the same ones each time, on each adventure, on each run-through.\n\nI guess I'm being pretty negative about the game. And there's a good bit to be negative about. But that's only because I've played it too much. The game is great when you first start playing, and will remain great if you have the sense to stop. Buy this on sale, run through each of the adventures once, and never touch it again.

It's all fair game on the way to fame and fortune.  \n\nThis is the first time I've written a review on Steam.\n\nThat should give you some idea of how much of an impression Renowned Explorers has left me with in such a short amount of time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anybody who is a fan of King of Dragon Pass, Faster Than Light, or roguelike games. It's hard to describe because this game really is a breath of fresh air for any gamer that's played pretty much everything over the years.\n\nIt's not really like most other games. \n\nThe combat system is easily the most interesting mechanic I've seen in years. The last time I was this impressed by a new idea like this was probably when I first played Civilization because it was that different and new ideas in games don't seem to come around all that often anymore. It all feels like more of the same, except for this game.\n\nYou pick your leader, recruit your crew, and set out on an adventure. You can build a party up of different characters, and there's a lot to choose from. You unlock them as leaders to lead your party later.\n\nThe super deep \"combat\" system. I can't rave about this enough. \n\nYou can resolve encounters through skill checks before they happen sometimes, or by using aggression, devious, or friendly moves during them. Or, you can walk around the areas where you know they'll happen if you want. I mean, there's probably even more ways to handle a single encounter than that, but that's off the top of my head. That doesn't even get into the numerous strategies you can use while you're in combat. You don't have to stick with an aggressive approach for an entire encounter. You can switch halfway through to resolve it in a friendly or devious manner.\n\nIt's hard to explain. You just have to play it.\n\nYou MUST play it. \n\nThe game really gives you the feeling that you're exploring the world like Indiana Jones, Nathan Drake, or Lara Croft. You have your crew members, and everybody has their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe art style is Adorable!\n\nIf you ever felt like all the wonder was gone in the world. Or like most games are too damn oppressively moody, then you'll really love the tone of the writing, the refreshing art style, and the humorous events that just seem to happen through the stupid decisions you make.\n\nThe cons:\n\nI'm not sure I've found any yet. One bug that resolved when I exited the game. There was an enemy that kept running around my screen like he was on crack after he died. It was more funny than anything.\n\nI solved it by saving and exiting the game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1451961205, "timestamp_updated": 1451961205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20307608": {"recommendationid": "20307608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172024262", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460598949}, "language": "french", "review": "Un tr\u00e8s joli jeu, vivant et color\u00e9, dont le principe de jouabilit\u00e9 avec les \u00e9motions est tr\u00e8s original et se comprend assez rapidement.Tout est relativement bien expliqu\u00e9, le style est clair et compr\u00e9hensible malgr\u00e9 la barri\u00e8re de la langue pour les non-anglophones.

It is an amazingly competent and enjoyable game, on many levels. In this day and age this is very refreshing. And yes, I didn't repeat myself here. It is a game both extremely enjoyable overall, yet also beautifully designed both for the casual players and for the die hard fans of such games. Truly, this is one of the hidden gems and one of the top games that came in 2015.\n\nBut enough baseless praising. This game is essentially rogue-lite done right. There is no outgame progression, aside from opening new possible \"captains\" for your team of three. Which means you have as good of a chance of finishing it on your first try, as in any other attempt, if we disregard your accumulating personal experience with the game's mechanics. Captain roles can be opened in any order player desires and all characters can be used from the start as simple companions. While it may be argued that some of the locked captains are very strong, starting choices are good enough, desired captain can be unlocked in as much as one playthrough and mostly captains provide strong yet diverse bonuses to your party. Those bonuses, together with the choice of other two members and your playstyle form noticeable diversity in possible ways of playing.\n\nThere is some imbalance between usability of skills, but even that is kept in check with the ability of the player to choose his own adventures after the random starting one. You get a perfect basic description of each adventure, stating what playstyle and skills are perfered for its completion. And if something is going horribly wrong - you can always choose simpler expeditions after the second one, if you feel that your luck isn't as shining as you expected it to be. I can't emphasize enough how ingenious the gamedesign is in this diamond of a game, which tries to contain possible randomness and imbalance on every step, ultimately giving player every tool he needs to finish the game, bar exceptionally bad luck.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around series of expeditions both with Turn Based \"overworld map\" and Turn Based combat. Your endgame mission is to become, as the title suggests, the most Renowned Explorer in your club. And yet in another ingenious move, the \"club\" isn't some sort of faceless entity, leaderboard with only you as an existing figure. You do meet other explorers ocasionally, and may interact with them. You have different resources to both make use of and take note of. Three basic resources (Status, Research and Gold) both provide points for the end game and are spent between expeditions on enhancing your resource gathering, recieving different upgrades from a Scientific tree or buying equipment for your team. There are also Supplies and Resolve. First is usually spent while moving during expedition on the overworld map. Should you run out of supplies, you start incurring drastic debuffs, though you still can try to get few last items before facing the boss of this particular expedition. Resolve is lost if you fail certain events, take unnecessary risks or lose all HP on one of the teammates during combat. Should you squander all of your Resolve - you lose this game.\n\nThe game is using simple but well thought out system of \"Friendly-Devious-Aggressive\" playstyle, with most characters being addept at combination of the two out of three. WIth this comes the only real gripe I can possibly muster with this game - the Attack/Defence stats for Friendly/Devious are the same, yet for Aggressive are different. Basically that means, that in many cases you are attacked by Speeches and are attacking by Speeches, shadowing the necessity of Aggressive builds. Developers try, admirably I must say, to provide decent balance between those, but ultimately I must admit - it is nigh impossible to tackle this issue properly. Still, this system works extremely well most of the time, providing noticeable differences in playstiles even with the same party members used differently.\n\nOverworld map of expedition is abundant with events and challenges, of which the turn based combat is anything but prevalent (except for expeditions specifically designed for aggressive parties). In many cases, combat can be circumvented. In other cases, you often can gain an advantage before important battles if you have certain non-combat skills at your disposal. But that is not to say that combat isn't important. Boss of each expedition will still be in your way, and each battle won provides a hefty combat bonus to one of the party members until the end of the expedition. Still, you can gain big advantages before quite a few boss battles using the non-combat skills, usually in different ways. And the game usually allows you to see the chances of success for each possible choice before making the ultimate decision. It might not be too far stretched to say that the Overworld experience on its own is worth the money this game asks.\n\nBut there is also a turn based combat. One would assume that it would be a mere add-on, poorly executed and without any time invested in it. Far from it, turn based combat makes full use of \"Friendly-Devious-Aggressive\" trio, making it a simple yet very important core mechanic. The battlefield is reigned by \"mood\". Mood being a combination of most used attitude of your party and that of the enemies. Depending on the combination, it provides different bonuses. For example, being Devious against Aggressive opponent provides you with +Dodge chance, while double Aggressive leads to a bonus Devious damage for whoever uses it. As you can tell from it, certain combinations are beneficial, and the mirrored ones are detrimental to your party. Not only that, but using Attitude attacks (majority of the attacks are those) can quickly shift the Mood towards different combination, especially when finishing off an opponent. That leads to an interesting tense combat, especially if you're getting the best reward from finishing the battle with the Attitude that would put the battle in a detrimental to you Mood. Many bosses shift their behaviour, if not all of their attacks, based on the Attitude you may use. And do not fear, most enemies contain a simple yet sufficient explanation of their strong points, weaknesses and possible big changes should you use particular Attitude attacks against them.\n\nWhat else is there to praise? Art style is somewhat simplistic, yet vivid and pleasing. Animations are hilarious at times, which greatly helps with slight repetitiveness of the gameplay. Music and sound effects are much the same - simplistic at times, yet immerse you greately into the overall experience. The game oozes of love and passion that was put into it by the developers.\n\nNot only that, but noticeable update to gameplay came out a while ago, completely free of charge. In this update they made some very drastic changes to certain aspects, like Research tree, Mood bonuses, various debuffs and characters. And you know what? The game became all the better. Developer that are both brave enough to change a lot, yet competent enough to make it ultimately worthwhile? On top of that, humble enough to provide it free of charge, when many others would make it a DLC (and do note, it would be worth money in my book)? I am baffled. People who made this game deserve all the praise and spotlight they can get, and even more on top of  that.\n\n===================================================================\n\nVerdict: I can give only one recommendation here. Watch the video of the game. If you enjoy what you see - the game is exactly that, if not much more. It is worth every penny in its price. Damn, its worth even more than that for the sheer competence the developer displayed. I am extremely saddened, that it somewhat went under the radar.

Overall, this game is brilliant for it's genre, and I would personally give it a 9.5/10...\n\n(Mainly because I shy away from 10/10 scores)\n\nYou should vote for this one as 'Just 5 more minutes' award", "timestamp_created": 1451825209, "timestamp_updated": 1479974963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20253257": {"recommendationid": "20253257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004036707", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459109219}, "language": "german", "review": "Super kreatives kleines Spiel al\u00e1 FTL.

You can choose to either aggressively dominate your enemies, insult them into despair, or become best friends with them. however, diffrent attiudes can easily wipeout your whole team. e.g, if you try to be friendly with an enemy who is aggressive towards you, you will suffer a armour debuff, making it more likely for them to hit you for high damage.\n-The characters. With 20 playable characters who each have their own playstyle, strengths and weakness, every run is different \n-Traits. each character has a trait/s that determine your chances in certain situations, for example, if there is a gaint boulder blocking your way, a character who has an athlete trait has a greater chance of succeding in that situation than someone who does not. in addition to that, characters can learn more traits through leveling,allowing you to customize your team to what you think will suit you best.\n-The Challenge.  By moving throughout your expeditions, you use up your supplies. once they are all gone, your team will start getting debuffs like \"-40% attack power\". This will mean you have to think ahead of time if you should go straight to the final destination of the expdetition or explore some more to earn treasure at the cost of stats.\n-Skill will win the battle. almost every attack in the game will hit at hundred percent, this includes enemy attacks aswell. even though it is a rogue-like game, a good strategy and equipment layout will always beat out sheer luck\n\nDislikes:\n-Frame rate problems. Throughout playing RE:IS, frame rate seems to vary everywhere. you could be fighting at sixty frames one moment and have it drop to 30 the next. while this doesnt bother me to much, i can see how others who play   might find this irratating.\n-The expeditions. Overall, there are 9 different expdeitions to go on, 12 if you count the first three starting expeditons that you dont get to chose from. while that seems like a quite a bit, some are very similar, for instance,  the Carribean expdetition mainly features pirates and monkeys and \"The Emerged Island\" offers voodoo pirates and voodoo monkeys, bascially reskinned pirates and monkeys.\n\nOverall, I Highly recommend this game if your into rouge-like and strategy games.

I like to experiment and try out various combinations and and see how they turn out with different playstyles. \n\nThe combat is refreshingly unique - it isn't too far removed from the type of turn based combat you'd normally see in these kinds of videogames, but it does a lot to distinguish itself from the normal with the use of moods and approach tactics and you can get rewarded for following certain tactics and moods for battles. You can write various research papers, which act as this game's tech tree, and further these rewards.\n\nThere's also over 100 different treasures to find in the game's state at the time I write this review, and it sounds like they will be adding more in due time.\n\nI would like to see more expeditions, though, because the current con I have for this game is that, being a roguelike, I come across the same events too often.

Rewriting it now, just shows how much I think of this game :P\n\nThe game plays out a lot like FTL with your characters moving through nodes and finding encounters or just picking up the various resources you can use to upgrade things in between expeditions. I find this much more engaging than FTL however as the encounters that you'll find aren't simply based on the roll of a die, but have a Fallout New Vegas style chance to succeed that depends on your party members skills and ability scores adding a bit of depth to how you choose and level up your characters. The types of encounters are widely varied and you probably won't see them all within a couple playthroughs. At 11 hours I still haven't beaten a few of the levels and even within the levels I can breeze through there's still some secrets I haven't been able to figure out (whats the gargoyle statue for o_O) \n\nCombat has been mentioned a lot, with a lot of notice given to its presentation. Basically there are 2 types of attack (Speech/Attack) that are in turn seperated into 3 Attack styles (Speech = Friendly/Devious and Attack) The 3 styles have a rock paper scissor effect on each other in that if you're consistently using a style that beats the opponents style you get a global buff or a debuff if you're on the losing side. Neutral means a buff to the winning style although I've not yet seen opponents take advantage of this. Additionally the way you win battles will give different rewards and potentially different outcomes. Attacks also have the ability to buff and debuff your opponents in various ways and I think that' s the general meat of the combat strategy. Overall its a pretty simple system which actually works to the games favor as it keeps the game flowing as combat encounters are just part of the general exploration ecosystem.\n\nA couple of nitpicks that I have with the game, visually I love the animations and graphical style. In most cases. In some places its oddly old style flash looking with flat colors and overly simplistic layout like the title screen. The lack of polish extends to other places like when you finish an expedition and you count your rewards, skipping ahead will cause it to pause for a long while, and some of the character suggestions are strange. Like Hildegard being suggested for Friendly and Aggressive despite have no attack skills and a poor regular attack. One larger one is that the combat system has the aforementioned buff debuffs attached to attacks, but enemies can be IMMUNE a buff or debuff and take no dmg from the attack. This can render a char ineffective in whats usually the effective strat. You can still go neutral, but it seems like a weird thing to have. \n\nOverall: I find this game reallllllly compelling. like, I should be studying for finals but I'm not, compelling.", "timestamp_created": 1451736567, "timestamp_updated": 1451987514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20209040": {"recommendationid": "20209040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110163439", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516315064}, "language": "bulgarian", "review": "The first 9 hours from that game went unnoticed for me.

This is a nice little game that will probably provide you with at least ~10 hours of entertainment before you get bored. That being said, I'm already bored.\n\nI'm not the type of person that likes to min/max everything in the game. I don't want to try and beat my high score and I don't want to get 100% achievements. I just want to enjoy playing the game and I want something that keeps me coming back to relax. This isn't it. \n\nI think my biggest problem with this game is that there isn't enough variety. I keep seeing the same encounters over and over again. In every play through I fight the same bosses, I see the same treasures, and then different characters don't really provide me with that much varied game play. It feels like I'm playing the same hour and a half campaign over and over again. The mechanics of this game aren't all that interesting if I already know how to win every fight and I'm esentially playing the same characters. I like tactics games, but the combat in this game is so simple and so unvaried that it ends up being completely uncompelling. \n\nOverall I am disappointed with this game.

It has many novel and interesting systems well covered elsewhere, most of which work quite well. However it has one gaping flaw:\n\nThe hex based tactical engine simply doesn't work with the other systems.\n\nYou control three units. Maps are relatively open. Many attacks are ranged and characters of any side don't block line of sight. It is therefor impossible to reliably protect someone from getting hit. You lose the game by losing all your resolve points, and you lose one resolve every time someone is incapacitated in the tactical map. Thus bringing anyone who can't survive reasonably on the tactical map is a recipe for failure.\n\nApart from the occasional area that heals anyone on it at the start of their turn, terrain is either passable, impassable and blocks LOS, or impassable and doesn't.\n\nAll of this combined means that save the rare AOE ability, positioning barely matters. So why have it?\n\n[h1]A Radical Fix[/h1]\n\nScrap the hexes and simply have lines of units on each side of the screen like the old Final Fantasy games. You can still play with AOE effects, all the other systems remain in place, the only thing you lose is range. and tedium.\n\n[h1]The Rest[/h1]\n\nI have some other minor quibbles but they're all picking nits. It's a charming presentation, the exploration is good, the between expedition stuff is okay but nothing special. I really want to like this game.

While the amount of maps and encounters is somewhat limited, I thoroughly admire how different the encounters play out based on your party composition and prior choices. Plus, there's oodles of unique 'epic' enounters which lure you into trying them when they show up, even though you might not be fully ready for them yet. You get a *real* sense of story here, you get to know your party members in such a way that you don't skip over the text of every encounter, like you would in FTL after a couple of playthoughs.\n\nDon't get me wrong, while the story element is great this is still an unforgiving roguelike if you play it on that difficulty setting. Your first few games should probably not be played on that difficulty setting. But after two games, when you have a feel for the combat, dive into the richest, most colorful and most tactical roguelike of recent years.\n\nThe only criticisms I could make against this game are a slightly clunky overworld map and a poor optimization of the graphic engine (a 2D game should be 100% smooth and polished, not 98%).

The premise of the game is that you belong to a group of scientists and explorers, and each game sees you setting out with a group of three explorers of your choice to travel the globe, visiting exotic locales and collecting treasures.  You've been sleighted by another member of the society, and over the course of 5 expeditions you have to collect more Renown than him in order to win.  During expeditions, you manage your resources as you travel from node to node, dealing with events and occasionally finding yourself battling strange locals and/or wildlife.\n\nEach game begins with you assembling your party, selecting 3 explorers from 20 available and electing one to be your Captain (Which provides a unique perk for the game).  Characters are broken up into 4 classes, and each character come with a unique mix of actions, skills, and upgrades.  The crew select screen is where the feel of each run will be decided, and there's a wide variety of party types available.  You want to befriend enemies to death while accumulating prodigious amounts of reasearch?  There's a crew for that.  Do you desire to do nothing more than smack your enemies until gold pops out?  There's a crew for that, too.\n\nFrom there, you're taken to the expedition.  On the expedition map, you travel from node to node to collect as many resources as possible, keeping an eye out for potential treasure.  The majority of nodes with resources available usually feature a challenge that you can choose to have an explorer attempt.  Challenges have percent chance to succeed/fail, often modified by the traits and class of the explorer chosen.  As you would expect, challenges offer greater rewards if successful, though often carry some sort of penalty if you fail (Anything from a minor stat loss for the rest of the expedition to losing resource tokens). You obviously want to maximize your resources gained by hitting many nodes, but your ability to do so is limited by supplies, so it's important to exercise judgment and figure out the optimal way to travel through an expedition (if you do run out, you being to incur rather large stat penalties).  Not all nodes have challenges, however. Some are empty, and some feature encounters.\n\nEncounters are where the meat of the game lies, and probably the most time consuming part of any run.  The overlying battle system is turn based, with each encounter utilizing a procedurally generated hex-based map.  You move your three units, and then the enemy moves theirs, etc. etc.   You obviously want to be as efficient as possible when dispatching the opponents (Who often outnumber you), and the best way to do this is through EMOTIONS!\n\nThis is the hook: the mood system.  You and your opponent each have a certain attitude in an encounter, which generates a mood that can be advantageous (or not) for you.  The three attitudes are Aggressive, Friendly, and Devious, and they exist in a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  For example, Aggressive beats Friendly but is weak to Devious.  So, if you are against a Friendly opponent, it is in your best to interest to generate and maintain an Aggressive attitude since it provides bonus Speech Defense.  However, if you generate a Devious attitude in contrast to their Friendly one, you'll take a Speech Defense penalty (which is bad).  You can generate a better attitude by utilizing attacks of that attitude, contributing points until it rolls over.  So in the case of a Friendly enemy, you want to use Friendly or Aggressive attacks until you switch to that attitude, generating a less disadvantageous attitude.\n\nFriendly/Devious attacks also have an emotion component to them, which can provide buffs or debuffs to a target enemy depending on their \"state of mind\", which is essentially a meter that goes up with Friendly attacks and down with Devious attacks.  There's a lot to manage and it's a ton of fun, and there's a surprising depth that doesn't come through in screenshots.\n\nI'm skipping over a lot in the interest of brevity, though I hope I've communicated the core mechanics.  I haven't even touched on the preparation stage, or how resources work, or skills.  This is very board game-like in the sense that the rules and mechanics are simple, but the way everything interacts creates a good amount of depth that never feels clunky or counter-intuitive.  While the game rewards good decision making and tactical acumen, the most important thing is developing mastery over the game.  You never fail because the game was unfair to you, or because you got unlucky.  Every failure will be your fault, even if you don't know it at that time, and the best way to improve is to learn something from your failures and carry it with you into the future.\n\nWhile the core mechanics are sound and fun, the package it comes in is incredibly charming.  The art is great and fits the overall feel of the game, the writing is funny through and through, and the music is enjoyable.  It look like a fun, light-hearted game about being an explorer in the late 19th century, and it certainly feels like it.  \n\nI love this game, and for me it scratches an itch that only FTL has ever been able to.  Each run takes about 2-3 hours from start to finish, and it's incredibly easy to drop in, form a crew, and set out if you have a bit of time to kill.  I'd also like to give props to the dev team, who are active on the forum and communicate with the fans.  They're constantly tweaking and balancing stuff even now, which is massively appreciated.  The game is better than it was when I first bought it because of their efforts, and it was incredibly enjoyable even then.\n\nI suspect that people who enjoy board game sensibilities or solid turn based strategy will get the most out of this title, though I suspect anyone who just enjoys resource management games would find it enjoyable.\n\nWHAT I PAID FOR IT: $20.00\nWHAT I WOULD PAY FOR IT:

Unfortunately I feel like Renowned Explorers is a case of almost but not quite, all of the elements of a great roguelike are here but it falls short in a number of different areas that ultimately resulted in the game leaving a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nI think my biggest issue with the game is the severe lack of content available to play with at the moment, in one playthrough you can visit the vast majority of explorable areas in one playthrough. The areas themselves are basically the same each playthrough except for a few minor RNG differnces. Seeing as one playthrough lasts for at most just under three hours there really isn't a lot to keep you coming back for more.\nIf the game was in early access or in open beta this might be excusable but with only one new piece of DLC available since it's \"full release\" I could never reccomened this game at full price and would do so cautiously when it is on sale.\n\nMy second issue with the game is that I feel it's a little to RNG heavy. I like a little randomness in my games as the next person but this game turns it up to eleven... the vast majority of your overworld interactions are going to be decided on the roll of a dice, and even the combat has fixed %chance to hit for some abilities. It's incredibly frustating to be completing the final expedition only for a 5% dice role to take away two resolve (basically life in this game) and end your playthrough.\n\nRenowned explorers does have a few interesting and well executed ideas though, for one thing whenever you click on a decision on the map with a percentage chance instead of just resolving, it brings up a spinner wheel. The simple addition of this spinner wheel adds a lot of tension into what is usually quite a mundane part of rougelikes. Another thing I thought was relatively well executed was the emotion combat system, which basically gave stat buffs or debuffs depending on how you chose to handle the encounter wether it be peacefully, deviously or agressively. This had it's own problems however, as to min-max in this game you basically have to optimise your encounters to one particular mood to get consistent benefits. \n\nI enjoyed my first couple of playthroughs of this game, but after I started to understand the game more and progress I became increasingly frustrated with the amount of luck compared to skill especially for someone not amasingly skilled at roguelikes. Overall I guess that's my overall opinion of this game, if you like the theme of this game and are really good at roguelikes and don't mind heavy RNG elements, great.

The moves, the skills, the speech bubbles all give each character a different feel and a different strategy going in.\nThe comedy: Your rivals are as over the top as Gaston. Your characters get into rediculous situations where you have to going into a conflict because the locals are too friendly, or where you accidentally drop a safe from a treehouse. Even the expressions can be funny.\nThe Replayablity: Why not try a different location? A different party? A different strategy? Get different treasures this time? There are a lot fo reasons to replay the game.\n\nCons: Minor gameplay issues: Sometimes movement grids don't show up until you start and cancel an attack. Sometimes targeting can be misjudged by a few pixels (an issue even Shadowrun has). Its unfortunate, but doesn't always ruin the gameplay.\nAchievement Hunters: As much as I love the stories that can be told with this game, one of the major calls of this game is the achievements.

But getting to it will not be that easy and there are surprises around every turn. As we make our way through the jungle, we encounter a group of monkeys being berated by another, rather mean group of monkeys led by a peculiar blue monkey. We could simply ignore the incident and be on our way, but that is not who we are. We decide to step in and a fight ensues. The blue monkey is relentless in slinging insults towards us, which depletes our spirit and makes us want to run away in tears, but we persevere. We could beat them up or be mean to them in return in order to teach them a lesson, but we decide on a different approach. We are being super nice to them, which catches them off-guard and convinces them that we are pretty cool people. Both groups of monkeys end up being influenced by our friendly approach.\n\nThis is the kind of decision-making that permeates throughout Renowned Explorers: International Society, a vibrant and entertaining mash-up of various genres, including adventure, turn-based strategy, and role-playing. You begin by making a party of three explorers, each with their own unique abilities. Some are friendly diplomats, some are aggressive warriors, whereas others are devious scientists. There are a lot more characters to choose from with a nice amount of variety in traits and abilities. Once you choose your party, you set out to explore exotic locations around the world in an effort to become the most renowned international explorer. Each location acts as its own separate expedition on which you can gather gold, status, research, and insight. After a successful expedition, you return to your headquarters in London and spend the accrued resources on equipment that increases your stats, entourage that enables you to collect more resources, and technologies that give you an edge on the following expeditions.\n\nYou can usually choose between two new locations to serve as your next expedition. Once you arrive, you will be presented with a point of interest. How you get there is up to you. You travel from point to point on a small map. Most points will provide a short story, some resources, or an encounter as described in the opening paragraph. Depending on your crew and the challenge, you will usually be able to choose from a variety of options. Chances of success will depend on the traits of your characters. The outcome will be determined on the adventure wheel (like the one on The Price Is Right). For example, you may choose to break down a door with a fighter or talk your way in with a diplomat. The more advanced your character is in a particular trait, the higher are the chances of success.\n\nThere will be times when you\u2019ll be able to get out of a fight, but sometimes that will simply not be possible. Battles take place on hex-based grids. Renowned Explorers uses a very interesting combat system, which enables you to be friendly, devious, or aggressive to beat your foes. This acts as a sort of rock-paper-scissors system. Friendly is very effective against devious, devious against aggressive, and aggressive against friendly. But the opposite is true as well. For example, being aggressive against devious will either penalize your team or provide bonuses to the enemy. But if both parties use the same attacks, there will be no bonuses or penalties for anyone. All characters can use a combination of two attacks, never three. The combat system is definitely interesting and entertaining (a battle between your devious crew and a herd of super friendly sheep can be pretty funny), but it\u2019s not particularly deep.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to become the top explorer, and beat your rival Riveleux to the top spot. You have five expeditions to gather as much renown as possible. After that, that particular playthrough will end whether you have managed to beat him or not. The adventure mode features rogue-like elements. If you lose all of your characters in battle, it\u2019s game over. If you lose just one or two, you can still win the battle and carry on (you also have the ability to revive them in battle), but you lose resolve every time a character goes down. If your resolve drops down to zero, it\u2019s game over. You can sometimes also lose resolve on the adventure wheel. If you\u2019re not into rogue-likes, there is a separate mode where you can save the game anywhere you want. The game is designed to be replayed over and over again using different play styles. It is also not possible to see all locations in a single playthrough. There are 11 locations in the game, but their map layout is procedurally generated, which adds a level of unpredictability during exploration, even if it is a location that you have already visited on previous playthroughs.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society uses a very nice, colorful art style and a charming, lighthearted way of storytelling. This approach gives it quite a bit of personality and simply makes it a joy to play and experience. On the other hand, the soundtrack and sound effects are not particularly involving and don\u2019t stand out in any way. I felt as if the same exact tune just kept looping over and over. Also, the game does not do enough in order to explain its systems very well. In the beginning, it all seems pretty convoluted and it takes a while to figure out the systems in place. The biggest issue with this game is that the design perhaps isn\u2019t strong enough to support many playthroughs, which is what rogue-likes strive for. After you\u2019ve tried out all three play styles and seen all the locations (of which there are not that many), there is simply not that much incentive to go on. I also think that the combat system, while unique and fun, is not deep enough to keep you engaged once the novelty wears off.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for something a bit different. It successfully manages to combine gameplay elements from several genres into a single, cohesive whole. It is a colorful, lighthearted romp that feels like a mash-up of Monkey Island and XCOM, which is definitely worth playing, in my opinion. However, it does not quite deliver the depth and replay value synonymous with the best rogue-likes out there.\n\n[h1][b]7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1447599894, "timestamp_updated": 1447599894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19045088": {"recommendationid": "19045088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051148674", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504968610}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game. Easily worth $20 if you like rogue-lite and tactical combat. If you get it for less than that it's a no-brainer. After nearly a hundred hours played, I want to write my first-ever Steam review to hopefully make a few more people aware it's out there.\n\nWhile the artwork makes Renowned Explorers look cutesy and light, it's really anything but. There's an impressive amount of depth here, and on many levels. I love the tactical challenges of games like xcom and Invisible, inc. (which was previously my favorite game of the year). This game is in many ways similar to those games but I think it's quite possibly better.\n\nIn the beginning you put together a team of three explorers and then guide them through a series of perilous expeditions spent hunting for treasure. The expeditions are made up of a series of (usually optional) stat rolls for in-game currency, fame and research, along with combat encounters that also reward you. The stat rolls are nerve-wracking and sometimes you have to make the choice to gamble your entire game on a roll.\n\nThe combat is a modified rock-paper-scissors style where you have to control which abilities you use based on enemy weaknesses, range of abilities and overall \"mood,\" which will give combat-wide buffs or debuffs based on the past series of moves you've used. You can get by in the beginning based on the tutorial info but once you've put in maybe 30-40 hours in the game you really start to master the depth and can use things like delayed starts to combat, stacked AoEs and predictive shop buys to get items for specific encounters in advance that can really sway battles in a huge way.\n\nThe Abbey games team is also doing one of the best jobs I've seen of offering regular updates that reinforce the diversity of options while adding content and balancing existing strategies. They added an entire new encounter with the completely free Mali DLC and just today released a modification to captain perks that were previously merely passable. Now they're interesting and powerful. They also post regularly to discussions in the steam forums.\n\nThere are a few bugs that pop up with new content from time to time but they get stomped out pretty quickly and with the speed and regularity of updates I can't complain.\n\nI'll probably try and buy their previous game Reus too, just because I love this one so much.\n\n10/10 favorite game of the year.", "timestamp_created": 1447388134, "timestamp_updated": 1447388134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19035389": {"recommendationid": "19035389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014445135", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511399491}, "language": "english", "review": "Jezzz this game is good!\nPlayed at least 20 games and i am still enjoying them and get supprised by it\nMust have", "timestamp_created": 1447347051, "timestamp_updated": 1447347051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19006195": {"recommendationid": "19006195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028060174", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449903682}, "language": "english", "review": "Superb.", "timestamp_created": 1447222383, "timestamp_updated": 1447222383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18999769": {"recommendationid": "18999769", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979935488", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 11416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512266755}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome!\n\nFighting sheeps by telling them that they smell like fish and it works!", "timestamp_created": 1447195960, "timestamp_updated": 1447195960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18978035": {"recommendationid": "18978035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160972646", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445460318}, "language": "dutch", "review": "We gaan op R.E.I.S. met Abbey Games, een Nederlandse Indie Gamestudio die in 2013 vooral bekend is geworden door hun Steam succestitel Reus. Dezelfde cartoony stijl qua design en de originaliteit van de game is op geheel eigen wijze terug te vinden in de  nieuwste release: Renowned Explorers.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society (Oh, vandaar op R.E.I.S.) is een roguelike, turn-based, strategy game. Deze avontuurlijke single player game maakt gebruik van drie heldhaftige ontdekkingsreizigers die over een gebied trekken om schatten te vinden, land te ontdekken en eeuwige roem te verdienen. Dit doen ze door tactische keuzes te maken, battles te winnen op een hex-grid based, combat field en je goed voor te bereiden met items en upgrades. Alleen op deze manier kun je het einddoel behalen en dat is in Renowned Eplorers de meest bekende ontdekkingsreiziger van het leaderboard worden.\n\nDe Gameplay\n\nWanneer ik de game begin mag ik kiezen uit twee soorten gameplay. Adventure of Discovery. Wanneer je het spel verliest mag je bij Discovery zo vaak je laatste zet opnieuw beginnen als je wilt en bij Adventure moet je helemaal opnieuw beginnen, of bij je laatste save game. Nou, Adventure daar maar! Helaas is de gemakkelijkste moeilijkheidsgraad \u2018hard\u2019 bij Adventure, dus schakel ik naar Discovery en \u2018normal\u2019. Het is een belangrijke keuze, want hij is later niet meer te wijzigen. Nu een party samenstellen. Er is een bord zichtbaar met wel 20 verschillende karakters en de keuze lijkt enorm. Al gauw blijkt dat je eerste keuze drie uit de vier karaktermogelijkheden is, omdat de andere karakters eerst vrijgespeeld moeten worden. Prima, want anders was ik nu nog bezig met kiezen. De game speelt zich af in een fictieve wereld rond de 19e eeuw, de karakters daarentegen lijken een bonte verzameling uit alle tijden als we kijken naar de kledingstijl en de wapenuitrusting. Zo heb je een vrouwelijke Lucha libre, een eskimo-look-a-like, een vagebond met smiley buttons op zijn jas en een legerkapitein met puntsnor. Dit alles maakt je party niet echt geloofwaardig.\n\nDe karakters\n\nWe mogen een keuze maken uit verschillende classes. Dit zijn niet de bekende Hunter, White Mage, Warrior en de Black Mage, maar hier kiest Abbey voor een Scout, Speaker, Fighter en Scientist. Zijn dat niet exact dezelfde, in een ander jasje? Ja en nee, hier kom ik later op terug. Afijn, voor mijn eerste game kies ik als captain: Harry Walker de scout, als crew member nummer \u00e9\u00e9n: Yvonne Lefevre de Speaker en de tweede is Victor Signac de Fighter. Mijn keuze is niet gevallen op de vierde keuze Anna Proskurikova de Scientist, zonder verdere reden. We starten onze expeditie met de Celtic Code.\n\nIkea\n\nIk ben behoorlijk eigenwijs van stuk, dat zal niemand mij tegenspreken. Wanneer ik in Ikea een kast koop met gebruiksaanwijzing, dan lees ik die lekker niet en ga ik prutsen tot ik niet meer verder kan of aan het einde bepaalde zaken overhoud. Pas dan pak ik de Ikea tutorial erbij. Ditzelfde gebeurde mij een beetje met R.E.I.S. Omdat ik redelijk wat tactische roguelike rpg\u2019s op mijn naam had staan, dacht ik: wat hebben die gasten van Abbey Games, dat mij nog kan verrassen, haha arrrr. Een hele hoop blijkt, want in mijn derde expeditie zat ik vast en ieder uitstel leverde mijn team minpunten op en ieder gevecht werd mijn dood doordat ik nog maar \u00e9\u00e9n Resolve had.\nReview-Renowned-explorers-map\n\nTutorial\n\nOk\u00e9, opnieuw dan maar! De tutorial klik ik aan, maar er begin helemaal geen tutorial game waar alles al doende uitgelegd wordt. Er verschijnt alleen een soort helpschermpje waar je alles moet lezen. Nooo! We hate the in-game reading, precious. Toch maar het \u00e9\u00e9n en ander doorgebladerd en zo kwam ik erachter dat het knokken in Renowned Explorers er een tikkie anders aan toeging. Er wordt namelijk ingespeeld op de algemene status van jouw party en je vijanden. Er zijn drie statussen. Friendly, Aggressive en Devious.\nReview-Renowned-explorers-battle-map\n\nFriendly, Aggressive en Devious\n\nTijdens de battle zie je in welke gemoedstoestand jouw vijanden zijn, Je kunt dan een vijand aanvallen met een bepaalde attack die weer een gemoedstoestand als neveneffect heeft. Zo las ik de regels: Friendly aanvallen zijn sterk tegen Aggressive vijanden, Devious tegen Friendly en Aggressive tegen Devious. Toen ik dit een beetje doorhad werden de battles een stuk gemakkelijker, maar de gameplay ingewikkelder. Daarbij kwam nog dat je levens, die daar Resolve worden genoemd, minder worden als je bepaalde resources slecht koopt, een battle verliest of lang zonder voorraden zit. Dus als je een battle ingaat met nog maar \u00e9\u00e9n Resolve, dan hoeft er maar \u00e9\u00e9n karakter het loodje te leggen, wat al snel voorkomt als je het niet heel tactisch speelt. Je kunt je vijanden aanvallen met gewone Melee aanvallen, Ranged aanvallen of AOE aanvallen. Je kunt kiezen om ze toe te juichen met Cheers, Charms of Compliments en daarnaast kun je ze het leven zuur maken met Insults, Taunts en Huniliations. De uitleg van deze gameplay krijg je niet uit de tutorial en koste mij al twee uur spelen voordat ik het doorhad.\n\n\nConclusie\n\nRenowned Explorers is een tactische en originele avonturen game die niet weggelegd is voor de standaard arcade gamer. Nu zijn turn-based, rouglike games dat zelden, maar ach ik meld het toch maar.  De gameplay is enorm tactisch en deze leer je pas echt door het veel te spelen, dit kan zorgen voor ergernissen of opgave. Een goede tutorial ontbreekt hierbij. De grafische aspecten van de game zijn erg simpel, maar erg mooi en lijken handgetekend. Helaas wordt alles in de game gebracht door tekst, geen enkel filmpje of cartoon. Het geluid is erg sfeervol en de muzikale ondersteuning draagt het geheel prima. De dialogen in-game zijn spitsvondig en lekker verfrissend. Een minpuntje is dat soms niet alle tekst van een gesprek binnen de kaders past en je wat moet scrollen. Er is niet veel aandacht besteed aan het speelbord waar je overheen loopt, deze is (bewust) minimalistisch. Ik had dit graag met meer details gezien om het echt het gevoel te cre\u00ebren dat je op reis bent. De karakters die je speelt en de gameplay zelf bieden je geen echte storyline. Hierdoor heb je geen binding met je team. De grote van het spel vond ik ietsjes tegenvallen, ik zag toch weinig locaties en variaties in ecounters. De explorers had ik toch wel verwacht bij de zeven wereldwonderen, al waren het dan nieuwe fictieve wereldwonderen.\n\nBen je een tactische gamer, dan adviseer ik je zeker om Renowned Explorers te kopen. Het is een geweldig leuke game, gemaakt door een Nederlandse Indie Gamestudio.

I'd also point out that there's no persistent bonuses or character growth so each playthrough starts as a clean slate, this will be ok for some but others will be disappointed you have nothing to show or gain from your past adventures.\n\nAll things considered Renowned Explorers is a very good game and an easy recommendation for lovers of the genre that don't mind taking the time to learn its mechanics and its reliance on repeated playthroughs.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1446970851, "timestamp_updated": 1446970851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681663", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18943774": {"recommendationid": "18943774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030571167", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456701713}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

Chaque personnage poss\u00e8de des traits passifs (athl\u00e9tique, voleur, tacticien, etc.), une mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e de g\u00e9rer les affrontements (agressif, amical ou sournois), et un petit arbre de comp\u00e9tences ainsi qu'un inventaire. \n\nLe but du jeu sera d'avoir la plus grande renomm\u00e9e en tant qu'explorateurs et on pourra y arriver de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res : en trouvant des tr\u00e9sors, en faisant de grandes d\u00e9couvertes scientifiques, en revenant avec des histoires \u00e0 raconter, en r\u00e9solvant des combats de mani\u00e8re avantageuse, etc. Les possibilit\u00e9s ne manquent pas. Il existe une vraie profondeur de jeu.\n\nChaque fois qu'on part dans une mission d'exploration, on se retrouve dans un environnement (europe de l'est, afrique de l'ouest, orient, am\u00e9rique du sud, etc.) au travers duquel on d\u00e9place notre groupe vers diff\u00e9rents points d'int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement (un peu \u00e0 la FTL). Comme les rations sont en nombre limit\u00e9, il s'agira de choisir avec soin o\u00f9 on envoie notre petite troupe pour maximiser les \"bonnes rencontres\" qui nous donneront de pr\u00e9cieux points de renomm\u00e9e et arriver \u00e0 ravir le tr\u00e9sor tant convoit\u00e9. La plupart des points d'int\u00e9r\u00eats sont l'occasion de mettre \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve nos personnages : soit en testant leurs aptitudes passives, soit en faisant le bon choix parmi une liste de propositions, soit en lan\u00e7ant un affrontement, etc.\n\nLes affrontements sont une des grosses originalit\u00e9s de RE:IS. Durant les combats, il y a un syst\u00e8me d'\"humeur\" qui variera selon les attaques que vous ferez et le temp\u00e9rament des ennemis. Il y a une sorte de trinit\u00e9 m\u00ealant actions amicales, sournoises et agressives, influant sur l'humeur et l'issu du combat. Par exemple : si les ennemis sont des moutons (et oui y en a...), que l'humeur du combat est neutre et qu'ils sont eux m\u00eame dans un mood pacifique, si vous les agressez avec une attaque physique (agressive), l'\"humeur\" du combat deviendra \"tyrannique\" et vous aurez un bonus propre \u00e0 ce cas de figure (ici les ennemis subiront un debuff d'armure de 30). Le probl\u00e8me c'est qu'au d\u00e9but du combat, on vous a annonc\u00e9 que si vous terminiez la joute de mani\u00e8re pacifique, vous gagneriez des bonus : libre \u00e0 vous alors de terminer le combat sur une note pacifique mais il sera tr\u00e8s dur de faire oublier \u00e0 vos adversaires la mani\u00e8re dont vous avez d\u00e9marr\u00e9 les hostilit\u00e9s. Il faudra donc multiplier les actions pacifiques pour faire tourner l'esprit de l'affrontement. Ajoutez \u00e0 \u00e7a, les actions sournoises et vous avez un syst\u00e8me de combat simple mais riche et qui reste tout le temps int\u00e9ressant, ce qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un gros point positif pour un rogue-like. \n\nUne fois que vous terminez une exploration, vous revenez \u00e0 Londres et d\u00e9pensez vos points durement acquis pour acheter du mat\u00e9riel, faire parler de vous pour gagner de la renomm\u00e9e, d\u00e9bloquez des comp\u00e9tences pour l'ensemble de votre groupe, etc. Tout ce que vous ferez ici aura une grande importance pour les explorations qui suivront et ce sera pour vous l'occasion de donner une direction strat\u00e9gique \u00e0 vos p\u00e9r\u00e9grinations.\n\nJe vais pas m'\u00e9taler 100 ans sur les qualit\u00e9s de ce jeu que je trouve g\u00e9nial. En plus, certains l'ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait mieux que je ne le ferais. Je vais juste mentionner les choses que je regrette un peu : \n- le c\u00f4t\u00e9 al\u00e9atoire est compl\u00e8tement absent des inventaires des magasins. Ce qui est bien pour le c\u00f4t\u00e9 strat\u00e9gique mais qui pourrait entrainer une certaine r\u00e9p\u00e9tivit\u00e9 si on enchaine les sessions de jeu.\n- il n'y a peut-etre pas assez d'environnements diff\u00e9rents. On s'imagine explorer des dizaines de lieux diff\u00e9rents, voyager aux quatre coins du globe, mais au final on revient toujours aux m\u00eames endroits. Alors certes, il y a beaucoup de sc\u00e9nars diff\u00e9rents par environnement, mais vu la qualit\u00e9 du jeu on aurait aim\u00e9 tellement plus...\n- pas de trad FR. Pour ceux qui veulent se plonger dans l'aventure mais qui ne parlent pas anglais, ca peut etre r\u00e9dhibitoire. Heureusement, les r\u00e9compenses issues des choix que vous aurez \u00e0 faire sont toujours illustr\u00e9es par des phrases simples et des icones qui parlent d'elles-m\u00eames, mais pour le reste...\n\nVoil\u00e0, gros coup de coeur pour ma part pour ce jeu FRAIS et passionnant. \nEt m\u00eame si je l'ai eu bien moins cher, j'estime que le jeu vaut le prix demand\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1446576533, "timestamp_updated": 1446577050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18857600": {"recommendationid": "18857600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136728356", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476017550}, "language": "english", "review": "more addictive  than chocolate", "timestamp_created": 1446562284, "timestamp_updated": 1446562284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18856685": {"recommendationid": "18856685", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994754998", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497261497}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it!

Instead of space, you are in the age of exploration with a crew of allies looking for treasure all around the world, so if that setting doesn't do it for you, I don't blame you for giving the game a pass, but everything else is great.  It's a turn based tactical combat game focusing on using both strength and speech to win the day, with the option to hit, insult, or chat with enemies to win them over to your side, each with benefits and drawbacks.  Say, you meet a nasty pirate captain.  Maybe, after you talk nice to him and win him over, he decides to go with you as a lobbyist, to bolster your rep...or maybe you pound him into the dirt and turn him in for an extra bounty...different solutions lead to different outcomes here.\n\nAlongside the interesting combat mechanics, the game uses a spinner to determine success in many randomly generated actions, such as studying plants, climbing perilous cliffs, searching for treasure, dashing out of a collapsing tomb, etc. and this spinner uses your inherent % for success to give you a visual representation for these challenges, which is much more satisfying than a basic pass/fail.\n\nYou begin the game choosing a team of 3 explorers out of a total of 20, with one captain and two subordinates.  The captain perks and the synergy with certain people allow for some really interesting ways to play and combinations and this is aided further by a robust upgrade system which gives bonuses for research, which can affect all or some of your crew.\n\nOverall, what I love most about this game though is how approachable it is.  FTL has a cripplingly high difficulty at times, making it easy for anyone to give up on it in frustration.  Explorers though, has multiple difficulty settings, each scaling well and allowing you to cater your experience, along with two modes, one which lets you retry encounters you fail and another which ends your game, allowing for another layer of challenge.  I feel in control when I play.  And while I haven't been Classic difficulty, which is on par with FTL, normal has been very good to me.  This is a game which, when jacked up in challenge, will make hardcore min maxers cry, but when played on easy or normal is easily approachable by kids or families.  It's a game which I think suits all ages, especially with the charming art style.\n\nExplorers is, in my opinion, a great game.  It's fun and approachable, has a lot of variety, and there's many teams to try out and treasures to collect, with the devs adding new, free expeditions to go through all the time.  This game rocks.

Encounters are either trivially easy or punishingly hard. The best \"strategy\" i've found is trapping enemies with no ranged attack behind a \"chokepoint\" that they could walk around in 2 turns if the AI wasn't so bad.

The loot is chosen from among a pool per encounter increasing your Renown, as do some ressources you gather along the route you chose.\nSome fighting tests your skill in positioning and in using the right mix of attacks against specific enemy setups.

Looking at screenshots or even just one playthrough, you can be guiled into thinking you've seen all the game can offer.

Through combat, diplomacy, or cunning, you resolve challenges across the exploration scenario - the makeup and stats of your explorers will determine your overall success.\n\nTokens earned can be spent on upgrading a research tech tree, attracting more followers, or purchasing loot. \n\nCombat in RE is especially well done. During combat, 'moods' can offer a significant bonus/penalty. Manipulating the mood of the combat situation is key to winning battles in harder difficulties. You can resolve a battle by being friendly, aggressive, or devious. \n\nOverall, RE is easy and fun to play but will take some learning and effort to master.

The game really shines as a complex system of resources and synergies; it's a lot of fun to try out different ways of generating the ultimate ressource in the game - renown. Another element standing out is the combat mood system. Based on your actions and your opponents' actions, the encounters have a different mood, which gives your units certain buffs and debuffs. This really encourages you to use all abilities of your explorers, rather than just using the 'strongest' or 'juicest' (which you can also do and is a challenge of its own). I think in this sense, RE:IS is a great developmental step from REUS, the studio's previous game. REUS had bautiful synergistic mechanics, but the game played more like a simulation. In RE:IS, the devs managed to forge the synergies into a great interdependent game system that is very enjoyable and rewarding - especially if you're into building systems/resource engines.\n\nIn general, I think that the game is also a bit too short (many others have mentioned that as well). You're done after a handful of explorations; to compare it with a card game: it feels a bit like playing Race for the Galaxy -- you're taking some turns building a great resource engine, but there's not much time to actually see it run. This being said: The replay value is great, but I think some additional campaigns, or some sort of ongoing exploration with limited lives (\"resolve\") could be a great addition. (The good news is that the devs are still working on some additional content and modes.) \n\nAs much as I do like the mechanics and the complex resource system, I do think that the representations of different cultures and individuals are reinforcing problematic stereotypes. I do believe that 'exploration' type games do have a tendency to reinforce hegemonic world-views; in the case of RE:IS, I believe that the  \"explorer\" setting is indeed strongly reinforcing a eurocentric idea of exploration, and in fact, of cultural exploitation (and more than that: it refers to a style of colonialist exploration that actually did happen, and it romanticizes it). \n\nMany encounters involve helpless or fumbling natives that need the help of the explorers. In my opinion this does have an undertone of cultural inequality, and contains an imlicit message that suggests a cultural inferiority in the cultures we explore in the game. It is also important to note that  all of the places we explore are depicted as technologically, and culturally less advanced.\n\nOn one side, the game gives me the choice to resolve encounters agressively or via persuasion. But even if I use persuasion, or 'friendly' tactics, I am still taking something away from the culture (e.g. artifacts). In fact, there is no way to progress in the game without taking artifacts away from their originating culture.  For example, I talk myself into a monastery and convince the nuns to give me one of their relics. Cultural exchange is great - but in RE:IS, a classic colonialist (one-sided, and hegemonic) way of exploration is a constitutional part of the game setting, and game play. \n\n\nIn conclusion: The irony in RE:IS is that the game mechanics are so bautifully synergistic - but the setting is colonialist. Overall I think that this is a game worth playing, set in a game setting worth problematizing and talking about.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1445990341, "timestamp_updated": 1445990341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555086", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18717103": {"recommendationid": "18717103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060934374", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464291948}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fun!

(and collect many treassures)\n\nAs i said te ambiance in this game is just great. All the crew members you can pick from are really diverse, with their own specialisations, prefferences and skills. The joy lies in combining crew members (20 in total) to create a group of 3 with the most potential. then you go on your first expedition.

The joy of them overcomming their obstacles as a team is truly becomming. Opposed to that is the fear of them failing challenges, or losing spirit in battle...\n\nThat brings me to how these obstacles can be overcome. when you enter a 'battle' with some people/cultists/sheep!? the  game switches to a TBS playboard.

Will you impress them with friendly boasting, pester them with devious remarks or just slice those natives in pieces as the conquistadore you apparently are. The 'life' of characters isnt composed of health but rather spirit, a nice and subtle touch.\n\nThere is much more to appraise such as the different emotions allinged with all your characters attacks, all the different treasures to be found and so on.

RE:IS is a very compelling , Refined , Well-paced and simply epic way of telling story using every mechanic to support the idea of upbeat adventure. Which might be praised  for a hundreds of time already.\n\nSo I am going to focus on presentation this game has to offer instead. First of all, I am pretty much a sucker for anything that has a strong theme. whatever it might sound weird , serious , stupid or unrealistic it is, If the game living in it's own world and take advantage on it's own theme then it's doing presentation right (example : Darkest Dungeon , Hunnie Pop, Don't Starve , Recettear)\n\nFor limited budget game like REIS to shine out,  It has to need every aspect of the game to help represent the theme of \nthe game and gladly they did almost everything right. the visual is bright and colorful in pop up book style , this might just look too simple on screenshots but when you playing it yourself it feel a hundred times more impressive. This is one of the game that design everything to support the theme itself. Characters design is vivid , a little goofy but they can be mixed together not just for create an efficient party but to change the story telling itself too. Also , to support the idea of combat system that based on \"Friendly\" , \"Devious\" and \"Aggressive\" ways, Every character has their own traits and personality fitting what they are. A small but important details like how they gain buffs or making facial expression on dialogue encounters helping a lot!  So even not in combat this game still keep getting interesting by well made story telling (which you have part of writing it too). It's not hard to find an epic funny story along the way and still this is not the end of how smart they using this system, Because the way they keep changing how encounters and event approach you. Eventually , You will find  most of them but it will hardly goes stale because you will still get different vibe with different party anyway. Even Combat system is created to compliment the theme , battle can be resolved in ways and it's really funny that you can even bully a giant monster until he cry and run away! (and that is A F**KING Brilliant way to make this game appealing).\n\nThe weakest point of presentation might be the soundtracks of the game, However it's not actually bad but comparing with all amazing aspect of this game, music in this game got a little off feeling (feel like it should be more upbeat and epic than this), And While it has a good feedback interface that giving most information you need to know. some of them are still lacking (like no tool-tips of unlock buildings in world map and some unclear combat tiles connection). Anyway these are just very tiny dot in this masterpiece.\n\nBottom line.

I regret nothing.\n\nIt is a very entertaining rougelite experience, with tactical turn based combat. There are similar games out there, but RE:IS has some features that make it stand out from the crowd.\n\nFirstly theme and aesthetics. Game is set in XIXth century from the pulp novels of the era. It is the world of high adventure, voodoo pirates, mummies rising from their sarcophagi, travels around the world and exploration. Characters are embodiments of the tropes associated with that genre and they are given decent personality through simple things like their visual design and animation, despite almost complete lack of dialogue.\n\nSecondly, combat. It is relatively simple, but uses a \"mood\" system to create interesting variations with each encounter. Video linked above explains it in more detail, but in short - each move in battle fits one of three moods: Friendly, Devious, Aggresive. Depending in each side's mood, party is affected by buffs or debufss. Add to it the fact, that ending encounter in certain ways may give different rewards and it creates a set of decisions going far past spamming the strongest available attacks.\n\nThirdly, the charming narrative. It strongly connects with the first point. Each encounter (in verty FTL-esque) manner has a short description (or set of descriptions) which capture the adventureous feeling of the whole thing.\n\nThere is one problem with the game, namely number of different adventures available. Within few hours it is possible to see every one of them (but not to see everything they offer - supplies acting as a time limit make it difficult to see everything on any map within one play). This is however prone to change since devs promised to keep content patches coming through the 2015 and in 2016, provided they can afford it.\n\nSo here's the selfish part - go buy and play RE:IS.

Set in a 19th century vaguely steampunkish setting, the world has a lot of charisma and each expedition stage has its own quirks and charms.  I especially enjoyed the wide variety of crew members and I hope one of the things the developers release is more of them, as they add a real splash of color to the proceedings, especially as you realize that each explorer has hidden traits and abilities as well.\n\nThe goal is to become the most renowned explorer in the world, racing against a rival and his own crew of explorers.  You gain renown by, well, exploring and the fun is deciding what path you will take to both explore and to deal with the variety of challenges before you.  There are both choose-your-own-adventure moments, the random outcomes decided by the Adventure Wheel and influenced by the skills and stats of your explorers (sometimes also with those hidden character influences coming up), and tactical encounters.  Though simpler than something like the X-COM games, it still has engaging strategin elements, helped along by the emotion and three-part attitude systems.\n\nConflicts can be resolved by Agressive (straight up combat), Devious (trickery or intimidation), or by Friendly (diplomacy and enthusiasm) means.  Resolving encounters with different attitudes leads to different rewards, told to you on the battle screen.  Also, the emotions of characters can shift through different states, both positive and negative, each with added buffs and debuffs based on the emotion.  Performing repeated actions of a particular attiude can shift the overall attitude of the battle, which ALSO has a variety of buffs and debuffs.  Even blending some of one attitude during a round can shift the attitude to a different style of the current one.  There's a lot to discover and understand here, especially early on.\n\nWhile I love the encounter system, it does have its flaws.  My biggest gripe is that there is only one 'health bar', Spirit, meaning that all forms of influence take from that bar.  It's not usually a problem, but it feels just a little off that both insults and gunfire do the same harm and are healed the same way.  When it comes to the Adventure Wheel, it can be a bit rough early on, especially as you are learning the system and the kinds of challenges, and sometimes the rogue-lite elements can bite you on the ass, throwing you into hard-to-handle situations just because of the arrangement of an expedition.\n\nOverall, though, I greatly enjoy the game and look forward to many more playthroughs.  So many more teams to try and Captains to unlock!\n\nPros:\n+ Interesting tactical encounter system\n+ Bright and colorful art style\n+ Charismatic cast of playable characters and plenty of things to unlock\n+ Rogue-lite elements lead to lots of variety in playthroughs\n+ Variety of expeditions to undertake, multiplied by the rogue-lite elements\n\nCons\n- One health bar for all kinds of attacks feels funny\n- Rogue-lite elements sometimes bite you on the ass\n- Might be a bit overwhelming at first to completely grasp the emotion/attitude systems\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1445811984, "timestamp_updated": 1445811984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18685999": {"recommendationid": "18685999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057724254", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1512, "last_played": 1521720179}, "language": "english", "review": "You can charm Sheep an Evil God and nuns with shotguns.\nNeed I say more", "timestamp_created": 1445810224, "timestamp_updated": 1445810224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18685595": {"recommendationid": "18685595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010943467", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450529626}, "language": "english", "review": "Hidden gem!", "timestamp_created": 1445808660, "timestamp_updated": 1445808660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18684324": {"recommendationid": "18684324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026931900", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514481797}, "language": "english", "review": "A delightful roguelite with a charming approach to the genre.

The game is supposed to be about an intrepid band of explorers venturing into the unknown and discovering lost lands, lost peoples, and lost treasures, but ultimately, it fails to deliver on that.\n\nFor example, you're supposed to be exploring the unknown, but in reality the path you're taking is fairly predictable. You know exactly how long your supplies will last, exactly what kind of challenge you'll run into, and exactly how best to deal with that challenge. There is certainy random chance involved, which is good, but it's in the wrong place. Instead of throwing you into the unknown and making you figure out how to get out of the mess you're in, you are instead encouraged to look forward, figure out what lies in store for you, and then meticulously plan out where you go and in what order to have the best chance of success. This isn't a bad mechanic per se, and in a different game it could make for some great gameplay, but for a game about exploring the unknown, it just doesn't click.\n\nThe combat is another example this. While I like the idea of using a combination of weapons, words, and trickery to defeat your enemies, the way it was done just makes everything feel gamey and contrived. Everything is boiled down to an attack on the enemy's HP, and at best you might get something that inflicts an unreliable status effect or changes the \"mood\" of the combat.

It tells the tale of a group of ambitious explorers, out to gain fame and best their rivals by plundering treasures from across the globe.\n\nOver the course of a game, you'll pick your crew of three explorers and send them on a series of expeditions to exotic locales such as the Egyptian desert or the forests of Transylvania. The encounters in each setting are procedurally generated, making each game a new adventure and offering great replayability. Fans of games like FTL will find much to love here.\n\nThe tactical combat system has a surprising level of depth. Each explorer in your party has his or her own set of abilities, and can be further specialised based on your skill selections and item choices. Additionally, combats feature a clever Attitude system, which grants bonuses or penalties based on how well you've optimised your use of Friendly, Devious and Aggressive abilities.

Replaying this game is integral to the whole experience, and makes you tweak your tactics bit by bit until you have a formula that works well. Because this game is so appetizing and creative, the whole tactical puzzle becomes something wonderful. Instead of \"oh snap I died again, NOOOO\", it makes one go \"oh yeah? well how about I do it THIS way\". In any case, as a gamer you're being challenged to be EXPERIMENTAL, and try numerous combinations of tactics until you're beefed up enough to gain special items and level-ups. \n\nThe most bizarre thing is that after Reus, a godgame in an arena devoid of godgames, they have pulled off their magic trick again of creating a game that is so original and flamboyant that it can only become a niche in itself.", "timestamp_created": 1444900853, "timestamp_updated": 1444900853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18481381": {"recommendationid": "18481381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031507739", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506780380}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been fortunate enough to be allowed to play RE:IS when it was still being developed and it is amazing to see how much it has changed in the last stages of development.

Lastly, there are so many mechanics and little systems hidden beneath it surface it will take you a long time to master them all. There is a bit of a learning curve here, and sometimes it can be very overwhelming to see all the little things you can take into consideration. It can easily scare away the more casual gamers from trying to understand this game. \n\nIt has some aspects of FTL in it that work very well with the genre, I feel. The risk/reward choices you make to travel along a certain route in an expedition is the part of the game I enjoy the most.

The game consists of short, challenging play-throughs that build familiarity with the game levels and concepts. As you improve, the game provides re-playability through selection of different combinations of party members and/or attempts to refine your strategy for high score. Not only is the game already fun, but the developers are very active in the steam community to fix bugs and implement suggestions for improvement.\n\nRead on for a description of the game play elements.\n\nParty Selection: The first challenge is picking a captain and two crew members from a selection of 12 characters with a variety of strengths and weaknesses. The characters are divided into 4 classes, each with 2 of 9 traits, a variety of attacks, and semi-hidden personality traits with hints in the character description. The game provides plenty of advice for selecting your team, including description of a character\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, recommended party members, and symbols for a party\u2019s relative strength in each of the three offensive areas \u2013 allowing you to quickly select a balanced or specialized party. There is plenty to appeal to min-maxers, challenge runs, or leisure players that just want to select a quick party and go exploring.\n\nExpeditions: After choosing a party you are cast into your 1st of 5 expeditions, in which you explore a location for resources (gold, campaign and research) and renown (victory points). The map shows the location of the final boss and a couple of nearby locations. Each location gives a hint of the challenges and rewards you may find. Some spaces give rewards automatically, some required the roll on a an adventure wheel, where your chance of success is determined by your party\u2019s class, traits and stats. Some challenges provide an opportunity to avoid the roll for a lesser reward, others impose penalties for failure, including a loss of resolve (game over at 0). Your goal is to choose the route that will provide the most reward on the way to the final boss. You can take as long a path as you like, but if you run out of supplies, your team starts suffering stat penalties.\n\nEncounters: Encounters are brief tactical combats that occur during expeditions. During combat, your characters can use aggressive attacks (physical), devious speech (insults) or friendly speech (compliments) to reduce your opponents\u2019 spirit (hit points). Speech abilities also have 4 debuffs and 2 buffs (friendly speech) that can be applied to a target. Friendly abilities can be used on your own party to heal or remove debuffs. The debuffs/buffs only apply when a character has a positive or negative state of mind, which can be manipulated through use of devious or friendly speech. Also, using aggressive, devious, or friendly abilities will affect the mood of which is how the enemy perceives your actions. The enemy also has its own mood showing their preferred method of attack. The game applies bonuses in a RPS format based on your and your opponents\u2019 mood, where aggressive > friendly > devious > aggressive. If your mood matches your opponent, you receive a bonus to abilities in the superior mood. If your mood is superior to your opponent, you receive a defensive bonus. If your mood is inferior, you receive a defensive penalty. If your characters die in combat, you lose one resolve. Characters can also be revived in lieu of attacking your opponents.\n \nPreparation: After each successful expedition, you are given the chance to spend your resources to improve your characters. Research can be spent to improve your ability to earn rewards, or to make combat easier. Campaign is used to upgrade your shops or hire an entourage, which can improve the value of future reward tokens or increase the number of reward tokens you receive for certain events. Gold is spent on items. Each character can hold one offensive item, one defensive item and one trinket that provides unique bonuses. Will you buy quality armor for a single character, or spread the wealth for small improvements for all of your characters? Finding treasure during expeditions also earns insight, which can be spent during preparation to earn more research, campaign, or gold tokens \u2013 you decide.\n\nEnding the Game: You win the game if you successfully complete 5 expeditions AND finish with more renown than your arch rival. You lose if your party is wiped out during combat, loses all of its resolve during expedition or combat, or if you complete 5 expeditions but don\u2019t earn enough renown to be the top explorer.\n\nIf you like strategy and tactics, this game is for you.\n", "timestamp_created": 1444688253, "timestamp_updated": 1444688253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18446645": {"recommendationid": "18446645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048002776", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474179248}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is excellent.

There's been quite a few improvements to RE:IS since I wrote this, I really recommend both this game and its DLC.\n-------------------\nWhen I first heard of Renowned Explorers : International Society (henceforce known as RE:IS) my initial reaction was along the lines of \"what on earth is this?\". I purchased it on a whim, and having now played it for nearly 100 hours and all treasures collected, it has definitely turned out to be one of my wisest purchases (and heck, i'm actually writing a proper review for once, my first one on steam.)\n\nRE:IS is a roguelike in an Indiana Jones style - you and your crew will be having adventures all around the globe, from searching castles in the Scottish highlands to the tombs of  ancient pharoahs in Egypt in the hopes of finding treasures (and with over 100 treasures to find, there is plenty to see.) You'll run into a variety of characters such as bagpipe playing clansmen,  pirates suffering under a voodoo curse and a group of monkeys worshipping a giant fruit.\n\nThe game keeps a fairly lighthearted and humourous theme throughout, which is aided by its bright and colourful art style. Don't let this fool you however - there is a surprising amount of depth to be found in the games combat and exploration systems. Battles have three different approaches: you can befriend your enemy, offering them things such as compliments and peace treatires. Or you can take a straight up physical approach - hacking and slashing your way through hordes of your opponents. If you prefer a more devious approach, you can play mind games with your opponents, hurling insults towards them in such number that they run away from the battlefield sobbing.\n\nOverall, RE:IS takes a refreshing approach to the turn-based rogue-like genre. The developers are very active within the community and listen to feedback and suggestions from players. The game is frequently updated with new content, and more has been promised down the line. I highly recommend purchasing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1444521246, "timestamp_updated": 1480427879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 338, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.938235", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18417426": {"recommendationid": "18417426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048871026", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518534041}, "language": "english", "review": "So in this game you establish a team of 3 explorers, then go off on a series of adventures in order to defeat that dastardly Frenchman Rivaleux and his team of equally dastardly explorers. You have 3 options as to how you handle encounters: You can be Agressive, Friendly or Devious. These work in a rock paper scissors style system. As you complete these expeditions you find different types of currency, which can be spent on upgrading your crew in various ways. The in-game tutorials do an excellent job of explaining this to you, and prevent any confusion you may have at first. \nThe encounters themselves are fun and unique, even if you play through the same encounters again and again they always go a little differently, though they can be a a little cheap (and borderline unfair) at times (I'm looking at you, Vladimir).

Pirates!  Sheep?  Welcome to the world of Renowned Explorers!  I'll start by saying I bought this game on a whim.  I was looking for something fun and challenging, but that wouldn't take a vast amount of time to complete. I would have settled for a \"Meh\" time killer, but I bought this and now I'm hopelessly addicted.  I can honestly say my first thought after an hour of playing was that I'd gladly pay for any future DLC to expand the game.  And that was after I'd lost five times.  It's a unique game that can be a bit difficult to describe, but rather than just shouting, \"I love it!\", I'll give it a try.   Basically you start by selecting a team of 3 characters from pools of 4 different types of explorers.  Each explorer is unique (some attacks abilities are repeated but the characters all have their own animations and it goes a long way to giving them the feeling of individual personalities) and has Skills, that effect how they play and their success rate on events that can occur while on an adventure.  After selecting your team, you start working your way through Adventures you want to undertake.  While on Adventures,  you explore locations on the Adventure Map searching for resources (used to upgrade your team) and events.  Events fall into three basic categories:  Adventure Wheel challenges (think The Price is Right), combat instances and story challenges (like choose your own adventure books). Lots of  events contain elements of all three.  Combat is tactical and features a unique system in which attacks are divided into Friendly (charm), Devious (psychological) and Aggressive (physical violence).  This ties into the flavor of your team.  Now at this point, we need to jump back to character selection.  Certain characters complement each other better when teamed together.  I've read some comments criticising the combat system as confusing and certain adventures as too hard.  The truth is, what team you put together determines which expeditions you're best suited to undertake and what tactics are best to use in combat.  *The game gives you all this information, you just need to read it.* When you select your crew, it tells you what types of team (Friendly, Devious or Aggressive) the character works best with.  It even gives examples in the character discription of the types of charcters they'd work well with.  It will even show you the type of team (Friendly, Devious, Aggressive) you're putting together at the top of the team selection screen.  The descriptions of Adventures tell you what type of team or what character skills are best suited for those adventures.  I imagine a lot of those people complaining did what I did at first, which is skim this information and go, \"These three look cool together, I'll use them!\"  Team Super Awesome may be the coolest looking group of explorers around, but it doesn't mean they'll work that well  together or that they have any hope of  making it out of Transylvannia alive.   This is a roguelike.  I recommend sticking fairly close to the recommended teams until you have the chance to get a feel for the Adventures and different characters.  For the combat system, it's one of my personal favorite things about the game.  You can overwhelm pirates with charm, beat the living daylights out of evil cultists, or even make an ancient goddess cry and run away.  The types of attacks you use (your Atttitude) versus the type of attacks your opponent is using (their Attitude) create a Mood (displayed in the top center of the tactical map) that grants various buffs/debuffs.  As a tip, next to the Mood display are little indicators showing how many of the other types of attacks you can use before your Attitude changes, which changes the Mood.  You can mix and match attacks, managing and manipulating the Mood to your advantage is part of the challenge.  Be aware, the AI can do the same.  Pros:  A wide cast of playable characters that feel like individuals (not just reskinned clones).  A fun art style that goes very well with the game's sense of humour.  The combat system is unique and challenging.  Tons of content and an enormous amount of replayability.  While there is some violence, most of it is slapstick or cartoonish, and  I'd say it's one of the safer games out here for younger players.  It's fun, which I know sounds rather simple, but I can honestly say at no point have I been bored or felt gameplay was tedious.  Stability (I haven't had a single bug or crash).  Cons:  A playthrough only consists of 5 Adventures.  You won't understand why that would qualify as a con until you play it and realize how much you wish you could squeeze in just one more  :)", "timestamp_created": 1444445686, "timestamp_updated": 1444445957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18399450": {"recommendationid": "18399450", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968394118", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494353521}, "language": "english", "review": "You can attack nuns, befriend a giant Ape and Insult a ghost!

On classic, it will exploit some of your misakes and forgive you others.\n3. Unique locations with great art: the artwork of this game is great, the devs did am awesome job with it.\n4. Unique Characters: your Captain and your crew members all have unique capabilities, and you are free to mix and match them to your heart's content, discovering the best combos and finding out what works best for you.\n5. An innovative take on combat: combat can be won with friendship, deviousness, aggression and... guile. Why guile? Because you can mix and match all of those 3 combat approaches to achieve a combat status that best fits your next move at any given time, and thus win a battle more easily.\n6. A game over that barely feels like a game over. Your crew doesn't really die... they just have \"stuff\" happen to them. Like spend the remainder of their lives repenting in an all-nun monastery. Well, if that was a 3 man crew... they have their work cut out for them.\n7. Easy to roleplay: I am not a good roleplayer AT ALL. Yet I found myself putting lines in my toon's mouths. Say, my girl does an ew and shows some soiled undies to another female and I was like: \"Geez girl, when was the last time you changed your knickers?!\" - reaction: \"Saddened\". In another case she shows a snail and points at a guy and I was like \"Sheesh, mate, even she knows that you are slow to get it up\". And then I LOLED. And then I was happy.  And then I went to bed with a smile of my face. 'Bout that...\n8. This game easily puts a smile on your face through dialogues, the encounters (charming wolves and sheep FTW), and the combat. Yeah, even when you're losing...\n9. Tons of unlockables: the devs really went balls to the wall with this one. You have 20 unique characters, with every one of them available as a captain after you've played them a few times, over 100 achievements, treasures, and 4 difficulty levels with or without savescumming.\n10. Ironman if you want: many rogue-likes (Lites?) have an imposed ironman setting. Here you don't. All that the non-ironman game does is to lock you out are the achievements, and that is a small gripe, especially when it comes to a game as hard as this one. 'Bout that #2...\n11. The game is hard. It's brutal. It's so damn difficult to win. I love it. Even getting 2nd or 3rd place is an achievement. Hell, even surviving the whole ordeal is :D\n12. 12 procedurally generated maps with tons of stuff to unlock on them.\n13. Your experiences matter and the game teaches you as you go. I really like that about a game - it makes my subsequent playthroughs meaningful, and much more fun.\n14. Tooltips give you an idea what to expect and even let you turn back and back out of a possible challenge, encounter or opportunity, which is a rare thing in rogue-like (lite?) games. You just need to read, you know...\n15. The game gives you recommendations with your starting crew (every toon has 2 \"best fits\" so to speak), which saves you some trial and error time.\n16. Once you get the hang of the entire system, just like in FTL, the game feels great to play.\n\nAnd now, the bad:\n\n1. Only a limited number of maps. 12 is ultimately too little if you want to play this game over and over.\n2. The game is HARD. It will take you a good amount of hours to find a decent crew composition and make it work. And then you need to get used to the bosses... and then you need to get used to the levels... and then you need to learn which toons does what ability... and then you need to pick the proper maps to do it... and finally, you need to make it work. Yeah... that's a lot of info.\n3. You can lose missions through no fault of your own. The map can screw you, the RNG can screw you, the enemies can screw you, etc. I had runs where I was consistently losing high % rolls... not a pretty sight.\n4. Very high learning curve. Learning how every character, every enemy, every mood combo, every attack and so on and so forth works is a daunting challenge.\n5. Overpriced. While the game is good, 20\u20ac is too much. I personally bought it on HumbleBundle for the US equivalent of Euro and even had a % of it donated some to charity, so I feel good about myself. On steam, however, 20\u20ac is a lot.\n\nThe conclusion:\n\nThis game gets an easy recommendation from me, especially to the gamers of the rogue-like (lite?) genre. The game allows you to do pretty much everything with it - explore safely, savescum, challenge yourself, find tresures, go achievement crazy and so on and so forth. It never makes you feel bad about losing too. Your guys don't perish - they just get to live a different life or flee. This makes it a great game for people who are generally sensitive or don't like to lose their in-game crew. All of this is a grat selling point to this game. Its setbacks comprise of a high learning curve, limited maps and TIME. Yes, you need time, and you really need to take the game in and let it teach you. Not everyone is ready to do that.\n\nAny price reduction of 33% or more makes the game an easy purchase. It needs love in my opinion, because it does so much right, and it is a breath of fresh air to the genre, by letting you do whatever you feel like it with it. I have a ton of fun with it, and I will keep on doing so. 8.7 hours in, just a tad less than my play time in FTL, and this game still isn't getting old, and that is saying something.", "timestamp_created": 1444398162, "timestamp_updated": 1444614436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18391386": {"recommendationid": "18391386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055990164", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495002277}, "language": "english", "review": "RE is a fun little game with enough randomly generated elements to keep you coming back till you've unlocked all the content.

It's radically different from the typical RPG or strategy games that I am family with.  Because it is so different, it took me a while to grasp and learn the basics of the game. In the end, after learning about the game, I begin to have great fun... and hundreds of hours on the game. \n\nThe nice thing about RE is that the entire game campaign consists of 5 expeditions, and you can play it over and over again with different team setups. Different team captains have different super powers, and so, each game with a different captain usually require different strategy and even different playstyle, making in intriguing and interesting.\n\nAnother nice thing about RE is that the development team offered to add additional contents and updates on a regular basis. So far they have already added quite a bit of new content. Such a commitment from a developing team is really commendable. Even with 276 hours played, I will still be playing this game whenever they add anything new. \n\nI am sure I will get MORE than my money's worth and highly recommend this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1444351180, "timestamp_updated": 1444351180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819256", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18389284": {"recommendationid": "18389284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052294279", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444513693}, "language": "danish", "review": "Saw this at Evening with Sips and instantly thought I had to play it.

So what does this game bring to the table? What makes it replayable?\n\nIt is designed to be played multiple times so each session will only last a few hours at most. You form a three person team from a roster of 20 characters divided into four specializations. The catch being that only four are unlocked at the start to be in the captain roll. Simply playing the game and running with different characters in the other two positions permanently unlocks them for the captain position in future playthroughs. On top of this you can choose how you approach your encounters, be it friendly, devious or aggressively so playing for or against type can throw your opponents for a loop.\n\nNow the biggest drawback is the lack of locations to explore. Currently you have three possible starting locations and then choose from a handful of others. Your goal is to gain enough reknown to beat a rival explorer at a special party, but you only have time for a total of five explorations before the deadline hits and the most reknowned explorer is crowned. While I will freely admit to wanting more locations to explore there is a lot of replay value in what is currently available if you're determined to hunt down all the side quests or you want to nail a significant portion of the 100+ achievements currently available. Each currently available explorable location is stuffed full of interesting things to uncover. You can scour every spot on a playthrough only to discover a different event chain in that location in your next playthrough. The locations were definitely well thought out and had a lot of time and effort put into each one by the developers.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nYes. If nothing else, it's definitely worth a solid ten to fifteen hours of gameplay just to unlock all the captains and see a good chunk of the quest events. There are plenty more hours to be had if you want to find all the in game trophies and want to grab a good chunk of or even all the achievements. I just finished unlocking all 20 characters for captain use at nearly 13 hours and have only gotten about half of the in game treasure from various side quests and main quest chains and finding all of said side quests.\n\n\n\ntl;dr\n\n10/10 Would make sheep feel bad about their life choices again.", "timestamp_created": 1443383043, "timestamp_updated": 1443383043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18209736": {"recommendationid": "18209736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045480614", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494570299}, "language": "english", "review": "+20% chance to succeed, because this crew member has a fancy mustache. 10/10!", "timestamp_created": 1443302296, "timestamp_updated": 1443302296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18193509": {"recommendationid": "18193509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047693133", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468638869}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game alot but I wish you could continue to play once you beat it, also it would be cool if you did another campaign after winning instead of trying to beat the guy again, you should have to beat your previous crew.\n", "timestamp_created": 1443224826, "timestamp_updated": 1443224826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18185359": {"recommendationid": "18185359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036094580", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443494747}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun, but inconsitent and little technical glitches make it bothersome more often than not. \n\nThe idea is great, there isnt enough depth to the explorations and encountrers to play over and over again and playing with different styles requires no extra thought save making sure your three explorerers are of the same skillsets.

It\u2019s a fun little premise based on running a team of three explorers through a handful of expeditions to exotic locations (pirate-infested isles, Count Dracula\u2019s castle, the mysterious Shangri-Lai), exploring and gathering rare treasures.  Your time is split basically between three screens \u2013 the planning screen where you use the resources you\u2019ve gathered to buy new equipment, unlock scientific advancements to improve your abilities, and gather an entourage of followers to increase the value of future resources.  It\u2019s a nice little balance that allows you to take different approaches in how you improve your team.  Easy to use but requires some time and thought to really master and make the most of your choices.  \n\nThe other two screens are the game itself.  The first is a map of the area where you pick what locale on the map to explore, trying to match your characters\u2019 diverse skills to what the region is likely to yield.  IE, don\u2019t send your party of fighters to spots where expertise in engineering or science is needed.  Finally the third, where you\u2019ll spend a bulk of your time, is in the turn-based combat screen in which you resolve encounters according to your characters\u2019 abilities in a kind of fun paper-rock-scissors dynamic that can see a friendly argument rapidly turn into fisticuffs.  The challenge of course being to balance it so that your own characters stay one step ahead of the fight by leveraging the skills their best at.    \n\nAltogether it\u2019s a diverse little game that allows for a lot of play-throughs with different teams and styles.   It\u2019s also the rare RPG where skills actually mean something more than just an alternative way to kill enemies.  The right mix of skills on your team can have your characters gathering tremendous amounts of renown (the way the game is scored) while a poorly selected and equipped team may end up just scraping by or eventually outmatched in the later stages.  It\u2019s even possible to go through the game without technically ever getting into a physical fight \u2013 defeating enemies purely through the persuasive powers of your speech skill, a real rarity in any kind of adventure game.\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely worth a try if anything about the premise appeals to you.  The developers did a pretty excellent job of bringing the world to life and offering something a little different, and they\u2019ve continued to tweak an already well-developed game in response to the community\u2019s wants and suggestions.  And if it\u2019s the art that\u2019s maybe giving you pause, I\u2019d advise you don\u2019t let that dissuade you \u2013 it\u2019s actually a pretty nice looking game when it\u2019s running and while the cartoony style fits the sometimes humorous tone, this is a serious game that takes a level of skill and dedication to really master.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1443159500, "timestamp_updated": 1443159500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18179369": {"recommendationid": "18179369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011441276", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473546925}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is nice.

Upon first starting up, the initial loading screen and introduction menu looks badly slapped together. \n\nReally, white text on black screen loading? Abbey Games you couldn't have done a simple but nice splash screen with a loading bar? And the start game menu! Why are all the text buttons arranged in a small row vertically (so hard to read!), when there is so much space? Why is the start menu screen background a flat boring landscape when you have far better art throughout the game?\n\nWhilst this may come off as nitpicky, first impressions do count!\n\nAnd this is such a shame (and so easy to fix!), as RE:IS is a gem, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nIt is a great mash-up of gameplay genres: rogue-like permadeath choices (if you choose to play it this way), choose-your-own-adventure storytelling, reasonably deep and interesting tactical hex-grid-like battles.\n\nIt has an interesting and fresh setting, fun and funky characters, mostly well-written and funny storylines.\n\nI had a lot of fun playing this game. Even though I won it twice in classic adventure mode (failed in many other runs), I would go back to retry again using different captains and characters because you want to see how other strategies play out.\n\nI would say this game has surprising depth.\n\nReplay value wise, I agree with other commenters that the number of expeditions are a little on the low side. After a few playthroughs, you have seen many of the events there are to see.

It has this nasty tablet game vibe and feels like it's catering to stupid kids, not even smart kids but plain retarded children. Oh boy, can looks be deceiving! This game is so incredibly mature and deep while still being highly accessible.\n--------------\nGameplay:\nRE is a rare genre-mix and feels like an Indiana Jones movie. You select a team with 1 leader and 2 sidekicks out of 20 unique characters from four categories (scientist, scout, fighter, speaker).\nThis gives you the total number of possible combinations: (20!) / ((20-17)! * 3!) = 1140 party combinations!\n\nThen you pick between normal mode and the much better \"iron man\" mode. It's how every game of this kind should be played, no reloading. Once you're dead, you're dead. One playthrough only lasts a few hours anyways. In iron man mode it's much more tense and fun! Then you pick one out of 4 difficulty modes. Hint: always play iron man, just pick a lower difficulty setting if you want!\n\nOnce you have assembled your party, you will have 5 expeditions for your claim to fame. Every expedition takes you to a beautiful place around the globe. This is where the board game aspect kicks in. You move across the map from node to node with limited supplies (each node costs 1 supply). Each node offers different benefits. Sometimes you will get encounters. An encounter plays out on a hex based battle field. This is where the game becomes really complex.\n\nEncounters can be resolved in three ways: peaceful, devious, aggressive.\nThere is a rock-paper-scissor element to it, but it goes much deeper. Based on your team's skills and the opponent, there are many possible ways to solve an encounter. You can pistol-whip everything, you can charm your opponent or you can backstab them. Really cool stuff and really clever. \nEach expedition ends with a boss fight. Once that is mastered you return to the world map where the resource management unfolds. You can invest in research, items, entourage... again numerous choices, again very complex.\n\nAt the end of 5 expeditions (if you're still alive by then!) you get your final score. The devs are planning an online highscore list. The current limitation to 5 expeditions has been critiziced by some people, but let me say two things about that:\n1. the devs already announced longer game modes for future patches\n2. the idea behind the game is that each playthrough lasts only a few hours and the emphasis is on replay value with different teams (remember: 1140 different combinations!). After all you're unlocking new captains by playing the game. This is exactly what made FTL (Faster Than Light) such a modern classic. Quick playthroughs and a lot of incentive to start over.\n-------------\n\nTechnical aspect:\nGraphics are very good, but annoyingly childish (fake Disney-look). I don't like the over-the-top comical style, but objectively they are executed flawlessly.\nSound is okay, but nothing special. I turned off the music quickly, but I do that in every game.\nThe real beauty is the programming. So many Indie games suffer from poor to mediocre programming and you can tell immediately. Be it CTDs, clumsy interfaces and plain poor controls... RE truly shines here. This game is a smooth as any 200 million dollar production can be. Wonderful design and implementation. It's just a pleasure to play. \n__________________\n\nSummary:\nVery complex, yet easily accessible game. The looks are deceiving. It's a true PC game that looks like tablet garbage.\nHighly recommended for everyone... I can't think of a single person who wouldn't enjoy this one.\nMy biggest gripe (the cartoonish look) isn't even a real con. If you hate that like me, first thing you should do: turn off the action camera.\n\nRating: [strike]9.5/10[/strike]\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nUpdate: 23.09.2015\n11 hours and 5 campaigns (iron man, normal difficulty) thus far. I won 3 and lost 2 campaigns.\nStill extremely high fun factor. The replay value is enormous thanks to the sheer endless possible combinations of characters. I lost my first campaign with an all-out scientist crew. That emphasizes how important a versatile crew is.\n\nOne issue is beginning to bother me now. The number of expeditions is too low. It should take more than 11 hours to have seen everything. The devs announced 1 more free expedition and more to come via DLC. Depending on the price that can be good or bad.\nI would recommend to deliver 1-2 more free expeditions before moving on to DLC. The lack of content has been a major negative point in many reviews I've read and I have to agree with that.\nFor a $20+ game you should expect a bit more content.\nThis leads to a slight devaluation of my rating.\n\nRating: [strike]9.0/10[/strike]\n\n---------------------------------\nUpdate: 15.10.2015\nA brand new free DLC-expedition set in Mali will be released next week. This kind of post-launch support is highly commendable!\n\nRating: [strike]9.5/10[/strike]\n\n--------------------------------------------\nUpdate: 12.11.2015\nPicked up the game after a long time. \nThe devs have been extraordinarily active constantly improving the game. You can tell how much they love their product. Some characters used to be weak, they found perfect solutions for that. Every minor gripe I had is solved by now. Hell, I even love the graphics now. The tablet look put my old 1980s gamer genes off for quite a while, but I got used to it and finally see beauty in those loveable characters.\n\nThis game is absolutely fabulous now. I doubled my total playing time in this week alone. I'm hopelessly addicted now. For the first time ever I will rate a game with the highest possible score.\n\nRating: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1442861086, "timestamp_updated": 1447357674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18106473": {"recommendationid": "18106473", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972583180", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482875689}, "language": "english", "review": "A very enjoyable little game with surprisingly deep mechanics and replayability.

There... is a surprising amount of depth in this game.  Crew have 4 basic stats (phsyical/speech offense and defense) as well favoring one-two of the three combat styles (Aggressive, Friendly, Devious).  Its an important choice to either stack all of these up or keep them well balance, as using abilities will change the mood of an encounter.  Both you and your opponent have a combat \"stance/attitude,\" and the combination of them affects the fight.  If you are both friendly, then the first aggressive attack gets +50% damage! This will immediately change the mood giving you extra speec defense (agains their pansy words!), however they will often swap to aggressive themselves creating an attitude that favors devious damage... which continues the dance.  As moods flip, enemies will react differently and use different attacks/change moods themselves.  Bosses are particularly bad about gaining bonus stats when you flip to a mood that they are hte most vulnerable too.  Even worse, some ecounters are scripted to offer better rewards for completing them in a different mood.  If you aggressively defeat the bandits, you get more rewards.  If you aggressively beat up the crazed abbess, your conscientious members get wracked with guilt and suffer permament penalties!  So even if your party really sucks at deviously, you have to consider weighing the extra challenge of a predominantly devious fight against what you would give up ending it on your prefered attitude... You also normally build up \"Extra ____ when ending a fight ___!\" bonuses.  So is giving up your standard +3 coin tokens on an aggressive victory worth giving up the information/treasure/incuring the curse of ending it that way instead of another? Can you even finish this tough boss battle the \"right\" way? Again, this cutesy game has a mountain of depth!  \n\nAnd that is just one half of the game! While all expeditions end in a boss \"fight,\" that might be the only fight you actually perform on the entire hike.  The rest of the map has various loot and challenges that check against your parties \"abilities.\"  However, even if you don't have the right ability (like beguiling or archeology), if a character has high enough stats and is the right class... the can \"brute force\" the check.  My last play through had a speaker class with ranks in beguiling and a -very- high speech score.  She was my main attacker, however she lacked any ranks in diplomacy.  When going through a latter expedition with several diplomacy checks, I found that her sky-high speech stat coupled with a natural bonus of being a \"speaker\" was enough to push those diplomacy checks into the 60-70+ range! Everyone else was easily below 20.  This is another level of balancing your party... you need to have a good spread of abilities.  Each of hte locations you can choose to embark on also favors certain abilities and resources.  Embarking into the carribean will grant a ton of research, mostly found through survivalist, naturalist, athletic challenges.  Don't expect to get much use out of an engineer or beguiler! Tactician will be of limited use... but you might find the odd ruined village to excavate.  In the transylvanian countryside, you'll need a skilled diplomat to talk down the superstitious natives and a sharp tactian to deal with all the ambushes by cultists, bandits, and wolves.  So if you lack a diplomat, you'll have to choose.  Do you go to the carribean and enjoy the easy challenges, or do you tough it out in Hungary because you need the renown it offers more than the science? On top of all of this... each cleared expedition unlocks places to spend resources.  Exploring the carribean opens up a shop in New Orleans that sells +speaking element books (extra terrify damage, extra impress damage, etc).  So again, even if you don't want that science or don't have abilities to easily traverse the place... do you still go to unlock those sweet, sweet, books? \n\nThere is definitely a steep learning curve here... the creators graciously added different difficulty modes to help beginners get into the game and learn how to properly balance a party to dance between moods in combat and navigate the world map better.

There are a large number of party combinations to try, and for casual gamers you can set the difficulty somewhat low and just explore around.\n\nHowever, this review is aimed at the more serious gamers.\n\nThis game, at higher difficulty levels, has a lot of strategic depth. It is a rogue-lite (with the only progression unlocking new captains--you start at lvl 1 explorers each game, with no new equipment). So essentially a pure rogue-like.\n\n\nThere are several different parts to this game.\n\n1) [Non-expedition] Resource management. You never have enough to do everything, even with full focus on one of them.\nGold for equipment.\nStatus to hire followers and specialists. Give new perks (see below) and improve # of resources gained on expeditions.\nResearch to write papers (which give various bonuses; there are multiple research trees focused on different things).\n\nFully focusing on gold, for instance, will never get you enough for the best equipment for all your characters.\nFull on research? MAYBE you'll get half the trees unlocked.\nEtc.\n(And you'll still get other resources; just where you focus your bonuses can matter a lot.)\n\n2) Character development\n\na) Your captain perk matters a lot. Each captain has a different perk that can make a big difference (or not, depending on the captain, but its all in how you use it). Hard to explain without going into horrible amounts of detail, but different captains are better at some strategies than others; lots to explore.\n\nb) Perks: each character starts with 2 perks and gets at least 2 more during level-ups (choice between 2 different perk groups for each character). You can also gain them during exploration and from equipping trinkets.\nPerks give you more options during exploration (e.g., with enough Archeology you get might get unique options when exploring a pyramid, or with enough Athlete perks maybe you can do some crazy stuff when running from natives across a bridge).\nPerks give you bonuses on the 'adventure wheel'--a %-based spin that resolves various non-combat encounters. (Different perk \"groups\" give bonuses, and specific perks can too. E.g., if you have 5 \"naturalist\" perks, maybe you get a big bonus on identifying some new species of animal you find, giving bonus research. If one of those perks is 'biology', maybe you get a separate, additional bonus.)\nPerks also give combat stats.\n\nc) Attacks\nEach character starts with 3 regular \"attacks\": A physical attack of some sort, a deceitful talking action, and a friendly talking action.\nAll of these damage enemy \"spirit\". (And the friendly one can be used on allies too, will heal them.)\n\nThe talking attacks generally inflict a status too: saddened, excited, etc. (These give bonuses or penalties to combat stats.)\n\nIt can be really interesting if you are trying to be friendly; you may end up buffing the enemy! Careful...\n\nEach character also unlocks 2 unique attacks as they level up (AoE, line attacks, single target, and all sorts of other stuff).\n\nd) Equipment: Each character can equip a trinket (perks, resists), offense item (offensive combat stats, maybe buffs too), defensive item (defensive stats).\n\ne) Special things. Sometimes you may get a permanent non-perk thingie that stays with the character either for the rest of the current expedition (each game is 5 expeditions) or for the rest of the game.\n\n\nThe different classes of character have typical perk groups they unlock and typical types of builds. (E.g., scouts tend to be glass cannon with long range attacks and quick thinking/rogueish perks. Fighters tend to be melee with athletic or tactical perks.)\n\nUtilizing different combinations of characters is fun--it can play very differently.\n\n3) Combat\n\nSo there are 3 different flavors of attack: \u201caggressive\u201d, \u201cdeceitful\u201d, and \u201cfriendly\u201d\n\nThey interact in different ways depending on the overall mood of the fight. (9 total combos. E.g., if enemy is aggressive, it is ok for you to be aggressive (small bonus) or deceitful (bigger bonus), but if you are friendly you get a debuff.)\n\nEach of the 9 combos has a different threshold for changing, and changes when enough abilities of a different flavor are used. (E.g., when both sides are \u2018friendly\u2019, using a single aggressive ability will change the mood. But when both sides are aggressive, it takes a lot of friendly abilities to change the mood.)\n\nFurther, you can have specific abilities, items, artifacts, research, or other stuff that gives bonuses or penalties when in a certain mood.\n\nThere are buffs and debuffs; deceitful talking abilities can give Enraged, Saddened, Terrified (all of which give different penalties, and also can have interactions with items & other abilities/research/etc), and friendly can give mostly buffs (and one debuff): Confident, Excited, and I forget what the debuff is called (makes you more vulnerable to speech attacks).\n\nEach character has an attack rating, a speech rating, armor, and speech defense. (And \u2018grit\u2019, which dodges all attack types.)\n\n\nSo on top of all that, the way you win a combat also matters. If you mostly used one ability type, that is how the combat will resolve. (E.g., mostly used friendly abilities.)\nThis affects what bonuses you get (if any)--different abilities, research unlocks, and the specifics of the encounter can all affect what the bonuses are for different combat endings.\nFurther, your overall reputation is affected by how you typically resolve combats, and this overall reputation can affect how things go when you run into people during your explorations.\n\n\n4) [Expedition] Resource management & exploration: Don\u2019t run out of food or resolve (lives).\n\nYou can trade resolve for stuff sometimes, but probably shouldn\u2019t. If you run out of food you start getting horrible penalties (like -40% to your attack stat, or to a defense stat).\n\nYou have to balance how hard you think an encounter will be (and what type of challenges your team is able to overcome) with gaining resources. You want as many resources as you can, but if you have no scientist on your team (there are 4 classes and only 3 characters per team\u2026) then you should probably avoid challenges that will require naturalist/engineer/archeologist perks (though engineer & archeologist can be gotten a bit from other classes).\n\n\n(There are 4 challenge categories, each corresponding to different groups of perks; you can see what challenges there are at a node before you go there.)\n\nYou can base a strategy around buffing up the resources you gain for overcoming certain types of challenges, then seeking those out. All sorts of stuff you can try :).\n\n\n\nAnyway, the game is fun and challenging. You should give it a shot.\n\n\nBTW, as to the cons in the most helpful negative review:\n\n - Adventurer wheel screwing you over: You have a ton of control over this.\n  a) Avoid nodes where you know your perks don't line up with the challenge type\n  b) Unlock tools in the preparation research tree (gives a big boost to your % chance to get through)\n  c) Choose perks wisely, equip trinkets to fill in some gaps\n\n(BTW, adventure wheel is essentially a %-based way of resolving non-combat stuff. You get a base % chance modified by perks and various other things.)\n\n - Boss fights: they can be very difficult if you aren't prepared. But once you know what you are doing I think they are challenging but not unfair/impossible.\n\n\n - Lack of content: Yeah there aren't that many islands yet. But there are so many different events... I'm 8 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface I think. I could replay this a ton.\nAND they are planning to release more content.\n\n\nI usually buy a game and give it a 2 hour shot, then give it a hard look for whether to refund or not. I hit the 2 hour mark and knew there was no way I could refund this.\nGive it a shot, its worth the try.", "timestamp_created": 1441999412, "timestamp_updated": 1441999995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17986873": {"recommendationid": "17986873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010405907", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473512836}, "language": "english", "review": "The Developers for this game are really on the ball.

Adventure! If you are fan of Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider, then Renowned Explorers is a game you're going to love. You will form a crew of dashing and clever adventurers and set out on a journey to become internationally famous. All that stands in your way is pirates, mummies, forgotten horrors, and other explorers. The game itself is broken up into three phases, planning, adventure, and occasional combat. Planning is where you gather your resources and research. Adventure is where you will face all sorts of random challenges and possible dangers. Combat itself is a battle of wits, brawn or hugs. Yes, I said hugs. You can be so friendly that they die. Renowned Explorers does quite a bit of genre blending, incorporation turned based strategy with RPG/adventure elements. The entire game has a wonderful style and theme. Making you feel like your adventuring throughout the world. This is what drew me in and I wanted more of. One thing that is important to note though is that the game is based on replay. You only have 5 adventures before you either win or lose, and start over again with a new crew of adventurers.

I had 10 of 11 xp entering a map, i saved then i did an event with success my captain gained experience point enough to level up, i saved before hitting the next map only to fail and being forced to load, when i loaded my game I had \"De-leveled\" and had 10 of 11 xp.

The game ended not from how many expeditions you had but when you had found enough treasure to humiliate the opponent. Having the option to re-visit allready explored areas to grab what you can of materials would be fun, basically more RPG than what it allready is. Could also make it so that finding and acquiring more members is also done in city event.\n\nSimply put as the game is now, it is a single player game of Settlers of Catan, or thats as close as I can place it.

Yes, boss fights can be horrible, and the RNG can be your worst enemy. But I stuck with it, and gradually learned how to be better at it. I've had a lot of fun trying different combinations of crew members and figuring out when to take risks, when to play safe, how to prepare the crew in between adventures and plan ahead, and how to be more effective in encounters.\n\nThere was a time that I found level 3 expeditions impossible, but I improved. There was a time I thought Shangri-la - the level 5 expedition - was literally impossible. It didn't matter; you can play the game to its conclusion and even 'win' without going there. But I finally beat it for the first time tonight - with a little luck along the way to be sure, but also because after 40+ hours of play I eventually had a fair idea of what I was doing. That moment when I beat the final boss after systematically defeating each of his annoying lieutenants was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've had for a very long time.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, there are a few minor bugs (mainly missing or incorrect text in a few places), some things that could be better explained, and I'd like some of the randomness to be toned down a little.

I can't wait for new expedition maps to be released, however even without them I feel as though there's still a lot to do.

Different teams with different skills and approaches means many encoutners and events will play out differently in multiple playthroughs.  And I don't mean easier versus harder.  I mean the difference of storming an abbey full of gun-toting nuns to having a charm off with them.  This all leads to quirky humor which is all good and fun.\n\n* That said, I am a bit disappointed in the amount of content.  I know there is a lot of content in that encounters and events are actually just one of many possible events because each event has to be coded differently depending on initial mood etc.  However, I felt my expectations were set high since there was three different tutorial islands, but after that the areas are the same.  I really expected maybe two of three possible expeditions opening for each star level.  I guess that is what expansions are for.\n\n* There has been a lot of comparison to FTL, but it is not as hard or as unforgiving as FTL.  You are not forced to press on to harder expeditions because you can win the game (2000 pts) by just doing lower level expeditions.  However, there really should be a scoreboard to track your points to keep you going after those high-point high-risk options.\n\n* There are a few bugs still. Nothing game breaking, just immersion breaking.\n\n* Different shops unlock after each expedition.  However, they are rewarded in a counter intuitive way and have the same things every play through.  I really wish there was more randomized variety in the gold/item shops versus knowing where the machete is every play through. \n\n* Boss battles can also be too rough because of endlessly spawning minions, but in gereanl a coutner strategy of nuking the boss ASAP works.\n\nI might have harped on some of the weaknesses of this game, but in reality when you put it all together it is still a great game and lots of fun.  Even though each play through is only 5 expeditions, you do learn about your crew and random events can even lead to character development.  Character development in the story sense not in the game stats sense.  Even though I have dinged the game on lack of content, I am still surprised by what situations my crew will find themselves in.  \n\nIn reality, my critique is really picking the wings off a beautiful butterfly.

The game inexplicably adopts the neo-Roguelike model that has been popular since FTL, where each `playthrough' is short, brutal, and random. After a few hours, you'll have found a handful of artifacts, leveled your characters around max level, and (most likely) died at the hands of a sudden difficulty spike or a series of bad rolls.

A playthrough in RE consists of your team embarking on 5 expeditions, upgrading your team, and gathering renown to beat your rival, the French clown, Rivaleux.\n\nI\u2019ve played the tutorial twice, and in my second playthrough we were defeated during the final mission. I would expect a playthrough to be between 3 - 5 hours, but this game can be replayed due to randomised encounters and a large variety of ways to adapt your team.\n\n[h1]Flow of the game[/h1]\n\nA game starts with you picking your team of three characters. Each character has unique skills, traits, abilities, stats. I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to the numbers, but I now understand the implications of skills from playing the game, so would spend more time creating a team that suits my tastes. The great thing the game does is recommend crew members from a given character. There are 20 characters to pick from.\n\nCharacters will affect how well suited the entire crew is for different attitudes, so it is worth explaining the mood system the game uses.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Mood and Spirit System[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]The game represents character\u2019s (both friend and foe) health as spirit which symbolises both physical and mental health. When dealing with an encounter, you can defeat an enemy\u2019s spirit by being so friendly that they wish to stop fighting you, or by being devious and upsetting them (essentially destroying their soul), or by standard physical aggressive attacks.\n\nEach character also has an attitude which describes the state of the character. For example, an enemy character might encourage me with a friendly attack that hurts my spirit, but increases my mood to be confident, which gives me a bonus so my next aggressive attack will do 25% more damage.\n\nEach team also has a attitude describing the team\u2019s approach, and can be handled using the rock-paper-scissors approach to exploit weaknesses.\n\nOn top of this (and my favourite feature) is the mood system which describes the battlefield based off you and your enemies actions. The mood changes after one or more strikes from the same attitude reach a certain threshold. Friendly moods are generally more fragile to maintain than devious or aggressive ones. Moods may empower your team, or weaken you.\n\nFor example, if everyone is friendly to each other, you may enter the \u2018Pleasant\u2019 mood.\n\nIn this mood, it gives a major boost to physical attacks but only takes one aggressive attack to turn the mood to \u2018Brutal\u2019 (if you imagine a group of people encouraging one another and then someone throwing a punch, it would be brutal!). There are about 9 moods in the game, depending on the attitudes of the two teams.\n\nI have found the mood system to be fresh and surprising deep when dealing with encounters, and I\u2019m now finding more creative ways to deal with certain characters.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nWhen you have selected your team you are sent to your first expedition on an island which serves as a tutorial. The tutorial does a great job at covering everything, and is about 30 minutes long (each expedition is generally longer due to the rising difficulty).\n\nYour team has two major resources, resolve and supplies. Run out of supplies and your team with have major issues. Run out of resolve and you lose the game!\n\nYou move around the island, much like a board game, and each \u2018stop\u2019 on the map may have different outcomes.\n[list]\n    [*]You may find some resources\n    [*]You may need to pick a team member to handle a situation (think [b]events in FTL[/b]). Each character\u2019s chances are shown for success, and the game does a great job of explaining the breakdown of the chance, plus all the possible outcomes. A dice is rolled for the outcome based off the chances.\n    [*]You may have an encounter (which is their term for a battle).\n[/list]\n\nEncounters are playing on a grid battlefield (think [b]XCOM[/b]) using a variety of skills (each character has an skill for each mood to begin with). Each battle has a dominant attitude (based off the number of attacks you used of each type) which may give you greater rewards or change the way an encounter plays out. For example, if you were dealing with some aggressive locals, being friendly with them might encourage them to spread the word about you afterwards.\n\nAs you move around the map you gather tokens that are cashed in for certain resources after the mission. There are also extra special tokens which give bigger bonuses. These resources are:\n[list]\n[*]Gold - Which is used to buy items in shops.\n[*]Status (reputation) - Which is used to acquire an Entourage, which can give your team bonuses (like more resources from tokens). Also used to upgrade shops.\n[*]Research - Used to unlock technologies (similar approach is the Policy tree in Civilization V).\n[*]Insight - Used to get more of the above resources.\n[/list]\n\nAfter completing an expedition, you are returned to the world map where you can spend your resources, upgrade your crew, and gain your bearings for the next expedition. Different stores are available to spend your resources, and new stores are added depending on which expeditions are taken.\n\nThere are still a few other mechanics (like character leveling) but I believe this highlights all major features of the game. \n\n[h1]Why I enjoy this game[/h1]\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game, here are a collection of my thoughts on why:\n\n- The game is very satisfying, as you built up your massive collection of tokens on your expedition to cash in later. It helps you feel like you have achieved something on your quest.\n- The game universe is fun and creative (think Indiana Jones + Tintin).\n- Beautiful artwork for a very diverse set of characters and locations.\n- Nice music to set the scene.\n- It seems impossible to unlock everything in one playthrough. For example, I only unlocked 8 out of 36 possible research items, so there are many strategies to try.\n- Variety of expedition locations to take, with it\u2019s events being procedurally generated. You probably could visit all the locations in 2 - 3 playthroughs, but it\u2019s nice to see it\u2019s not the same places every time.\n- Game can be played with save/load states, or in ironman mode where all decisions are final.\n- Game has great help/reference guide.\n\n[h1]Things that may be disappointing[/h1]\n\n- It can be frustrating if all your random rolls fail (but there are upgrades to help this).\n- Mood system can take a while to figure out (but it's worth it).\n- Each location is essentially the same if you strip away it\u2019s character. Though I do feel like that character is enough to make each location interesting and different (think how in FTL that sectors were different types, and while they were basically the same it does still influence your decisions and the situations you encounter there).\n- Some simple UI features missing, like end turn once all characters have taken their actions.\n- A playthrough can be quite short at 3 - 5 hours.\n\n[h1]Overall impressions[/h1]\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with Renowned Explorers. It has been great fun to play, and surprising with how easy it was to get into, but also contain a lot of depth at the same time. Also it is great value for it\u2019s release price if the game interests you. A solid 4 out of 5 stars from me (possibly 4 \u00bd with more playtime and UI fixes).\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, you can tweet me on Twitter at @JackAttackNZ", "timestamp_created": 1441746014, "timestamp_updated": 1441747460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17946957": {"recommendationid": "17946957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014917105", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452902325}, "language": "english", "review": "Mix some elements from FTL, XCOM and Crusader Kings together and the result is this great game. The graphics don't do justice as it makes the game look like a Flash game from ten years ago. Also the music is horrible. But these are the only complains I have. There's quite a steep learning curve and some unique game mechanics present. You collect tokens which will be traded for resources in between missions. Your character traits will help you solve difficult situations by granting a higher change to succeed on the RNG wheel. 'Battles' can actually be won not just by mere violence but also by acting either friendly or devious. And the 'explorer theme' suits the game well.

with \"let's try it out, if it isn't ok, I got steam refunding\". I am happy I did, since I got a full weekend of hardcore exploring out of it. ^^\n\nAt first it was all fun and exciting, because of the [b][i] cute representation [/i][/b].\nThe graphics in comic look are just lovely, having very authentic animations for your characters and the enemies alike. You got a very diverse set of explorers to choose from, and often their personality also matters. Even the headshot pictures react to the moods characters get during the battles, and many of them were very amusing.\n\n[b][i]Moods[/i][/b] in battle? Yes, you read it well. The game has an authentic mix of simplicity and complexity, taking a basic stone-paper-scissors gameplay, and adding a lot of complexity to it by introducing battlefield moods. If you are peaceful, you will get a large bonus against devious opponents, while aggressive opponents will give you trouble. Those opponents however will have problems, if your party decides to react devious!\nDuring the battles, you will be able to change the battlefield mood of your party with your actions, but be aware, some  enemies will do the same!\n\nThe [b][i]difficulty[/i][/b] in Renowned Explorers is one of the most polarizing things in the discussion boards these days.\nI consider myself very happy with the difficulty settings, as they gave a real feeling of excitedness to the overall game. You always have to consider carefully if you want to move on, even though you ran out of food and your expedition is starving. It might give you more ressources, but adds very negative conditions to your party members, which might do a big impact on the challenging bosses.\nThe bosses are challenging. You will have to understand the game mechanics and change the battlefield moods carefully, if you want to stand a chance. Sometimes you will want to avoid a mood alltogether, or will have to plan ahead to change the mood fast, if it happens to go bad. Also you will have to use the positive friendly buffs, and the negative (mostly) devious debuffs well. If you want to go with aggressive physical combat, you might want to enrage your enemies to take additional damage, and your party might want to become excited for an increase in attack power. If your enemies dish out too much physical damage, you will also find a mood to weaken them.\nChecking the discussion boards, it seems like the creators are working on an easy mode for those which do not enjoy these well made and challenging boss battles. But until then, you may expect some real try and error puzzle solving on how to get through all the expeditions. Moreso if you play the (Ironman) Adventuring mode.\n\nThe last [b][i]expedition[/i][/b] is hardly beatable, if you didn't master the game and take some really well equipped explorer party with good Synergy with you. But thats absolutely allright, since you are never forced to beat those missions, to win the game! Just consider it an added challenge!\nWhenever you finish a Journey, you will get two new journeys to choose from, which have added difficulty. So after beating the initial Rank 1 journey, you will get 2 more Rank 2 journeys to choose from, and so on.\nFor your first games, you might want to skip on the Rank 4 and 5 journeys though, and might want to go 1-2-2-3-3. It is possible to get a high enough score for the score victory with it. But if you tackle the rank 4 journeys, you might want to expect a tough challenge, with the rank 5 journey checking your mastery of the game.\n\nIf you aren't battling, you are exploring semi-random journey maps, while trying to conserve your food, to get as many of the 3 [b][i]ressources[/i][/b] science, fame and wealth as possible. You might also find some treasure for additional game effects and to increase your Renown, basicaly your score. To win the game, you will want to gather a Renown of at least 2000, but the real challenge is to get the biggest Highscore and find the best hidden Treasures.\nYou also got the two secondary Ressources Insight and Resolve, where Insight is tradeable for more basic ressources in various ways during the game and Resolve basicaly resembles your life count.\nWhile collecting these ressources, you deal with well written and often funny [b][i] story situations [/i][/b], in which you decide to alter the outcome or if you want to take a risk, using the \"adventure wheel\". Basicaly it's a represantation of the dice rolls for your percentualy based chances on event outcomes. How much percent you got to get a certain result is based on which Adventurers you picked, and which perks you make avaiable for them.\nSo, will your risk one Resolve, to take a chance for some additional ressources at 63%?\nThe game is full of such decisions, and sometimes mean situations you might want to be prepared for or avoid, as you grow to know the game. But it's what creates a lot of the charm and replayability!\n\nThe game rewards getting to know it better, it rewards dealing with difficult situations, it rewards careful decisions ... it rewards [b][i]Exploring[/i][/b]!\nNot by throwing increasing amounts of goodies at you, but by making the experience authentic.", "timestamp_created": 1441718929, "timestamp_updated": 1441719414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17939388": {"recommendationid": "17939388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048549540", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467234720}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful idea, and wonderful mechanics.

Originally, I lfelt like it wasn't a full game yet. There are still somethings I'd like to see fixed, but most of what bothred me about the game initially is fixed, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nI'd still love to see an option to have it auto-end a turn when you have no more possible actions. Not only does this feel like a time waster, when you realize you need to hit the end turn button, or when you hit it, but because the mood of the battle changed, it didn\u2019t read the input and you have to hit it again, but everyone and then you think you\u2019re done and you skip over someone who still could have acted a moment to late. \n\nThe latter hasn\u2019t happened to me often, but there are some issues in how the encounters are drawn that can lead to it. First off, everyone and then I\u2019ve lost a character behind a bush or a tree, this is especially bad if the character has been knocked out, and you are trying to find them to revive them, but there is a blurriness to encounters that sometimes makes it hard to tell on the characters that don\u2019t have vibrant colors if they have acted or not.\n\nThere are a few other interface issues that also make the game frustrating. The arrow that shows you when your character has leveled up isn\u2019t that noticeable, especially with all the other buffs and debuts that sometimes show near the portrait. If you don\u2019t notice before you move to a new location, you can no longer level the character until after that encounter. Also, I was almost 20 hours into the game before I noticed the very subtile tool icon, that allows you to use tools to help your chances on skill tests.\n\nIt would also be nice if you got to carry over something from a previous game. As it is, you do unlock the option to make more and more of the characters \u2018Captains\u2019 which give you various bonuses,  but you get nothing for doing better on one game than another. If you could maybe choose one treasure to carry over with you, that would be great. Especially since the treasures are slightly randomized, and so sometimes you get a treasure that would benefit a Tactician, but if you didn\u2019t create your crew with one, you can never take advantage of it. It would be lots of fun if you got a treasure that your current crew couldn\u2019t use, but you could keep, and then design your next crew around it. \n\nBut aside from those nitpicks it\u2019s a lot of fun. The characters are great. You have 20 to choose from, and they are extremely diverse. The characters come from all over the world and they each have a flavor to them that makes them exciting. They all feel like they really do have personalities, and in fact, in certain encounters you will suddenly discover that one of your crew has a \u2018hidden\u2019 characteristic like being vain or a glutton, that changes your options. \n\nThe battle, or encounter animations are great. I love that two out of the three play styles are based around talking not fighting, and they\u2019ve put some real thought into it. It\u2019s more complex than a simple rock paper scissors mechanic. For instance if both sides in a battle are friendly, there is a huge bonus to being the first to physically attack. However, actual attacks swing the encounter radically towards the aggressive side, and if you had been hoping for a friendly resolution, you\u2019re going to have to do a lot of work to make up for whoever did the attack. That means that if you\u2019re trying to play friendly, it\u2019s beneficial to keep playing friendly. However, more aggressive groups can sometimes get a one time big bonus by pretending to be friendly and then attacking.", "timestamp_created": 1441643474, "timestamp_updated": 1456032898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17929365": {"recommendationid": "17929365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009609537", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499702504}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let the cartoonish presentation fool you-- this game is very challenging.\n\nThe good:\n1) Selection of explorers to complement each other.\n2) The absurbity of fighting sheep, ghost and cultists\n3) Balancing of emotions to pull off victories\n\nWhile I love the 19th century theme and the humour, I found the scaling of difficulty very steep.

I've always been interested in all the Indiana Jones, old mythos, and 19th century history, so this, naturally was an easy fit. But seriously, the game would be great without it. You get pretty attached to the characters you choose and in a lot of ways it feels like old world XCOM  - and yet completely refreshing.\n\nThere are two legit cons you hear more than anything else:\n\n1) The game is too difficult\n2) It should be longer\n\nPersonally I think the first one is a little dumb. Yes, there is RNG, but there is also, again, brutal RNG in XCOM, and it's no more crazy than that. I feel like the problem with the RNG is that too many people think that this game is like FTL, when it's really more like XCOM. The RNG isn't in the encounter, it's in the success. If your soldier misses a 85% shot on a mutalisk, he will probably, brutally die, I think the adventure wheel is in the same vein. Even more than the combat, which again, feels very XCOM. I read Abbey Games saying that they were implementing a difficulty feature, which will probably help.\n\nThe second complaint I wholeheartedly agree with. I would love this game with more goofy characters (or maybe an option to make and name your own character?), more areas to explore, longer quests, more treasure, more leveling up and all of that. I don't know how feasible it is, but maybe even open the game to modders in the future, because the template is all there, I would just love more. \n\nBut overall the answer is, yes! You should absolutely purchase this game. It's very fun, it's got a lot to offer, and from what I've read, it sounds like Abbey is planning on adding more to the game over time. If you're a little hesistant now, I understand - but at least put it on your wishlist.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1441594351, "timestamp_updated": 1441594351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17921798": {"recommendationid": "17921798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047954782", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 6932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503763227}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit 3: They have made SO MANY improvements for this game that basically every minor complaint I had with it is now irrelevant.  There are more places to explore, tech is now no longer based on your team build, there are more events in locations and more interesting decisions to be made there along with tons of balancing patches.  You heard right BALANCE PATCHES IN A SINGLEPLAYER GAME to improve the play experience.  The Dev team is fan-freaking-tastic.  If you like rogue-likes, buy it, if you like turn based strategy, buy it, if you like adventure games buy it!  The only feature that might put people off is the learning curve.  You really do need to figure out the strategy elements in this game, which are a little weird at first, but after that the difficulty settings let you make this anything from hardcore score-attack to casual lunch-breaker game.  It's really flexible that way.\n\nThis game is great.  It has an awesome choose-your-own adventure style and a lot of replayability.  The mood and combat system is a bit confusing at first but it's not too hard to learn and it really makes things interesting.  There's a big FTL or Binding of Isaac kind of feel where it's a short experience that can turn out in different ways.  My only problem is that is simply doesn't have the unpredictability that those games do.  There are 10 different levels, 5 of which you explore in each playthrough, with their own strategies and secrets which are randomly placed on the map, but always present and always the same.  The characters abilities are slightly customizable over the course of the game but not a ton, this isn't much of a problem though as each 30 minute playthrough will use 3 out of the 20 characters.  However besides character selection there's little deviation between playthroughs.  In FTL or BoI finding the right weapon at the right time can swap your whole strategy, not so much here.  Your strategy is set by the characters and missions you chose, there's no evolution.  It may sound like I dislike the game here with this rant but really it's just that I love it so much and I see so clearly what it could be with more levels and more evolution.  If this gets steam workshop support or an expansion it could easily match the hundreds of hours Xcom, Isaac and FTL have gotten from me.  As it is now it's about 10-20 hours of great content, which was worth it to me but I can understand wanting more for your money.\n\nEdit: Based on their latest patch I am now completely sold on this game.  Abbey has demonstrated that they are interested in making their game better on a consistent basis and ensuring it doesn't turn into a stagnant, formulaic experience despite being singleplayer.  This is more than I can say for Binding of Isaac and FTL, who recieved only spotty support from developers.  This pushes me from 7/10 to 9/10.  If they release a few more levels I'll send it straight to 11/10.\n\nEdit 2: Well they released a new map.  I can think of no reason whatsoever not to recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy.  My minor complaints and nitpicks have been blown into a fine red mist by the rocket launcher of amazing that Abbey is wielding.  They comboed their Impress with some follow up excite attacks and now I have become excited about their cause and stopped resisting.  I rate this game 11/10.  What are you waiting for?

It turns out that there isn't much going for the combat other than a rock-paper-scissors sort of thing with three attack types. Of course, the game suggests building your team around one or two types, so you're going into a RPS contest without one of those choices. Each character has a small number of attacks to choose from, and they were mostly the same between the characters I tried. If there's some way to switch team members between expeditions, I didn't find it.\n\nBetween combats, the game has a dull board game feel, like playing Monopoly. Sometimes you roll on a wheel to see if something good or bad happens. There are different skills that influence this, but there's not much way to prepare for a particular type of area where different skills might apply, unless I missed that, too. I should note that the UI for this game is often confusing.\n\nAlso, there's some bug for unusual resolutions that makes the mouse cursor not line up with whatever position it's using for selecting buttons. I played this game on my TV, which obscures some of the edge of a standard resolution, so I clipped it a little in the video settings.

This title bring a variety of upgradeable or unlockable traits for the 20 some odd characters you can unlock and upgrade.

You can fight your way through enemies, insult them and hurt theuir feelings so they give up the will to resist you, or you can just tell them how great they are so they give you the treasures.

I really shouldn't be surprised...Reus was an incredibly deep game, so it's easy to see Abbey Games has chops.\n\nMy only real complaint so far is the same one I had about Reus...the mechanics can be a bit overwhelming and there isn't quite enough tutorial material to help you learn. That being said, once you put in a bit of time and figure everything out it's a ton of fun.

But thats a different review for a different Day.\n\nYou pick a team of three archeologists from a roster of 24 people in 4 classes (Fighter, Scientist, Scout and Talker (Diplomat)) with yiur captian being limited to only a few people, but you unlock more as you play Expeditions with them.\n\nThe story is simple - Make it Big! Be the most renown Explorer in the Renown Explorers Guild, but you only have 5 months (say: expeditions) to do so! \n\nthe gameplay is pretty simple - When you start an expedition you are dropped on a fixed map of knots, like in for example FTL. Travelling between nodes takes provisions of which you start with a limit, which you cant surpass with restocks. As you traverse the map towards your goal you will see that some Nodes have Markers \"There is Knowledge/Fame/Gold to be found here!\",\"There might be an encounter here!\", \"There might be a XXX Challenge here. A YYY would be helpful\". those nodes hold short events that will on success gain you some tokens or more information or on fail may cost you provisions, give your team debuffs or end up costing you Resolve (say: Lives). When you reach your destination, you will enter a bigger chain of events to ultimately resolve what you came for and finish the mission.\nUpon finishing any tokens you gained through events and battles will be converted into your 4 base resources: Fame, Knowledge, Money, Renown and a mission specific shop will open.\nOn the world map you can spend your resources as you wish - Knowledge to write thesises (say: give your team various buffs), Money to buy more and better equipment and Fame to either get better Items in Stores or to hire an enourage, that will boost the amount of resources you gain from tokens.\n\nRenown is your actal score, and you have to pass the renown of the Lists 1st to \"win\" the game.\n\nAs it was in Reus - the Graphics are beautiful, the characters and their animations are just gorgeous\nMusic and sound is nice to listen too and get you an an adventuring mood\nGameplaywise this game throws a few balls out there and manages to juggle them well. the combat system actually goes pretty deep with its Mood System - every character has Speech (say Magic) abilities that give certain buffs or debuffs (for example a flattered character will take more damage from Speech attacks while a confident character wil deal more physical damage) and based on the overall mood of your approach and the enemies approach (forceful, Devious or Friendly - yes, you can complement your enemies to \"death\") your team will get a global buff/debuff based on a rock-Paper-Scissors system. A Forceful approach against a peaceful enemy will leave you at an advantage while a devious enemy will have you gasping for air quickly\n\nI have a little beef with this game, since it is mostly luck based. the Skill checks require your explorers to have certain perks to better their odds, but most of the time you will be staring into 30 to 40% chances top if your perks dont match up well.\nThere also seem to be a few bugs still around, like a memory leak on long sessions or that a certainBosses healthbar was imprinted on every space he stopped.\nAlso if you dont immeadiately invest a few points into the first skill tree (thesises) you will find yourself short on supplies quickly. And if they run out you will get arandom until-the-end-of-the-exploration debuff that will stack and might cost your head.\nwith that the shortage of Resources might end up leaving you dry during the end if you splurge too much in the beginning.\n\nThe replayability is very high due to the many different possible combinations of teams.\n\nA Definite Must play for fans of Reus or the old Adventuring days in general", "timestamp_created": 1441480861, "timestamp_updated": 1441481175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17896995": {"recommendationid": "17896995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128354143", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441396417}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes.

And I have had tremendous fun with it. I have only played in the brutal \"no reload\" difficulty, and I have refused to reload, despite dying nearly constantly with every step up in difficulty. I can now succeed three star missions roughly 1/2 the time, and I have yet to succeed at the most difficult of the missions. As a result, my highest ranking after the missions so far is 3rd.\n\nSome players complain about the fact that enemy reinforcements \"appear randomly\", and that does make the game more difficult, but if you have played some seriously difficult tactical RPGs, this is nothing new to you. If you haven't, then you can count this among the difficult tactical RPGs. If there's a way to avoid a fight, even if it's just a 5% chance, you take it, because fighting is hard in almost all cases.\n\nThe best part of the game is assembling your team. You start with four possible Captains, and by recruiting other folks onto your team, you can unlock them as possible Captains, assuming you can make it past two missions alive. (The tutorial mission counts.) Speaking of the tutorial, this is a big negative for me. The game has no manual, and the tutorial is very incomplete. You can read up more on how things work as you go, but you'll be assembling your first team of explorers with absolutely no clue as to what anything writen means. If you play on the ironman difficulty, you will almost certainly lose on your first REAL mission, and winning the game will be nigh-on impossible.\n\nThat said, a full session takes maybe two hours, and the game is terribly fun.

Looks simplistic at first glance, but the combat mechanics are a little deeper. The rock-paper-scissors thing is nothing new, but its interesting to see how they interperet it as aggression-trickery-niceness (and sometimes funny. Attacked by wolves? Scaring them works pretty well, but its far funnier and just as effective to make them SAD They leave and state they just want to be alone. You couldve just killed the wolves, but no, you made them need THERAPY). True one has an advantage over the other, but they have effects based on whats actually being done, which in turn is affected by what party members you went with. The reward for each approach can be different as well, not just affecting the story but your loot tokens recieved. The buff/debuff based on your party's tactics can be helpful or annoying, but nonetheless can swing the battle either way. However it does mean you have to coordinate your team's tactics, since if you use a different tactic too much it will switch to that buff/debuff, but if you use a tactic that matches the current battle mood the counter resets, so it can be managed.\n\nBut every stat has tooltips if you hover over them and there are clearly displayed meters for the tactic switching, all the information you could want is on screen during battle and you're given percentages for success on non-combat choices. You'll probably still fail your first expedition, but it's pretty easy to find out why and there's loads more team combinations to try. \n\nChoices given to you in the story are relatively interesting, even if the results sometimes aren't *You impress the villagers.* \"Wow! You're so great!\" .....yeah it mustve taken them a whole day to write that exchange. On the other hand, some do give you a tough choice and interesting things to discover, if not an explanation as to why. Stole painting, painting makes my party member more devious, activating a debuff until the expedition is over, but I somehow wrest the painting away and sell it later for loot. Dunno why it happened, how I got the painting away from them or why we sold a mind-altering artifact with zero consequences, but whatever.\n\nSo there's some ups and downs, but most of it is pretty interesting. I was just gonna do one expedition to give the game a shot and according to Steam I've nearly played five hours. Several teambuilds and expeditions later and I'm still playing. Make of that what you will.\n\nI do wish the tactical elements came into play more or were better defined. Flank and Shank is a nice ability, too bad it's sometimes hard to tell who's being flanked at first because of the strange pentagonal spaces. I also wish some of the character's personalities showed up more in the decision results, but it seems to be the same for whatever role the person fufilled.\n\nI mean Molly the austrialian scout has it in her bio that she got in trouble for offending people with off-color language, it'd be a nice touch to add some sort of dialect based cursing. Or have other character's cut her off mid-sentence and force her to put loot tokens in the swear jar.

I don't like the random addition of new enemies especially right on top of you, I'd like to see an option to fail in the expedition and move on and I think there needs to be more expeditions to choose from...BUT, the sheer potential, humor and exploration parts are too good to pass up. \n\nTwo additional suggestions.

(2) an undo move option during encounters. \n\nMy original review is below the line.\n\n---------THE LINE--------\n\nThis is the hardest \"Not Recommended\" review I've ever written. Most of this game is fun and a real hoot but it's ruined by the final encounters durring each expedition and the limited number of expeditions.\n\nThe final encounters are just too random and they violate a pet peeve of mine. They randomly introduce additional enemies during the fight. This means that maneuver strategies don't work since new enemies can be dropped in right on top of you. The other problem is sometimes you'll find that your current crew just doesn't do well against the final encounter and there's no way to simply give up on the current expedition and move on to the next one.\n\nEven if you don't get to the top of the leader board seeing how well you can do with different crews would be fun.\n\nAnother problem is while the individual expeditions are generated each time there doesn't seem to be very many of them and that makes the gameplay, or at least the final encounters, become very repetitive very quickly. There just aren't that many expeditions to choose from so you're pretty much repeating the same ones game after game.\n\nGet rid of the random addition of new enemies or add the option to just run back to London with what you've earned so far and move on to the next expedition even if it means not getting to the top of the explorer board and add more expeditions to choose from and this game could be a classic.

Il est ici question de partir dans des contr\u00e9es inconnues et d'aller braver les dangers dans une \u00e9quipe de 3 qu'il conviendra de bien choisir en fonction de leurs capacit\u00e9s et de leurs aptitudes sur le terrain. Il existe 4 types d'aventuriers: les combattants, les \u00e9claireurs, les scientifiques et les portes paroles. Il faudra donc bien choisir parmi plusieurs h\u00e9ros dont un leader naturel qui est d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du jeu. Pour permettre d'avoir plus de leaders, il faudra jouer le m\u00eame personnage dans 3 aventures afin de pouvoir le choisir au d\u00e9but de la partie. Comme tout bon FTL qui se respecte, sachez que lorsque vos aventuriers seront morts, il faudra recommencer une nouvelle partie de 0. Le jeu nous propose malgr\u00e9 tout 2 niveaux de difficult\u00e9s qui permettront dans le plus permissif d'essayer \u00e0 nouveau un niveau apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 de vie \u00e0 tr\u00e9pas.\n\nLe principe du jeu est de se d\u00e9placer dans une carte al\u00e9atoire afin d'aller y d\u00e9couvrir des tr\u00e9sors et d'affronter des situations diverses et vari\u00e9s qui peuvent aller de rencontres avec les indig\u00e8nes o\u00f9 il faudra n\u00e9gocier ou faire des choix comme aller dans une mine ou soudoyer les mineurs pour faire le travail \u00e0 notre place. On dispose de 10 rations de nourriture que l'on utilisera \u00e0 chaque fois que l'on se d\u00e9place sur la carte ration par ration. Heureusement, le jeu nous indique ce qui nous attend sur chaque nodule ce qui nous permettra de faire des choix au moment d'avancer dans la carte. Si l'on a utilis\u00e9 toutes nos rations, on h\u00e9ritera d'un d\u00e9buff \u00e0 chaque fois que l'on se d\u00e9placera sur la carte. Il arrivera aussi assez souvent de devoir en d\u00e9coudre avec des adversaires comme des moutons, des indig\u00e8nes ou alors des autochtones moustachus dont le sens de l'humour n'est pas la principale qualit\u00e9. Certaines actions demanderont une comp\u00e9tence particuli\u00e8re qui ne sera disponible que chez certains personnages, sachez que le jeu nous montre le pourcentage de r\u00e9ussite de l'op\u00e9ration en fonction de notre personnage et de son \u00e9volution. On appr\u00e9ciera tout particuli\u00e8rement la mise en sc\u00e8ne de ces actions qui se d\u00e9roulent via une roue de la fortune ou de l'infortune. Si on tombe sur le bon segment de la roue, c'est gagn\u00e9. Sinon c'est une autre histoire et \u00e0 nous la honte et les quolibets.\n\nLes combats dans Renowned Explorers: International Society se d\u00e9roulent au tour par tour comme un XCOM par exemple. On se retrouve sur une carte o\u00f9 l'on est entour\u00e9 d'ennemis qui apparaitront au fur et \u00e0 mesure du combat \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers. Il faudra donc bien r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 ce que l'on fait en mati\u00e8re de priorit\u00e9 d'ennemis \u00e0 tuer car une fois que l'on tu\u00e9 le boss de la carte, on a gagn\u00e9. Il est possible de se d\u00e9placer d'un certain nombre de cases et ensuite d'effectuer une action qui peut \u00eatre offensive, d\u00e9fensive ou neutre. Certaines cases permettent de soigner automatiquement nos personnages pour peu que l'on s'y d\u00e9place. Les combats sont un des gros point fort du jeu car il y a de multiples fa\u00e7ons de s'y prendre, on peut y aller en mode commando en utilisant les comp\u00e9tences de couleur rouge ou en mode taunt qui consistera \u00e0 briser le mental de nos adversaire en se moquant de lui et en l'humiliant. On peut \u00e9galement user de diplomatie afin de rendre nos adversaires plus dociles et moins enclin \u00e0 nous mettre leur poing sur notre figure. Le jeu reprend le principe de Pierre-Papier-Ciseaux au niveau des combats, la force fera plus mal \u00e0 un adversaire pacifique par exemple. Le pacifisme sera plus fort que la raillerie qui sera elle-m\u00eame plus forte que la force pure.\n\nUne fois que l'on a atteint la carte avec le boss de l'aventure et que l'on a combattu avec succ\u00e8s, on h\u00e9ritera d'un tr\u00e9sor unique qui nous fera gagner de l'admiration. En fonction de nos actions dans l'aventure, on aura gagn\u00e9 des niveaux pour les 3 personnages, de l'argent ou de la connaissance qui vous permettront de d\u00e9bloquer de l'\u00e9quipement, du support et des comp\u00e9tences afin de rendre votre prochaine aventure plus facile. A vous donc d'explorer comme il se doit les niveaux afin de trouver ces ressources, sachez \u00e9galement qu'il n'est pas rare de tomber sur de la nourriture ce qui vous permettra de trouver des objectifs secondaires qui apporteront leurs lots de surprises que ce soit au niveau du sc\u00e9nario de l'aventure ou au niveau des r\u00e9compenses. L'objectif principal du jeu est de rabattre le caquet de notre nemesis Rivaleux, un autre aventurier qui ne manquera pas de nous mettre dans la panade \u00e0 la moindre occasion et de nous mettre des b\u00e2tons dans les roues. Pour ce faire, il suffit d'amasser plus de r\u00e9putation que lui et le d\u00e9passer dans la guilde des aventuriers. Plus facile \u00e0 dire qu'\u00e0 faire bien s\u00fbr!\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society est un jeu o\u00f9 il ne faut pas trop s'attacher \u00e0 ses \u00e9quipes de personnages car la d\u00e9faite arrive vite et sans crier gare. C'est aussi tout ce qui fait le charme et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du jeu, comptez environ 6-8 heures pour r\u00e9ussir votre premi\u00e8re aventure de fond en comble et bien plus encore par la suite si vous souhaitez tout voir et tout d\u00e9bloquer. Plus on a l'habitude de jouer et plus les parties iront vite ce qui nous permettra de d\u00e9bloquer des objets et autres tr\u00e9sors n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 notre progression globale dans le jeu. Il faudra compter 3-4 heures pour terminer vos prochaines aventures. La dur\u00e9e de vie est d'ailleurs remarquable car il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de choses \u00e0 voir et \u00e0 faire avant d'esp\u00e9rer tout d\u00e9bloquer que ce soit au niveau de achievements et des succ\u00e8s ingame. Une fois que l'on a accroch\u00e9 au principe, on ne l\u00e2che plus le jeu et on passe beaucoup de temps \u00e0 peaufiner son \u00e9quipe et \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 ce que l'on peut faire pour am\u00e9liorer notre prochain run.\n\nRenowned Explorers: International Society est tr\u00e8s joli \u00e0 regarder et \u00e0 \u00e9couter. Le jeu ne n\u00e9cessite pas un foudre de guerre pour tourner et il est compatible PC, Linux et MacOSX. Il est compatible avec le Steam Cloud ce qui est fort appr\u00e9ciable si l'on jour sur plusieurs ordinateurs comme c'est mon cas par exemple. Le jeu n'est pas trop gros en mati\u00e8re de place prise sur le disque dur et il se lance rapidement. La direction artistique est superbe avec des personnages expressifs et marrants \u00e0 jouer. L'humour est omnipr\u00e9sent au niveau des dialogues et des interactions avec les personnages et autres ennemis. Les cartes Steam mettent pas mal de temps \u00e0 tomber et elles valent assez cher pour le moment, pensez \u00e0 jouer assez rapidement si votre but est de les vendre et de rentabiliser au mieux votre achat!\n\nAu final, Renowned Explorers: International Society est un jeu vraiment attachant, il apporte un r\u00e9el plus au genre et il est fort agr\u00e9able \u00e0 regarder et \u00e0 jouer. Sa dur\u00e9e de vie est exemplaire ce qui rend le prix d'achat int\u00e9ressant en d\u00e9finitive. C'est un gros progr\u00e8s si on le compare \u00e0 Reus que ce soit au niveau du tutoriel, de la r\u00e9alisation et de la profondeur du contenu.

Renowned Explorers is a roguelike, clearly inspired by FTL. It has a similar \"decide where to go, solve text-based encounters, fight occassionaly\" structure, but it is so much better.

The crew members and the opponents they encounter are wonderfully designed, well-animated and also exceedingly funny.\n- Your crew (three explorers) have so much personality. IT is coveyed by art (how much personality can there be in a simply attack animation) and by their reactions in an encounter. Say, if you have a very greedy crew member, they may just refuse to leave a treasure, even if it is risky.\n- The plot is much more fun, at least for me - I really feel annoyance at our heroes' opponents.\n- The encounter/fighting system is really interesting. It occurs on a tactical, hex based map, with varying terrain (e.g., some terrain heals characters standing on it) and interesting mood system. Every ability you use influences the mood of your team, and so does every opponent's action. The interplay between your mood and the opponent's mood can strengthen you or weaken, and furthermore most bosses have interesting reactions to a type of ability. For example, a Big Important Nun gets into her Condemn the Heretics mode if you try to use Aggression on her.\n- You can play it in hardcore (here: adventure) mode, without retrying failed ancounters, or you can choose a casual approach, with free saving and retrying failed encounters. \n- Very varied content: every expedition our explorers can go on is different.\n- Very funny writing.\n- Cheerful and happy. Even when you loose, you laugh.\n\nAll in all, 10/10, great impulsive purchase, can I get an expansion or two?", "timestamp_created": 1441290132, "timestamp_updated": 1441290132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17862036": {"recommendationid": "17862036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195968330", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481937455}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game, with an inventive approach to combat, a jaunty and entertaining vibe, and a satisfying sense of progression.

My current game is more direct and is full of dashing gentlemen and fisticuffs.\n\nThis is absolutely amazing.  Yes, the overland map is a lot like FTL--random events that are influenced by your party skills.  Combat is your standard hex based tactics game (even though it's not really hex shaped, which is neat).  Physical attacks work like normal, but speech attacks are a major part of the game, and so is control of emotions and mood.  If your enemy is using devious speech attacks but you are being friendly (they all deplete Spirit just like physical attacks), then you get defense bonuses from being the good guys.  If both sides are friendly, then both sides get a bonus if they are the first ones to go to physical attacks, stuff like that.  Takes about an hour or two to really get used to it, but then it feels natural.\n\nThis game is pretty polished.  Not perfect, but it hits its mark pretty darn well.  Difficulty seems pretty well tuned, the first couple missions are easy but surviving to the end seems like a real challenge, much like FTL.  You can sit down for a couple hours and play a game or two and have them end in one sitting which is great, honestly...replayability seems high, and unlockables are present but a very minimal part of the experience.

You lead a crew through a series of locations, some of which are just text-based choices, some of which are fighting encounters, many of which give you the opportunity to gather resources that you can later spend on upgrades and items that improve your crew. The game puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Livingstone-like explorer, going through the ruins of ancient civilizations looking for plunder. It's very good in this way. The art style is incredibly cute and a great asset to the game. Not only are the twenty different characters you can take on an expedition instantly recognisable, the character portraits in-game change when you affect their emotions, which is a lot of fun (making sheep sad is especially rewarding). The music is good as well, never distracting from the game, always adding to it.\n\nA game like this, however, lives and dies with its events. Such games throw a lot of text at you, and it needs to be enjoyable. This, the game succeeds at. There are quite a number of cute little unique responses that make you want to replay the game to see how different characters would interact (for example, a pair of Hungarian lumberjacks gave me some extra goods because they were impressed by my moustache). As such, the game is quite good. It falters a bit in the combat, though. You can use three types of attacks (friendly, devious, and aggressive) to solve encounters, and they affect what you get out of the encounter, but they do tend to play out the same way in an encounter. You can do some nice tricks with it, but it doesn't feel as deep as in FtL. Another negative in the comparison with FtL is that you never really feel pressured. You use up your supplies to move through the map, but there aren't a lot of events that mess with you, so you can usually plan your entire expedition and proceed unrushed. The events do seem to have a lot more variation than in FtL, and the perks that you can unlock for your characters throughout the game make for extra interactions and unique responses to events.\n\nAll in all, Renowned Explorers is a very good game. It's enjoyable and its humour makes it very replayable. The humour, graphics, and sheer variety of events makes up for some of its shortcomings and makes it a game that I would be more likely to pick up again than FtL, where I have kind of already seen everything it has to offer. It could do, however, with some more depth in its combat system.\n\nUpdate: the More to Explore expansion has come out, and it has massively improved on many aspects of the game. A number of balance issues have been solved, the new expeditions showcase some of the best design the Abbey Games team has to offer, and by including new campfire stories, there is a new reason to keep coming back to this game and replaying it.

Und dann geht es erst so richtig los, denn es gibt verschiedene freizuschaltende Charaktere, verschiedene Skills, Techniken, Taktiken, Ressourcen/Loot uuuuund v\u00f6llig verschiedene Maps. Man hat hier keinen klassischen Start und Zielpunkt, sondern startet zu Spielbeginn eine neue Mission, bekommt dann eine der zig verschiedenen Maps und eine Mission auf der Map angezeigt. Wie und ob man allerdings den Weg an dieses jeweilige Ziel einschl\u00e4gt, ist die eigene Entscheidung. Auf den vielen unterschiedlichen Stationen bekommt man unterschiedliches Loot oder Errungenschaften, somit bekommen unsere Charaktere auch Erfahrungspunkte. Auch Kampfsequenzen sind vorhanden, welche rundenbasiert sind. Spiel ist ansprechend gestaltet und hat hohen Wiederspielwert.

Les environnements sont vari\u00e9s et la direction artistique est r\u00e9ussie.\n\n- Au niveau du gameplay, vous choisissez 3 personnages parmi les 20 propos\u00e9s, chacun ayant leurs propres caract\u00e9ristiques. Une fois ces pr\u00e9paratifs accomplis, vous devez parcourir le monde \u00e0 la recherche de ressources, tr\u00e9sors et autres merveilles, dans le but de devenir le meilleur aventurier.

I have played about 1.5 hour so far and enjoyed it a lot during this time. It is kept in nice lighthearted mood that will keep you smiling through most of a game. I enjoy tactical encounters a lot and the fact that i can resolve in different ways. It is no longer just a case of winning but winning in the way that will benefit our crew the most. \n\nGame keeps it short and composes of 5 expedition to finish one run. It is similar to FTL in that manner that it can be completed in one afternoon and then you go on pick a new crew and start new procedurally generated adventure. I think game has potential to give hours of fun. \n\nI also highly appreciate the tutorial in the game it teaches all the basics you need to know to complete first expedition. \n\nMy greatest concern is the price FTL legend that started it all is on sale for $ 9.99 and as much as I appreciate beautiful graphics of Renown explorers and more work put into the build I would prefer it to be slightly cheaper. For me it\u2019s still worth it but it\u2019s up to you to decide. \n\nI also have a video featuring first procedurally generated expedition in which I show the gameplay, talk about mechanics, and teach you how to play feel free to check it out and let me know what you think. If you have any questions hit me up here or on my channel I\u2019m happy to help.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSwvSjhTA2Y&list=PLCZleGQiTyuCuxTigfMgW_K2md93ufVtn&index=1\n", "timestamp_created": 1441198970, "timestamp_updated": 1441198970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759903", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1829, "total_negative": 129, "total_reviews": 1958}}

The personality and the motivation of the main character is well developed and rich, you can sympathise with her situation. Each of the other characters are cleverly put together and I loved getting to know each of them by playing through all the routes. The story is intriguing as you try to figure out what the secret behind each character is and why they act the way they do. During each route it slowly unravels with finally the last puzzle piece coming together once you have finished all the routes and watch the extra \"behind the story\" clip .\n\nOne thing that might be a bit frustrating in the clip is the stat building can seem repetitive, but don't let it fool you. Depending on where you are in the relationships the description of the activities changes. Keep an eye out for it, it is rewarding and adds to the feels ^_^\n\nThere are a few things in the game that was not obvious to me at the start:\n-Later in the game you can give gifts to the guys. You do this by clicking at the top of their interaction page\n-By exiting the flat during the week you can go buy things at the shops\n-You have an inventory which is your purse when you look at your stats page\n\nHope this helps", "timestamp_created": 1520315950, "timestamp_updated": 1520315950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40551860": {"recommendationid": "40551860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166654342", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519883741}, "language": "english", "review": "Dandelion - Wishes brought to you is such a good game.

It was almost like a time jump into seeing Cheritz's baby stages? You see commonalties of story telling style, game mechanics and aesthetic but MysMes definitely presents a more refined version of Cheritz as a developer. \n\nDandelion explores the theme of wishes, life decisions and consequences. I spent roughly 4-5 hours on each character route (clocked 31 hours by the time I achieved all good endings). \n\nPositives: \n* Characters were interesting and unique. Each character route had it's own spin on the game theme. \n* The heroine isn't a blank canvas (and her eyes are drawn in!). She's got her own story and each character route presents how her perspective changes based on the hero's influence. \n* Beautiful art (although a couple of CGs had slightly off character proportions) and the voice acting was well done. \n* Nice soundtrack. \n\nNegatives: \n* The stat raising aspects can become tedious. \n* Unpolished English translation. There are grammar and spelling errors in the translation which breaks you away from the immersion but nothing which stops you understanding from what's going on. \n* Endings can leave you feeling dissatisfied. In my case, this was evenmoreso after unlocking the \"bonus chapter\". This can be attributed to a lack of closure for the story lines. If you're used to the After Endings of MysMes, be warned!\n\nDespite some of my gripes with the game, it was enjoyable overall.

The characters/ love interests are funny and cute but they are still their own individuals. None is like the other so each path you take with each character feel new and interesting. The animal idea in my opinion is really interesting, and really cute which also adds another kind of dimention to the characters as the characteristics of the animals they portray says a lot about their character. \nThe main protagonist is also just like most of us is juggling work,school and also our personal lives. And we get to follow her as she both are put in a extremly weird situation, and also see her or maybe even choose for her what to do to battle the stress of everyday life and to make everything work (or not). The only downside with this game is that once you have chosen a story line ( which character to romance and so on) you need to strictly stay on that path and you need to make certain choices big or small to be able to get the good ending. Even the smallest wrong descision could give you the bad ending. That can make the game abit restrictive but also challenging ,and also another thing that makes you invest and get to know the romantic interests even more. Then the whole story is very instruiging. It easily makes you curious enough to play through all of the different paths you can take only so you can find out the mystery behind this whole story.

I thought it gave the game a unique twist  that I haven't seen before, and seeing how well Cheritz pulled off the unique playstyle of Mystic Messenger, I wanted to give this a try as well. \n\nHowever, the stat raising was way too simple and way too easy for me personally. Once you figure out the optimal places for each stat, raising them to the needed levels was a piece of cake. For the first runthrough, I chose Jiwoo and found the route to be ridiculously easy toward the end. For the second one, I decided to try Jisoo's route, because I had read that his was easily the most difficult because of the stat requirements and I wanted a bit of challenge. His route was equally simple though, and by mid-February, I had gotten the stats I needed to get by the end of May, so I just spent most of the time clicking through and not reading things because it was boring. I probably won't wind up playing the rest of the routes, because they're supposed to be even easier.\n\nIn addition: The characters were good, but not GREAT. There wasn't nearly enough depth to them for me to become personally attached to anyone (except maybe Jiwoo) and the two good endings I got seemed really lackluster. There are a few translation issues, nothing too absurd but definitely noticeable, and the main character has to be one of the most annoying main characters I have experienced in a VN in a very long time. Her character is very wishy washy and easily pushed around, which I do understand given her backstory, but after one playthrough it gets really old really fast. It made it difficult to get through the second playthrough even though I took almost a month break in between.\n\nOverall, there are too many flaws in this game for me to be able to recommend purchasing it, especially at full price. If you find it at 50% off or more, it might be worth it, but I would not pay anything more than $15 for it and if I could refund the game for even just $5, I would.", "timestamp_created": 1516261876, "timestamp_updated": 1516261876, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39361289": {"recommendationid": "39361289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357114415", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1521114805}, "language": "english", "review": "Seriously loved this game.

As predicted I was not a fan of the stat building.. at all. The progress seems to be made only with stat building and how fast and which stats you choose to build, not at all in choices made in dialogue or relationship decisions in the story. This makes the game seem more like a click fest and less like a strategic, wise deicion, personality based game. Stats aside, I enjoyed the story and as an animal lover I loved the idea that there were different kinds of animals to choose from as far as who's story to follow!\n\nI do have one major problem with this game and that's how it doesn't explain to you what you're supposed to do or how to do it. For example I started it up without reading about how to play the game or any tips since I didn't want spoilers and I never knew you were supposed to collect stamps and that stamp collecting was very important to get the good endings (same with gift giving. I never even knew that was a thing and I still can't figure out how to do it). I also had no idea how high or how important the stats were to the game (Meaning the beauty and art skills along with other skills). Because of that I spent most of my time in game earning money or hanging out with the characters (thinking building relationship with the characters was the most important thing since I thought the most important objective of the game was to WIN a character's heart!) and paying attention to whether or not I had JUST enough stats to please the chosen character; Because of that I got a bad ending, really fast and really easy. I thought this was unfair!\n\nAnother gripe, and the last but not least one, is that the bad ending I did get seemed completely unfair and it didn't make sense to me why it was a \"bad\" ending. The circumstances to me were very sweet and heart warming and I was very happy with them and touched.. then the words \"bad ending\" flashed in front of my face and I was like \"WTF how is that BAD!?\"\n\nWARNING Spoiler, stop reading here if you don't want to know what the ending was. Continue reading if you want more specific information:\n\nThe ending I got was where the black cat and my character just confessed their love for each other (Success!) AND then my character's best friend confessed HIS love for her in what I thought was a very sweet and touching way. THEN the game says bad ending. Nothing in the game was going bad for me! Nobody was mad at me, hating me, dumping me or dying.. everyone loved me, so why was it bad and why was that an ending? Nothing ended, things were beginning! It didn't make sense to me at all.\n\nI stopped playing at this point since this \"bad ending\" sort of ruined this path in the story for me, and on top of that I really wasn't enjoying the stat building.", "timestamp_created": 1515187914, "timestamp_updated": 1515187914, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38999051": {"recommendationid": "38999051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413223627", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516667735}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I think that this game is excellent, the music (Perfect for each moment, a deep music), the images (Precious colors and forms), the characters (That don't are stereotips), but about all the points, my favourite parts of the game are the system game and history original and funny, personally, I admir to Cheritz for their job, is like the teem always looking for better games, I began with Mystic Messenger and I love them, after that I bought Dandelion and, I am very surprised, is of the same way an excellent game, officially  in my top of best otome games, thanks for all the love in their jobs, I hope a great future for cheritz!.\n\n(Sorry if i have mistake spellings, It's not my native leguage).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPienso que es un juego excelente, adoro la m\u00fasica que es perfecta en todo sentido, los personajes que pueden ser graciosos pero tambi\u00e9n profundos y fuera de los estereotipos para un otome,  las preciosas im\u00e1genes llenas de color y con formas perfectas, pero sobre todos estos puntos, lo que m\u00e1s me gusta es el sistema de juego, original y que hace que no sea mon\u00f3tono eljugarlo, adem\u00e1s de que no es una t\u00edpica historia de la chica que se enamor\u00f3 y punto, tiene misterio y adoro al misterio, no cansa y es algo que pienso que caracteriza a todos los juegos de Cheritz, gracias por todo.\n\n\u00a1Mucha suerte Cheritz!", "timestamp_created": 1514954211, "timestamp_updated": 1515104934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38889942": {"recommendationid": "38889942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133957760", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516140190}, "language": "english", "review": "God tier game with masterful storyteling and great mystery.

The pay off you get compared to the time you spend clicking & stat building & quick saving is not enough. In my opinion there is hardly any pay off at all. Maybe it just feels this way because of how long it is between moments with the characters, but you barely even talk to them other than the little bits at home. & those little bits get repetitive very, very quickly. I realized after a few hours that I wasn't really having fun, & I wasn't really enjoying the stories of the routes either. It doesn't feel like there's any chemistry between the boys + Heejung, & when there is it feels forced which is unfortunate because this takes place over the course of a year, so it should feel more natural than other games. In games like these you want the player to feel invested, so that when good / bad / romantic - anything happens - the player will feel something. If a player isn't invested, they're not going to give a crap about what happens in a story or to a character. Which is why I'm surprised so many people loved this. I'm the type of person to easily get sucked into stories & care about it's environment & it's people, but during this I just felt like I was going through the motions, which NEVER happens to me. It was to the point that when I reached the endings I was like \"k next\".\nI didn't HATE the game, & it was well made (other than translation - typos galore. there was one place where something important was happening & it was spelled wrong & had :.}} after it... really takes you out of the environment which was already lacking). The voice acting was great, & music was okay, most of the drawings were really good. I can see there was effort but for me it just didn't add up unfortunately.\nI don't know, I liked Nameless & Mystic Messenger, but this really fell flat for me.

Plottwists are predictable, and anything you might assume to happen in a romance novel happens in this game. I might have adored this in the past, when I was infatuated with anime and romance and I was six years younger. Now, many years later, I've found that I'm not as easily entertained by a \"sexy anime boy.\" Therefore, if you do plan to buy this game, understand that the intended audience ranges between 12 to 17 years old; don't expect complexities and don't expect a different type of romance.\n\nThe heroine is incredibly dim-witted, despite her education. I understand that it's somewhat \"cute\" to have a rather naive protagonist, but this again falls under a rather boring cliche. Body language, atmospheric language, and just verbal language seem to be lost to her. It's a tiresome role to play in a romance, quite honestly.\n\nThere isn't much variety in dialogue. You usually only have one or two lines to choose from, and you can never escape your naive personality. \n\nThe stat bars are tedious and feel unnecessary. The activities themselves are designed to stretch out the story, but, at the same time, they do ground you in the reality of the heroine's position; she has work to do and other things to think about besides boys. Therefore, I suppose it's not too much of a critique. It has no great impact on the story, which is my only gripe.\n\nPraises:\n\nThe art style is easy on the eyes, elegant, and clean. Each romantic interest has his own aesthetic, and they differ in fashion and appearance to make for a variety of choices. From an artist's stance, I am, at the very least, envious. It makes for a gorgeous game.\n\nThe voice acting is phenomenal. Of course, I can't understand the language, but each voice has their own tenor and tone that perfectly fits their character. Even the protagonist has a sweet, honey-silk voice.\n\nThe stories last longer than I expected.

He wants to see her have some kind of emotion and becomes obsessed with meeting her face to face. So, he devises a game that will hopefully draw out those emotions and a wish that will allow them to meet. The five guys are characters from another realm (not earth) and have either cat or rabbit ears. Each one wants a wish fulfilled or start a new life. If they fail in winning her love, they stay in earth and lose memories of their wish or whatever caused them to want that wish and the MC. This is how the wizard grants wishes, by taking part of their memories, which gives him power. If the MC falls in love, the winner will return to their own world without warning, which causes her to want to make a wish so that they can see each other again. Thus, the wizard can meet the MC. This is pretty much the story. [/spoiler]\n\nPros:\n1. I guess the drawings are pretty good. Some of the characters look awkward (body proportion wise), but pretty good anyway.\n2. First MC I actually like from an otome game. She actually has a personality. \n3. Some of the idea concept is interesting. [spoiler] a sadistic wizard playing with people's emotions is always fun. Plus, there are high stakes from the guy characters in trying to win the game. [/spoiler]\n\nCons:\n1. The stat building is grueling, annoying, infuriating, and pointless in my opinion. Once you get the hang of it it is easy to do, but there is so damn much of it. It makes the game take forever just doing that part alone. \n2. One feature I LIKE from otome games is dialogue options which can make other characters react or change their personality towards the MC in different ways. THERE IS BARELY ANY!!!! In fact, your success depends on stat building and interacting with other characters in the flow of rigid and set dialogue which you have little if any influence upon. \n3. Due to those two above cons, combined, I feel as though there is really little story overall and rather misleading in fooling you that there is ample game play involved. Stat building is boring!\n4. There are some bugs in this game. I got all those dumb stamps for every character, but for some reason, even though finishing those routes and getting a good ending, those stamps disappeared and cannot unlock those boring bonus? extra feature drawings?\n5. I am not sure if I really like any of the characters to be honest. There are funny moments and boring moments. [spoiler] Actually, I think Jieun is my favorite route simply because he was the only one that could successfully challenge the wizard on any real level. It is more of a friendship route though with the idea that that could change once the youngest male character grows up. In my opinion Jieun's route should be played last. [/spoiler]\n6. Ending is abrupt. I know that could be a technique, but after all that terrible stat raising, little story in truth, I would expected a little more effort. Instead, my overall opinion is more like \"meh\" okay, well that passed the time. \n\nIf you like otome games and are bored waiting for more interesting ones to come out, sure. Now that I am finished I doubt I will play this game again.

This is a fantastic game. In fact, one of the couple of games that made me interested in getting a Steam account.\n\nThis was my first dating sim, and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. I love visual novels (even ones that are more novel than game, Zero...) and this just amazed me. The five boys felt really realistic (minus the bunny ears) and although - especially early game - it seemed like a lot of comic relief was going to be involved, they really got serious. I admit, some characters I was looking forwards more to than others (Jiwoo and Jihae if you're curious) but I really wasn't disappointed by any of the stories. Jiyeon gave a lot of entertainment to my gaming club when I brought this in and Jisoo and Jieun kept me entertained for a time when I was bedridden. And the one bad ending I have seen (the chicken ending) is just as amazing (though I think the others are going to be very different).\n\nBut I feel like I'm rambling. The game is great. The characters are great. The stories are fantastic, each one making me cry for one reason or another. Until I found the bonus for getting all the good endings, it had the villain I loved to hate the most. Still love him after it, I just don't hate him as much now.\n\nUpsides... Like I said, great characters and great stories. The art and music is fantastic (I'm legitamately considering picking up the OST) and there are nice bonuses if you're diligent with the game. Stamps are easy to collect (I got 45 and 50 for Jisoo and Jieun, once I found out how good eye drops are). You get really good rewards that I can't sing enough praise about. A fantastic experience.\n\nDownsides of this game... It's a little pricey and there are some translation errors... A couple of times characters are misnamed and there are some spelling and grammatical errors... But it's easy enough to figure out what they mean and its pretty charming, but some people might find it a little off-putting. Oh, and there's a hint something at one small point with Jisoo I wish I could have found out more about (don't want to spoil anything, but alcohol was involved).

The voice acting is quite good, the CGs are lovely, and the stories can be quite interesting. I can understand why people have been putting this game on their lists for what defines the VN genre.\n\nBut it's horrifically buggy. You need to play through all storylines in order to unlock the final short stpryline, but after I played two routes, the game erased all the progress I made on the first route. And because there's a lot of micromanagement required to successfully complete a character route, it's not something I want to go back and do a second time.\n\nMost of the 'day management' sim involves repeatedly quick-saving so as to fight against the RNG. I'd say a good 98% of my 28-hour playtime is just reloading the game over and over so that I wouldn't fail a task on a particular day. The game doesn't have a lot of polish, either. Fonts change randomly, music glitches out, and sometimes the whole game will just stutter to a halt. Not to mention that you have to have an internet connection to play this game, and the team is constantly apologizing for server maintenance issues.\n\nIt would be easier to overlook the flaws if not for the ridiculous price. There are VNs out there with way better polish that you can download for free, or at least a fraction of the price of this one.

I really wanted to love it, and I sank so much time into it so I can get the full story from all of the routes and the graphics that go with them. But the more I think about it, this game just wasn't all that fun and the story wasn't too great either. (Please don't think I hate this game either though, I just like to poke fun at it a little sometimes) \n\nIt's not a badly-made game for sure; the music is good, the art is beautiful, the voice acting is very well done, the English translation is solid, and the guys you get to date aren't too terrible. Unfortunately though, I think the place where this game is weakest is in its story and characters, which are the most important things in a visual novel. Every single character in this game ends up being shallow, bland, and forgettable --- some worse than others. I didn't feel particularly emotionally attached to any of them. Most of your interactions with them consist of...going out to places together once a week, giving them gifts, and watching some pre-set dialogue that mostly consists of small talk. That just seems like the shallowest way to develop characters and relationships in terms of a visual novel. There are also some routes where almost nothing at all happens, leading to a very empty experience overall. The romances aren't super well developed and you don't really spend much my time getting to know any of the characters. (Not helping is the fact that a lot of these guys' personalities are full of cliche tropes...I'm pretty sure Jihae's big character flaw was...being too pretty but thinking he was ugly??? which made sort of sense as a magical interdimensional rabbit but not as a human haha) I also personally didn't like the setup that [spoiler] the boys are forced to date you in some crazy game set up by a wizard so they can get their wishes granted. I just thought it made the whole dating thing even more forced than it already was and made a couple of the boys seem like selfish conniving assholes. [/spoiler] Plus most of the time, the guys that you aren't dating mostly get pushed to the side, which is weird because you all live in the same house! Keeping some friendly interactions with them or something would have been nice, because these dudes did have a lot of potential to be weird or funny. \n\nOther reviewers have pointed out that some of these relationships would be considered unhealthy or dysfunctional and that the heroine overall comes across as being too weak and passive, and I can certainly see where they're coming from. I know that there's a level of cultural differences and personal likes/dislikes at play here, I know that a game can be enjoyable regardless of whether or not the relationships portrayed are 100% perfectly healthy (I thought Magical Diary and Hatoful Boyfriend were super great for crying out loud)...But, I still just didn't care for it and I can see why others wouldn't either, so it's worth pointing it out at least. I personally just found the heroine to be a rather bland character, though she definitely has a sense of relatability to her.  Then there's also the fact that [spoiler] the heroine has to get amnesia at the end of a route in order for her to ever see the boy she dated again after he gets his WISH GRANTED FROM A CREEPY-ASS WIZARD WHOSE MAGIC WORKS OFF OF LOVE AND THEN HER DUDE GOES BACK TO HIS WEIRD RABBIT/CAT KINGDOM DIMENSION AGAIN AND JESUS GOD IT SOUNDS SO WEIRD AND DUMB WHEN I PUT IT LIKE THAT but yeah her decision to do so tends to be about as silly and frustrating as it sounds, [/spoiler] though at least Jieun's route (the young albino rabbit) didn't do that, so that was a nice change of pace. \nSo basically all of the routes are pretty much just angst, boredom, and frustration and not much else (which honestly could probably be fixed if the stat raising was toned down and the pacing wasn't so damned slow). I also didn't find the true ending to be anything special or compelling, just...weird? It was honestly sort of a letdown, like there wasn't really an overall story arc or anything that was worth completing all the routes for. [spoiler] Turns out the creepy wizard had the hots for you (i.e. the heroine) all along and bends time and space to be with you. And this after watching you do all the routes and exchanging ZERO actual dialogue with the heroine. What the hell? Just made me dislike him even more for having an extra layer of manipulative creep to his character. [/spoiler]\n\nI will admit though that Jiwoo's route (the blonde rabbit guy) was probably the most interesting/enjoyable since both he and the heroine get some character development and have a bit more natural interactions. Plus he has the added benefit of being hilarious. Jiwoo is the real true ending :P\n\nAnd of course, most of this game is stats management. The stats barely have an impact on the game, but they take up most of your time, so the game ends up feeling a lot like a chore. There's also the fact that it takes FOREVER for your regular ol' rabbits and cats to turn into dudes (Hell, I think their bonding with the heroine was more compelling when they WERE animals because of how much she brightened up and started to find joy and meaning in her sad and empty life through her pets, which is what many people do experience in real life). Even more frustrating is the fact that you have to start the game from the very beginning for each route if you want to unlock the character graphics, but at least you can start pressing the skip button then (I'm a filthy completionist lol)\n\nMy overall thoughts on Dandelion is that it's not a bad game, it's got its cute and heartwarming moments and its characters are decent, but it's not that great or fun of a game either. I honestly think this game way too overhyped; take away the art and the voice acting and you don't have much else left in this game that's worthwhile, especially for such a steep price tag (I understand why it's such a high price, obviously games take a lot of time, effort, and money to make, especially when there's gorgeous art, voice-acting, and multilingual translations, but the product still kinda felt like a waste of my time due to its overall shallow and boring content). By all means buy it if you're still interested, it's just that for me the game fell so short of the amazing and compelling game I thought it would be after hearing so many great things about it. It's got a lot of problems with pacing and bland characters. \n\nYou'd probably be better off just buying Cheritz's other game, Nameless, which still has the beautiful art and voice acting, but has a more compelling story and characters and basically avoids/remedies ALL of the pitfalls that I mentioned here for Dandelion.

I wanted to wait to post a review until I had completely finished it, which meant unlocking everything possible. Although it was a challenge at times, I finally did it so here are my thoughts. ^^\n\nDandelion isn't a perfect game but overall, I loved it quite a lot. It took me having to actually play and experience it to understand why others love it as well. Gamewise, it's pretty lengthy in which it takes course over the span of one year (in game) and there are a total of five possible guys to pursue, four of which have both good and bad paths. (The final one only has a good path.) Dandelion is a combination of a visual novel and dating sim so there is stat raising involved. Although some might find the stat raising to be annoying, I was fine with it since I've played quite a lot of games that have this feature. The cut scenes are enjoyable, some of them being funny while others being emotional. (I did find myself crying at certain points and I rarely do so in general.)\n\nI'm sure that everyone who has played this game has a favorite romanceable character and mine would have to be Jieun. Spoilers as to why but beware, you've been warned:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are any negative points, I'd have to say that this game could have been proofread better. Now I know that it's a translated game but I think that it certainly would have helped if the developers had hired a proofreader with proficient English skills to check over the script. I noticed typos, grammar errors, and weird punctuation at certain places. Of course, I'm nitpicking but still. Also, I would have loved for there to be Steam achievements but I do know that it can be difficult to implement them although I do hope that they can be added one day. ^^\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved Dandelion and I can understand all the praise it's gotten. As I've said, it's certainly not perfect and there's room for improvement but it's a great game and I'd highly recommend getting it for all the fans of VNs, dating sims, etc. XD", "timestamp_created": 1484983399, "timestamp_updated": 1484983399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29363815": {"recommendationid": "29363815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256888724", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520104082}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an emotional rollercoaster.

Without spoiling anything, I really didn't like them at all, and the game seemed to just end suddenly with them. It seemed unfinished, and really irked me considering how much time I had put into this game/the relationships involved. I've said my peace: I'm not a fan of it. There.\n\nBut as for the rest of the game itself, I found it mainly decent. The part I liked best was the skill-building mechanic, where you can choose to build up your skill level in multiple areas with one activity per day, and lower Stress and Pressure areas in order to stay healthy. I questioned whether Feminitity and Beauty were really the most important things she should be focusing on, but I didn't find anything really offensive about it either. The item collection mechanic that's secondary in it could use some work - going to the bookstore doesn't allow you to read any of the new books you purchase? That seems like it was meant to contribute to skill building at some point, but the developers didn't have time to finish it. \n\nThe characters, including our main, can be pretty one dimensional. Jisoo is the 'bad boy', Jihae is the pretty and shy older man, Jiyeon is the perpetual child, Jieun may be a literal child from how he looks and acts on first impression, and Jiwoo is the rich-boy a*hole. At least, that's all based on first impression, but the writers do try to develop them more depending on which relationship you pick. Some of the redeeming backstories work, while others seem out of place. Also, I didn't really like how Jisoo would often bully or try to intimidate Heejung if she didn't pick him, with pretty much every choice, and led to some awkward encounters. Even if it's in character for him, that made me uncomfortable and crosses the line from 'bad boy' to 'obsessive and abusive and borderline manipulative stalker who you should definitely stay the HELL away from'.\n\nHeejung is not a bad character, but at times it feels like she has no autonomy over her decisions. Her mother's abuse may have led to her crippling insecurity and this would explain this, but I'd really rather she grew to have more confidence in herself and not really let herself be led around by men or overwhelmingly shy around Jihae, for example. Again, it wasn't an offensive thing to me or stopped me from enjoying the game, but I'm kind of a bit sick of the insecure girl trope. It'd be fun to have a protagonist who's direct, has her own opinions and knows what she wants, but that's just my opinion.\n\nOverall, I really think the mechanics in this game hold up, but the long hours it takes to play, multiple character/writing problems, and the bad endings I know I'm gonna get even if I do everything right, really stop me from playing this all the time. I'd say it is a good sometimes-game, it's definitely good for a dating sim, and there are some cute moments with each of the characters.

I'd say this is more of a neutral recommendation rather than me screaming \"YES THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!\" There are some pros as well as many cons, so I think you should take everything into consideration over the type of gameplay you like if you're on the fence over buying this. Overall, I have mixed feelings about the game, but I liked it more than I disliked it. And I did enjoy the endings despite them hurting my heart. I just wanted to make note of that before you continue on reading this.\n\nAlright, so, this is the last Cheritz game I've played. Meaning, I started with MM and then Nameless before playing Dandelion. I LOVE Mystic Messenger, and Nameless was a great game as well! I highly enjoyed both of those. On that note, let me say, this game isn't bad; the story is interesting, but it is my least favorite from Cheritz. This was the first game that they made, so that's probably why, as I feel as though they improved more and more with each game. Having said that, I did enjoy the characters. There was a pretty good range of personality, although I found Jieun and Jihae to be the least interesting to me. Jiwoo was my favorite, being a typical tsundere-type character. His personality grows a bit, which happens to every character, and it's cool to see, even though you really do not get to spend a good amount of time with the characters and getting to know them up close. Your real interactions with the characters are few and far in between the stat grinding, which gets boring.\n\nThis game relies HEAVILY on stat grinding. Honestly, I was put off by that in the beginning... and my feelings didn't really change at all about it as I kept playing. I got used to it, yes, but I found the stat grinding aspect to be extremely tedious, and if you took that aspect away, the stories/cutscenes/interactions for each character would be extremely short. If you're put off by that, I wouldn't recommend you to get the game.\n\nThe heroine, Heejung, has her own name and voice, which is pretty cool. If you like to immerse yourself as the MC, then this isn't really for you. Heejung is actually pretty relatable, though. She's a college student who is extremely stressed out and has an immense amount of pressure put on her by her mother. She has a lot of past family troubles. I honestly felt bad for her, because dang her mother is a jerk! But these aspects of her life make her likable and relatable, and she's also pretty goofy sometimes too, which I enjoyed.\n\nThe overall story is pretty interesting. It's nothing extremely deep, and I wish we could have seen more with the special/real ending. I feel as though they had a great story idea in mind, but they didn't go as in depth with it as they could have. It has potential to be an amazing story, but it feels a bit lackluster.\n\nA lot of people say this is a good \"intro\" game to otome games, but I would say no. I do like it, it's not awful, but it gets boring and tedious. I highly enjoyed the moments where I actually did have interactions with the characters during cutscenes, though.\n\nSo, I'll just say this: for the price, I don't recommend the game. If you don't mind paying the price for the game, then I'd say buy it. Just don't expect some grand, in-depth plot with engaging gameplay and freedom of choice. It's not like that. Really, it's not terrible... I was immensely bored with stat grinding for each day that I played as Heejung, but looking forward to the cutscenes helped me to get through it. Even if you get as annoyed as me, I managed to get through it all and get all of the good ends, and I'm too much of a completionist to end it there and not finish the bad ends, so I'm still working on that! If you want a game that'll just make you feel, \"Meh, I'm bored and I got money to spend, so I'll play it,\" then by all means, go for it! If not, then you'd probably want to move along and try Cheritz's other games (if you haven't played them already!)", "timestamp_created": 1478140643, "timestamp_updated": 1478223909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26368283": {"recommendationid": "26368283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331438678", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478228724}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9~~~~\u559c\u6b61\u5287\u60c5\u6eff\u4e0d\u932f\u7684!!\n\u80fd\u8b93\u6211\u6709\u8010\u5fc3\u5730\u73a9\u5b8c\u5168\u90e8\n\u7b97\u662f\u5c0f\u54c1\u8150\u5973\u904a\u6232\nCG\u5716\u5df2\u8490\u96c6\u5b8c\u6210  \u552f\u4e00\u89ba\u5f97\u56f0\u96e3\u7684\u662f\u667a\u79c0\u7684\u6050\u6016\u60c5\u4eba\u8def\u7dda\n\u770b\u4e86\u653b\u7565\u73a9\u9084\u662f\u4e0d\u6210\u529f \u81ea\u5df1\u4e82\u8a66\u5f88\u591a\u6b21\u624d\u6210\u529f\u7684(\u597d\u50cf\u662f\u9b45\u529b\u8981\u5920\u9ad8!?)", "timestamp_created": 1478066775, "timestamp_updated": 1478066775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26239287": {"recommendationid": "26239287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121122809", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481596582}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game although, for what it is, I think its a little overpriced.

You can also choose to hang out with a particular love interest on the weekends and there are cut scenes that trigger based on date and level of affection with that person. \n\nIt's a solid setup of this type of game. But the interactions with the male characters feel pretty shallow and disjointed; and after a while they become really repetitive too. I can understand the male characters' motivations to a certain extent, and won't get into them for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but it feels like you're kind of forcing the protagonist into a relationship that never seems to pick up steam. It's like you're friends, and there's no romance, and then bam, suddenly you're supposed to be downright Shakespearean. \n\nThe ending I received was the only part where it finally felt engrossing, but it took hours of mostly boring repetitive gameplay to get there. I know repetition is the stock and trade of these types of stat building games, but you truck through them for the little rewards you get when you interact with a love interest or get a cut scene. The problem here is that those rewards did not feel...[i]rewarding[/i], so the stat building just ends up feeling like a slog. \n\nThe storyline I chose also suffered from the same type of borderline absuive relationship that makes Amnesia a dubious choice--as in, anyone can see this guy is actually a major chode and you'd tell your best friend to run screaming from him if she was dating him in real life. And yet you kind of have to force the kind, shy, unassuming heroine down that road to get anywhere in the story.\n\nAll in all, it was an okay diversion for a day, and you might consider picking it up if you have the money to spend and are just curious. But it's not something I'm interested in playing again, certainly not through all the routes-- which is a shame because there is an overarching plot that seems like the completionist playthrough could be really interesting.

As an otome developer I have played a regrettable and insane amount of these games and I went into this experience with apprehension to say the leasst... but honestly, as hard to believe as it is,  a game about cursed bunny and cat boys tops my list. \n\nThe writing was really great, the protagonist was so relatable and well written which is ABSURDLY rare, the characters were very multidimensional and surprisingly stereotype defying on more than one occasion. The story has a surprising amount of depth. All of the routes were enjoyable and surprising, even the one I liked the least (Jiyeun).\n\nHowever, this is a stat raising game. There is serious stat raising and it can get tedious at times, but is honestly worth it for the story. My major grieviance with the game as a whole is the DRM, purely because I personally have dodgy internet so it interfered with my experience. Usually not being able to play in offline mode is enough to make me not buy/play a game but Dandelion was a definite exception.\n\nFrom skeptic to Cheritz fangirl, I can do nothing but reccomend this game. And to play Jieun's route last for the most emotional impact. Consensus? If you're a dating sim/otome game fan, this Dandelion is a must play. Honestly even if you're a visual novel lover it's worth a play, although I doubt it will convert anyone who doesn't like the medium.

If you mess up once, and don't quick save or save in general, you have to start all over. (Wow, they should really have a tutorial or something to mention about this in the game!! I didn't think there were any \"bad endings\") You have to hear the intro music and your MC talking again and again and again. It took me DAYS to get the \"bunnies\" and \"cats\" into humans. I finally did it with Jiyeon just now, but I really wanted Jisoo. And I got a bad ending. Again. With not even the main characters, but her school friend?? Why is he a bad ending? He should not be a part of the whole story.\n\nAnother thing that makes me frustrated with this game is that we should have the option, once they turn into humans, it doesn't matter who you talked/played with when they were an animal, you should still be able to romanticize/interact with the others. I  just wanted to get to the point where they were finally HUMANS and when I did, they were all angry at me because apparently I spent a lot of time with Jiyeon, even though I talked A LOT to Jisoo? \n\nI also think the MC burns a lot of stress and you are forced to study and nap a lot. That gives me NO time to see the animals and manage to get them happy and into humans. \n\nDo not recommend this game at all.

The depth of the story was impeccable, I was totally immersed as the game progressed. The art is beautiful, but not my taste. The male characters are shallow, and the main character has no presence. She may have a different personality from other heroines as she doesn't start with amnesia or the like, but her obsession got old. Their \"love\" was not exactly present, as they don't really get to know each other. The translation is far from what I could do, but sloppy as there are plenty of mistakes. The game requires an internet connection. I have much larger games on steam that I can play in offline mode, yet this game needs an internet connection for cutscenes. My game is extremely buggy as the sound glitched every 5 minutes and it never completely exits out of the game. The reason why I've clocked so many hours on this game is because it never fully exits until I restart my whole computer, exiting steam is not enough to shut the game down. Some music choices don't exactly match with the game, this isn't a huge deal, but a good soundtrack makes a tremendous difference. The skill levels take a lot of grinding, and I spent a few weeks without needing to level up anything. Although I was happily surprised to interact with the game unique from other visual novels, it takes away from the player getting to know the character, and expressing the player's individual personality. The only real times you as the player get to pick responses is on dates. I really enjoyed my time playing this game, and I look forward to finishing it completely. But I can't recommend the game. The story was completely unique and refreshing as I love the premise of the story, but it fell short of my expectations.

Thankfully Dandelion does have a demo available on Cheritz's website and here on Steam plus plenty of player videos on YouTube. I only recommend watching (part of) a play-through if you don't mind having the story development spoiled a bit.\n\nWhat sets this apart from so many other otome games for me is the main (really the only) female character. There was a lot of thought put into her character which I really appreciate. Unlike 99.9% of protagonists in other otome she isn't flat, transparent, nor more or less non existent. Any weakness or flaws she has are clearly explained/have a very clear reason for being. She's completely relatable (at least for me) and very likable... most of the time. Even if you find yourself being disgusted by her actions you are still experiencing a well fleshed out character not some cookie cutter archetype who's only actual purpose is to give narrative to a nearly non-existent storyline and when she actually does speak it's nearly always things like \u201cUuugh!\u201d \u201cUm...\u201d \u201cYes\u201d \u201cNo\u201d and \u201c......\u201d if that last one even counts as speaking. The male characters are well thought out as well. They each have though own unique stories and requirements for a bad or happy ending. While there are a few fixed events none of the routes felt like a copy of the other. Unlike your typical visual novel you have more to do than just pick the answer that gets you (the most) relationship points with the guy you're pursuing. Though I must admit keeping up the MC's maintenance can feel a little pointless toward the end of the game especially if you aren't playing natural aka attacking the save and reload buttons like crazy to ensure you get the best reaction from the characters as possible. I think for people that play though without crushing the save and reload buttons the time between certain events would be adequate in order to ensure everything is on point for a happy ending.\n\nThe art was alright but nothing special. Sometimes it's really good and others it looks rushed. The images during game play are a mix between realistic portions and miniaturization which I found kind of cute. Mechanics wise the game worked just fine. I didn't notice any weirdness going on. The only issue that I think many might run into that isn't really addressed or admitted to as one is when you try to start a new route from a previous save. Most don't want to spend time going through the prologue five times over so they make a save file to skip over all that and start earning relationship points with the \u201canimal\u201d who's route they want to get. But, if you do this the game will probably ignore any stamps you collect making all the time you spent trying to get them null. If you want the stamps to count just sacrifice the 3-5mins it'll take to skip through the intro scenes. This is every so slightly annoying but not really a big deal (unless you've just completed a route only to find none of the 60+ stamps you collected registered). Speaking of the skip feature unlike most games in this genre I've tried the skip button actually works/you don't have to hold it down for it to work. One click and everything fast forwards, although it would be better if it just skipped entirely, but I'm happy with how it functions. \n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the game and recommend it to everyone who likes a good story I couldn't help being slightly annoyed by the number of grammatical errors. Some of them were borderline story breaking; prime example being the characters were consistently confused with each other. The second most common is repeating lines. The second most common is repeating lines. (See what I did there? :)) You're left wondering if the character said something relevant to the story or scenario taking place and mostly just why the heck are the there so many repeated lines? While the number of grammatical errors is moderate they occur far too frequently for a professionally done game. This is especially atrocious since it's been a good number of years since the game's release/more than enough time for the developer(s) to go back in and correct these things with a patch. When they transferred the game to Steam they di ddo some updating but it was mostly slight cosmetic changes/nothing that really improved the game. There are other minor errors in the game; you might see some script code a couple times for example, but that pales by leaps in bounds compared to the spelling and grammatical errors. [spoiler] One very good example of that is with Jiyeon who tends say things wrong a lot. With consistent grammatical errors already occurring, until it's pointed out you will likely just see that quirk as part of the overall lack of care in quality control.[/spoiler] Again, while you are not utterly bombarded with errors and can follow the story pretty well for a game that is centered around text, particularly for those that are not fluently in Korean, the rate at which they occur is still very deplorable. Perhaps if this was a beta it'd be okay, but this is the finished product and has been sitting like this for years with not patch to correct any of it. \n\nOerall I found it to be probably the best compared to the currently available otome games despite obvious flaws. Although the voice acting is Korean only I think the actors did a pretty good job conveying the characters. The bonus material for completing the game is pretty interesting too. I'd be thrilled if this was made into an animation, manwha, and/or novel. If I got wind of it becoming available in English (with the assumption much better job would be done grammar wise etc.) it'd definitely be on my pre-order list. \n", "timestamp_created": 1466000480, "timestamp_updated": 1466000480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23509266": {"recommendationid": "23509266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175513939", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470173726}, "language": "english", "review": "thats 11 hours of my life im never getting back", "timestamp_created": 1465679658, "timestamp_updated": 1465679658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23242199": {"recommendationid": "23242199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165536927", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463923942}, "language": "english", "review": "While I loved the story itself, and the characters quite a bit, I often was bored with it...

Baby bunny FTW, you know, if the Wizard didn\u2019t exist and all.\n\nIn order to understand what a crazy puppetmaster and schemer the Wizard is, let\u2019s first take a look at our suitors and their motivations for being in The Game.   \n\nBossy, opinionated Jiwoo doesn\u2019t give a shit about romancing your ass.  In fact, the only reason he\u2019s playing The Game is because he wants to run away from his old life.  I know, technically he wants revenge on his \u201cfamily\u201d, but eventually, he changes that to wanting a fresh start.  If he happens to lose his memories, painful as they are, so much the better.  As for serious contenders, Jiwoo is pretty down there on the bottom of the list.\n\nMuch like Jiwoo, Jiyeon (that fucking heartbreaker\u2026. all the tears I cried for him) wants revenge and/or a fresh start since his world no longer holds anything he cares about.  He\u2019d be going home to an empty life.  If you don\u2019t play his route, he seems perfectly happy; if you can take the abuse of chasing him down, then yeah, eventually he\u2019ll be happy and all, but really I think he just wants to be left alone.\n\nBeautiful Jihae also doesn\u2019t give a shit about romancing your ass.  He\u2019s too hung up on his past lady and being uber depressed about her to even notice you have boobs.  In fact, the only reason he\u2019s playing The Game is because Jieun is making him!  Does he care if he wins the heart of a new lady love?  No.  He had already surrendered to his depressingly overwhelming need to be needed, dedicating (tenfold) his life to caring for Prince Jieun.  So, not a contender.\n\nThe rabbit prince, while my darling, also has no desire to actually win your heart, or the game.  He wants Jihae (\u201dEddy\u201d) to be happy, and so the two are each wishing the other would win, but never striving to win themselves. \nFor all four of these characters, it isn\u2019t until you start trying to win them over that they take notice of you.  But pay attention to the phrasing there: You win them over.  YOU.  WIN.  Not them.  They are still pretty much inactive players in The Game.\n\nWhich brings us to Jisoo, the only player of The Game who is actually trying to win.  Even in routes outside of his own, Jisoo tries to appeal to Heejung, whether it\u2019s as the big brother \u201cplease depend on me\u201d type, a confidant, or an outright rival to the suitor in question, and this is because he is the ONLY ONE with something to lose if he does not win.  If he does not win, his sister will die.  End of story.  So yeah, he tries real hard, whether you notice him doing so or not because you\u2019re making moony eyes over some other dude is irrelephant.  Even the Wizard himself had said that Jisoo had been his choice to win the game, but stick a pin in that and we\u2019ll come back to it.\n\nAs gorgeous and mostly dependable as he is, Jisoo is not without his flaws.  He has a violent jealous streak that is frightening under normal circumstances, and CRAZY TERRIFYING when he finally snaps (see the bad ending OMG).  \n\nEnter the Wizard.  (My husbando.)  So far we have 4 not-entirely-committed players, and one must-win player with a history of violence, who has been hand-picked as the prize-horse* (note: not actual horse) by the Game organizer.  Naturally, The Wizard must have known about Jisoo\u2019s violent temper and jealousy, and therefore knew he was a ticking time bomb. He must have hoped that he would win so that Jisoo\u2019s relationship with Heejung would eventually become so abusive that Heejung would have a desperate wish, and then, FINALLY, meet The Wizard (possibly again?), and he can step in and save her.  \n\nThe Wizard is really such a tragic character, constantly being denied his own happiness, it\u2019s no wonder why he\u2019s so twisted.  I really wished that he had his own \u201cafter\u201d route that we could play through.  He sacrificed everything he was just to be with Heejung, not even fully knowing if it would work.  Since he wished, he probably lost his memories, but you know what?  I think that\u2019s okay.  He would wake up without the pain and bitterness that twisted his personality like it did, next to the one he loved so much.  Granted, he wouldn\u2019t remember that either, but, this way they could start off and build a real, true, lasting love.  That\u2019s a story I want to play.", "timestamp_created": 1451601579, "timestamp_updated": 1451601579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20115819": {"recommendationid": "20115819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048605793", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442107218}, "language": "french", "review": "Je le recommande parce que j'ai quand m\u00eame pass\u00e9 beaucoup d'heure dessus \u00e0 avoir toutes les fins ^^\nApr\u00e8s je dirai qu'il est assez... niais, mais pas non plus \u00e0 100% (pas comme ceux de Cybird games) ^^\n\nC'est aussi dommage pour les bugs inexpliqu\u00e9s.

I played it together with a friend once before  but I REALLY wanted to buy it for myself to support the wonderful Cheritz.  \n\nAll stories are wonderful and the overarching story makes this really heartfelt. Dandelion is a story for the heart, a true keeper for me. \n\nMC. For me, MCs in otome HAVE to have strong presence, be full characters with a personality and story to tell. I HATE  empty vessel-like MCs that  make you emptily self-insert that some otome, particularly mobile ones,  seem to have.  I want MCs I can care for and I trully care for Heejung. I love it when a game like Dandelion comes along that has a full  Main Character, with flaws but also potential for growth and change. I love the fact I can see her, know her and care for her, I love the fact she has a strong, touching backstory, that she is a wholesome person I care for and can ship with the other characters. I love Heejung, she is lovely, personnable and has her own story to tell.  Main character Heejung is one of my top favourite female heroines in an otome game ever. She has a strong presence, feels complete as a human with her flaws and insecurities and also her kindness. I really love her.  Her dynamic with the group that comes to live with her is aweome, the relations are very fun and touching. The interactions are lively. \n\nThe endings are all validated and not even the true ending invalidates them. I love it that way, it tells many stories plus one more you don't expect at first and everything is concrete enough for me to let me imagine a very happy conclusion. I really loved how all ending happened in this game, it was very well done, and I have a sense they could all happen and none of them are ever undermined and it's perfect.  My favourite endings...well it's difficult.. since the premise of the story actually makes it very difficult to have favourites. Some of the characters really have a LOT to lose if you don't choose them. It's heart rending.  Well even so my favourite endings are Ji Hye, then Ji Eun and Ji Soo and...one more, the OTHER, special ending.  It's, above all, a story of a certain desperate quest... I really love the ideas that went into this story and I came to love all characters but I can;t highlight enough how glad I am that endings are what they are and I can be happy with each of them.  I really think the game was clever with endings and  made me happy with all of them. \n\n\nThis is a stat-raising game. Stat raising is closely connected with Heejung's development and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoy stat raising games and I particularly enjoyed stat raising in Dandelion, it wasn't tiresome for me and there were many random events that made it so much more fun. Also there is a sense of progress as you raise stats. Things actually happen to the group that comes to live with Heejung...and also  stats you raise and which character you interact with from the beginning is very important. The game essentially divdes into a common route where you play until you chose one character you focus on and then, after a certain key event, the route of that charatcer begins. I love that, because it gave me a sense of progress.  \n\nArt...The CGs are all absolutely stunning!!!! I love the art in this game very much and I have at least three CGS that are my top favourites ever, from any game. The artist did a wonderful job on all of them, I adore them.  \n\nI am VERY grateful to my friend for showng me this game and playing it with me and I am happy I can finally buy Dandelion for myself....it's a true keeper for me, a senstive story that tells many stories (PLUS unxpectdly one more!) and it touches the heart.  thanks Cheritz, so much!

Please, don`t look at the playtime displayed in my Steam account. I bought this game almost immediately after its official release on CheritZ, when it wasn`t available on Steam at all and used a special security server to play, and played it for around 6 months (completing all possible character stories, of course).\nI actually love Dandelion. One of the reasons for it is the main character - Heejung. Even though I never was in the same situation is hers, I still can feel her sorrow and pain. She is not some lifeless female protagonist that we can see in many otome games. She has personality and we can see her developing during the game. If you have heart, you WILL want to make her happy, though the road to happiness for this poor girl is a really difficult one.\nNow, after I have talked about my main reason to love the game, let`s look in details at what it offers.\n\n1)\tCharacters. There is a lot of different personalities here: timid and dreamy Jieun, tsundere type Jiwoo, dark and \"bad-boy type\" Jisoo, mysterious and level-headed Jihae, charming Jiyeon (whom I started to hate at some point because....well, you need to play the game to understand what he really is). And of course the Wizard, a crazy person who is obsessed with Heejung in some way (or in all ways). There is also Heejae - Heejung`s friend from the university, but he doesn`t play any major role in the story. \n\n2)\tStory. This one is quite interesting. As I understood, there are two words \u2013 the normal one, where Heejung lives, and the parallel one, where animal-people live. The main two classes mentioned are rabbits and cats: rabbits are royalty and wealthy all in all, and cats suffer from poverty and rabbits` policy. That`s the reason why Jisoo and Jiyeon \u2013 the cat-boys - don`t like three other young man (who are rabbits). Developers of the game did quite a good job showing the society of cats and rabbits. As far as the romantic part of the story is concerned, it is also worth mentioning. All male characters are really different and their attitude towards Heejung is different too. Some of them are pretty shocking, to say the least, for example, Jisoo`s one. He scared me at some point. However, I don`t want to write spoilers here, so I can`t add anything else without opening some part of his route. It is also really appealing to me that male characters develop along with the protagonist and that all of them are not what they seemed at first sight. Don`t trust your first impression, dear friends, because it will fail you. Every character is unique, so the game has great replayability. Despite having already completed the game I still decided to start it again in Steam, because it is better than many other otome games, its story is more consistent and it provides something apart from love story. Yes, Heejung has to fall in love with one of them but it doesn`t mean that everything will be in pink colour. There is great social context that will make you think about different things, including how to raise your children (Heejung`s mother is one of the worst possible examples, to say the least).\n\n3)\tVoices. Something I really liked was that Heejung has her own voice. Yes, she speaks, and I like how she does it. She is emotional and sincere. Male voices are very good too, they suit the characters well and if I have ever to imagine them in real life, I would give them the same ones. Though I should also say that at first I found the language funny, no offense here, people from Korea. It is just so different from Russian, and the way some words are pronounced\u2026that`s fascinating. Nevertheless, I got used to it pretty fast, so there is nothing to complain about.\n\n4)\tInterface and game mechanics. Both were nice and easy to understand in the non-Steam version of the game, but in Steam it has become even better. I like how the Status of Heejung is shown, I like how simple the stats are that you don`t have to run around the map or house to understand what to do and how to improve the protagonist. Everything is simple and it is good. At the same time I can`t but mention that all this stat raising may become a bit repetitive. By the end of the third route (it was Jisoo`s one, btw) I have already learned by heart what to do and where to go to achieve what I want, so the story is the main feature that makes you want to play, not the process of playing itself. \n\n5) Art and CGs. I love the style all characters are drawn. It`s neither childish nor too realistic. Heejung is not a super model and she never was presented as one, she is just a common young woman who is concerned about her future and current life. It is also worth saying that characters` emotions are well shown with both the art and the voice acting. The CGs are all well-drawn, I can see love of the artists who created them. Some are funny, some are scary, some are mysterious (remember the crazy Wizard?) and some are lovely and romantic. I strongly recommend completing all the routes and opening all CGs, because you will most probably love them. \n\nAll in all, Dandelion - Wishes brought to you \u2013 is worth its money and your time. I do believe that you will like the characters and the plot and that you will not be disappointed with any of the endings. There is no fairytale here, even though it looks like one. But there are actual problems of the real world that Heejung has to face every day. \n\nI wish you good game and hope my review will help you in any way. ^^\n\nP.S. Don`t forget to complete Bad Endings too, they are more then worth it.

It was way better than I expected! It was interesting, sad and a very good plot. \n (On the side note, I like how it connetcts  to ''Cheritz'' other game  ''Nameless'' that I also likes. )\n \nI also like the voiceacting! The characters really comes to life with their voices. Its very well done! \n\nEven if I love this game there is ..\nalthough the art were wonderful most of the time, did I not quite like one of the main characters poses.. And the friend at school is oddly shaded and drawn without care compared to the others, which make him stand out of place ..

Which also made me insecure to save at times.. Since if you save close to a bad ending without knowing, than its hard to continue ..And noticning that, I saved most  when the first requirments were fullfilled, and the next one started.\n\nAnd last, sometimes did the game disconnect to the server, but I did not have that much of a problem to reconnect. And I do not see this as a hindrence to play... but that may differ I do not know. \n\nOverall, I really loved this game, I will probably play through the endless days just for the characters!

It's a must have for people who like these sort of games!!\n\nAlthough it wasn't perfect in a case where I encountered a few visual/interaction game bugs mostly because I was speeding through the game to get all the endings. I'll say my experience with this game has been very good none the less.\n\n\nWith it being my first ever otome game, I can say that this is a very player friendly game to play when it comes down to getting good and bad endings compared to some other otome games. It's actually easier to get the good endings than the bad endings in this game... which is good imo! But I still think they should of made the good endings a little harder to get or at least have an achivement point system where you are actually bothered to get all the endings in the end to get a secret good ending when you have completed all of the good ending-routes.\n\nThe characters are also quite interesting and unique (so-so on some such as Jiyoen and Jiuen). You can instantly notice that they have their own unique personality off the bat as animals, and once they turn into humans they get even better and easier to build relationship with them.\n\nThankfully this game managed to gather and develop all the usual romance personalities a heroine can fall in love with (tsundere, yandere, outgoing, shy, inteligent). Although some of them did stray off a bit or it got too much of it, it usually all ended up being good near the ending of the game where you hear each character's backstory and their ending.\n\nWhen you know you are torn about chosing a spotted rabbit or a black cat, you know there's something going on here...\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nPROS:\n* Characters\n* Beautiful Artstyle (some angles are a little weirdly drawn though)\n* Humor\n* Pro voice acting\n* Overall good story\n\nCON:\n* Gameplay (it gets very repetetive - esp if you go for all routes + endings.)\n* Music is somewhat bland/repetetive\n* Minor visual bugs when quick speeding\n* Translation is sometimes off, but understandable anyway.\n* No achivements\n\nOverall score: 7/10 - 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1443836540, "timestamp_updated": 1443836928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18243501": {"recommendationid": "18243501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072057813", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462755538}, "language": "german", "review": "bin zwar nicht gut in reviews schreiben, aber ich versuchs mal ^^\n\nwas ich vorweg empfehlen kann sind taschent\u00fccher XD ich hab so geheult O.O anfangs dachte ich nicht, dass ich so tief in die storys versinken kann, aber hab mich voll get\u00e4uscht. man schlie\u00dft jeden von den 5 ins herz und will den nie wieder weggeben ^^ \nanfangs ist es noch etwas m\u00fchsam mit den skills hochpushen, aber sp\u00e4testens nach dem ersten durchlauf hat man routine darin :) (ein guid is ganz hilfreich falls man nicht genau rausfinden kann was der liebste gern mag was geschenke angeht usw) mir haben zwar die standartm\u00e4\u00dfigen entscheidungsfragen gefehlt, die es hier nicht gibt (gibt ja das skill system daf\u00fcr unso), aber ist nicht wirklich tragisch ^^ \nda ich nur VN's gespielt habe mit japanischen stimmen musste ich mich doch bissl ans koreanische gew\u00f6hnen, was aber recht schnell ging ^^ (finde pers\u00f6nlich die japanische sprache sch\u00f6ner, aber vermutlich ist es nur gew\u00f6hnungssache :D) die sprecher haben es jedenfalls sehr gut gemacht muss ich sagen. die geben die gef\u00fchlslagen sehr gut wieder. jihea nuschelt zwar iwie n bissl :x aber auch dar\u00fcber sieht man iwann hinweg.\n\nalles im allen ist dieses otome game sehr sehr sch\u00f6n gemacht. mega traurig und man heult wien schlosshund XD aber ich wills nicht missen. jeder der otome games liebt sollte zugreifen :D oder halt die demo wenigstens spielen :) einer von den reviews hier hat es verlinkt :x\n\nps: ich wei\u00df ich schreibe recht komisch durcheinander XD aber hoffe es is dennoch etwas hilfreich :)", "timestamp_created": 1443488973, "timestamp_updated": 1443488973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18215183": {"recommendationid": "18215183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064623268", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471940342}, "language": "english", "review": "There may be spoilers.

There isn't much of a tutorial for the game, it just throws you right into the thick of the action, so I would recommend looking at walkthroughs online or watching something like Dodger's fantastic Let's Play of this game (she's PressHearttoContinue on YouTube).\n", "timestamp_created": 1436913728, "timestamp_updated": 1436913728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16950695": {"recommendationid": "16950695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061763552", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485841057}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished my first playthrough of this game today, and I loved it.  It has a well-developed backstory for our protagonist and she's relatable and quite ordinary - in the best way possible.   It plunges you into the storyline quickly, so you don't get bored waiting for the game to \"start\".  The art is gorgeous.  Both animals and humans are insanely adorable visually, and (especially a certain spotted one that captured my heart immediately) insanely adorable emotionally/behaviorally.  :>  They all have their own personalities and quirks that add to their charm, and if the route I played through is any indication, they likely all have backstories worth learning.  I'm certainly satisfied with my choice of romance and experiencing his story.  Honestly, I rather fell in love with him and the protagonist as a pair - they had similar heartbreaks in their pasts and seemed a natural fit together, both able to empathize with and support the other.  I hope the other routes are as fulfilling (although secretly, in my experience the first romance is always the best, otome game or other, since you gravitate toward the one that speaks to [i]you[/i], not the protagonist per se).  That ending, though... ye olde heartstrings be pulled, aye.\n\nOne thing I wasn't aware of when I first started playing was that various scenes have Korean voice acting!  Which was an interesting surprise for me, since I'm extremely familiar with Japanese, but extremely unfamiliar with Korean.  Had to train myself to pause a second before furthering the dialog in a voiced scene, just in case there was just a pause in the sentence and not a full stop.

As I've come to expect in Cheritz' games, the artwork in this game is beautiful in regards to the characters. All of the CGI's were well done, and the stories are dynamic and engaging. The bonus content is a great system and gave the MC a bonus on dates with the guy/s of her choice and gives the player a goal to collect the stamps for each of the boys. \n\nGameplay: This is where my 1.5 negative comes down off of the overall score of the game. My reasoning for this is that some of the negative paths are unbearably difficult and specific, namely Jiwoo's path. His bad ending is extremely difficult to enact, and I won't spoil it as there are really good walkthroughs that explain how to get it, but yes. Also It is difficult at times to actually find the character you're trying to engage in the house, so quick saving is a must for certain characters, especially Jiyeon, and Jiwoo. It isn't unbearable by any means but it does require a lot of time to engage specific characters when others may also be triggered by doing said action.\n\nThat said, the actual stat building in this game is remarkably easy to do, although getting stress and pressure down is hard in the beginning of the game, towards the end assuming you don't wish to unlock activities it makes the game a cakewalk. I loved the story in this game and that there was no real NEED to buy the characters gifts although it does add some extra text options, it made it optional. It was also very easy to make money, and I found it nice that I didn't need to build a huge schedule around going to work or school in order to achieve something. I loved actually sitting down and getting the paths fully completed and I also love that Cheritz was generous enough to offer free steam keys to patrons that paid for the game pre-move to steam. The steam client works wonderfully as long as the game is updated and you're not in \"sharing\" mode on your account. \n\nMusic/Voice/Audio: This was really well acted. I loved Jisoo's voice acting. I will say though that the fake meows were annoying as hell, but aside from that the music and voices were beautiful and I didn't get sick of listening to either. I also really love the opening song and video for this game. It's really well done. Also I liked that each character has a specific ending song and movie. It added a bit more depth to the game, and it really is worth it.\n\nIf you don't like stat building Otome games, this isn't for you, however If you do enjoy stat building you'll enjoy it quite a bit. The UI can be a bit \"ugly\" at times and the text could use a bit of work, however - it all runs smoothly and there were no bugs that I noticed which is more than I can say for some VN's/Stat builders out there. It's in my opinion very much worth the expense and The bonus content again is hilarious and awesome. Also I loved the individualized Christmas cards which you can read in the extra's as well. \n\nIt's a really good purchase, and I don't regret getting this at all. If you like VN's, Otome games, Usagimimi's/Nekomimi's/Catboys/Bunnyboys you'll enjoy this quite a bit. \n\nIt's got many cute things in it and moments that made me smile.  This was the first game I purchased from Cheritz' that made me a loyal customer in the future. I hope that they make many more games and add them to steam in the future. I really enjoyed this game and Nameless as well. Both are great. :) Thank you Cheritz' and the translation team for translating the game into English for those of us that only understand Hangul or English. :D", "timestamp_created": 1434528267, "timestamp_updated": 1434528267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16443256": {"recommendationid": "16443256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137389014", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494786069}, "language": "english", "review": "Downloaded this game due to a gameplay short I saw of Cryoatic and Dodger however I didnt want to ruin the storyline or gameplay so downloaded it myself for a second viewing.

What can I say about this game? Fluffy? Oh yeah it's got fluff. But it also has darker moments, sad moments, and the endings will tug at your heart making you want to cry with the MC. But those kind of things won't help ya understand what this game can be like. This game has so much to offer and a few things I wasn't too fond of. So let's get started.\n\nCONS: Honestly I really really dislike the stat raising. Don't get me wrong I have seen that others like it but for me it made avoiding the worst of the bad endings {I'm sorry but that nerd from art class getting the girl 4 times while I was chasing Jisoo drove me nsane.} Trying to avoid bad endings in this game is like trying to avoid a cold during winter, its damn near impossible. However the personal bad endings have much more to them than I could ever describe. I honestly only got one person's bad ending {twice.....} but it still made me cry and want to punch the person..... Yeah I am pretty mean.\n\nThe Mc is one of my other problems. While she is what most would think of when playing a game like this, quiet and shy, she doesn't have much of a back bone against the guys. When Jisoo, or Jiwoo even, are rude she doesn't get defensive, doesn't stand up for herself.  Yes I understand that most people wanna see the shy cute girl win the man at the end but she takes a lot of verbal abuse in this game.\n\nTranslation/spelling errors...... I saw a couple, not many worth noting, though I did have a glitch with Jiwoo that had him repeating the same thing three times and another with Jihae that did something similar. Not sure if it was a glitch or if that was translation errors. They didn't ruin the game really but it can mess up the flow if you don't expect it.\n\nPROS: The story line. Ok first, and this has to be said, play as many times as you can. Play everyone. Like seriously the more you play, the more you will see as you romance each of the guys. \n\nTHE WIZARD! Seriously I love this dude. Like he is in the pro list even if no one else likes him. Watching the bonus story for him, which you do have to get all five good endings so good luck, is so touching yet so messed up. I adored him when I first saw him. I was crepped by his voice in the beginning but as each playthrough progressed I started to love his characters, his part in the game, so much more.\n\nThe characters in general are so much fun to watch during the game. *Spoilers ahead*\nJisoo I think has one of the most touching storylines yet also has a much darker personality.  His possessive streak can be a bit much for anyone who has dealt with abusive people who are that possessive but that actually fades away eventually. That fading away allows you to see the real him, the side that is sweet, caring, and just so damned adorable.  Even though I joke to friends he is a perv, which he really is, he is much more than that.\n\nJihae..... oh what I can I say about this poor man. His story will make you wish you can just hug him tight. His bad ending will make you freak out while crying because of his abandonment. OUt of all of the guys I think he is the one I feel needs the character most.\n\nJiyeon.... Just a warning this cat boy is not all he seems and you will find that out about mid way through the game. He and at least one other character leave for a time, though this allows you to get your meters raised as well as your stats. Jihae, Jiyeon and the other character{who I can not remember off the top of my head} have the best bet of raising stats to acceptable levels while you wait for days you can talk to them.\n\nJiwoo ..... Seriously this bunny pissed me off at first. He is a typical tsundere with a chip on his shoulder and a superiority complex. But he has his own soft side and when it shows you might just forgive him for how often he calls you stupid.\n\nOh the baby bunny Jieon....... This is why I put the spoilers..... This kid is amazing. FIrst he starts growing up enough to realize he can't keep letting Jihae baby him. Then he starts showing more and more amazing strength hidden under that cute visage. And finally the way he drops that bomb about the Wizard not getting the girl.... PRICELESS. I adored this kid after I finished his playthrough. I mean seriously the little bunny became a badass by his ending and actually grew up really handsome to boot. It was amazing. \n\nHonestly this game has more than I could tell without completely ruining the game for anyone reading this.

Dating sims are my one true guilty pleasure, and when I say guilty, I mean lock the door, wear headphones, how do I keep people from seeing how many hours I've clocked in with this, it's time to make a salt circle amounts of guilt. That said, most of my enjoyment for the genre comes from a purely cynical place -- I play them because the one dimensional characters, insufferably girly and dense main protagonists, cliche plots and belittling premise of the vast majority of dating sims is utterly hilarious to me. I have a good time of playing them, either with a friend or by myself, and tearing into the faults or pointing out the ridiculousness of them. And I thought I was going to get that here, too. At first glance, this game appears to be a completely unorthodox concept -- touch the butts of your cats and rabbits that are actually hunky guys. I really looked forward to getting a laugh out this -- play it for a bit, then drop it when I couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nThat was not the case. 'Dandelion, Wishes Brought to You;, is a game with an unorthodox premise that is, without a doubt, one of the most unique and intriguing twists to the dating sim genre that I have ever seen. I immediately became engrossed with the story and characters, who unlike the ilk featured in other products, are well thought out, well rounded, and diverse. I fell in love with every character after only a short time, even the main protagonist (who I believe to be the hardest thing for dating sims to get right). I caught myself on the edge of my seat numerous times, waiting for the next piece of the story to fall into place, and damned if my anticipation wasn't rewarded with every small unveiling to a character's back story, or the plot itself (which has such a shocking climax and reveal that my head is still whirling). For that alone, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Not cynically, either. I recommend this game because its story and characters make it stand out as a masterpiece among other dating sims. I've completed several different routes, seen some amazing endings, and know that I haven't even scratched the surface yet.\n\nThat said, the game does have its faults. The fact that the game must always be online is a particular fault that's been beaten to death by other reviewers, so I won't go too in depth on the subject, other than to say that I understand why it's necessary. Cheritz it's a small company (with only two games currently under its belt, I believe) based out of South Korea, where the problem with internet piracy is extremely severe. I want this company to succeed, after seeing what they're capable of, and if that means I have to play the game with a decent internet connection, that's fine with me. I support the decision, as difficult as that is to say (Error: 37, never forget), but here it isn't just some dumb move by some CEO that doesn't understand how games or gamers' work. Cheritz has this in place because they need to make sure they can make money off their game, and not be ruined by internet piracy. Even if it's a bit frustrating.\nOther complaints range between repeating yourself quite a bit while you play -- the utter monotony is divided well between interactions with the boys and cut scenes, I think, and once you're in the flow of things, bouncing between your choice of animal boy, doing laundry, drawing, and taking a bubble bath (to name a few) becomes so second nature you don't really get bothered by it. I can see how this could be a major problem to some players -- the 'you get to do one thing today, because logically it'll take you the whole day to talk to the plants or arrange your 'meaties and veggies' thing is a bit frustrating, but a familiar mechanic in this sort of game. You also have to maintain levels of femininity, beauty and art skill (with the intention of being suitable for your suiter, which I've always found to be a bit of BS) along with balancing your stress and pressure. Personally, I enjoyed having to monitor stress and pressure -- it added an appreciated level of difficulty, as having these stats go too high has consequence (from the dreaded chicken to watching \"boring normal guy\" desperately try to get some booty), but if you didn't come here to juggle stats, you may be less than thrilled.\nAaaaand the translation errors. I thought them pretty endearing a first, but as the game went on, I found myself more and more annoyed by the grammatical, html and other text errors, especially when they dare show up during a scene that was meant to have some emotional weight. However, all and all, my experience was never flat out ruined by this -- I merely wished there was more polish at times, especially during serious or somber moments.\n\nOh, the somber moments. Those are what sold this to me, to be honest. This isn't a game where you pick a guy to touch butts with and then go to prom. There's a dark dark cloud lingering over ever interaction. I won't spoil anything, but needless to say, you'll reach a point while playing where you'll get hit, and hit hard. If you prepare to die in Dark Souls, than be prepared to cry in Dandelion. It's a simple interface, with simple design, but damn it if it doesn't know how to tell a story that will get you right in the feels.", "timestamp_created": 1432801342, "timestamp_updated": 1432801342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16032009": {"recommendationid": "16032009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067442620", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433125035}, "language": "english", "review": "I finished playing Nameless and I liked it so much that I bought Dandelion since both games were made by the same company.

Not only do we get eye-candy a plenty, but we also get actual personalities with realistic faults and flaws, (yes, even silver bunny and white bunny have their flaws, though theirs aren't quite as pronounced as the other three's). Even the main character has a personality \u2013 or quite possibly a severe mental condition that, in most cases, she manages to overcome without the need for expensive therapy and/or medication (come forth and bear witness to the mighty healing powers of cat/bunny boys!).\n\nAs for the actual gameplay: It\u2019s pretty much a matter of grinding states to progress the story (mostly by avoiding a bad end). I know some people don\u2019t care much for this aspect, but to be perfectly honest that was one of the main reasons I bought the game (that and Dodger). It does make the game pretty long, I admit, but for me it was kind of cathartic so I don't really see that as much of a downside.\n\nBTW: Frequent and blatant abuse of the quick save/load feature is a legitimate part of the game. That\u2019s my story and I\u2019m sticking to it.\n\nSo I would love to recommend this game. I really would. The story was quirky and interesting, the characters were great, the typos(which are regrettably frequent) are sometimes unintentionally hilarious, the weirdness is prevalent (which I quite enjoy), and the 'true ending' that you get after you complete all the rest was just amazing. I totally fangirled all over this game for quite some time (don't judge me), but after the most recent update I can't recommend it anymore.\n\nYou see, Cheritz seems to have graduated with high honors from both the EA and Blizzard schools of DRM douche-baggery. This is a graphic novel. Albeit, it is a pretty good graphic novel, but there is, nevertheless, no possible need for it to require, REQUIRE, a constant internet connection. And yet for some reason you cannot play this game in Offline Mode; some people can't even play it when they ARE online because of all the other little addendums and bugs that have come with it. Oh you can do the grinding in Offline Mode, but the moment a cutscene comes up you're pretty much screwed. I honestly can't understand what logical reason Cheritz could have for this. I always thought that Steam WAS the DRM, but now even that's not good enough for you guys? Really?\n\nI'm sick of it. I really am. This DRM bullcrap is getting into absolutely everything, isn\u2019t it? Even effing graphic novels. Graphic novels, people! But hey, if you don't have a problem with all that and have a flawless internet connection (obviously you do not have the same ISP as I do, lucky) then go for it! It's an enjoyable graphic novel game. I just wish the company would rethink this entire thing and go back to how it was BEFORE the constant connection was necessary. If it ever does I'll change my recommendation and I'd buy their other game, Nameless, in a heartbeat. But, so far, that doesn\u2019t seem likely to happen. Oh well.

My money wasn't wasted...  I am really happy I got to experince this. Even with all the stress of updates, some routes that I got frusterated with; (Jihae and Jiyeon I am looking at you two) I enjoyed every minute of it. And though some of the routes were a little predicatable... I was the end that caught me off guard.\n\nJust a forwarning. Yes, I am going to spoil some stuff in the game, so bare with me. I'm going to go through with each of the routes and especially the end. So if you don't wanna be spoiled for the game I suggest you avoid reading this... or at least go play the game for yourself, trust me it's worth it...So let's get's started.\n\n[h1]Jihae[/h1]\nHe's actually the reason I even bought the game. I love type of guys who are shy but very polite. The fact that Heejung [spoiler]helped him forgive himself for what happened to his former love,[/spoiler] struck a spot with me. And despite what people think that he's boring and wouldn't be interesting enough without his looks are completely wrong. Also, he was the first one I got both endings for... kinda makes me sad that my favourite one I failed and completed the story line... but he got me into it so I have to admit he's my favourite.\n\n[h1] Jiwoo [/h1]\n\nOoooh man, the tsundere. I don't really like guys who act all tough at first but then finally warm up. But Jiwoo made me laugh the most. Seeing Heejung tease Jiwoo made me want to see them get together even more. [spoiler]Even more so when we learn that he worked so hard to be loved only to be rejected by someone he thought loved him...[/spoiler]. However unlike Jihae I didn't get the bad ending this time and managed complete it with high hopes. Though I was kind of disappointed with the ending...\n\n[h1] Jieun [/h1]\n\nI was kind of worried with this route. With the new update and the constant problems I almost didn't get to complete his route. But when I pushed through and got the fixes. I really enjoyed his route. [spoiler] It was obvious that he was a Prince from the get go, and the fact that he didn't want to be King AND had powers?[/spoiler] Well it was kind of hard to relate to... but after a while. To see him build up enough confidence to not only [spoiler] wanted to accept his role as king BUT to also let go of Jihae? [/spoiler] It was honourable... and made me love his ending even more. [spoiler] Because she never went to see the wizard to go see him again. That made me feel big XD [/spoiler]\n\nAfter I had finished up all the rabbits... I was kind of hesitant to start up on the cats. It kind of made me uneasy, already knowing about Jisoo's jelousy from Jihae's route, and already knowing about Jiyeon from stuff I read online. I was going into the cat's routes with a grain of salt.\n\n[h1] Jisoo [/h1]\n\nThough I not one for the 'jelousy story' I have to say that I really enjoyed Jisoo's route just as much as I did Jihae's. I wanted to see him happy, I laughed when he acted perverted. But the more I got into these routes. The more I reminded myself that in the end... it was going to end. [spoiler] And it made even more sense when I saw the bonus ending. But seeing the ending where Jisoo gave up his memories to be with Heejung... and yet retaining some of his memories? It made me think that just because the memory is taken away doesn't mean it's truly gone... [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Jiyeon [/h1]\n\nHere.we.go. When I started this stupid cat's route I was expecting the worse. I HATE jelousy stories when it's on the girls' end. But with this, I didn't get that... [spoiler] I got even more pissed off when I saw it was the complete opposite of that... and we had someone who was exactly like me. Pushing away Heejung... being cruel to her. It drove me to instanity. [/spoiler] I wanted the route to end so badly I just wanted my suffering to end. I thought it would never make me feel satisfied like the others did... but I was surprisly changed. Around the end... I... I cried. I never thought I would... I cried more for Jiyeon's story than any of the other guys... and that's what surprised me.\n\nDO NOT READ THE SPOILER BELOW IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE GAME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU FINISH IT FIRST BEFORE YOU READ!\n\n[spoiler] Finally the Wizard... if you beat all the endings, you learn that all the stories happened because the Wizard was continually turning back time. Watching the Heroine and obessing over her made him create the game in the first place... and it almost killed him for it. I thought it was because he wanted her memories for himself... but that wasn't it. But because he wanted to see her, to talk to her... not because he wanted the memories because of her earnest wish... and that's why seeing that he gave up everything to be with her... made me happy. Even though I hated him before... I finally felt satisfied.[/spoiler]\n\nMy final thoughts? This game is worth it... I normally don't play Dating Sim's because I know how sexualized it can become... but this game... it gave me all the happiness, and sadness without making me feel unconfortable. If you wanna enjoy a really good story, but don't want to play it because you are worried it is over sexualized. Have no fear!

Definitely worth the expense. Surprisingly, I really loved all the different character storylines and am excited to go back to do all the bad endings and extras. The game remains fun after multiple playthroughs, since there are so many cute interactions to unlock. In addition, be ready to come down with a real bad case of the feels, because you will, repeatedly. Some of the backstories/endings can be a little dark so be prepared. The pacing of the game is set up to get an emotional response from you, so you will feel frustrated, sad, excited, and happy at times that are appropriate for the story.  Overall, the heroine was very relatable, although sometimes pretty dense (in true romantic fashion).  Each guy brought out different sides of her personality, so I did feel like she was a different person in each playthrough.\n\nThe whole game is colorful and fun to look at and the voice acting and sounds effects are really fun. There are a few translation errors, but nothing that breaks the dialogue. The sprites have a lot of personality and I found myself watching them just because they showed the thoughts of the characters so well. The mechanics of the game play were more focused on stat building with some choices to help you gain stats either with the guys or for your own character to advance in the game, but once you were on a guy's route (either good or bad), there isn't much branching decision making. You were able to interact with each guy in a variety of scenarios, which is a blast since you can get some really fun dialogue. I also had a lot of fun trolling them with gifts (island tickets and get a bikini ASAP \u263a). \n\nObviously the first few playthroughs should just be for fun, but for nice plot progression, I would recommend Jihae before Jieun and probably Jisoo or Jieun last (I went with Jisoo). Otherwise, play them anyway you want. I got a lot of bad endings on my first playthroughs since some of the play mechanics aren\u2019t obvious (there is a status page so you can access inventory and your stats with each of the guys but it\u2019s not obvious how to get to), but once you get a handle on it you\u2019ll have some nice wiggle room to play with your characters. \n\nI really really really hope there will be some fan service DLC in the future, since I would love to just spend some fluff time with the guys.

There are some suggested themes throughout the game but nothing explicit or mature ever happens however. This is a visual novel though and except the stat rising you are mostly reading, so if you crave action then this game might not be for you though.\n\nThe story seems pretty simple, Hee-jung finds a basket with animals in her room one morning and ends up taking care of them, and after some time it turns out the animals are really humans, or well humans with adorable cat and rabbit ears, and you get to choose which guy she will end up with. But the story is quite dark despite how it appears at first glance, the main character Hee-jung has a very real and relatable background and each of the guys have their own story that are all heartbreaking in their own right that has shaped them into what they are in the game and it makes it hard to settle for just one favourite.\n\nThe game often had me laughing out loud, especially the guys interractions with or without Hee-jung nearby, only to take a 180 turn and give you a sad or straight out heartbreaking scene. The art work really complements the game well, the character models, the adorable chibis and the locations are all very well done and I eagerly awaited the scenes that would give me a CG.\n\nThere are five routes to play through, with each guy having a different personality and a captivating story but if you play through all the routes you get to see that there is a bigger story behind it all and there is even sixth route available that gives some interesting insight in the plot of the game.\n\nAlmost every character also have a bad ending, most are not too bad but I recommend trying to get Jisoo's good ending before his bad end, seriously it's for the best. If you are worried about getting a bad ending then I recommend playing Jieun's route first since he has no bad ending. However it is still good to play Jihae's route before Jieun's since they are connected and the story really plays out better when doing Jihae first.\n\nThe text is in English or Korean and the audio is Korean, and the person that picked out the actors did an amazing job. Every character has a perfect voice in my opinion and it really makes it easier to relate and get immersed in the game, I especially like that even Hee-jung gets a voice, it's rare to have the female lead in an otome game to have a voice but in my opinion that makes everything better. The music is really good and fits the mood, there's not too much variation but it's always good music, not too much but just enough for you to notice it.\n\nThere are a lot of spelling mistakes though, even places where character names is switched by mistake and some might get thrown off by it, personally I didn't find it too distracting but for almost 30\u20ac some proofreading before release would have been appreciated.\n\nOverall this game was funny, heartbreaking, embarassing and filled with relatable feelings and moments that really makes it hard to pick out a favourite character, my favourite is Jisoo but I can not rank the remaining five so they share a second place. I generally don't play otome games or dating games but this one I really recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1428922369, "timestamp_updated": 1428922369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15289311": {"recommendationid": "15289311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171052473", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501436905}, "language": "english", "review": "Apart from the few mistakes and typos with the dialogue, Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - has some amazing features.

I think I just tried to justify the amount of money that I spend on \"Dandelion\". Either way, I finished all the routes and gained all the extras and pretty much did everything there was to be done. Conclusions?\n\nIt's not good. Really. Not for this price, that's for sure.\n\n[h1] Good stuff [/h1]\n\n[b]Game is long.[/b] I guess it could be treated as both good and bad thing, since it depends on whether you enjoy it or not. Take into account that you will spend most time raising stats and not having any scenes that moves plot forward, but if you don't mind that, this game offers lengthy gameplay.\n\n[b]Beautiful graphic. [/b]CGs, backgrounds, characters, everything looks good.\n\n[b]Original idea. [/b]Whether you are weirded out by the concept of dating your pets after their transform into humans (I know I am), the concept definietely had its potential. There is an intruiging backstory that could easily be so much more that it ended up being. I also like the fact that protagonist [spoiler] re-live each route as sort of different-dimension thing [/spoiler].\n\n[b]Extras. [/b]Unclockables, additional scenes, gallery - it's all there.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n\n[b]Too high price for the quality.[/b] For the game that offers more in terms of stat raising than actual story, has LOW RESOLUTION (!), two [spoiler] abusive [/spoiler] characters, bland protagonist and poorly developed plot, that's really huge price. You will find much better visual novels for half of it.\n\n[b]Promising potential, bad execution.[/b] The story could be so much more, but end up being so little.\n\n[b]Not enough plot-related scenes[/b]. With this amount of grinding (I can't call it any other way), I don't want to see the same \"little encounter\" with the same outcome every God damn time I'm doing certain activity. This games is a true borefest when you wait FOREVER until something actually important happens.\n\n[b]Protagonist is bad.[/b] She's bland and boring, very schematic. There is absolutely nothing interesting about her. She's portrayed as classic, shy, not-speaking-much girl, but really, that's all there is to her. Nothing behind the curtain, nothing to discover, not even a bit of charisma. And don't get me wrong, I don't mind shy and calm characters, I'm like that myself, but \"shy and calm\" doesn't mean boring. Oh, and stupid. I'm sorry, but Heejuing is just plainly dumb and she acts like she doesn't have her own will. She allows to do boys whatever they want to do with her. And she acts like a victim. ALWAYS. It's so tiring, especially since she doesn't have really good reasons for it. I mean, sure, she has bad situation with her mother, that has high expectations and she aims for perfection, don't know how to relax and so on, and so forth, but she lives alone, she as all the possibilities and, at some point, she also have help of her... animals *cough*. There are far worse things that happens to people and they deal with it without constant victim-mask. I wouldn't even mention that, since I think everyone has the right to deal with their problems in their own way, but her \"hard life\" is an important aspect, since this is why important character becomes fascinated with her.\n\n[b]Music[/b]. Out of place, doesn't fit the mood of the scenes, gets annoying really quickly.\n\n~ * ~\n\n[h1]Routes[/h1]\n\n[b]Ji.ssoo[/b] [spoiler] I felt like he was supposed to be \"main\" love interest, since he had very expanded path and was often important character on other routes. He is super annoying and jealous. He's the type that could do nasty stuff and then find the reason to justify them by saying protagonist that it's all her fault, that she can't meet with other boys (even before they have anything romantic going on), she can't have friends, she pretty much can't do anything related to other male. He made a jealous scene in the middle of the street and he wasn't even dating the protagonist at that time! I seriously have enough of this types of characters, I won't even mention his bad end.[/spoiler]\n \n[b]Jihae [/b][spoiler] Silent and shy, typical knight on white horse, he's personal story wat interesting, but the route itself wasn't particularly engaging.[/spoiler] \n\n[b]Jiwoo[/b][spoiler] Always repeats that protagonist is stupid and he is painfully right. This is the most interesting path, because only here, protagonist actually make a move herself and does not act like she needs to be guided every step of the way.[/spoiler] \n\n[b]Jiyeon[/b] [spoiler] Character with a \"twist\", but not very interesting and not well executed. Selfish and rude, with him Heejung is even bigger victim than usual which makes him unbearable.[/spoiler] \n\nJieun [spoiler] Weird.

I kept getting surprised by each new side of a character I found.  There are even a decent number of unexpected but nicely foreshadowed twists.  Whenever I heard a conversation between the current path's love interest and another character, I found myself anticipating playing the other character's path so that I could find things out from his perspective.  Each new perspective turns out to be very worthwhile to learn (the plot of each path is completely different, and you learn a different facet of the shared backstory).\n\nAlso, the $30 pricetag seems kinda big, but it's totally worth it.  This game has a loooot of content.  There are five love interests, and within a given love interest's path, both the good (happy/bittersweet) ending and the bad ending (separate from just failing the relationship) have very different stories, depending on which one you're headed to.

What else could you ask for?\n\nThis game offers fairly in-depth characters that actually develop as the story progresses. They're not just quickly drawn pretty boys, they have reasons for how they act and why. For men in animal ears, they're pretty realistic in terms of behaviour. (except falling for this clueless MC, ofc) The music is beautiful, art's well made. The GC's are quite breathtaking.\n\nThe game takes you along for an emotional ride, and you'll notice yourself getting attached to the characters. Each new playthrough with a new guy felt like a betrayal every time. Until I accepted the fact I just need to touch all of their butts or I won't be happy! The game play gets repetitive quite fast though, with the stat raising and waiting for the days to pass to get to the good parts. For a completionist like me, who needs to get all the bad endings, good endings and extras, after a couple playthroughs it's not that fun anymore. The character dialogue and GC's are deffo worth it though, and skip function for the heavy story parts ftw.\n\nThem speaking Korean caught me off guard first as it was the first time I ever heard the language, but you get used to it!

What I have to say about this game is it definitely took me by surprise. At first glance, I thought it'd be the classic \"pursue one guy and you'll get a good ending because of it\" sort of game. It actually required a bit of grinding, relationship and stats wise. Jihae's route was actually a bit of a challenge for me personally since I didn't know affection for Jieun was a requirement for his good ending. \nEach character has certain attributes and personalities that decently cut through otome game character cliches. I admit each had their own personal charm, including the main character Heejung herself. Some would think her naive nature is a fault, but I acutally found it amusing and it made all the stories intriguing for my gaming experience. She also made the struggles of herself and the other characters so detailed a player could find them, in a sense, realistic. Even Jiwoo's classic \"Korean Drama Route\" had some twists here and there, along with interactions during the game that were typical and endearing.\nFor the sound, it was well done and probably the strongest factor of the game. The OSTs throughout the game could be either sweet, playful, anxious, or edgy. It all added to the effect of dialogue being either, \"Aw, that's so adorable~ <3\" to \"Oh my gosh, is this happening? This is actually kinda creepy e-e\" and also, \"OMG WHYYYY!?!? So sad. Ugu~ Sob cry sob ;-;\" (<- *Literally my reactions if nobody picked up on that*) The opening made the gamer excited for what was to come. The ending song leads players to feel hopeful for whichever route they pursued. The voices of the characters suited the figures well, and I don't think anyone would have selected better roles. The actors sunk into the shoes of their character and expressed such profound emotion, knowing precisely how to present them to the player on the other side of the screen. It was remarkable, and all of them gave me endless tearjerkers while I played the game.\nUnlike other games with the adorable happy endings, this was particularly very bittersweet, which is why I found it worthy of much praise. All the elements of the storyline ranged from farfetched to scenarios that are understandable, a balance that was difficult to make but was still executed successfully. Some of the fourth wall breaking dialogue on \nJiyeon's route was one of the many humorous additions from Cheritz to the game. Because of such, I have to wonder if there are any missing pieces of conversation, which is why I end up returning to play through the game at least a bit more. This is hard to come by, and it's one of the reasons why I'm satisfied I bought it. \nThe mechanics themselves were somewhat irritating, sadly enough. After a while of playing, the game can easily freeze and have the occassional crash. This didn't affect my experience though, annoying as it was. There was also the necessity to quick save/load constantly when you fail to interact with the character or gain a stamp. Even when buying the eyesight improvement from the store, the price can be difficult to meet and the bottle ends up being one of the many the main character needs to improve her luck. Though it was aggravating, the negative points did not detract from the game too much. In fact, in some cases, that was what made it more addicting and caused me to be determined to find all the endings that were possible.\nOverall, with that said, the game was a great adventure. The CGs are saved along with cutscenes when the player has completed each route. The art is well-defined and pleasant to the eyes. I enjoyed Dandelion beyond the mishaps I stated above. There may be some secrets those that bought it may need to check out (Perhaps certain dialogues and extras from stamps collected during dates?) Those that haven't bought it should get it.

That is a ridiculous restriction due to DRM. Being online does not enhance gameplay at all. Although this game is a wonderful game, I cannot recommend it as it stands. I paid for this game so shouldln't I be able to decide when I can play it and not because it can arbitrarily connect to the servers? Steam itself puts DRM in place so this additional layer by Cheritz doesn't not seem to be needed. Since I travel a lot internet is not always available. The game will repeatedly say it is not connected to the internet so it cannot continue. This is pervasive enought that I have to change my previous yes recommendation to a no recommendation. In addition, I no longer intend to buy their next title because of this issue. No use wasting good money on a game that will not function in offline mode. I think Cheritz should beware of alienating their customers just to put their DRM in place. This kind of thing is becoming more prevalent especially with the big companies such as EA and Ubisoft who are getting reviews based on their cr*ppy DRM software rather than the quality of the game and that is just sad.\n\n\nPrevious review when I actually recommended the game.\nThe art is beautiful and bright and the story line for each character is different and very interesting. Because of how much I enjoyed this game, This game is a bit heavy on the stat leveling, which may or may not be your thing. I personally had no objection to it but I did take a peek at the walkthrough available in the community forum to get some initial help. I think the game itself could have a small explanation section for people who are new to this genre and stat leveling in general. But gameplay can be figured out without it.  I thought the conversations with the characters during activities were very entertaining.

The stats that you're trying to increase are Beauty, Femininity, and Artistic Skill, while the stats you're trying to decrease are Pressure and Stress. I don't know what purpose these stats serve, but I'm sure that they serve some sort of purpose. Maybe in the places you can visit on your weekends out, or in the way you interact with certain of your lovers, maybe your stats influence the end of the game, dunno and couldn't tell you. I definitely don't mind stat systems in games, and certainly it's not a bad thing to have one, in fact having a stat system can take a dull game and make it decent, however your stats need to have a visible effect on the game, otherwise it just seems kinda pointless to have them at all. \n\nYou have five choices of lovers, all of whom are introduced within the first three minutes of game play, depending on how fast you read, and who, for the first little while are rather unique in the way you're forced to interact with them. However, it can sometimes be difficult to interact with the one you want. If more than one of your lovers is in a particular room, you have to go to that room and select the right activity to trigger the scene with your desired lover to raise your relationship meter. Sometimes this is impossible, as a large number of the activities that you can perform are locked at the beginning of the game, and sometimes they don't become available to be unlocked until much, much later, and by that point it can be too late, since failure to raise your relationship with your lover leads to game over, or at least it seems to from my experience, so it's entirely possible, and in my case it seems to be common, that you can get forced into pursuing a character you have no interest in just to stop yourself from getting the bad end. \n\nThere are \"cutscenes\" of a type as well. They run on a scripted course and you have little or no control over the outcome, sometimes these cutscenes trigger for seemingly no reason and can end up undoing a whole lot of work you've done to raise your relationship meter, and other times they trigger because you're about to lose the game, or because you've done something right, for once. However, the cutscenes don't differ much from the rest of the game, so they're not terrible. \n\nThe story line is trite and cliched, about a young woman out on her own struggling to overcome the burdens of being useless and indecisive until a man, or a group of men, give meaning to her life, so if you're looking for a game with a strong female protaganist this game is not it. There are many ways in which the main character could have been improved, but I think that giving her a brain would have been the best one. I would have found her a much more relateable and believeable character if she hadn't been completely clueless about absolutely everything she encounters in the game. \n\nAfter this long and seemingly negative review, I'm sure you're wondering why I recommend this game. Well, it's for the most basic reason of all. The game is fun. It has a lot of replayability, what with having five romance options and a rotating string of activities, and gives you plenty of options for things to do on subsequent playthroughs. While the price point is a little high, if you have the disposable income and like dating sims this game will be worth your money, if you don't have any kind of a disposable income I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere, since this game doesn't really offer you anything you can't find for cheaper elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1422390943, "timestamp_updated": 1422390943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14131822": {"recommendationid": "14131822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166540469", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1521097986}, "language": "english", "review": "i really like the characters.  that alone enough to push me through this game. except the game. i don't like that much because stat raising is not the funnest thing after  stat raising wrongly , then using only one save file and having to restart the whole thing.

In essence, one day you found a bsaket of bunnies and cats in your room and decided to look after them, only to realised that they can turn into more human forms and they were all here as participants of a 'game'.\n\nWhat makes Dandelion really shine, in my opinion, is the story. It is not one of those shallow sim dating game where there is no content- Dandelion is extremely story rich and you get more and more questions as you play along: why the hell these boys appear from nowehere, what is the 'game' that they constantly talk about, etc. Then when you get the ending of your first character, BOOM! You see the person who is behind all this and all I can say is RAGE!!! Once you have got all the good endings for the characters, BOOM! Everything comes together - it even explains the fact that why as players, we got to go through all the different characters - MIND-BLOWN! Plus RAGE as you just hate the secret character for putting everyone through the game!!! :P\n\nAside from the story, the art is amazing. The CGs are so beautiful!!! All the characters have distinctive personalities so you are bound to find one that you like! The voice acting is super professional and you can tell that the voice actors put a lot of thought into the characters and the story so they can say the lines with great emtions... I also enjoy the opening song together with the visuals - looks just like an opening for an anime, extremely professional and well made.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, having played all the good and bad endings for all the characters. One thing to note is that if you are looking for some cheesy 'happily ever after' endings, sorry, you won't get them here. When I first got the endings, I was gutted that they weren't true happy endings but after a while, I appreciated the fact that Cheritz has decided to do so as it is a very bold move. The endings were all sort of open ended but I mean come on, it is just life, isn't it? In a way it leaves you room for imagination as well.\n\nNow the characters, they all look great and a lot of thought have been put into the character development. At first glance I really like the black cat but his pocessive nature really puts me off a bit (some girls like that so fair enough). Also I will warn you if he is your favourite, you might want to avoid his bad ending as it is dark, REAL DARK. I actually ended up having the tiny white rabbit as my favourite as I played more. At first he seems too young but his character development, together with the fact that he was the only one to KICK THE SECRET CHARACTER'S ASS puts him my number one!!! I MEAN GO JIEUN, YOU MIGHT LOOK SMALL AND HARMLESS BUT YOU ARE AWESOME!!! If you don't understand what I mean, apologies as it is hard to explain the plot without spoilers but basically, he is the only one with a proper real good ending if that helps :)\n\nThe thing that really disappoints me is the english translation - mistakes every now and then. Dandelion is definitely my favourite of the two Cheritz games because of the clever plot of linking all the stories together. It might seem expensive but it is totally worth it.

It is bittersweet and touching at the same time as I discovered the true ending behind the game. Each character also have their own story beautifully crafted and revealed across the time of interaction between the heroine and themselves. \n\nI personally love the story of Jihae, Jisoo, Jieun and also the true motive behind the game itself. While playing on Jihae's route, everything has been nothing but breathtaking. He truly cares and put everyone else before himself, even till the very end. On the other hand, Jisoo's route is a very touching one, especially after I realized his intention of participating in the game. For Jieun's route, there are some cute and fun moments with him which will pretty much make you think of apples all day long. I feel that his route is a bit more fantasy, especially for his ending. And lastly, the behind story summed up the whole game nicely and I wish there is more to what actually happened after all this! =D\n\n[i]When one's obsession becomes a form of yearning, one's wish can eventually become a reality.[/i]\n\nFor the gameplay itself, I will say there is a wide variety of interaction and activities you can do in the game. The stats management system is a great addition to the game, and how it challenges the player to work around with it to fulfill the necessary requirements tailored to different characters. However, I believe it is quite easy to manage once you figure out the pattern. A great tip will be really to just focus on the relationship points + hearts first before you raise the stats as you progress as they will increase the requirement points, there will be plenty of time to do so, unless you keep doing those activites that only add a minimum amount. Taking bubble bath is a good way to increase both Feminine and Beauty and Sketching increase a huge amount of Art stat. And make sure you always watch the level of your stress and pressure.  \n\nOverall, I really love Dandelion and its story.

Wish there was a yellow \"~\" option along with the up and down votes. \n\nIf you like VNs and Dating Sims, and want to play a decent length game (8ish hours per line) with a lot of interesting types to choose from, then yes, it's a reccomend. We don't get nearly enough of these lengthy foreign titles, and I love to see more of this.\n\nIf you\u2019re into chicks or just plain not up for a binge of cute, hot guys, then this title is not going to wow you. \n\nFinally... If you're also a fan of romance novels, or follow Hanako Games and enjoy the quality writing some local titles have to offer... then I suggest you keep reading.\n\n\n\nAll the characters in Dandelion are fully realized. They\u2019re all typical \u201ctypes,\u201d bad boy, classy gentleman, dreamy prince, peppy neko ball, and tsundere, stuff that you can hear a couple lines from and say \"yep. I like that one.\" The designs are excellent and enticing. They\u2019re supposed to be otherworldly, and they certainly come off that way! And the situations they get into sometimes are hilarious! When all these personalities get together, the banter between them is quick and witty. I wish I could play the whole game with them playfully bickering.\n\nBut it\u2019s strange. I wonder if I should bemoan the writing, or the translation. I\u2019m not talking about the spelling errors here, I\u2019m talking about the small, personal, and private moments. The moments where your heart is supposed to flutter, and your eyes are glued to the screen, on your gorgeous male moe blob as he finally comes in closer... and closer...! \n\nYeah. Those moments\u2026 fall soooooooooo flat in English.\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand why\u2026 and I wonder, more than any other part of the game, is that a place that needs solid writing. Not just solid scenarios or solid characters. It\u2019s a place where you breach into the sensual realm, of touch and smell. Where word choice is powerful. \u201cHe put his arm around me\u201d is worlds away from \u201cHis arm slid around my shoulders, cupping me gently.\u201d \n\nReaders of VN\u2019s and Romance\u2026 People who have enjoyed games like Katawa Shojou, Royal Trap, and Magical Diary, or hell, the brief little tastes of Persona 3&4's romantic moments. you know what I\u2019m talking about, right? There's a kind of writing that can make you melt into a gooey puddle of YES, even if the guy/gal isnt your prepackaged \"type\". There's some powerful stuff in Dandelion's plot that can reduce you to a quivering pile. But the smaller the scene, and the further from the main plot it is, the higher chance the entire moment will be ruined by the flat and simple text.\n\nBesides that, it\u2019s easy to get knocked of the cute moeness by Bad Relationship Flags. Oh, it\u2019s not a game mechanic. It\u2019s occasional character moments that are played up as desirable or adorable, but in the real world are indicators of some SERIOUS bad juju, run from that relationship right now! The biggest problems I had were with \"bad boy\" Jisoo... I dont care what kind of situation you're in, man! Getting instant ragegasms for STANDING next to another guy is NOT. COOL.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid game with solid art, solid characters, solid scenarios\u2026 Pandery, cutesy moe pap, sure.

There are a few problems with playing it. Mostly, it's just typos that throw me off on my reading when I play the game. The boys are amusing and you get attached to them very easily, which makes it saddening when you push the other animals away to spend more time for a play through. I wished that there were jealousy scenes in the game, otherwise the whole \"wish\" thing doesn't have the same amount of impact. It just seems like no one really cares enough about what they want and just spend their time fooling around.\n\nThe pacing of the story gave me problems, since I usually optimize my stats for the story, it makes the game feel rather slow  at some parts. But I suppose if someone were to just play, it would be fine as long as you don't attempt to play the game in one day, which I did. There is a lot of content to explore, so it is best to take your time and not burn yourself out.\n\nThe voice acting of the game gives a nice experiance.\n\nIt has a nice, long story that makes you want to explore the other character some more. So, for a dating sim, it's very successful in getting attachment to the fun times of having 5 guys in your apartment. But on a professional writing view, the characters are pretty two dimensional, the story has a lot of holes, the characters lack active goals, and the sheer fact that typos happen is shameful, but I still enjoyed it. The character problem isn't too bad, since they are way more fleshed out than a standard dating sim.\n\nI suggest that people buy it when it is on sale about 5 or 10 dollars cheaper.

It is definitely one of the best contenders in the visual novel/dating sim genre. There are some things to be aware if though, which I will be addressing in the cons section of my review.\n\nPros\n+ Each of the characters are supremely unique and have interesting backstories. I've completed the routes for each of the guys, and each guy turned out to be more than what meets the eye. All the characters have positive & negative sides to them, and they each come with some surprises.\n+ The art is gorgeous! I love a game that will take the time to show you some of the pivotal scenes drawn out, and this game does it awesomely! If you look through the screenshot collection on Steam, you will easily see that the story doesn't skimp on engaging cut scenes with wonderful pictures.\n+ I *felt* a lot during the game. I really did empathize with what was going on. You can't go wrong with a game that gets your heat invested.\n+ The voice acting was a great touch! Even though it was in Korean, I loved being able to hear the emotion behind what the characters were saying. \n+ The stat system felt balanced. The stats you needed were different for each character, and I did find myself having to pay attention to make sure I was on track. It added a challenging element to the game without it making it feel bogged down.\n+ The game is VERY replay friendly! I've spent over 30 hours playing and I haven't even gotten all the endings yet. Every romance route is different and enchants you in ways.\n\nCons\n- You unexpectedly run into some uncomfortable stuff in this game. Some of the guys get extremely verbally abusive, posessive, physically violent, and stalker-ish. I did fine with it, but just beware - if you are triggered by any of these things, you might want to look up a walkthrough beforehand and avoid certain routes.\n- This is kind of spoiler-y, but whatever: Jieun's route was BORING. Like... why include this dude as a romance option if the entire time he's just gonna be like \"lol i'm too young though.\" I felt more like I was being his babysitter and it was weird. I know plenty of people loved his story, but I thought it couldn't hold a candle to the other stories. That can be up for you to decide though.\n\nIn short: If you like anime dating sims and can appreciate some upscale art, definitely give this a shot.

I figured it would be  a slapstic piece worth a few laughs. Pleasently mistaken, Dandelion offered an deeper underlying story that brought a more tought provoking level to an already enjoyable game.  The idea of having all the pathways sewn together in an overlying story arch is refreshing to say the least.\n\nThe game has faults in its own right. In order to reach the ending on a given pathway, you have to repeditivly raise stats and keep your stress level down. One of the characters, in my opinion, becomes too possessive and dangerous without any option to counteract the behavior.\n\nOther than that, a very enjoyable game.

The opening video is great and the song catchy. The art is consistent and delivers; I'm not crazy about the art style in itself, with funky legs and necks, but wow the bishonen was strong. The music used is okay. Few tracks stayed in my mind, but I always consider a non intrusive soundtrack a good thing. Voice acting is truly amazing!\n\nThere was no tutorial. There is no need for one, as I guess the only people who will play Dandelion are familiar with visual novels already, and there is a certain standard UI used in the genre. Nevertheless, I found out the player's inventory by accident. The location of it should have been mentioned, I think.\n\nThe statistics you need to raise are Art, Beauty and Femininity. Each love interest has different requirements that you need to meet in order to continue the relationship. Do activities to raise statistics. You will meet the love interests in the house, and have the possibility to interact with them to raise the relationship points. As you swirl around interacting with your boyfriend and practicing the housewife life, you also need to keep low Stress and Pressure. \n\nI saw a problem in the stats. In the writing as well, in certain routes. \nHeejung can only act within the walls of her house. Heejung has the function to save the male interest from his painful past. She is unaware of her feelings, unaware of her needs, incapable of relating personal experience to the same romantic clich\u00e9s she criticizes when she reads Harlequin novels or goes to the movies. True, Heejung overcomes her fear, but she does not accomplishes it by herself. Her knight on a white horse does the talking to the source of her nightmares. She needs her prince to save her. (Notable exception is [spoiler]Jieun[/spoiler]'s route, which favorably impressed me!) Typical otoge MC that I can't identify with: despite the universal nature of her conflict, it's approached in such a childish way that it made me feel annoyed instead of empathetic.\n\nDespite all this, I still recommend the game--it's Cheritz.

The game was released in South Korea in August 2012 and was released in the US in August 2012. The game was released on Steam  on September 29, 2014.\n\nThe game revolves around Heejung, a Korean college student majoring in business with a penchant for art. One day, she wakes up to discover a basket of animals in her room: two cats and three rabbits. Heejung eventually adopts the animals as her own, only to discover that the would-be animals actually have human forms. Moreover, they're actually from another world entirely. \n\nDISCLAIMER: While I have beaten the good routes for all of the characters, I have not yet played through the bad routes. I'm sure I'll play through them eventually, and will amend my review accordingly if needed.\n\n\nThe protagonist:\n\nHeejung Kim, our leading lady, is an incredibly relatable character. Ever since her parents divorced, she has struggled to meet her mother's expectations. In doing so, Heejung has lost her sense of self. What does she want to do with her life? What kind of person does she want to be? As the game progresses, Heejung finds those answers.\n\nWhile the game does not explicitly call the relationship between Heejung and her mother abusive, the characters of Dandelion universally acknowledge that Heejung's mother's behavior is unacceptable. No one ever attempts to encourage Heejung to make amends with her mother; no one ever makes excuses for her mother's behavior (e.g., \"she just wants the best for you!\"), either. That definitely won brownie points with me.\n\nWhile Heejung's characterization is fairly consistent across all routes, there are some routes where her growth as a character is absolutely outstanding. If you like lots of character development in your protagonists, I highly recommend that you start with the Jieun route. \n\n\nThe love interests: \n\nBefore I bought the game, a friend warned me that the bunny routes were all much better than the cat routes. After clearing through all the good endings, I absolutely agree. The interaction between the bunny characters and Heejung were mostly positive; those relationships -- for the most part -- involved mutual support and care and respect.\n\nUnfortunately, the same can not be said for the cat routes.\n\nWhile the game did a fabulous job of addressing familial abuse, some of the romantic relationships on the game were abusive. While I don't plan on addressing those issues in every route, there is one love interest where the abuse is especially prevelant; that's the fan favorite, Jisoo's route.\n\nDuring his route, he does the following:\n\n-follows Heejung without her knowledge\n-tells Heejung she can't be friends with any other men\n-assumes that Heejung secretly has a boyfriend when he discovers Heejung crying about her mother and then retaliates by /pining her down/ and demanding to know why she lied to him about her relationship status\n-repeatedly drags Heejung off by the wrist and holds her down against her will/protests  \n\nUnlike the relationship between Heejung and her mother, the game fails to acknowledge that this behavior is abusive; disappointingly, it's even romanticizied. \n\nAll of the bunny routes managed to make up for extremely unhealthy relationships that Heejae had with Jisoo and, to a lesser degree, Jiyeon. If you value healthy relationships, you'll enjoy any of the bunny routes.  If I had to recommend one, though, it'd definitely be Jihae's route.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nDandelion - Wishes brought to you - is your standard otome game. You play a female protagonist, you fall in love, and Things Happen. While the story itself doesn't bring anything new to the table, it's (most of) the characters, the character development, and the way the game thoughtfully and respectfully address familial abuse that make Dandelion a stand-out title for me. Highly recommended.\n\nFinal ranking: 4/5", "timestamp_created": 1415339215, "timestamp_updated": 1415339215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12821299": {"recommendationid": "12821299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014552816", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 330, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446808677}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing, amazing game.

Each character's path is decently long, and has both good and bad ends. The stat-raising aspect actually requires a little strategizing (especially for some characters), and the MC is voice acted and has her own personality which varies a bit depending on whose path you're on.\n\nThe game has a nice mix of serious feels and light-hearted comedy, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any otome or romantic VN fans.

A million times yes! This is definitely worth the price if you're willing to splurge a little on a dating sim/otome game.\n\nCharacters and Story: 9.5/10\nThe personalities of each character as well as their corresponding backstories touched me deeply and made me cry every time. Jisoo and Jieun's especially. Story is tied into my rating for the characters because they are practically inseparable. The stories paired up with the personalities of the cast clearly define who they are and turn them into a wonderful group of characters that you grow incredibly attached to. Heejung's backstory is painfully relateable to the point that you just naturally sympathize or empathize with her. Each one of the guys also has a way of making their way into your heart as you try to understand and comfort them through the player character, Heejung. Those 29 hours were very much well spent considering how the range of emotions I went through as I played through each story. If I could go into detail about how I felt about each story individually, then we'd be here forever (and you'd have the whole game spoiled for you). My only problem in this section would just be very minor translation mistakes. It's played upon quite a bit for Jiyeon, but at times, the mistakes are a little obvious and out of place (especially at times where there is a tiny inconsistency with the name being said and the name being read). Fortunately, they don't badly interfere with the storyline, so I have no complaints.\n\nMusic+Voice Acting: 9.5/10\nOnce again, the soundtrack for this game is amazing and calming as well. It helped me relax during this stressful time (since I was in the middle of midterms not too long ago) and I truly wish I could get the soundtrack if it were being sold. Also, my reasoning for giving this a 9.5 would simply be due to the fact that the drastic changes between an intense situation and a regular day were a bit too quick for me. It's not exactly bad, but I guess I didn't have time to calm my heart after crying for a little while. I do like that the music fit the situations in the storyline very nicely though which truly added to the experience. As for the voice acting, I may not know much Korean (other than stuff from manhwa and K-pop which isn't a lot obviously), but I loved that the message, despite being in a completely different language, was still getting through. There is so much heart in their voices that it almost felt like you were Heejung and the guys were all talking to you.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\nDefinitely buy this if you have the money. You won't be disappointed in the least. There is a bit of stat raising which can be tedious at times (as they are in many otome games/dating sims), but the effort put into it goes a long way once you get to truly delve into this beautiful piece of work. Will I continue to play this after finishing the game? I already am. If you have the time (since this does take a good 3-4 hours per route not counting the common route bad ending) and the money, I suggest you buy this game if it interests you even the tiniest bit. You will not be sorry.\n\nOh. But on the downside, internet connection is a must.

It's also a story about how she changes for the better after having five pets thrown into her lap out of nowhere and deciding to adopt them. It's also about the strange origin of said five pets (three rabbits and two cats) and the mysterious pact they made with an individual known as The Wizard to win a \"game\" he's arranged them to play that involves Heejung's unwitting participation...\n\nAnd, of course, it's a story in which the player, depending on whose affection they raise the most, can help Heejung develop a romantic relationship with one of her five pets after they turn human.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The way Dandelion is structured is that each love interest has a route and their own plot, meaning that each character has different conditions needed to get their official good ending. The similarities between these routes is that they all need to have their affection maxed out (get all of their hearts!), their necessary stats need to reach a specific level before the end of the game and the player needs to collect 30 stamps of the character they're pursuing. There are five stats to keep an eye on in all: Femininity, Beauty, Art Skill, Stress and Pressure. The first three cap at level 20, whereas the last two you will want to make sure the gauge never fills up else you will end up with a non-standard game over. In addition to these, there is also the heart gauge that once filled allows you to unlock new actions or to diminish the effects of stress or pressure.\n\nStats can be raised by performing an action, such as watching the education channel by clicking the TV in the living room to lower pressure and raise art, or by going out with a character and choosing to not look around. You can go out with a character in both their pet and human form during the weekend or you can choose to go to work (and receive $40) or stay home. Choosing to go out during a weekday gives the options of shopping at either the item shop or bookstore or to go to work (for $10). Keeping an eye on Heejung's wallet is important since the items or books that can be bought can be used to either boost her stats (or diminish the effects of stress and pressure) or be given as gifts to the character the player is pursuing. Each character has different preferences for gifts so keep an eye out for that!\n\n*A word of advice!* Prioritize buying the eye medicine, which costs 200$. This is important since it allows the player to have more luck in finding useful items during the Look Around option during dates, which means better odds of finding stamps, stat-raising items or gifts.\n\nWhich leads me to detailing the specifics of dates! By choosing to go out with a love interest during the weekend, Heejung will get the option between choosing a stat raising action at the location of choice or of looking around. This is a fun little activity where you will be offered a bunch of random objects littered all over the background and you get to pick up three of them! Alternatively, you can quit the \"investigation\" at any time. Either way, the date ends and the game moves on to the next day.\n\nFinally, there's raising a love interest's affection. This can be done either by taking them on dates, as explained above, or by finding them somewhere in the house and choosing the action where they're hanging around and successfully performing an action they enjoy. (For example, Jisoo frequently hangs around the fridge.) Gifts can only be given to a love interest after they turn human. An affection-raising action has been successfully performed if a yellow or pink heart appears; blue hearts or the spikey black circle signify a failed action and WILL reduce affection points.\n\n***QUICK-SAVE BEFORE TRYING TO RAISE AFFECTIONS OR LOOKING AROUND DURING DATES*** There is no penalty for quick-loading several times and it will save you a lot of grief! You have about an in-game year to work on stats, so no need to stress, but better not to waste chances!\n\nBut enough about gameplay! LET US DISCUSS PLOT, PROTAGONIST AND LOVE INTERESTS.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game is told through Heejung's eyes as she struggles to get good grades in university for a job she doesn't want for a future she has no clear vision of. She's rather depressed and is questioning why she's working so hard for something she doesn't find rewarding, when one night, a mysterious individual bestows upon her the gift of suddenly finding herself to be a pet owner of three rabbits and two cats. Needless to say, when she wakes up to find a basket filled with five strange animals in her room, she initially freaks out, but over the course of the day (and week) she decides to take care of them, and afterwards becomes incredibly grateful for their presence in her life.\n\nHeejung, in my opinion, is a huge success of a protagonist. She's incredibly relatable, especially in this day and age when our generation is struggling to find work and pay and meaning in our lives. It's incredibly up-lifting to see Heejung change from being monotone and hopeless to finding time to sit back and relax and enjoy the world around her, not to mention it gives you a warm, happy feeling to see her getting attached to her newfound family. Her backstory is also incredibly real for many of us, and though I won't spoil it, I think that helps give players someone tangible to connect with.\n\nThat, and it's nice to not play a high school student for once, especially when you've graduated a while back already and are struggling with the realities and responsibilities of Being An Adult.\n\nThe five love interests that the player can have Heejung hook up with are as follow: Jisoo, the black cat; Jiyeon, the orange cat; Jihae, the silver rabbit; Jieun, the small white rabbit; and Jiwoo, the spotted rabbit. They all have their own personalities and struggles to deal with (all of them heavy in spoilers so I won't go in detail here), each with their own appeals and possible deal breakers.\n\nJisoo, for example, is always looking out for Heejung and cares deeply about her well-being, but he's also the jealous and possessive type. Jiyeon is sweet and caring but his particular deal-breaker is a spoiler, so I'll just advise people to be careful with that one, cute though his ears may be. Jiwoo is hilarious because he reads romance novels seriously and is also just an all around hilariously arrogant and superior-than-thou type of guy, but those exact same traits might not cut it for others who aren't impressed with people who act like a jerkwad towards the protagonist. (To be clear, Jiwoo is a tsundere: Harsh on the outside, sweet and loving on the inside. It requires work to reach that soft side to him, but for many it may be more than worth it. Or not.) Jihae is nothing if not polite and courteous and forever attentionate towards Heejung, but he might also come off as boring and flat. And finally, Jieun is PRECIOUS CUTIEPIE LITTLE BABY RABBIT LET ME PET YOUR HEAD, but, uh, he's. Kind of young. His route is pretty PG, though, but that might still break it for many.\n\nAll in all, each route adds more to the story and reveals aspects of their origin as the story progresses, making it worthwhile to play every route to gain access to the true ending. The bad endings are also worth gunning for, if only to complete the gallery and memory in the extras, but I suggest playing them last.\n\nDandelion is a fascinating story that probably hits close to home for many with supernatural elements thrown in. I strongly suggest it for anyone who likes good plots, quirky but believable characters and a realistic portrayal of how stressful but varied life and relationships can be.", "timestamp_created": 1414442734, "timestamp_updated": 1414442734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12660275": {"recommendationid": "12660275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157789785", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430096493}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game a few months after it first came out and am thrilled that it is getting the attention it deserves on Steam! I knew very little of this game before I bought it and was blow away by it.\n\nThe story deals with relatable, realistic problems; though there are some clich\u00e9 elements. The story is completely character-driven, which is something I like. The narration is well done, though there are typos. There are five routes plus one Bad End for four of the routes, making a total of nine times you\u2019ll have to play the game at least in order to complete everything. However if you mess up and don\u2019t get enough stamps to unlock some of the extras, you may find yourself playing routes over. The good thing about this game is that it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, yet can still make you sympathetic towards the characters.\n\nThe art work is fantastic. The artist did a great job at keeping a theme with the coloring and style. There is a background in almost all the CGs \u2013the ones that don\u2019t seem fine without. Only critic is that some CGs would have looked better if drawn from a different angle.\n\nThe background music does a good job at music setting the mood. I liked the soundtrack, however if you don\u2019t you can simply set the BGM to off and still hear the characters beautiful voices. The voice actors are what bring the characters to life. All the voice actors are talented and display their characters perfectly.\n\nEach character has a different backstory and character development that is believable and well-written.\n\nHeejung makes a great main character because she is someone easy to relate to or at least one the player will be able to sympathize with. Cheritz did the right thing by not making her a blank-insert for the player. It\u2019s better to have a relatable character than an insert for a story so character-driven. \n\nI have mixed feelings for Jisoo; I liked him in every route but his own. He is a \u201cbig-brother\u201d type character. I have a similar opinion of Jihae; I liked him, but hated his route. Jiyeon was my least favorite; I found him to be rather selfish, didn\u2019t enjoy his route either. Jiwoo was, to my surprise, my second favorite; he\u2019s silly but also serious at times. I think he was the one best suited for Heejung. Jieun was my favorite; his route is the happiest one in my opinion.\n\nFor the other characters there is not much to say: The wizard makes an interesting sort of \u201cvillain.\u201d I can\u2019t say more without spoilers. Other minor characters, such as classmates and Heejung\u2019s mother, serve their purpose.\n\nLastly there are a few things that should be mentioned: I\u2019d recommend playing the demo first. It is a stat-based game, which I love but I know other otome gamers despise. Everyone has personal opinions, so you may hate or love most of the characters. Many people complain about the price of the game, however it is long and you are likely to replay it and it is nowhere near some of the prices of otome games from Japan.

Sure Dandelion can be fun to play, but it's also SO much more than that. Dandelion's an immersive story that feels like it\u2019s from another world. Yet, at the same time, it\u2019s incredibly realistic. It addresses many themes such as self-worth, acceptance and sacrifice. Cheritz handles these themes with utmost care and it delivers to the audience.\n\nART:\nThe art is absolutely stunning. The colours are bright and vibrant. The characters all stand out and are very diverse in their appearances. I must admit, the visuals were the first thing that caught my attention. Both the sprites and CGs were very well done. \n\nSTAT RAISING:\nWhile at first, the stat raising in the game was fun and cute. Over time, it became repetitive and tiring to do for all the routes. Although, the pain of it all will be worth it for the characters and story. \n\nVOICE ACTING:\nAll the voice actors portrayed each character amazingly. They displayed a wide variety of emotions for every scene. I really felt the character\u2019s personalities shone through their voices. I also really liked how Heejung was voiced too. \n\nMUSIC:\nI really have to praise Cheritz on their music. The different character songs suit their respective characters and some made me laugh too.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nHeejung was a fantastic heroine. She is kind and caring, but has a teasing snarky side to her at the same time. I also really liked how relateable she was. It's nice to see how she develops throughout the game and how she comes to terms with her inner battles.\n\nEach guy was vastly different from each other and I ended up falling in love with them all. Though, I must admit, Jiwoo ended up being my personal bias from the game. The interactions between the guys themselves was very fun to watch as well.\n\nOVERALL:\nDandelion is a wonderful visual novel and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1414386603, "timestamp_updated": 1470666783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12652192": {"recommendationid": "12652192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142521099", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419415298}, "language": "english", "review": "Dandelion covers the story of Heejung who is a very studious young adult lady who spends most of her time attempting to become the ideal well-rounded student... but it's not what she really wants. She's pulled ahead by the invisible guide that her strict mom has set for her in life, but if you asked her what she wanted herself she wouldn't know what to say.\n \nTo an otome game regular, I thought she was a refreshing heroine who is quite relatable and strongly written, which can be a rarity in otome games sometimes. Her troubles form an important part of the story and I found it interesting how she ended bonding with the datable cast and changing along with them.\n\nNot everything in Dandelion is played straight and all the guys have hidden secrets for you to discover throughout the game, which adds an interesting dimension to what may seem like a silly stat-raising game where you date animal boys. That being said, the story is fairly well-written in terms of depth of character, but keep in mind that this is a game meant for dating pretty boys at heart. You may not find this game to be entertaining if you don't like said pretty boys. Ahem.\n\nAnyway, it's difficult to explain the charms of the game without spoiling the story, so I'll try summarizing briefly the different points:\n\n\u2661 Charming and non-intrusive BGM\n\u2661 Attractive and stylish art\n\u2661 The translation is surprisingly good, though the prose may not be everyone's cup of tea\n\u2661 Solid game design and system lacking bugs\n\u2661 Relatable conflict and emotional character developments\n\u2661 Full voice acting (heroine included!)\n\nWhat you may find to be drawbacks, however, are:\n\nX Prose not as strong as, say, an original English visual novel [i](but don't let that fool you, it's not like it's unreadable, but don't expect a flawless example of the height in literature)[/i]\nX There is some awkward anatomy in the art, but I wouldn't say it's overwhelming and it's generally fairly solid.\nX Long sessions of stat-raising with very little to break the melancholy once you've satisfied the stat requirements.\n\t[i]---(The stat-raising system can be repetitive after a while but it is fully functional. I think this may be preferable to those who dislike the long sessions of reading a straight visual novel may require or those who are new to the genre altogether.\nEven if you dislike the stat-raising system, I'd say it's worth trucking through anyway if you would like the story. Keep in mind that the story has more meat on it than you may glean from the description provided, but  you can scratch the surface by playing the demo. I think that will provide you with at least the bare bones to determine if trudging through the stat-raising system to enjoy the story is worth it or not for you.)[/i]\nX Unexpected character developments you may not be pleased with [i](never without proper justification, though)[/i]\nX It's very easy to get lost without a walkthrough, though it is possible to get through if you're willing to make mistakes [i](which will sacrifice you much time unless you remember to create individual saves often)[/i].\n\nI'd recommend this game to those who will form an attachment to the characters because this is one of the game's strengths, those who can enjoy stories that aren't all sunshine and don't feel that stories that will not provide full  closure are weaker for it.\n\t[i]---(Cheritz has always been ambiguous but I don't consider it to be a weakness. Their strength lies in the characters and their relatable conflicts and not the clean tying of knots for a satisfying ending, so to speak.)[/i]\n\nIf you're none of these, I can't really guarantee your full enjoyment of the game. In my own opinion, the game had many lovely moments though I couldn't come to like every character. Cheritz didn't fail to make it generally clear why they were the way they were, however. I strongly suggest playing the demo to have a taste of the stat-raising system because it really is a large part of the game and  the padding to express the passage of time. If you can't stand it, it will be hard to play because it's an unavoidable area. On the other hand, I know many who chose to play despite disliking stat-raising, myself being one of them. I found going through the stat-raising I usually abhor to read the story to be worth it in the end. \n\nCheers.", "timestamp_created": 1414385052, "timestamp_updated": 1414385097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683984", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12651154": {"recommendationid": "12651154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025069330", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414469561}, "language": "english", "review": "Dandelion is one of my favorite otome games. You play as Heejung, a college student who's dissatisfied with her daily routine and is trying to find her place in life. This routine is completely disrupted when two cats and three rabbits are mysteriously left in her home. Heejung slowly warms up to her new pets, who make her happy for the first time a long while. But lo and behold, Heejung is shocked to come home one day to find her pets have turned into humans! On top of their strange transformation, Heejung keep hearing mention of a \"game\" set up by an enigmatic Wizard. Who will be the winner?\n\nHeejung, the heroine of the game, is one of the standout characters of this game. In many other otome games, the main character is usually bland so the player is able to self-insert themselves into the story. That\u2019s not the case with Heejung; she\u2019s a fully realized character with her own fears and goals for the future. Her constant worry about needing to be the best to please her overbearing mother is something that really struck a chord with me. \n\nThe 5 main guys are all very likeable in their own ways (although I will admit the jealously streak that one character showed throughout his route annoyed me.) Not everyone is who they appear to be on the surface, and as Heejung gets close to each boy, you begin to unravel their past and true personalities. \n\nThe gameplay includes raising stats in Femininity, Beauty, and Art Skills by performing a number of different tasks around Heejung\u2019s apartment and raising affection with her beau. Raising the stats can get tedious at times, but there\u2019s enough variety in activities that it never truly gets boring.\n\nThe art in this game is wonderful; each CG was a treat. The in-game music was nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. (I really like the Wizard's theme a lot though.) The opening song is also probably my favorite opening of any visual novel I've played.\n\nAs of writing this review, I\u2019ve completed 4 of the 5 routes in the game. (I\u2019m saving Jiwoo for last because I know he\u2019s going to be my favorite <3). Each route tugs at your heart strings, and the endings are bittersweet. When a game gets you so invested that you cry, you know it\u2019s doing its job right. \n\nSo in closing, I\u2019d highly recommended this game for someone looking for a good story with lovable characters.

In the English community, otomes are not an extremely popular subgenre. It\u2019s fairly common for companies not to bother with an official translation of their game, and the ones that we do get are often games of fairly subpar quality, obviously meant to try and make the player pay as much as possible for things such as energy points. I had been hoping for something better, however, and after hearing about Dandelion from some friends soon after it\u2019s release, I purchased the game with high hopes. Did it live up to my standards?\nThe short answer is: It most certainly did, for many reasons.\n\nStory: Heejung is a young adult attending college. She has a past of being emotionally abused by her mother, which has led her to be depressed and constantly in a state where she feels stressed and pressured by the expectations she feels like she must live up to. Things begin to change when one day, she discovers a basket of animals, two cats and three rabbits, has somehow been left in her room. After some consideration, Heejung decides to raise these animals, and to her surprise, after a while, she discovers they have all turned into human boys!\n\nThe plot seems silly at first glance when you consider the idea of \u201cdating pets,\u201d but I was easily drawn into the game\u2019s world. It sets up many questions about why exactly these animals were left to Heejung, where they come from, and their pasts. No character is as simple on the surface as you may wish to assume, and everyone is developed very well in their routes. I found everyone to be sympathetic on some level in a unique way. The characters all have very distinct personalities as well, and stand out from one another.\n\nI was also impressed by the protagonist, Heejung. I believe Cheritz has written a very realistic and believable depiction of depression in her character. As someone who has dealt with these issues myself, I found her extremely relatable and she was a character I was always happy to see become more happy and confident over the course of the game. Some people accuse otome protagonists of being boring, but I personally do not believe that is the case with Heejung.\n\n\nGameplay: Dandelion stands out a bit from other visual novels in that it has a different sort of mechanic from what you normally expect of a visual novel dating sim. You spend a fair amount of the game simply managing Heejung\u2019s day to day life by choosing activities for her to partake in during the day. Depending on what you choose to do, different stats of hers will either increase or decrease. Not being careful with your stats can lead to a game over. And depending on what you decide to do, you can run into one of the boys and begin building affection points with them. Not paying attention to your affection points can also lead to a bad ending. This is quite different from the typical dating sim, where you normally just sit through scenes and choose an option every now and then for dialogue. I found this style of gameplay a refreshing change of pace and an interesting difference.\n\nThe only real problem I have is that every now and then you can find typos in the dialogue, but luckily they\u2019re actually fairly easy to miss if you\u2019re not paying a ton of attention and don\u2019t normally affect the flow of a sentence. I do, however, think that it may be beneficial in the future for Cheritz to have a native English speaker help proofread the script.\n\n\nArt: Like I mentioned above, I\u2019ve played a lot of subpar otomes. In a lot of them, the art isn\u2019t too great, and is often very awkward looking in regards to anatomy. I was extremely relieved to find that the art in Dandelion, which is all originally drawn for the game, is nothing short of beautiful.\n\nThe anatomy seems quite fine to me, as there was nothing that jumped out to me in any of the character sprites or CGs that looked off at all.\n\nThe colors are actually one of my favorite parts of the art. The palette is very bright and colorful, which matches the game\u2019s tone extremely well. The brightness however, isn\u2019t overwhelming at all, and all the colors used mix together quite well for a very pleasant arrangement.\nThe backgrounds used are also quite well drawn. Perspective appears to be quite on point, and they are all quite detailed and well-drawn.\n\n\nMusic: The music in the game is quite catchy, but I never found it distracting. Every piece used fits the mood of the scene well. I also enjoyed both the opening and ending themes used quite a bit. While there wasn\u2019t any music I considered particularly stand out or felt I immediately had to have on my ipod, it was all enjoyable and certainly not bad at all.\n\n\nOverall: If you\u2019re searching for an otome game of decent quality, with good art, story, music, and characters, this is it. Dandelion is sure to be an enjoyable experience for anyone who enjoys these kinds of games, and I would very quickly recommend it to anyone who is interested. Of course, I cannot guarantee it is for everyone, as anyone who is looking for something more \u201cmanly\u201d or with more intense gameplay won\u2019t find that here, but it\u2019s really quite obvious that isn\u2019t who Cheritz is interested in pleasing. Their slogan, \u201cSweet Solutions for Female Gamers\u201d shows exactly what they\u2019re trying to accomplish, and I\u2019d say Dandelion certainly lives up to that.

And in otome games, you will very likely play through each character\u2019s route, which makes about five playthoughs in Dandelion \u2013 more, if you don\u2019t get the best endings on your first try.\nA New Game+ feature would be a very nice addition and save you from clicking through the same fluff text again and again and again.\nAlso, let\u2019s be honest here, stat-raising (and the hidden-item minigame) just ends in reloading until you get exactly the character interaction you wanted or find the item you were looking for. And that\u2019s rather boring.\n\n[b]Storyline[/b]\n\nYou play as Heejung, a stressed and lonely university student with an extremely overbearing mother. One day, a basket full of animals \u2013 two cats and three rabbits \u2013 myteriously appears in her room. Said animals soon turn into attractive men with cute ears and a lot of baggage, from the butler-like angora rabbit to the bad boy black cat.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that Heejung herself has a lot of baggage. Actually, Heejung\u2019s anxieties were a big draw for me. She feels much more like a realized character than most blank slate otome protagonists. \nHeejung grows as a character in each route, and even better, the male characters\u2019 arcs mirror Heejung\u2019s own development, which is really cool. It\u2019s really satisfying when both parties change and grow.\nPrepare for many a tear-jerking moment along each route \u2013 and for bitter-sweet endings.\n\nAs a warning: There is some problematic stuff in some of the romances, like physical violence and one character strays dangerously close to a shotacon (an absolute no-go for me).\n\n[b]Artwork[/b]\n\nCertainly one of the game\u2019s high points. Each and every one of the characters looks gorgeous both ingame and in CGs and has a lot of different facial reactions \u2013 including cute ear movements. Special mention to Jisoo\u2019s drooping ears when he sulks and Jieun\u2019s surprised expression when you wear your facial mask\u2026\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nDo I recommend the game? Absolutely.

This is my first time putting together a review, so bear with me.  I'll be dividing this post into 5 sections:  Plot, Individual Characters, Technical Features/Gameplay, Sound, and Art.  This will be a spoiler-free review.  If anyone wishes for my thoughts with spoilers on anyone else, I\u2019d be happy to post that as well.\n\n\nPLOT\nThe overall plot is simply amazing.  I have to admit, I was preparing myself to be thrown into a ball of stereotypes and other redundant plot devices & themes.  Fortunately though, there are a bunch of surprises and twists, and the game does a good job of making use of the cliches it has, while avoiding many others.  Don\u2019t let these lovely, cute-looking pets in the beginning of the game fool you - you\u2019re in for some pain.    \n\nINDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS\nJiyeon:  Unfortunately, his route felt incredibly short (due to plot reasons), and because of this, I did not have the desired period of time to become attached to his character.  Not only that, but many of his actions weren\u2019t really...appealing.  At all.  Overall, I felt he was the person who should least be with Heejung.\n\nJieun:  I liked Jieun more than I thought I would.  At first, I had thought his plot was going down a cliche path, but it diverted from such and I\u2019m very happy it did so.  The story in this route was unique, and there\u2019s much more to him than meets the eye.  There was plenty of surprises for me, especially since I did this route before Jihae\u2019s.  He goes though most character development, hands down.  As you might\u2019ve guessed, you get to learn plenty about Jihae as well, which is why I actually suggest doing Jihae before Jieun if you would like to be surprised about his backstory.  Out of everyone, I felt that he was the healthiest for Heejung.\n\nJisoo:  I expected to love this gluttonous dork.  Surprisingly...he was in the middle for me, due to a quality of his that you\u2019ll run into...that isn\u2019t healthy.  What I like about his path the most though, is that I feel that Heejung's own path in life was most recognized here, and she probably had the most personal growth here.  His route felt much longer than the others, with my personal favorite set of CG\u2019s (besides the Wizard\u2019s of course) in the game.  It also had some great, unexpected twists, so it was definitely a good route nonetheless, just not the best.  His ending was definitely top-notch though.  I feel that out of everyone, Jisoo had the largest motivation for winning the game.  My big tip for his route is that femininity does not matter nearly as much as your art skill and beauty, so definitely focus on raising those two up the most.  \n\nJiwoo:  Being the biggest dork you encounter, this dude is hilarious.  It\u2019s definitely a good route to play right in the middle of all the heaviness of the game.  This route had to be my personal favorite, and this ending was the only one that had me absolutely bawling.\n\nJihae: First and foremost, if you want to be surprised by his backstory, do not play Jieun\u2019s route first.  Jieun\u2019s route will reveal a lot about Jihae, so I recommend playing Jihae\u2019s route before Jieun\u2019s.  With that being said, this route was good.  Although I felt Heejung's comments about how beautiful he is and etc., quite redundant, eventually I got used to it because hey - he IS pretty hot.  He probably had some of the most beautiful CG\u2019s as well.\n\nWizard:  I love this guy.  He\u2019s just so interesting.  There\u2019s really not much to say without completely spoiling his character, but personal story was probably my favorite - you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nHeejung:  The heroine is actually my favorite part of this game.  I feel that anyone that has ever attended school, basically almost everyone, can relate to her - myself included.  The feeling of loneliness, of wanting to change, or the desire to know what it is you want to do in life, many of us have such wishes.  Especially the feeling of having to satisfy everyone else, forgetting you, yourself in the process.  In addition, her reactions to her situation, I believe, are realistic.  I could write an entire essay on how much I love her character.\n\nMy recommended play order for each character would be Jiyeon > Jisoo > Jiwoo > Jihae > Jieun.  Although many people recommend doing Jieun first to get used to the gameplay mechanics, I believe that if you\u2019re looking for gradual plot progression, his route is fantastic to leave last.\nMy personal rankings for each route are Jiyeon <<<<< Jisoo <<< Jihae < Jieun < Jiwoo.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FEATURES/GAMEPLAY:\nFirst and foremost, I must mention the sprites.  I personally love how their mouths move, and how they actually blink.  Just small tidbits like this bring much more life to each character.  In addition, other little things such as the dandelions floating around the title screen, the leaves during fall, snowflakes during winter, etc. were all beautiful as well.  Secondly, I'd like to address the stat-raising aspect.  While it's cute and fun at first, it quickly becomes quite redundant.  Had it not been so repetitive, it would have been much more enjoyable.  It almost feels as if stat-raising takes up more of a route than the actual plot.  Other then that, the gameplay is pretty much standard visual novel gameplay - simply clicking.  \nThe game possesses all the basic features you\u2019d expect:  Auto, skip, CG gallery, etc.  In addition, (and I loved this) the game features a special section where you can use the stamps you find on the routes to unlock bonus art - basically some concept art of the character, and an image of them (presumably after each ending) as their future self, whether it be human or not.  I HIGHLY recommend you try and unlock these, as they are simply stunning.  AN IMPORTANT THING YOU MUST KNOW (that I sadly didn\u2019t ;-;) is that every time you start a new route, you must start a new game, or else your stamps will not be there by the time you finished the route.  I\u2019m one of those people that likes to make a save file right before the first choice (while you\u2019re on the common route) and go from there for each route, but unfortunately if you want your stamps, don\u2019t make the same mistake as me.  Another tip I\u2019d like to add is that if you\u2019re interested in looking for stamps, work EVERY weekend until you reach at least $1200, then buy at least 6 visual improvement medications, to get increased eyesight out of the way - trust me, if you don\u2019t want to flip over a table, you\u2019ll increase your eyesight to at least 8 so you don\u2019t have keep quick-saving and loading on a date to find stamps.  \n\n\nSOUND\nThe voice acting is wonderful, what else can I say?  And while most side characters wouldn't get voices or sprites, Cheritz put in the extra effort to include them as well - Heejung\u2019s mom, Heejae, etc.  Even Heejung has a voice, and it\u2019s rare for heroine\u2019s to be voiced as well.  Extra props to Jiyeon\u2019s voice actor, you\u2019ll know why.\n\n\nART\nThe art in this game is simply gorgeous.  I think I stared at the title screen for a few solid minutes when I first purchased the game.  The chibi\u2019s during the stat-raising activities are adorable.  The vibrant colors fit the hopeful, cheery atmosphere the game possesses.  In addition, the garments for each character are designed in amazing detail, respective to each of their positions in the society back in their world.  For example, while Jihae's clothing may appear fancy enough that he could be mistaken as a noble like Jiwoo, that is not the case:  The colors are more diluted, and it's much less bejeweled in comparison.  It is not too difficult to find a visual novel with good sprites, but most of the time, the CGs are disproportionate.  That is not the case with Dandelion.  Funnily enough, it's CGs are actually higher in quality overall, compared to its successor, Nameless, which had some wonky-looking images (beautiful but occasionally disproportionate).", "timestamp_created": 1414253811, "timestamp_updated": 1414259509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12626961": {"recommendationid": "12626961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086436001", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442546789}, "language": "english", "review": "Dandelion is an Outrageous game! \nOutrageously and hysterically funny and surprisingly deep once you get into it!\n\nYou play as a senior student, Heejung Kim who has moved to Busan from her perfectionistic and nagging Mother.\nShe hopes to find her own path in life in this new town and is a great student, but not knowing what she truly wants from life and not having much self-esteem from her past, she keeps stressing about being the perfect girl and being pushed down from pressure of korean society and the insane ideals of her Mother. \nSo much that she has frequent flasbacks and nightmares, this being her trauma. \n\nOne fateful morning the meowing of a cat wakes her up.\nHeejung lives alone, but now a basket of 5 animals is lying next to her bed!

You start out with 5 adoreable pets(2 Cats and 3 Rabbits). Even though they change from pets to a bunch of dudes(with animal ears), Heejung decides to let them stay on the condition that they wear hats or hoodies to hide their ears when necessary.\nBuild up relationship points by interacting with them in your apartment, and occasionally by bringing them out for walks/dates. How you respond to events also affects your relationships, and the status of Heejung herself ofcourse.\n\nYour adoreable pets are as follows;\n\n*Jihae - The Silver Rabbit\nThe beautiful, princely and mature one of the bunch, Heejung and Jihae seem to share an interest in art.\nHe takes much care and responsibilty over Jihae and is stunning enough to be a model.\n\n*Jieun - The Pure White Rabbit\nThe (shouta)youngest of the bunch, a quiet, gentle and closest to (Eddie..)Jihae.\nHe loves apples to the point of being addicted and doesn't talk much at first, being very thoughtful.\n\n*Jiwoo - The Spotted(Cow) Rabbit\nFrom the start he isn't the most social one of the bunch, nor the politest one.\nHe is however perhaps the most intellectual one! Stuck-up and rude, but smart rabbit. Can you say Tsundere!\n\n*Jisoo - The Black Cat\nThe badboy if you will. He seems rough at first, but clearly has a soft spot for food!\nHe also likes to tease Heejung, but doesn't mean any harm. Just being a playful cat afterall...\n\n*Jiyeon - The Orange Cat\nThe adoreable sweetheart of the bunch, rarely seen without a big smile on his face.\nHe seems very pure and childish at first and even makes several small language mistakes.\nA charming heartbreaker!\n\nTry not to let stress or pressure take over completly, or you might end up collapsing like a squished pudding with Heejae, your classmate. He seems sweet and is certainly caring for you, but is sadly your BAD ENDING!\nSo focus that doki doki on your pets! (wow, that sounds slightly wrong..)\n\nYou'll quickly learn how quick save/load is your best friend through gameplay while balancing stress, pressure and raising ceratin stats for certain characters. Whenever you need to check your staus, wallet, items(some can raise stats) and relationship progress, just right click and well.. click status on the menu!\n\nOnce you progress through the story it's easy to fall inlove with the personalities of the characters, the CG artwork is neat and sets the mood, and learning their stories I find myself wanting to play more and more and get to know each character. My personal favourite so far is without a doubt Jihae, but that might quickly change within the other routes as I've been focusing on this rare silver rabbitman's route. \nI enjoy seeing how the story progresses in a steady pace of growing feelings from being awkward at first to eventually blooming a romance to adoreable CG artwork.\nAs for music, my opinion is mixed. Some of the looping music became quite annoying which made me hope for more variation(to my relief that the next season change had another loop), but some of the bgm was very enjoyable.\nI think music-wise it is more of a preference thing. However, the User Interface was absolutely to my taste!\nWell organized, easy and very practical to the game (quick save/load, how I love it!)\n\nAll in all I'd say Dandelion is absolutely a game worth playing if you enjoy rich stories with colourful characters, and the fate of the protagonist lying in your hands!

Each character has a unique and interesting personality, as well as a well developed back story. Not to mention, the story itself is really interesting. \n\nAs far as replayability goes, this is a game that is easily replayed over and over. Each path has it's own collection of cutscenes, so it keeps the story fresh and there is a skip option so you can speed through scenes you've already seen. So far, I've completed the game twice with two different paths and I'm still excited to play again. This game is full of feels too. \n\nMechanically, it plays well too. The inclusion of a quick save button is helpful in making sure you achieve the interactions and results that you're striving for. But there's also plenty of room to explore the details of the game so you can learn the best way to get what you want. Since most paths have both a good and bad ending, if you mess up, it's not a big deal. You can just replay and go for a different ending.\n\nSome of the English translation is a little rough sometimes, but it's still understandable and doesn't take away from the quality of the game. Plus, the characters all have a voice actor that can be turned on or off - granted, they say the lines in Korean, but I think it's a nice touch to hear the emotion behind the lines. There's also a nice inclusion of CG and artwork for the different characters that you can look at and a couple that you can unlock for each character.\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful game and I definitely recommend checking it out.", "timestamp_created": 1414227345, "timestamp_updated": 1414227345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12621079": {"recommendationid": "12621079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098590985", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430116734}, "language": "english", "review": "Previously, I have already played the game before it was released into steam and honestly I wouldn\u2019t mind playing this game over and over again. Here\u2019s why: \n\nIn terms of art, music, and story, I think this game has done a good job focusing on all these aspects.\n\nThe art is consistant, anatomy is fine, colors are bright and CGs are all different yet, suiting. Giving you a reason to collect them all. Character designs are also lovely and suit with their personality and voices nicely, with the animals having 2 types of clothes, the modern one and fantasy one is also a very good call.\n\nThe music is nice no matter where you're at, and it doesn't get annoying (IMO the best would be the opening and ending songs of course).\n\nNow the story, were do I being? Originally when I saw the game I was expecting a thick headed happy-go-lucky kind of protagonist, but nope! Heejung (The protagonist) is not only smart, down to earth, and caring; she also carries in herself a short of dark past. The game is constantly giving out new surprises throughout the story, and is excellent at pulling heartstrings. I even found myself going through all the good and bad endings (Something I don't do if the stories/endings are too similar or predictable). I also love how most events also bring in some of the other characters in the game. Certain otome games(dating simulations/visual novels) tend to isolate the main character and the love interest, but in many routes, there's still interaction between them and the rest of the characters. \n\nNow for secrets and bonus content. Other than just the usual 'get cgs throughout the route', the game also includes an amusing minigame that allows you to collect stamps of a certain character and unlock a bonus cg and the concept sketches. Another thing I liked is that the actual ending is after the beautiful credits, and the fact the credits would show all the CGs previously seen for that route, making it worth watching~\n \nThe only one thing I didn't like much was that the bonus was 'voice only', meaning to say since I didn't understand korean (in case you didn't know the game is voice and originally was in korean) I didn't understand what they were saying.

The premise revolves around two cats and three rabbits mysteriously being brought into the protagonist's home, then taking on a human form. How did they find their way into Heejung's home? What is the \"game\" they keep talking about, and what is Heejung's role in it? These questions are answered throughout the game's multiple routes, encouraging replays until all are completed and all of the story's pieces come together. \n \nHeejung is a very likeable and relateable protagonist. Unlike the majority of dating sim protagonists, who lack personality and backstory for the sake of \"immersion,\" Heejung has a life and personality all her own. Watching Heejung handle her conflicts, such as an overbearing mother and her uncertainty of what to do with her future, makes her an enjoyable and relateable character. \n \n[i]Dandelion[/i]'s dateable candidates offer a variety of personalities and backstories. They all feature a level of complexity that can only be experienced by playing their route. Their diverse plots and reasonings for participating in the \"game\" results in wanting to know these characters beyond their initial introductions. The stories pull at your heart, with just the right amount of silliness sprinkled in with the sincerity. Each route is a fair length, and the voice acting is stellar, bringing life to each of the characters in conjunction with their bright, animated portraits. \n \nGameplay is simple point-and-click, doing various activities to raise your stats, and interacting with the men to boost their affinity for you. The Stats menu lets you know if your stats are high enough to keep going down the character's good route, and you are given ample time to raise them, making playthroughs fairly straightforward. \n \nFeatures such as Auto, Skip, and Quick Save/Load make replaying the game for different routes convenient.

If you\u2019re looking for a subpar dating sim, you will have to look elsewhere, because Dandelion is very well put-together and a blast to play. The graphics are very nice and the characters are interesting and adorable in different ways. The stories for the different boys are very cool to learn about over time and the mysterious voice from somewhere is, uh, very mysterious. Very [i]I-don\u2019t-explain-anything-but-I-imply-that-there-is-a-huge-background-here-wink-wink-to-those-who-have-played-the-game-enough[/i]. So yeah, very mysterious to me. One of the only issues that I had with it was the typos that popped up sometimes, but overall the translation was well done. They did a very good job of maintaining the sweet, giving nature of Heejung while also revealing her struggles and discontent. She can almost seem too placid, but it is understandable, given her past, and as the game moves forward, she does show signs of a backbone as she comes in to her own (thanks, furry adorableness?), which I whole-heartedly approve of.\n\nIt takes some time to recognize the voices and names (very creative, Heejung\u2026lots of J\u2019s @_@) but once you do, it becomes very easy to know who is speaking during scenes that don\u2019t show faces. The different colors help and the personalities are so unique from one another that it becomes clear pretty quickly. The stat system is very intensive if you want to buff them all out, but the options are cute and for some of the boys, it\u2019s important to max out your stats as quickly as possible. Just think of it as primping and sketching your way to the top. I actually do enjoy the grind, because the little illustrations are cute and it\u2019s nice to become beautiful just by taking a bath. Unfortunately there have been no side effects in real life.\n\nThe most important thing that you should keep in mind when playing this game is FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS FURRY AND CUTE DO [b]NOT[/b] TRY TO GAIN HEARTS FROM ALL OF THEM. You may think, \u2018Oh that\u2019d be nice to be friends with all of them! I\u2019ll just hang out with everyone and become a more well-rounded person!\u2019 That is the quickest path to a bad ending, except in a few special cases, which I'm sure you'll figure out after a couple of hours of playing. \n\nYes. \n\nI was there.\n\n Let me lay out the scene for you:\nThere I was on a different guy\u2019s route, when I thought I would go out on the weekend and have a nice, friendly lunch with Jiwoo, you know? Just two buds hanging out and becoming even better friends. Maybe he\u2019d even stop calling me stupid one day! During lunch, he says something about me feeding him, and being the desperate-for-points-and-new-interactions player I am, I chose the \u2018Open wiiiide\u201d option, thinking it was a little weird, but hey, I don\u2019t judge friendships. Then he goes and says something about not dating any other boys. And if I were really Heejung, I would have stopped in my tracks and wondered, \u2018You think we\u2019re dating?!?!\u2019 But of course, I am not her, and the game just continued on, unmindful to the fact that it had just rocked my world. When I started the game, I thought that Heejung was very oblivious when it came to boys, which was cute but almost a little much. Now, I know the horrid truth. I am JUST as [b]oblivious[/b] and [b]stupid[/b] about boys as a main protagonist of a DATING simulator. TT_TT\n\nLet\u2019s just say there is one bad ending in particular which is more than a little traumatizing and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it last night. On the bright side, they did an excellent job of unobtrusively sliding you into an abusive and very dangerous relationship, with you torn between thinking there is something very wrong, and thinking that it will turn out okay once he calms down. \n\nHe didn\u2019t calm down.\n\n I am still a bit emotionally scarred and I have been hesitant to play his good route (I just need some recovery time\u2026). I recommend you get all the good endings before you try to get the bad endings for completeness\u2014that way you\u2019ll still be able to sleep at night without thinking someone\u2019s going to be hovering over your bed. Following you to the bathroom\u2026not letting you talk to people\u2026scarring the actual player for real\u2026or maybe that\u2019s just me. But, what the heck, do whatever you like! [strike](It\u2019s your funeral)[/strike]\n\nOn a completely random side note, I like to pretend that the silver-haired man in the city panoramic scene that pops up once in a while is actually the main protagonist from Persona 4 (just to spice up the scenery for me). Unfortunately, no matter how many times I click on him, he does not become a dateable furball of cuteness. But I can just imagine him as a large darker gray-haired rabbit, majestically lording over everyone in King\u2019s Game.

This is why Steam only claims I have played this game for a few hours.*\nBasic plot: \nA college student, Heejung, is living alone in her apartment. The influence of her overbearing mother forces Heejung to frequently second guess herself. To add onto her worries, Heejung wakes up one day to find a basket of five animals next to her bed. She questions where they came from but accepts them as her own after a week or so. Now she must take care of five animals and manage her college expenses. Things only get more complicated when they turn into humans.\n\nThe Gameplay: \nThis game is classified as a visual novel but is more of a stat raising game with visual novel elements. The player must focus on raising their relationships with each of the available suitors while maintaining high femininity, art, and beauty. However, the stress and pressure levels must remain low. Doing activities such as going to work or taking a shower will change the stat levels. The key is to find a balance as to what activities raise the most stats while raising the stress and pressure levels as little as possible.\n\nEach suitor has stats that they prefer. Some have lower standards, while other have higher standards. If the requirements are met within a certain period, usually 1-2 months, an event will occur. Unlike other visual novels where the player picks different options to make an event occur, the stat raising activates the event. When an event occurs, there are no text options to make. I felt that the stat raising element was a nice change from the other visual novels I have played. Having to watch my stats kept my interest and made it hard to stop playing the game.\nThere are even collectible stamps. When you get enough of them for each character, it unlocks bonus content.\n\nThe Characters:\nI feel that the character development is one of the best parts of the game. The stat raising game play allows close interaction with each of the characters. The characters are confined to one house most of the time so the player is forced to interact with each. There are not a lot of events for each character, maybe seven or so. That means that whenever an event occurs, something important is bound to happen. I commend Cheritz for creating characters with faults. For most visual novels, the heroine seems to be either perfect while the options have faults or vice versa. In this game, both the heroine and the characters have problems. This, added together with the stat raising actions, gives the game a sense of relatability.\n\nThe Voice Acting: \nEach voice matched the characters perfectly. I have no complaints. The voice actors of the cats even meowed; that is dedication at its\u2019 finest.\n\nThe Music: \nThe background music often sounds like elevator music, but surprisingly, that is not a bad thing. The music matches the calmness of a house or a stroll around the park. As a whole, the soundtrack is very happy. There are only a few songs for perilous situations, the rest are very calming. I really liked the OP song as well.\n\nThe Art:\nThe artists for the game are absolutely amazing. I am assuming that the CG artist and the sprite artist are different people since the CG\u2019s look different than the sprites. However, the CG\u2019s still look beautiful. The backgrounds stay consistent from behind the sprite to the background of a CG in the same room. The interface is drawn to look like a notebook and has very cute flowers and drawings throughout.\n\nPositive Aspects:\nHere is a list of some of the best qualities of Dandelion.\n-All of the characters have distinct personalities; none of the characters are alike.\n-The art is consistent.\n-The music matches the scene.\n-Having to raise stats keeps the player engaged.\n-Having the characters live together forces the characters to form relationships. These relationships are explored throughout each route, stay consistent, and add to character development.\n-Players of both genders could enjoy the game.\n-The main character is not a \u2018wall flower\u2019. \n-The main character develops alongside the suitors. Heejung changes for the better as the game progresses.\n-The game has \u2018collectibles\u2019 that the player can hunt for on dates.\n-The opening theme song is amazing.\n-The primary bad endings made sense for each character given their personalities.\n\nBad Aspects: \nHere is a list of minor complaints.\n-To get the best end for one of the characters, another character must like you a decent amount as well. The game fails to make this obvious. I was half way through the route before I realized I was on a bad path that I could not fix.\n-There was no true route for Heejae. \n-One character is significantly harder to satisfy. Some people, like me, may do his route first and fail a lot. If you are like me, playing his route first makes the other routes extremely easy.\n-It was never clearly stated that the game ends in  about a year. It only shows signs of ending a month before the game actually ends. For their first route, players will probably be scrambling at the end, reloading past saves just to raise their stats high enough by the end of the month.\n-It is not always clear what option is considered the best on dates.\n-Some of the character\u2019s required stat levels did not make sense when you take their personality traits into account. (I cannot explain this further without spoiling anything).\n-The translation had minimal errors; Jisoo\u2019s route seemed to have the most errors and the \u2018Special\u2019 menu\u2019s \u2018back to title\u2019 button was still in Korean. Otherwise, the translation was pretty good. \n\nAspects that will be good to some but bad to others:\n-Since the options are living with the player and are treated as pets in the beginning, it takes a while for any romance to start. \n-Events are caused by raising stats instead of dialogue options.\n-All routes connect to each other in some way.\n-All of the endings except for maybe one ended abruptly. The endings are left to interpretation.\n-The ability to quick save at almost any time makes the game really easy to get collectibles and items to sell. This also makes it really easy to pick the proper responses on dates.\n-The game focuses on character development as opposed to plot. \n-All of the plots are connected, so the player may be confused during their first play through.\n\nFinal Thoughts: \nI really enjoyed this game and would highly recommend it. All of the characters had distinct personalities and I liked the stat-raising. Sadly, I wound up playing the hardest route first, and then found out how to raise each stat really easily. This caused the rest of the routes to go by really slowly since my stats were already so high; I had nothing to do between events. However, this did allow me to get the collectible stamps with ease. I disagree with the people who feel that this game is difficult. The game takes time to get used to, but with the ability to quick save almost everywhere, learning what raises what and finding items on dates is really easy. Also, people complain that the stat raising gets monotonous; I disagree with that as well. Once you learn what to do, you can raise Heejung\u2019s stats so fast that it does not feel monotonous for too long. After going through one route, raising Heejung\u2019s stats becomes easier.\n\nThere is no clear order to play the routes in, but I would recommend one of two orders:\nPlay Jieun, then Jihae, then Jiwoo or Jiyeon, then Jisoo\nOr\nPlay Jisoo, then Jiwoo or Jiyeon, then Jihae, then Jieun\nEither way, make sure that either Jisoo or Jieun is first or last and that you play Jihae near when you play Jieun. As you can guess, their routes go together. I would recommend order two over order one if you want to go by story since Jieun\u2019s route is completely different from every other route. However, if you want an easy play through, go with order one.", "timestamp_created": 1413594606, "timestamp_updated": 1413594905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12517751": {"recommendationid": "12517751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019216749", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413499436}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like playing the fic, \"Take It or Leave It\" in visual novel form, right up to the mysterious creeper who set the whole scenario up.

I had played Spirited Heart and was sorely disappointed with the system and how I couldn't romance a guy AND try to aim for the goal that was set out for me. So when I saw that there was a demo to Dandelion I decided to give it a try. Before I knew it the demo was over and I desperatly wanted to know what was next.\n\nThat right there was a good sign that I would like the full version of the game. I didn't delay in purchasing it and pursuing Jihae (I did have to check a guide to make sure I was on the right track) and oh man. The feels. He was so sweet, kind, loving, and was a tiny bit jealous. The story line was good, I could relate to the heroine , the art and the music is FANTASTIC. And while raising your stats to try to woo your choice of bachelor you had a good chance in interacting with them if they were in the room. Yes, I had to quick save and quick load to get that to happen sometimes but the fact that I could was awesome.\n\nWhat I mostly love about this game though was how much I really grew to care about Jihae. I was nearly as heartbroken as the Heroine towards the end of the story line (trying not to spoil the ending). I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys these kind of games. I *do* recommend checking the guide available on steam if you want a decent idea what you should do without any spoilers. Some of these bachelors are *tough* to get.

(: I've owned and finished the game quite some time ago before they even got on Greenlight, if you wonder why there's little time on my record; however, I'm playing it over and recalling all the reasons I loved it. The price may seem steep for what this genre is usually worth, but is it worth it in the long run? Totally. Is it a simple visual novel with sappy stories? No. It's a lot more than that. It consists of characters with realistic traits and feelings that we can all relate to one way or another. Even if their circumstances are mannered to fit the fantasy world more, the morals are there. There are several features along the gameplay that will require some careful planning and your attentive eyes. I don't want to spoil much, if at all, so I won't go into too much details about them. Play it for yourself and find out, you'll enjoy the ride.\n\nI will, however, mention a few keys you should know. Firstly, the quick save and load feature will be your best friend in this journey. It's crucial to take advantage of this to make progress with your guy and keep track of everything else. Of course, use the real save too when you need to. The game wants you to be devoted to whoever you wish to pursue, so don't be wishy-washy. The moment the prologue ends and you've entered the playable stage, you need to determine a route and stick with it. You'll be spending a few months in the game raising affection levels and stat meters before the real romance starts. It'll feel like you're playing house and raising a few cute animals. Simple, right? Or not. Pay attention to the animals' affection levels by hovering over their head icons under the room diagram and you'll notice that there are hearts and numbers, displaying things like 0/7 or 0/16, etc. This is very important, make sure you interact with the one you want and get that number maxed as soon as you can, then you can sit back and worry about your other meters until the required level goes up. And it will, so check often! If you goof on picking the right interaction or don't manage to encounter him, quick load until you succeed. You can use the same method for finding stickers when you go out (which you will want to do if you wish to collect their extra images), so work a lot and use the money to buy Eye Medicines at the shop. When Fall rolls around, which is September, the event with your guy will automatically trigger if you've done everything right. And you will know, because the loading screen will change and it'll be the image of that person. From there, you can still get bad endings if you slack off or pick the wrong choices, so watch out.The stories of each individual will tug at your heartstrings, and bit by bit, the bigger picture of the whole game will fit together. Be sure to check the extra/special stuff by the end if you wish to know more about the backstory, it'll also reveal things concerning a particular wizard. The whole process may prove to be tedious or frustrating at first if you're not experienced in the stat-raising scene, but it'll be worth it when you finally get to the end to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Don't give up!\n\nOverall, Cheritz has proven to me that they're capable professional creators of this game genre with their wonderful story-telling, clean + pretty graphics/designs, realistic character traits, and great voice acting. I look forward to continuing in supporting them and seeing more of their future releases.

Also I played this game before it got on Steam, so my play time is not very long, but I hope to fix that during my next school break. By the way, I love Cheritz. One, they make amazing games and they release them in English. Two, they have character good that you can order from their store. They do not have too much Dandelion stuff in their store, but hopefully they will add some more since the game got on Steam.\nSecond, this is an otome game with five guys that are pursuable. Supposedly you can also end up with your classmate, but I have yet to do this. There is no yuri route. This is not a pure visual novel game; it does have a stat raising part to it. The art of the characters and the CGs are amazing and top quality. I would say that the CGs are as good as Starry Sky, Hakuoki, Sweet Side, and Dramatical Murder. The backgrounds during the gameplay are not as good, but they are better than your typical visual novel that you see released in English. The test is in English, but the voices are in Korean, which I love Korean so I think it is great. Not everything is voiced, but the main parts are. I think the voice acting is great, but I don\u2019t know Korean, so I probably am not the best judge of that. Is it worth $30? YES, YES, YES!!!\nYou play as a 21 year old girl named Hee-Jung, who is an art student at a university. Fairly quickly you find out she has an inferiority complex stemming from issues with her mother and the fact that her mother never considers what Hee-Jung is doing is good enough. I found this game very relatable considering I am a girl in college, who picked her major based off what her parents wanted, and I pretty much hate my major now. In another aspect Hee-Jung reminds me of someone who has depression, so she is not a happy go lucky heroine, and I feel that she is more realistic than some of the other main characters in other otome games that I have played. She doesn\u2019t seem to have many friends, except for this guy (sorry I forgot his name) in her art club who obviously likes her, so Hee-Jung does not have much to do besides school and her art project. Which as a college student in a time consuming major, I find this to be very accurate. It\u2019s also apparent that Hee-Jung feels lonely.\nHow the story begins is that Hee-Jung come home one day to find a basket with a black cat, an orange cat, a spotted hare, a silver rabbit, and a white rabbit on her doorstep. All of these animals are just peacefully chilling, and not fighting, which is really odd. She can not bring herself to get rid of them, so she decides to keep them. Hee-Jung names the black cat, Jisoo, the prange cat, Jiyeon, the silver rabbit, Jihae, the white rabbit, Jieun, and the spotted hare, Jiwoo. For the first portion of the game you do various things like studying or taking a bath in different rooms to increase your mood or grades. By looking at the map, you can see where all the animals are. If an animal is in a room that you are doing something in then you may get to interact with that animal also. This usually increases your relationship with the animal. Also you can talk to, give gifts to, and touch the animals. Be careful on the touching because if you touch the animal in the wrong place then you may lose relationship points. After a certain point you actually get to the point where Hee-Jung actually figures out that every animal is actually a guy, who can switch between the two forms (surprise if you hadn\u2019t figured that out yet). So no, this game is not like Hatoful Boyfriend, the guys are not actually animals. By the end of the first section, you are more or less on one guy\u2019s route, which is determined by which animal you became closest to. This doesn\u2019t mean you can not interact with the other guys. In fact you can make some characters jealous by hanging out with the others more than him. In the second part of the game, the focus is more on going out with dates with your desired guy, and raising up the stat that goes with him. On dates you can collect stickers of the guy you are out with, which unlock extra content from the extras section on the main menu. By the end of the game Hee-Jung has grown and become a strong character.\nBe warned the characters do have good endings and bad endings. To be completely honest, the good endings are bittersweet, and they will stay with you for a long time. The feels you get from the good endings are amazing and indescribable, so I hope you experience them yourself.\n\nSPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!\n\n\nThe magician is the guy who sent the animals to Hee-Jung, and created the whole \u2018game\u2019 that keeps getting mentioned. Each guy made a deal with the magician to try to get Hee-Jung to love him, and in return the Magician would grant the guys wish. Pro: guy gets wish granted. Con: Guy falls in love with Hee-Jung, but ends up forgetting her after his wish is granted. He doesn\u2019t completely forget her, but he doesn\u2019t really remember what he is missing, and this is what causes the bittersweet endings. Towards the end after the guy has won the \u2018game\u2019, the Magician is allowed to actually meet Hee-Jung (he has a very pretty CG), and this is the only time that the Magician ever gets to interact with her. It is hinted at that the Magician is in love with Hee-Jung, and is constantly creating alternate realities (or rewinding time) back at the beginning of the game, so that he can keep meeting her over and over again. In a way Hee-Jung, ends up with every guy. This is speculation, but I like this interpretation. Also the Magician guy supposedly pops up in Nameless also.\n", "timestamp_created": 1412563110, "timestamp_updated": 1412563110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12381631": {"recommendationid": "12381631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111094743", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432925772}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a big fan of Otome games and for this genre this is one of the greatest ever made.

It looks like your typical shoujo reverse harem otome game, which it is to some extent. The plot, however, is outstanding with a slice of life genre.\n\nLet's start with the heroine. Heejung is your typical college student who is struggling to keep up with society and her family's pressure to be constantly perfect (good grades, looks, and social life), even though she is still not aware what she really wants to do with her life. It also doesn't help that her family is quite dysfunctional and somewhat a bit emotionally abusive to her.\n\nHer bleak and stressful life takes a turn, however, when one day, she wakes up to find these animals in a basket beside her bed.\n\nFirst part of the game is spent raising your affection to the animal you will potentially romance later on. Yes, I said animal. Don't worry, they will turn into humans (or part-humans?) later on in the game. You get to pick one guy out of five: Jihae (the prettiest one), Jisoo (the bad boy type), Jiwoo (tsundere), Jiyeon (cutesy type), and Jieun (the quiet type). You are able to raise your affection on multiple guys but if you\u2019ve played otome games before, surely you\u2019re aware what happens when you do that. For the remainder of the game, you focus on raising your stats and affection for the guy you choose in order to get the good(?) ending.\n\nThe game itself remains sweet, cute, and innocent but deals with a lot of real life (and relatable) issues. You grow attached to the characters and the character development is splendidly done well. It does, however, take for a somewhat darker tone later on in the game that will GUARANTEE to make you cry and maybe break your heart into tiny pieces (I know mine did).\n\nThe stat-raising game does get repetitive and tiring (like Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side) and may discourage some people from playing it for that reason. There are also a few spelling and grammar mistakes but easily forgiven for the well-written storytelling and voice acting (and yes, FULLY voiced). The voice acting delivers the characters' personality and emotions well. The music is beautiful and so is the art.\n\nIt's definitely a must play for otome gamers. If you want to go for a ride on the emotional roller coaster, this is your game.

The art is also gorgeous and the music is enjoyable as well. The stories for each of the guys are also nice and I enjoyed the events that happened around the apartment as time passed and Heejung interacted with the guys.\n\nThis is a stat raising game so you have to make the right choices for the guy you're going after in order to raise affection points, which can become tedious for some people. The interactions between Heejung and each boy are very amusing and heartwarming though, so try different things out, some actions might be more worthwhile than others though.\n\nThe themes of abandonment and then about coping with it afterwards are very nicely addressed in this games story. While we may not all have magical animals suddenly turning up in our real lives, it is still soothing to be able too follow and help Heejung through her struggles.\n\nI also really like that there is bonus unlockable content, the extras are really nice~\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1412491898, "timestamp_updated": 1412491898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12371763": {"recommendationid": "12371763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090564513", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483422269}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to take the time and write a review of this game.

Well, kind of. Unlike the pigeons in Hatoful Boyfriend, these animals fortunately (?) don't stay animals forever. (I took a bunny with me to the beach; he was not impressed when I put on my $100 dollar bikini, the fruits of MANY nights of labor at the local art gallery. I would've been pretty weirded out if he was.)\n\nAnimal jokes aside, Dandelion is a lovely, very professionally done Korean visual novel aimed at a female audience. I think this may be the first Korean visual novel on Steam, and it's gorgeous, with fully voiced Korean dialogue and English text. I believe you can set the text to Korean as well. There are five different possible love interests you can pursue at the start, though at the beginning I swear it plays more like a pet raising simulator than anything else. Steambuns instead of Nintendogs, right? \n\nBut no, there's a mystery that slowly begins to unfold--and eventually romance. With people. Human people, I swear. Just ignore the occasional animal ears. Yes, the $30 price tag may seem very steep to a lot of Steam users accustomed to cheaper alternatives, but before brushing it off, try the demo (available on Steam right here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/323760/?snr=1_5_1100__1100). It doesn't take long to see how much work went into it, and how many visual novels on Steam have extensive voice acting? Not enough! I've only noticed a few small translation errors here and there, but they aren't nearly as common, noticeable, or cringe-worthy as a lot of the freemium VNs' rushed translations on iOS and Android. Overall, the translation is very well done.\n\nHopefully, if Dandelion does well enough on Steam, Cheritz might feel inclined to add Nameless, their latest visual novel set in the same general universe--but with dolls instead of cats and rabbits. Yes, dolls. How can any girl resist?\n\nUPDATE after completing all routes, including Jisoo's absolutely TERRIFYING \"bad route\" (totally worth it for the extra CGs!):\n\nYes, I sank 35 hours into Dandelion. Yes, every one of them was worth it. I can't think of another visual novel/dating sim that left me thinking so much after completing it. After completing all 5 routes, make sure to check the bonus content! I was really interested in the mystery behind the story--who left me with these animals and why? The bonus content was the cherry on top of an already delicious sundae--and isn't the cherry sometimes the best part?\n\nFirst, I have to praise the characterization of Heejung. I know most visual novels/dating sims use \"blank slate\" protagonists (sometimes without eyes--creepy!), but Heejung is the most relatable, realistic heroine I've encountered in a while. (I may be biased because I, too, wonder where my mysterious new bruises came from and how expensive it would be to install a TV in my bathroom when I take a bubble bath to raise my beauty and femininity stats in real life.) Who doesn't understand the pressures of \"making it\" and continuously doing things you dread solely to please your parents and loved ones, no matter your culture? Who doesn't fear being left behind? \n\nThe love interests are fantastic too, and are much more than their archetypes may make them appear at first glance (pretty bunny, baby bunny, snobby bunny, sweet kitty, glutton/pervert kitty), though of course I had favorites. I started with Jihae, whose route seemed like a good one for beginners (just remember to raise some affection with Jieun too!), and ended with Jieun because I was super stubborn about not pursuing a baby bunny. He's a baby! Heejung is a college senior! ...But his route was one of the sweetest and actually had the best ending. Jiwoo's was great too, especially if you've seen as many Korean dramas as I have and can appreciate how the game pokes fun at kdrama clich\u00e9s. (Those envelopes of money! Candy Cinderella and chaebol romances!)\n\nThere is a LOT of stat-raising, but if you focus first on raising your Stress/Pressure Relief abilities, that helps a lot, and soon you won't even notice your Stress and Pressure stats raising at all. Make frequent use of Quick Save/Quick Reload if you accidentally poke/show love/feed them fruit in the wrong place (sometimes deliberately...!) and get a bad reaction, or if you can't find the bunny/kitten of your dreams anywhere in the entire apartment.\n\nIf you're on the fence about getting Dandelion, definitely try the demo first--and then just get it.

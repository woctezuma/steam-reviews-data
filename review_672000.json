It's like the game is taking you on an acid trip, as you can tell by some of my screenshots.\n\nI can't really go on an essay review here, but here we go...\n\nSystem Goose Overload is free, hence why I gave it a try. I thought the art style was pretty impressive, especially for a free game. The sound and music get pretty interesting at times as well. The game is full of all sorts of tongue-in-cheek jokes and bizarre characters. Some people here reference Undertale, and maybe they're right on that part, though the game really is crazy.\n\nFor gameplay, it's overall simple. Honestly, \"Adventure\" and \"RPG\" are the game's tags, but they do not fit at all with what you do. You walk along as this weird purple goose, mostly through linear areas for a good while. You can talk to some characters and observe a bunch of objects as you go along. The characters are off-the-wall, and the game usually throws a bunch of puns or silly things when you observe something (again, see my screenshots, e.g., the ice tray). Sometimes I would laugh out loud, and sometimes I would just stare awkwardly at the screen.\n\nEvery so often, you hit save points and sections with obstacles. The majority of the obstacles are searchlights, where you can simply \"hide\" whenever they are over you. Thus, you have to time your movement with their movement. Occasionally, there are \"hacking\" minigames where you move through and again dodge a few spiky objects. Later in the game, you have some confusing mazes or puzzles to solve, along with new lights that flicker, or lasers that bounce around. But the premise generally remains the same: dodge moving obstacles, and find your way through.\n\nYou do learn a story as you go along, but again, it's completely unexpected and silly.\n\n([i]EDIT: I had a downside here about typos in the game, but the creator said they are fixing them.[/i])\n\nI'm not sure what to expect in the future, honestly.

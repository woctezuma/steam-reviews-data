That is to say however that this game's ~7-hour story and world-building is something that is definitely worth experiencing. The characters are likeable in their own right, and many of them have their own stories attached to them that portrays a related, valuable message.\n\nSome of the gameplay elements are inconsistent in some ways. For example, in getting tasked to obtain two quest items, one of them took 20 minutes to get while the other just required less than 5 minutes. Although this is just something minor, I feel like this could be improved upon given the significance the items have to the drive of the story.\n\nThe world-building, to expound, is really nice with colorful and creative design. The music was great as well, especially given the fact that this is produced by RPG Maker. Some areas in the game act as a sort of obstacle in a sense that it requires a couple of seconds to uselessly circumvent passages that could be better of not being their in the first place. I guess it's part of making the world feel big and less forgettable - but I find it more of a hindrance honestly.\n\nOverall, the story and the characters really are the driving force of this RPG, and does have the potential to make you shed some tears. I'd recommend it to fans of story rich games since it's somewhat inexpensive and can use up a good number of hours. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1514712056, "timestamp_updated": 1514712257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38886642": {"recommendationid": "38886642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411599789", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 576, "last_played": 1514785680}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved it, it has a really good plot.

The soundtrack is simplistic and incredibly atmospheric - and even if you don't play the game I'd say that the music by itself is totally worth the buy. That said, Rakuen isn't completely well-rounded. There's a fair bit of running around, and the puzzles are noticeably imbalanced in quantity as you progress, which made the gameplay feel rushed or dragged out in some places.\n\nStill, in terms of story, Rakuen is a beautiful tale of acceptance. It's loaded with recurring themes and concepts that, from start to finish, subtly conveys the story to the player without explicitly revealing facts. For me, those moments of dawning realization (and tears) were the best parts of the game. If you're looking for a short but heartfelt experience, I'd say play Rakuen.

I have not finisheed it, nore have I even come close to doing so. But holy shit. This game is amazing. Every scene feels like a painted picture, the character interactions are charming and lighthearted, the themes are very real and will tug at your heart strings, and the music elicits a full range of emotions that I can't explain in one simple review. I had been following this game's development through Laura Shigihara's youtube channel because I was a fan of to the moon and other games she had composed for. After what felt like an eternity of waiting, the game finally came out. Then I waited to get money to buy the game. But, in the end, all that waiting was worth it. The joy I feel when playing this game is incomparable. I fully understand that saying all this when I've barely nibbled at the meat of the story is probably unwise, but I don't care.

I am not sure how the creators of this game overlooked this glaring UX issue, but I guess I\u2019m not actually looking for an excuse; it is not excusable.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the plot next.  I liked the first chapter where an interesting cast of characters reside in a hospital, facing an unknown thief who has been stealing stuff.  But it took a down turn when the mother of the boy protagonist encouraged the boy (and also accompanying him) to the fantasy world in a story book.\n\nMaybe the story would later explain why the boy, who appears to have some serious cancer that must be hospitalized, can make a trip to the book\u2019s world and start doing cliched RPG-ish quests for fluffy cute NPC.  Even worse, the mother of the boy approved all these with seemingly blatant disregard of the boy\u2019s health (and the consequences of their disappearing from the hospital).\n\nIn the end, I think the only thing the game does very well is the sound.  The bgm tracks are gorgeous, and little details like the footstep sound from across the wall, to progressive louder ticks when you move towards a clock, is quite impressive.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that to protect my own eyesight and sanity that I have to quit playing this game.

You know exactly what I mean by that, when you consider this a heavily story focused game in the style of To the Moon.\n\nThis title shares a lot of common ground with the one of the biggest indie tear-jerkers. It uses the same engine, controls, it lacks any combat and it also focuses mostly on telling the heart-touching story. There are several major differences though. Rakuen, in opposition to To the Moon, offers noticeable more gameplay mechanics, more open-ended world to discover and far longer run time. I believe that those changes both damaged and helped the game in several different aspects.\n\nStory takes place in the hospital where a small boy with his loving mother discover portals to the alternative universe via family-inherited story book. In this colorful, fantasy world, interconnected with the real one, everybody has its own counterpart that faces similar joys, problems and fears. To awaken the legendary forest god and get granted a wish, boy and his mother need to help other patients in the hospital. This involves delving into their past experiences, learning their tragic stories that shaped them into who they are. Games jumps from helping one person to the next, dividing itself into seamless chapters, ending up with the climactic finale where developers bring up the biggest \"guns\" to this feels-train.\n\nGame has a lot of plot ground to cover and added gameplay mechanics in form of fetch questing, exploration and some very weird puzzle solving also extend the playtime. The world and challenges are mostly alright, but I think that thanks to atrocious RPG-Maker style controls and feedback, game seems to drag a little in many places, especially when the story doesn't run on all cylinders. You can start to feel somewhat little disappointed, especially when some earlier characters' stories and general plot movements aren't remarkably memorable or engaging (ex. I think that Mom character was very underutilized in the beginning). \n\nThat being said, you should not worry about the earlier parts of the game, since title really picks up the pace later on: putting some more interesting characters into motion, pulling some unexpected revelations and very pretty powerful moments. Some of those scenes, on top of being quite emotional, are also extremely clever with hints of foreshadowing hidden in the plain sight. I was very close to performing a standing ovation on the few last scenes. [i]That was a good one![/i] - it's the sentence I would like to share with the developers in those exceptional parts.\n\nDespite my initial doubts about Rakuen having a fair chance against other titles in the genre, I would say that the ending and the game overall, brought a very satisfying experience worth recommending to anybody interested in story based games. If you liked To the Moon, you will definitely like this one too!\n\nRakuen may lack focus, presentation and polish sometimes, but I believe that it will be a pleasure for you to help this boy get his wish.

Another thing to note, the devotion and love put into this wonderful title. May not be the best game, or what would be considered \"moneys worth\" by many standards. I say don't take it by face value, give it a try with an open mind as there are many mini themes and tales featured in the game. It will be worth it.\n\nMy final thoughts, the situations / experiences of the characters are very real in the sense of being human. We all have hardships, but this games is a great reminder that we are not alone. Some one is always watching, and some one is always willing to lend a hand. And most importantly, the mother. Like any loving mother, this character helps her son in many situations as you adventure in Rakuen. Encouraging, soothing, caring and of course loving.\n\nLike a mother, Laura's Devotion to her project, music, and fans we got this. A Glorious heartwarming experience that will never be forgotten. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512947454, "timestamp_updated": 1512947454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38218526": {"recommendationid": "38218526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048689181", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512932833}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10, thought I was buying a sweet little adventure game, and now I'm in tears and not quite sure what to do with my life now.

Eu acabei de zerar o jogo, no mesmo dia do meu anivers\u00e1rio, e estou a dois passos de chorar de emo\u00e7\u00e3o e tristeza por causa do final...\n\nNa realidade eu j\u00e1 derramei algumas l\u00e1grimas. Foi o melhor presente de anivers\u00e1rio que eu pude ganhar, n\u00e3o conseguia pedir melhor. Acho que nem ganhar dois mil reais iriam me deixar mais realizado do que ter jogado esse jogo\n\nO jogo \u00e9 belo. As m\u00fasicas s\u00e3o incr\u00edveis, a da tela inicial \u00e9 a minha favorita. O jogo foca na hist\u00f3ria de personagens, onde a trama se passa em dois ambientes: Um Hospital, e uma dimens\u00e3o pararela. \n\nO jogo apresenta puzzles, e se for para comparar com algo, pode-se dizer que s\u00e3o puzzles mais dif\u00edcieis que Undertale, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio quebrar a cuca para resolve-los. Caso fique preso, n\u00e3o sinta vergonha em olhar na internet como resolve-lo, o foco do jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 esse.\n\nMesmo sendo um jogo focado em hist\u00f3ria, eu passei algumas v\u00e1rias horas jogando ele, como podem ver. Eu comprei ele na promo\u00e7\u00e3o que teve alguns dias atr\u00e1s, ent\u00e3o paguei relaticamente pouco. Mas acreditem, vinte contos por esse jogo \u00e9 a mesma coisa que pular em um lago gelado e sair de l\u00e1 com a m\u00e3o cheia de pepitas de ouro. D\u00f3i na hora, mas depois a satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o vale o suficiente para que, se voc\u00ca pudesse voltar no tempo, comprava o jogo de novo sem arrependimentos.\n\nNossa... na boa, eu n\u00e3o consigo explicar em palavras como eu amei esse jogo. Undertale \u00e9 um jogo mais Mind-blow, Starbound \u00e9 um jogo de explora\u00e7\u00e3o infinita, e Rakuen \u00e9 um jogo de iluminar a alma. S\u00e3o esses os meus tr\u00eas games estilo Pixel que eu mais gosto.\n\nN\u00e3o consigo expressar em palavras como esse jogo mexeu comigo, eu preciso de um tempo para refletir, chorar num canto, pensar sobre alguns personagens...

The characters\nall have so much life put in to them and many of them really seem\nreal. Here is a brief rundown of the plot:\nRakuen is a game about a boy in a hospital. You play as him as\nyou travel through the fantasy world of Morizora's forest with \nyour mother. Together you seek to wake up the guardian of the\nforest to grant your wish. However, the guardian is asleep with\nno sign of waking up. In order to wake up the guardian you must\nwalk a mile in the shoes of your fellow patients and in doing so,\nyou come to terms with your own story. \n\nGameplay:\nSimple enough, but that is all it needs to be. It's basically an \ninteractive story with the occasionaly puzzle or quest to solve.\nThe real star in these kinds of games is always the story though.\n\nSoundtrack:\nFrom a game by Laura Shigihara, you should come to expect an\namazing sountrack and it does not dissapoint at all. I love all of\nher other work, especially her work in Kan Gao's game, \nTo the Moon (which I also recommend checking out).\n\nSo basically, if that sounds your style, pick it up! It will take you\nroughly around 7-8 hours to beat and is well worth the $10 price\ntag. Be ready for the possibility of crying of course. While the\nfinale didn't actually hit me that hard, there were some parts in the\nmiddle that really got me reaching for the tissues to dry my eyes\nso I could still play the game.", "timestamp_created": 1510463982, "timestamp_updated": 1510464606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36424646": {"recommendationid": "36424646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126076637", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510333950}, "language": "english", "review": "The Good:\n+ Beautiful artwork\n+Good character design\n+Relaxing: the kind of game where you can just have fun exploring in different environments\n+Honest, well-done message/theme\n+Plots with feels. All the feels.\n+The puzzles aren't frustrating. You are given information on what to do and, for the most part, you're allowed to use the tools provided to solve them on your own. I felt a little patronized to now and again, but I think this game was meant for children as well as adults, so I won't hold that against it. Anyway, I'm a veteran of Cyan's games (as well as other, more traditional adventure games), so I like my puzzles on the extreme of the \"give the player absolutely no information other than what's naturally provided by the setting\" side. That's probably not true for everyone.\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n+Characters aren't explored enough. The plots of their stories are well-done, but the only character who I felt like I actually got to know was Sue. However, I still cried a lot, so it's not like this flaw made the story horrible. It felt more like there was lost potential than like you were surrounded by two-dimensional people. Like you wanted to get to know everybody but weren't given that chance. \n+Consistent mechanics are nonexistent, aside from recycled things like fetch quests. Mechanic design is not this game's strength. I see a lot of these arbitrary mechanics in RPG Maker games, and I think that people get the idea that because Ib and The Witch's House had arbitrary puzzle mechanics, you don't need solid mechanics for a story-driven game. But the reason why those puzzles worked in those two games is because the environment was trying to use arbitrary puzzles to kill you. It wasn't supposed to make sense, and that's what made it work and even enhance the horror/mystery element. However, now that my rant is over, I should add that the overall game design flows pretty smoothly.\n+The pacing is unbalanced. It's half-RPG, half-To the Moon type story and those two pieces weren't cut to fit together well. The mechanics feel like they sit on the surface of the story rather than working in a symbiotic relationship with it, and this inevitably leads to wonky pacing. Again, it doesn't make the game bad, but it feels like potential was lost. \n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun playing this game and the message came to me at a time when I needed it.

Honestly, over my past few years as a 'gamer' Laura has always provided great songs and contributed many great tracks to multiple games. \n\nWith that said, let's begin.\n\n[h1] Rakuen, is it good? [/h1]\n\nRakuen, on the surface, seems like your typical 'RPGMaker' Game, the graphics aren't the greatest and the gameplay mechanics are basic and simplistic, like I said, a typical RPG of this nature.\nBut by no means does this mean [i] Rakuen [/i] is a bad game, in fact, I dare say, this is one of my most cherished Games of all time hands down. If not, one of my favorite RPG games of all time. Why? because it does things right.\n\nAs said before, it's mechanics are your typical pixelated game and the mechanics left much to be wanted. \n\nBut they're not what makes this game so good. What makes this game so good is the emotionally-rich story within the game that is masked by the visuals.\nNot only that, but the soundtrack, is masterfully crafted, the 'lullaby' style theme prevalent in many of Laura's works carry the emotional setting and tone of the events in the game well.\nThis is a perfect example of a 'balance' with the two aspects of the game complimenting each other rather than 'competing' one another to provide the player with a fantastic experience.\n\nI often found myself crying every 5 minutes because of the songs playing in the background as I experience this wonderful journey.\n\nBut it's not without its flaws. The game often asks of you mundane tasks that are very 'repetitious' and requires constant back-tracking to complete.\nBut that can be easily over-looked not only because of the variety of them but also because they are short and sweet. \nMost people say this is where the game shines the most and I agree to a certain extent, the way Laura used her wit and creativity to overcome the technological limitations is interesting and doesn't cheapen the experience at all.\n\n*Also, I can definitely say without a doubt this game will make you cry. That's no understatement, this game will try it's hardest to play your heart like a fiddle so a tissue box on-hand is recommended.*\n\nI'll end the review here because if I go on I'll end up going to *spoiler* territory, but to leave on a high note, [i] [b] buy this game! [/b] [/i] Especially if you're the type to have loved games like Undertale and To the moon, this game will definitely provide.\n\n\nA round of applause and praise for Laura Shigihara on her efforts and Passion as a contributor to the gaming world, well-done, and Thank-you!\n\n9.7/10", "timestamp_created": 1509458855, "timestamp_updated": 1509459015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36157091": {"recommendationid": "36157091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321185400", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507107236}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d", "timestamp_created": 1509423088, "timestamp_updated": 1509423088, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.290128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36152721": {"recommendationid": "36152721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034246084", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509404616}, "language": "english", "review": "Laura.

One that left me slightly emotionally unsatble, but I think that helped me really come to understand the meaning behind this masterpiece of a game.\n\nI've been a fan of Laura Shigihara for a while now, but mostly because of her singing. When I heard that she was makiing a game, I hopped right on the criminally small hype train and rode that baby all the way to Emotional Breakdown Station, which is a cheezy way of saying that I cried. A lot. This game left me a blithering mess for hours afterward, so be warned.\n\nNow, let's get into the nitty gritty.\n\n[b][u]The Story[/u][/b]\nIf you're looking for a good story, then you've found it. Rakuen is a story about a young boy in a hospital, so you know it's gonna be sad. It's quite a bit longer than the game that most people compare it to [i]To The Moon[/i] by about double the length, rounding out to about 10 hours of heavily story based gameplay. \n\nThe story takes place (mostly) in the imagination of a young boy, and is split up into segments based on the person of focus. Everyone in the hospital has their own story, and each is more touching than the last. You explore a fantasy land of Too-Damn-Cute\u2122 characters and areas, while learning the ins and outs of each patient at the hospital, all of which have their own fantasy counterparts. \n\nEvery segment is sad in its own right, but all together they make a perfect flurry packed with enough emotion to last a lifetime.\n\n[b][u]The Gameplay[/u][/b]\nThe gameplay in and of itself isn't compicated. RPG Maker iso perspective. Classic indie story title stuff. What makes it so enticing though, is the puzzles. While not being complicated, the puzzles have this perfect little quirk to them, that just makes them fun to solve. I don't know if it was the characters you interact with, or what but every little step in those puzzles was just a joy to solve. They all have life to them, and each one is specifically tailored to the character arc it's placed in. All of them make perfect sense in the world that they're built in, and that's something we haven't see very often in recent times, heck even [i]To The Moon[/i]'s puzzles didn't make full sense in why they were there (more specifically, the puzzles to go down a memory level).\n\n[b][u]The Music[/u][/b]\nI said before that I like Laura's music, and I'll say it again. I like Laura Shigihara's music. I primarily know this from her appearances in Kan Gao's music in all of Freebird's games, but she's absolutely outdone herself with an entirely original soundtrack for [i]Rakuen[/i]. Each track perfectly fits the area it was used in and designed for, and while I found some of the songs to be a little hard to listen to outright, most didn't have that problem.\n\nIf you enjoyed the music as much as I did, you can get it on bandcamp [url=https://laurashigihara.bandcamp.com/album/rakuen-official-soundtrack]here[/url] or on steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/572910/\n\n\n[b][u]Rant[/u][/b]\nI played this game in a very emotional state. My dog and best friend of the past eleven years had just died not two weeks prior, and that helped me really [i]click[/i] with this game. I'm glad that I played it when I did, and I think it'll really help for me to look back on it and reflect later on in life.\n\nHonestly, I sat there sobbing for at least two hours over this fuckin' game. It hit me like a fuckin' truck.\n\n/rant\n\nI made this review with the assumtion that most people here will have at least heard of [i]To The Moon[/i], but in case you haven't, you can find it here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/\n\nor you can find its sequel here (coming soon, to theaters near you): http://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/\n\nand hey, if you want, you can even read my review on it [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/FP42/recommended/206440/]here[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1508440239, "timestamp_updated": 1509577921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691660", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35812606": {"recommendationid": "35812606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264056473", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508302170}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u662f\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u611f\u52a8\u554a\n\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u5173\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\n\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u6709\u70b9\u68a6\u5e7b\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u6666\u6da9\uff0c\u8a00\u5c3d\u800c\u610f\u65e0\u7a77\u7684\u611f\u89c9\n\u4f5c\u8005\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4e8b\u60c5\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u70b9\u660e\uff0c\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u9760\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\n\u6b63\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5982\u6b64\u624d\u8ba9\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u90a3\u4e48\u5584\u826f\uff0c\u5e73\u51e1\u800c\u4f1f\u5927\n\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u66fe\u7ecf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u91cc\u90fd\u6709\u4e9b\u9057\u61be\uff0c\n\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u6700\u7ec8\u90fd\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9057\u61be\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u8bba\u600e\u6837\u90fd\u4f1a\u89e6\u52a8\u4eba\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\n[b] \u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u9057\u61be\u7684\u4eba\u751f\uff0c\u96be\u9053\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5417\uff1f[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1508311065, "timestamp_updated": 1508311065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35764828": {"recommendationid": "35764828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103238230", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508128009}, "language": "english", "review": "Not enough games are this wonderful.

Dazu passt der bunte (abgesehen vom Krankenhaus) Grafikstil, der allen Liebhabern von Pixelart bzw. dem \u00fcblichen RPG-Maker Stil gefallen d\u00fcrfte. Auch die vielen verschiedenen Figuren, die man im Laufe des Spiels kennenlernt k\u00f6nnen \u00fcberzeugen; stecken voller Witz und Charakter. Fast erinnert mich das Charakterdesign sogar ein bisschen an Undertale, da hier wirklich kreative Ideen und Dialoge aufwarten, die mich einige Male wenn nicht lachend, dann doch zumindest schmunzelnd zur\u00fcckgelassen haben. \n\nDas wichtigste Element des Spiels stellt in meinen Augen jedoch die Story dar. Dabei dreht sich das Geschehen gar nicht so sehr um die Hauptstory eines Jungen, der im Krankenhaus behandelt wird, und durch die Geschichten seiner Mutter einen Weg in eine Art Fantasiewelt findet. Vielmehr geht es um die vielen kleineren Geschichten, die in die Hauptstory eingebettet sind. Hier ist es den Entwicklern gelungen, \u00e4hnlich wie in To The Moon eine emotionale Bindung an die Charaktere zu erzeugen, sodass ich an der ein oder anderen Stelle doch einige Tr\u00e4nchen vergie\u00dfen musste.\n\nUnterlegt wird das Ganze von entsprechender Musik, die je nach Situation mal unaufdringlich-fr\u00f6hlich im Hintergrund dudelt, mal in emotionalen Gesangseinlagen einen H\u00f6hepunkt findet, und insgesamt eine gro\u00dfe Abwechslung bietet. Mit Laura Shigihara genie\u00dft das Spiel \u00fcbrigens dieselbe Kompononistin wie auch To The Moon, und das h\u00f6rt man auch.\n\nDie einzigen Kritikpunkte meinerseits sind der Mangel an wirklichem Gameplay (was ich pers\u00f6nlich nicht unbedingt st\u00f6rend finde) \u00e1 la To The Moon, sowie einzelne Strecken zwischendurch, bei denen man \u00f6fter mal ein paar Minuten hin- und herrennt. Auch der Einstieg ins Spiel war mir pers\u00f6nlich etwas zu langweilig, erst nach der ersten Stunde nimmt das Spiel an Fahrt auf.\n\nAlles in allem eine klare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr Leute, die auch schon To The Moon oder \u00e4hnliche Spiele gemocht haben.\nDie Spielzeit betrug bei mir knapp 10 Stunden, wobei ich auch an dem ein oder anderen R\u00e4tsel mal ein paar Minuten festgehangen habe.

Combining the cinematic storytelling with the exploration mechanics of classic Zelda titles, Rakuen is an incredibly personal project and you can really feel its creator's touch on every aspect of the game. As a non-combat, story-focused game created with RPG maker, I'll try to focus my review on these elements specifically.\n\nThematically, it's probably easier to compare Rakuen to titles outside gaming realm such as the animated movie 'Spirited Away'. Rakuen's main themes are family, friendships and the duality of life & death, which it generally handles pretty well - even though the pacing, depending on the player may seem overly melancholic and in some instances even pushy. I've seen many people hype this game up mainly as a tear-jerker, what for me feels both as an overstatement and disregard to other parts of the story which I found great. I do think that Rakuen has a touching plot, but the real highlight for me was its amazing side characters and hilarious writing that acted as a good counterpart for the overrall sad tone.\n\nOn a mechanical level, Rakuen shines. The limitations of the engine and how the developer approaches them is often a good way of judging a game, and Rakuen feels like the framework was created for it and not the other way around. Completely dropping combat aspects works well, and the usually tedious puzzle-solving of RPGM titles is done in a way that entwines it well with the story. For me however, the enjoyability of said puzzles varied greatly. A classic Zelda-esque dungeon was an amazing experience, but some of the more cramped and ominous parts felt monotone and only times I wished for a peek in the walkthrough.\nGraphically Rakuen is a treat with good character design, beautiful enviroments and fitting effects. The unique artstyle coupled with original soundtrack might not be for everyone, but they really nail home the creator's passion for the project.\n\nOverall, Rakuen deserves the praise it's gotten - if it had been published to a handheld console ten years ago, it would be definitely praised as a classic gem by now. Even now, it's a great example for both what you can do with such a simple engine and the emotional complexity videogames are able to achieve.", "timestamp_created": 1507044013, "timestamp_updated": 1511898705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35443192": {"recommendationid": "35443192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181556659", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506965772}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've played in awhile. \n\n[list]\n   [*]The story is so sweet and cute.\n   [*]The art is enjoyable.\n   [*]It has this really innocent vibe to it.

That being said, most people will find the overall experience hopeful, adorable, and downright delightful. \n\nIf you are currently battling illness, I think it will comfort you. You'll follow multiple characters struggling with various health problems, having different emotional reactions to their trials and their caretakers. This game delivers a wise and thorough treatment of the many manifestations of suffering - and generosity - in a human heart. That specificity and nuance in the game is why we want to use it in our program. The game rewards empathy and loving kindness, as does life. \n\nIf you are a caretaker, I think you would find it encouraging. I've spent 20 years helping my family care for a loved one with dementia. It's easy to let a cloud of sorrow hang over every interaction, growing a little more hopeless every time you are with them. It's hard to remember that creativity is...well, allowed! That sounds funny, but it's true. Rakuen shows a Mother doing just that, pouring out a story and adventure that heals her child's heart, even as she cannot control what will heal his body. (Also, this is the best mom in video game history, in my opinion.)\n\nWhen my family started to \"play\" in how we cared for my loved one, and let ourselves try anything we could think of to increase her well being and comfort, our reward was not so much a recovery of the person she was - the disease took that long ago - but a chance to enjoy and love the person she had become. She could laugh, if we told the right kind of joke. She could sing, if we played the right music. She could tell stories, if we were patient and worked to draw them out of her. One of the characters in the game also has what seems to be a form of dementia, and you help him \"speak\" what is in his heart at one point. I would tell people to buy this game just for that one moment.  \n\nIt's not a \"hard to watch\" experience. If you've played That Dragon, Cancer, there is a similar balance between the trials and hopes, though I think Rakuen offers more escape and relief as you play it. That's a good thing, as it is hours longer! There are real moments of foreboding, yes, and right from the very beginning. But there's also wit, whimsy, nerdy fun humor, love, and joy. A suffering person is never always sorrowful, just as a happy person is never always happy. The humans in this game, and their magical counterparts, feel like that, and so seem very real. \n\nCongrats to the team behind this lovely game.

The key to really immerse the player is to make the game world and its inhabitants feel natural and act in a way that makes sense. With that said, Rakuen is nowhere near an \"ordinary\" world and its approach to magic and wonder is what really captured my attention and in the end my heart.\n\nYou will get to know a wide range of characters and at the end of the game you'll really miss them. You care for them, you want to see what they do next. Each character felt unique and each of the \"main NPCs\" got their own arcs and stories told within the bigger story of Rakuen. In the end it all connects in an emotional and a natural way.\n\nThe music is probably my favorite part of Rakuen. I bought the full soundtrack even before I started playing the game itself just because I heard one of the songs on Youtube. Gosh, these songs will pull at your heartstrings!\n\nI don't wanna discuss the game more because this game is best experienced if you don't know too much about the world of Rakuen beforehand.

It obviously does not come with cutting edge technological innovations in user interface or game mechanics, but I'll still rate it a 9.5/ 10. Guessing the budget, scope, tools at hand, and the asking price- the small development team has come up with a little gem that will not be easy to forget. Where Rakuen may lag behind the AAA games, it more than makes up in its heart and Emotion Quotient (EQ).\n\n\nArt in Rakuen is endearing, and slightly reminiscent of Stardew Valley's. In particular portraits of two little children stand out- their expressions a joy to look at. The high aesthetics in the visual department are equally matched in music, another draw of the game. Sure the game has slight flaws in places with plot devices, some disjointedness, some repetition. But these are minor considering what the game successfully accomplishes.\n\nIn summary, Rakuen is a game that gently explores Love, Life, and Loss. While promoting values of goodness, caring, empathy- and considering how much the world needs these virtues today, Rakuen easily earns my very high recommendation.\n\nUpdate: Nominated Rakuen for \u201cThe World Is Grim Enough Let's Just All Get Along\u201d award", "timestamp_created": 1504881376, "timestamp_updated": 1511509667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34808533": {"recommendationid": "34808533", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996890063", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504848984}, "language": "english", "review": "I cried so much.", "timestamp_created": 1504849161, "timestamp_updated": 1504849161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34804189": {"recommendationid": "34804189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052675645", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504824933}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is equal parts heartwarming and heartbreaking.

There's no sprint function, which starts to grate early on, and so many of the puzzles not only rely on tedious back-and-forthery, but also seem really disconnected from what's going on in the story. They feel like arbitrary obstacles... unscramble a code, push a block, find a thing to mix stuff in even though there are BUCKETS AND BEAKERS RIGHT THERE OH MY GOD. Given how heavily Rakuen relies on symbolism and the strength of its plot and cast elsewhere, thus far all the puzzles I've come across have kind of felt like busywork, particularly the stuff revolving Gemma's plot. \n\nStill, if you're looking for something heartfelt, lovely, and smart, you can hardly go wrong here.

And I kept it in the back of my head.\nFinally I bought your game last Friday. I can't say I was hooked from the beginning - to my shame, it felt a little stringy getting used to going around the hospital, feeling estranged from everyone and everything. After some days of reflecting on it I know the reason I felt this way - because of my own social exclusion I am experiencing right now. I feel detached from everyone and find it hard to bond to people - whether it be old friends or potential new ones. And after an hour or so of playing Rakuen, I stopped and returned to League of Legends.\n\nStill, after some rounds of League, something compelled me to advance further in Rakuen. I don't know yet what exactly had driven me, because I wasn't very invested then, as I mentioned above. Maybe it was the prospect of a story - most games I play nowadays are sandbox or otherwise have the potential to spread in any direction for an endless amount of time or replay value. I need some constraint, I feel. If you can call it that. I need some constraint for my own thoughts, otherwise they overwhelm me and flow out of me without any sense, scattering into all the directions of the wind, like spilt milk covering wooden floor planks, seeping into the clefts.\n\nI value a good story above all else. Since I am not able to wring some from my own hands yet. I admire you for doing what I cannot.\n\nAnd a breathtaking story is exactly what I got.\nI remember starting crying around Tony's story arc and I don't think I stopped weeping for long periods afterwards. There were so many incredibly strong and meaningful images, elevated by your astounding music, accompanied by your heart-piercing dialogues... I don't want to spoil the experience for others reading this, so I won't put any details, but there are so many ways the fates are intertwined, a song might fit more than one of the story lines, a person you feel is nothing more than a side character becomes the true main character (to me, at least) and it feels enlightening thinking about it and then letting your whole range of empathic feelings take control for just the slightest amount of time - they get so little exposure to the outside world...\n\nRakuen is a masterly crafted piece of art, an all-encompassing holistic experience that tugged at my soul and made me cry very painful tears that came flowing directly from my stringy heart. The very same stringy heart that made the first one or so hours of playing Rakuen stringy in my own mind. After I overcame my own struggle, your game became something I needed dreadfully at that stage of my life. And which I will value highly as one of the most beautifully written stories in my whole life.\n\nAnd thus I want to wholeheartedly say \"Thank-you\" (including the hyphen) - not only for the e-mail I received, because I got music from your bandcamp like an eternity ago, but also for everything you went through to create this game. All the sad nights and the depressing thoughts, all the stressful moments, all the hard work. You as a person are one of my personal heroines - because you do the things I am not yet ready for and it feels like I'll never really be. Which is \"simply\" doing it at all, whereas I am not even starting. Which is going through with a project that seems impossible to tackle. Which is completing an idea that once just was a small flickering flame in your mind. Thank-you for starting developing this game, thank-you for going through with it, thank-you for completing it and sharing it with all of us!\n\nThank-you! <3", "timestamp_created": 1504460984, "timestamp_updated": 1504460984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34715402": {"recommendationid": "34715402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012916443", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502558469}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely amazing and emotional story with a very beautiful soundtrack!

But Rakuen is perhaps the fruition of all that work, a game that touched a very rare spot in the heart of any gamer who has been deeply touched by a video game.\n\nIt's pretty clear from the premise that we are in for some unique storytelling, but what the summary will not tell you is how much discovering the world of Rakuen feels like the most beloved games of the SNES era. It's not trying to hail back to that time; it's just the sort of game that's too rare these days. Beautiful, heartfelt dialogue and quirky comedy take turns as we learn about our protagonist and the world he inhabits. In all the games I've played over the last 20 years, I have never once played a terminally ill child. This is a brilliant story option and thrilling to me as it's a brand new experience.\n\nVideo games are not often tender, but Rakuen is. It has a sense of wonder. It's fully plugged into the human experience and all its ups and downs. And the fantasy side of it is so enveloping that there's never a moment where you don't believe in it entirely. I don't want to ruin any of its secrets, but I will say that the connection between Rauken and the human world is one that left me thinking even after the game is closed. The story is part fantasy, but there's a lot of reality woven into it. Those two juxtapose so beautifully it's made Rakuen one of the most memorable titles I have played all year.\n\nIf you miss the quirkiness of The Secret of Evermore and the fantastic worlds of Chrono Trigger you are going to love Rakuen. Surely it was inspired by them, but I think it could easily have existed right beside them in its own right.

You play as a young boy confined to a hospital. Together with his Mom, he discovers a fantastical storybook world with parallel versions of all his fellow patients and works to learn about their stories. The line between fantasy and reality is hopelessly blurred, but the beautiful thing is it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 the story\u2019s message is still crystal clear. And the message is truly unique, exploring hope and sorrow in equal measures. There are no miraculous recoveries for these patients \u2013 the reward for learning their stories is simply understanding and empathy, both for the patients themselves and for their loved ones. \n\nAnother strong point is the music. Shigihara has always been a fantastic composer, and this might be her best work yet. The vocal songs are beautiful, heartwarming, and sorrowful all in one, while the other tracks are a bit bouncier. The story wouldn't have nearly the same emotional impact if it wasn't for the music.\n\nThe areas the game suffers most in are all related to its engine, RPG Maker. Though the character artwork is great, the sprites themselves are usually not stellar. Movement is quite sluggish, with no option to speed things up. And the resolution is totally broken, letting you only choose between a super small window and full-screen with the edges cut off. None of thees issues are gamebreaking but they do pull you out of the experience from time to time.\n\nDespite that, I can heartily recommend this game for anyone who likes a slow, emotional story.

The Void is the feeling you get when you experience a game that's SO incredibly good in every single way, that you truly believe that you'll never again play a game as good as the one you've just discovered. The game was so perfect and so magical, that it made a lifelong lasting impression on you that you're never going to forget. It surpasses everything you've seen before it, and you don't think anything you'll see in the future will ever top that. It goes without saying that Rakuen most definitely made me feel The Void.\n\nWhen Laura Shigihara (also known as Supershigi) first announced Rakuen back in 2014, the trailer alone was enough to tell me that this was going to be an incredibly special game. I've had a lot of times where I buy a game just because of the box art. I just have a feeling that the game will be good, and 9 times out of 10, that method has never disappointed me. It's actually how I discovered my favorite game of all time, NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams. But when seeing Rakuen's trailer, I didn't just think it would be good. I truly believed that it would turn out to be one of my favorite games of all time. And I just HAD to play it.\n\nFast forward a few years, and Rakuen has finally been shared with the world. Right off the bat, you're able to see that this game is going to be a very emotional experience. But it's actually very surprising in just how many different types of emotions it manages to make you feel. Something that's important to acknowledge is that its not just a compilation of sad stories. They're stories of how to recover from sad events. You'll get attached to these characters and feel heartbroken for the things that they go through, for sure. But you'll also get such wise and powerful advice on how to recover from times like these, if you by any chance can relate to any of these characters. It gives hope in an environment that first appears to be seemingly hopeless. Rakuen will not only make you cry with its sad moments, but feel hopeful and inspired with their conclusions. Not only that, but there's tons of bright and hilarious moments that'll make you laugh out loud, as well as a lot of dark and suspenseful moments that'll truly frighten you. In short, this game has everything.\n\nNow let's move onto the art of this game. I know I'll get a lot of hate for saying this, but I'm usually not that big a fan of pixel graphics. I've just sorta had my fill of them and kinda get underwhelmed, while everyone else around me is going \"ERMAHGERD! PIXEL NOSTALGIAAAAA!\" But despite this, Rakuen manages to impress me IMMENSELY with its beautiful environments and detailed character sprites. I'd go as far as to call it the most gorgeous pixel art I've ever seen in a game. It also manages to combine pixel areas with backgrounds that look like they were hand-painted, and it all mixes together so well. The game also has these beautiful storybook portraits (drawn by Emmy Toyonaga) that pop up, whenever a character is speaking. This gives the characters so much more personality and brings them to life in a whole new way. Though, there are SOME characters that have SO much personality in both spirit and design, that they don't even need a character portrait to show that. Those who've played the game will know who I'm talking about. ;) From the characters, land, sea and sky, Rakuen's art is truly something to behold.\n\nThe hits don't stop there! Not by a long shot! Anyone whose familiar with Laura Shigihara's work knows that she's a phenomenal music composer! You can thank her for the beautiful music in the critically acclaimed \"To The Moon\". So it goes without saying that Rakuen has the bar set high, for having an awesome soundtrack. And it most definitely does not disappoint. Every scene becomes 10 times more powerful and engaging, with its accompanying track. Music plays such a big role in Rakuen. Not only in bringing more life to every environment and scene, but also in telling its story. I'd go into more detail, but that would just ruin the surprise. Rakuen is very much a game that's best experienced, firsthand.\n\nAnd that's something I gotta acknowledge. Despite how story driven it is, Rakuen is still first and foremost a game. So how well does it do, in that department? Survey says... just as good as everything else! The main gameplay mechanic comes from exploring all the areas, collecting things that'll unlock new tools that'll unlock achievements or new areas, and solving puzzles. The puzzles are easy enough to not bring your progress to a grinding halt, but are clever enough to make you really stop and think. They're also very clever in the design aspect, as well. Some puzzles are visual based, some are audio based. And sometimes its just as simple as listening to what the people around you say, and not forgetting it. I really like to think that having a story play with your mind counts as a gameplay mechanic, as well. You'll be trying to put all the pieces together, as you gather information on all the big secrets in this game. And if you were to replay this game, you'll end up seeing a lot of subtle hints that you might not have caught, your first time around.\n\nThe game also has a lot of side quests, to break up the pace of the main story. The achievements are simple enough to get and fun enough for you to WANT to 100% this game. Besides, if you do the side quests, then that just means that you get to play Rakuen even longer! And that is most certainly a good thing! The game is fairly short, so anything that can keep me in this world for a longer period of time is most welcomed, in my book. I don't know how else I can say it. Rakuen does everything right. Simple as that.\n\nTo call this game a labor of love is an understatement. As somebody who was fortunate enough to be one of the beta testers for Rakuen, I was able to see first hand just how much work went into making every detail as perfect as it could possibly be. It's a beautiful piece of art, in both visuals and sound. It's easy and accessible for anyone to get into, regardless of their gaming experience or taste in game genres. And most importantly, its beautiful story and amazing characters are something that'll leave a lifelong impact on you, as well as help you make a difference in your life and in the world around you. From the moment I saw it, I knew I would love Rakuen. And when I finally got to play Rakuen, it met every single expectation I had for it, and so much more. It's something that should be played and experienced by everyone. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. Rakuen is and forever will be one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nRakuen gets a 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1504043043, "timestamp_updated": 1504043043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34588797": {"recommendationid": "34588797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062190347", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495105184}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely good game and a nice story", "timestamp_created": 1504040902, "timestamp_updated": 1504040902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34587946": {"recommendationid": "34587946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059400767", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496268053}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is not difficult by any means - it's used more as a storytelling vehicle than any sort of real challenge.

So the potential was there; combined with the nice art and really good music, why the thumbs down then? \n\nFirst of all, the game is not super-bad. I thought long about it but given that we only have the binary choice it tended more to the 'bad' side. The story is very predictable in a bad way. It's just a string of little sub stories to pull your heart strings in the most blatant ways (oh, this poor lonely puppy and her little girl-friend who is poor and has an alcoholic dad, gee, I wonder what will happen???). \n\nThe bigger problem is the actual gameplay, though. It's just not engaging in any way. You mostly run around the world and listen to cutesy creatures talking and collect some objects to get to the next plot point. The puzzles are very light and easy, and there aren't that many of them. It's really just running around and talking for the most part. The game is not long, but it still kind of drags on.\n\nI think if you are a parent and you play this with your (really) young kid, than this game is worth playing, maybe.

Cos\u00ec, un vecchio scorbutico \u00e8 raffigurato come un irascibile orso, un tale affetto da demenza \u00e8 un essere acquatico un po' svanito, e via dicendo.\n\nPer fare luce sulle questioni irrisolte dei pazienti e scoprire di cos'hanno bisogno per essere in pace, il bambino e la sua mamma dovranno cos\u00ec andare avanti e indietro tra i due mondi, risolvendo piccoli ma intelligenti puzzle logici e ambientali (pi\u00f9 nella prima met\u00e0 del gioco, la seconda \u00e8 pi\u00f9 dialogata e con poca interazione) tra sequenze oniriche che affondano le radici nel passato della persona in questione. \n\nIl gameplay \u00e8 sostanzialmente questo, si va in giro a parlare con la gente, si completano le varie sidequest di ogni personaggio, si raccolgono e si usano diversi oggetti, si costruiscono attrezzi (come il piccone) per accedere a nuove aree della Foresta e si interagisce con uno dei due mondi per creare delle ripercussioni nell'altro. \nCi sono giusto un paio di sequenze pi\u00f9 trial&error, ma anche se si \"muore\" c'\u00e8 sempre un comodo salvataggio automatico pochi secondi prima, ed \u00e8 comunque possibile salvare quando si vuole.\n\nI controlli predefiniti (e indicati a schermo) sono invece quelli della tastiera, ma il pad 360 funziona ugualmente seppur con una configurazione un po' strana (X per confermare, B per il menu\u2026 ovviabile con programmi esterni se proprio si vuole, o anche no). \n\nIl sottotesto del gioco, ovvero la vicenda che fa idealmente da sfondo al ricovero di molti pazienti e alla situazione drammatica in cui si trova l'ospedale, non viene mai chiaramente esplicitata, ma \u00e8 facilmente intuibile leggendo i (molti) interessanti documenti e ritagli di giornale sparsi in giro, utili anche per farsi un quadro pi\u00f9 chiaro della storia delle diverse persone.\n\nE non crediate che dopo l'esperienza con TTM la Shigihara ci sia andata pi\u00f9 leggera, anzi: ognuno dei pazienti -protagonista incluso- \u00e8 estremamente ben caratterizzato, e i drammi che li vedono protagonisti (che non spoilero) sono resi in maniera molto credibile anche dall'ottimo lavoro di sceneggiatura che c'\u00e8 dietro - preciso che il gioco per ora \u00e8 solo in un inglese abbastanza semplice, ma questo non impedisce agli occhi di inumidirsi in pi\u00f9 di un'occasione, con un paio di pugnalate notevoli.\n\nSenza grandi sorprese, pure il comparto audio \u00e8 eccellente e passa con scioltezza da brani molto allegri e orecchiabili come quello del villaggio dei Leeble a brevi canzoni (cantate da Laura e da altri) con le quali culminano le varie vicende dei pazienti. \n\nAnche la durata supera quella di TTM, attestandosi su buone 7-8 ore per completare la storia principale prendendosela comoda nel risolvere gli enigmi e chiacchierando un po' con tutti, mamma compresa, dopo ogni evento maggiore per vedere cos'hanno di nuovo da dire, e provando a completare anche un paio di quest facoltative.\n\nSe le struggenti vicende di To The Moon non vi sono bastate e ne volete ancora, Rakuen con la sua leggerezza solo apparente fa senz'altro per voi. Pi\u00f9 elaborato sia come gameplay che come mole di dialoghi, \u00e8 una sorta di TTM\u00b3 e la dimostrazione di come con RPG-Maker si possano ancora creare delle ottime cose se si ha una solida base dietro e la voglia di raccontare una storia che tocchi i cuori dei giocatori. \n", "timestamp_created": 1503331874, "timestamp_updated": 1503331874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34387792": {"recommendationid": "34387792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058996760", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503466601}, "language": "english", "review": "A true emotional rollercoaster with many incredible highs (a hysterical tea party for one) and lows.

This game was definitely inspired by it, so picking it up during the latest sale was a no brainer for me. Just finished it today. So here's some thoughts (no spoilers):\n\n- It feels more like a game and less like an experience than TtM. There is much more to collect and do here. Also, it tells quite a few interwoven story arcs, as opposed to TtM's one.\n- Therefore this game is much longer. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing. The good: More bang for your buck, and more chances for one of its arcs to emotionally bend you over the proverbial barrel (which, let's be honest, that's what we're all here for, right?). The bad: Some of it's arcs were emotional misses for me, and so felt disappointing.\n- The humor isn't always present, but when it is, it is on point, which adds much needed levity. This game gets heavy. To describe it in the words of a great man, \"Sad.\"\n- I was quite satisfied by the experience. It never actually got me to cry (TtM got me, twice, by comparison), but I did have my throat catch a couple times, along with some whispered \"Oh no\"s (let me read that letter next to the marbles, dang it!) and so would very much recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1503183728, "timestamp_updated": 1503183728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34357120": {"recommendationid": "34357120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048427248", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503169962}, "language": "english", "review": "So to start, I don't have any hours on this game because I actually played it with my friend on his account when he got it.

My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away came to my mind prominantly while I played this game.\n\nYou play as a young boy, traveling with his mother in a world that is full of mystical things like forest spirits, dog spirits, spirits known as \"the envoy\". Very much like in Spirited Away, the young protagonist goes on quests to help these spirits, and in doing so learns more about the world and grows as a person.\n\nAnd while you help the villagers and spirits and try to awaken the forest god, things start to change back at the hospital as you learn more about your fellow patients, and the hospital itself.\n\nSpeaking of your fellow patients, the game treats them as more than 2d characters with copy paste stories and copy paste dialogue. Each secondary character has their own independent backstory.  They have their own tragedies, triumphs, and struggles.\n\nThe game treats these struggles with a great deal of care. Loss in various forms, abandonment, addiction. And yet it isn't overbearing. The characters have these issues, but they deal with them in realisitc ways.

That said, this is a GREAT game - if it wasn't, I wouldn't be recommending it! It's a beautiful game, with a lot of tie-ins and subtle statements about current events, and even events in the past that still have had lasting effects to this day. It presents them from the eyes of a child, but the discerning eye can catch n pretty quickly with what's happening thanks to all the clever context clues in the scenery and puzzles. \n\nFrom a gameplay perspective... well, to be honest, there's not much. This is a story driven game, primarily, and the puzzles themselves aren't too difficult. There are a few in-game animations that I think are... weird, such as when using the axe or foraging - the sprites just don't deliver those kinds of actions too well.

The story itself was beautiful, and I quickly became attached to each and every character as the game explores their past and emotions. Though, the soundtrack is definitely one of the best parts of this game.\n\nThe only negative thing I could possibly say about this game is a few of the puzzles can seem a bit tedious to complete, however they are very easy and keep you interested as you explore the area surrounding the puzzles. I do recommend keeping a piece of paper and a pencil next to you while playing to write down clues you come across though, which will greatly help you in completing the puzzles. I also read a few negative reviews that said it was difficult to understand what to do next without reading a walkthrough, however for me I was able to complete the entire game without needing one (until I went back to complete the rest of the achievements I had missed). For most of the game you are able to receieve hints in-game whenever you need them, so a walkthrough really is not necessary for this instance.\n\nI also recommend that if you are looking to complete every achievement, you should make sure to interact with and explore everything you possibly can, as there are some achievements that are area or event specific and you cannot get back to them without loading up a save or restarting the game. Other than that, I would recommend an achievement walkthrough if you find that too tedious for your playstyle.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy story-driven games with amazing soundtracks, loveable characters, and an emotional storyline that will have you laughing and crying, I highly recommend giving Rakuen a try.

After watching for a bit, I decided to stop and buy the game myself to experience it.\n\nAnd I'm glad I did. Lately video games felt like they've been lacking a rich story, and playing Rakuen has been like an interactive novel.

I'm honestly surprised by the soundtrack most of all, especially when I realized there was some voice acting included. \n\nThere's been suspense, mystery, tears, joy, it was a constant roller coaster ride from beginning to end and super hard to put down.

The bow moves, the fingers tighten, and the string sings with a cry of joy,  pain, anguish, or hope.\n\nA spotlight shines down and the musician bows her head in silence, surrounded only by the circle of light and blackness of the stage around her.  The audience, frozen in place from the tenderness of the moment, tries to gather themselves from the emotion of her performance.\n\nYes, Rakuen is like that.  I never saw it coming.\n\nHere, out of this sweet little game packaged in an RPGmaker wrapper with happy faces and cheerful dialogue, came a tempest of storytelling.  Make your comparisons to other games like To the Moon if you like, but this game can make you pause for a moment, shocked at the very real drama that unfolds within a single scene. One minute I am picking Sila Berries, the next I simply forget to breathe as the tragedy of the story leaves me with that sinking feeling in my gut as if I am falling.  Perhaps it rang too true with me, maybe I\u2019m a softie.  What I can say without a doubt, though, is that Rakuen makes the player actually care about characters like very few games can.\n\n[h1]Gameplay/Story[/h1]\nWhat I\u2019ll begin with is our lead character, Boy, a young child, of perhaps eight years of age.  He is in a hospital, along with many other characters, recovering from an illness.  A doctor informs him of a thief that is stealing items from the hospital, and to the Boy\u2019s surprise, his favorite book, Rakuen, has been stolen as well.  The Boy sets out to find the culprit and retrieve the book, leading to an exploration of the hospital by opening drawers, discovering keys, collectibles, and solving puzzles along the way.  The real meat of the game opens up after speaking with the entire cast of hospital residents and staff. Once the book is retrieved, the Boy\u2019s Mom appears and she stays with him throughout the rest of the story.  She gives him a key to unlock the book\u2019s magical land of Rakuen, which apparently is not just a story, but also a fantasyland juxtaposed to the real world of the hospital.  Strange portal doors begin to be revealed, and the Boy and his Mom travel to Rakuen through these doors.  Once there, they discover the land of Rakuen is in dire straits.  The powerful forest guardian spirit, Morizora, has fallen into a dark sleep due to the negative energy of the Envoy spirits who are changing the forest into a land of doom and desolation.  It\u2019s up to the Boy and his Mom to save the land by helping the inhabitants cope with their problems and collecting parts of a magical song called Mori no Kokoro in order awaken Morizora.  Once awakened, Morizora can grant the Boy a single wish and save the forest.\n\nRight here is where the game takes on some adventure gameplay that feels quite a bit like the Blackwell series of games.  Two characters are being played at the same time, the Boy and his Mom, to uncover clues and find out the tragic story of the other characters with the sole intention of helping those people find peace.  Each time you help someone, you get a piece of the song, Mori no Kokoro.  What you won\u2019t need to worry about, however, is how to combine items.  That part of the game is done automatically once you figure out the puzzles and locate the keys or objects required to progress.  That said, the puzzles are cleverly broken into sections that take some thought to figure out.  There is nothing incredibly hard, yet you may get stuck occasionally due to a single key element that has yet to be uncovered.  Rakuen has the uncanny ability to layer the clues and puzzles in such a way that the answers may be elusive even if the actual solution is right in front of you.  Most of the difficult puzzles are in the first few sections, with the latter half of the game being much easier to get through.\n\nThe main part of the gameplay that separates Rakuen from other games is that there are counterparts in the real world of the hospital.  For example, with Winston and Gemma, Gemma is in a coma in the hospital with her husband Winston at her side.  When going to the land of Rakuen, you see the exact same couple with Gemma sick in bed and Winston caring for her.  In order to set these lives straight, you must visit their past, and patch together the story.  The key here is that you interact with their past and show each character how to unburden themselves from the weight of their unhappiness.  Each time a song is sung that becomes a piece of the final Mori no Kokoro song to awaken Morizora.  There is no fighting, no leveling up, or weapons.  Players are only able to help people not fight them.\n\nSo, at this point, you may ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about that?\u201d.  For one, there is the dynamic of a child who is dealing with the arduous task of assisting these people with his mother by his side.  Just like in Blackwell, the secondary character protects the main character, guides them, and helps with useful hints here and there.  It also forms a relationship, one of the key components that made Blackwell successful, when two people are involved with each other you feel that connection between them.  It not only moves the story along, it creates the opportunity for the mother to become a significant part of the plot.\n\nSecondly, and perhaps most importantly, Rakuen creates segmented drama.  There are scenes where you want to continue with the story but have to unlock a series of events that go further than a simple explanation.  A mere storyline is not enough.  There are properly set-up scenes, not unlike a theater play.   Here, Rakuen bravely drops hints of underlying secrets while keeping the big secrets in mystery until the final curtain drops.  You complete one area only to discover another hidden alcove with insight into the backstory of someone, or a tiny snippet of life much like the calm before the storm.  And then, there is the presentation of pacing.  You might be completely unaware of the power of a scene until you get to the center of the story and have your heartstrings pulled when it all finally clicks together.  It takes a lot of care and effort to pull that off correctly, and Rakuen does it in spades.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nEver have someone give you an origami figure that you unfold and discover a hidden story carefully tucked away inside?  That\u2019s Rakuen, a small and compact game which reveals the most endearing game experience I\u2019ve had all year.\n\nRakuen\u2019s focus is about personal connections.  Each character has lost that connection and it is up to the Boy and his Mom to reassemble those bonds. It\u2019s also about a tragedy, and I\u2019ll warn players that they very well may cry during this game. I certainly did, but I\u2019m prone to that because Rakuen hit a nerve with me.  When I was a little boy my sister had cancer and I remember those hospital rooms full of patients, each with their own personal stories of how they got there.   It\u2019s not easy to manage through that and I\u2019ve never seen it portrayed in a game through a mother and child point of view.  It\u2019s unique and touching, making you feel like you are right there in the hospital with them.\n\nEach scene is carefully constructed, with very close attention to the pacing and timing of select moments. My throat got dry. My eyes welled up. I have to admit, it can be hard to take as the game pulls punch after punch.  Yet, the journey is worth it.  Rakuen aims right at your feelings with no holds barred.  I\u2019ve seldom come across a game that tackles real world tragic events and uses them as core components of a storytelling experience.  The pain you feel is entirely because these things can and do happen.  The fantasy of Rakuen took me to a place I certainly did not expect.  It connected me back to those difficult memories of the hospital that I purposely tried to forget.  I wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d feel at the end but I have to say, I am thankful.

The story is on the simple side, but it progresses at a quick pace and constantly provides moments of wonder for the player. Parts of it feel very like Alice in Wonderland. It expertly pulls back the curtains little by little and hints at background details effortlessly, making it very rewarding for players who choose to explore the world more. If you're looking for a game with a heartwarming, mature story, a captivating setting, amazing music, and interesting, fleshed-out characters, then this game is one of the best I've ever seen.\n\nThere's a big catch, though, and that's the lackluster gameplay. Playing Rakuen consists mostly of three things: walking, talking to people, and collecting objects that serve as \"keys\" to get to the next area. There are very, VERY few exceptions to this pattern. Basically every puzzle in the game just consist of looking around a room to find the aforementioned \"keys\", which are usually hidden in drawers or down the sink or something. The story is more than strong enough to carry the game through, but I found myself speeding through the last half of the game because I was so tired of the fetch quests I kept being given. The biggest problem with Rakuen -- and, I think, the only real problem -- is that there just isn't anything to do besides these repetitive puzzles. Even though an enormous amount of time clearly went into building the world, the lack of variety in what the player can actually do makes everything feel a little barren. Part of the wonder in the world of Rakuen is getting to explore more and more, never being sure what you'd find next, but I quickly realized that the only thing I was ever going to find were fetch quests.\n\nPut another way, I think the core gameplay just needs a lot more variation. I would have liked the puzzles to be more interesting and varied, rather than just finding the correct objects in the room. I would have liked some small minigames to play in the Leeble village and throughout the world. I would have liked an incentive to revisit old areas and characters -- it feels like they're just discarded and thrown aside after they're done being useful, a particularly harsh misstep in this narrative. As a quick example, there's a short section in the third chapter of the game where you have to fly over a gap in the attic with an airplane. Why not turn that into a simple minigame where you have to tap a button and angle the plane? It's certainly not a big deal, but it's just one of MANY missed opportunities to make the world of Rakuen feel more surprising and delightful for players.\n\nThere are some other minor things, like the text speed is slow, the options select screen is very limited, and the menus could have done with some spit-shine. I realize that most of my complaints are probably due to the choice of RPG Maker as an engine -- but Rakuen is too rich and too good of a world for RPG Maker and they really should have chosen a different engine to begin with.\n\nI think this could have been one of the best games of 2017 if it had some actual gameplay. There's an enormous amount of missed potential here, and it stings a lot.

Don't bother watching it online. It's not as immersive. You have to play it for yourself.\n\nIt seems that Freebird Games' Kan Gao has taken Laura Shigihara under his wing. Quite honestly, she has made a masterpiece! I think this game had me in tears on 4, maybe 5, seperate occasions. Both developers are masters at conveying emotion through a game; and to be honest, I think this game may even be better than To the Moon! I'm not going to talk about story, which is the bulk of this game, because you, YES YOU! THE ONE READING THIS! YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS FOR YOURSELF! Seriously it was great. Absolutely nailed it on that story aspect. \n\nAlso what I like about Rakuen is that it feels more like a game than To the Moon. Don't get me wrong, I'm not ripping on Kan's masterpiece. I'm just saying that there's a puzzle element to this game that was a lot more present than To the Moon which in turn makes this feel more like a game than an interactive movie. \n\nOne other thing that makes this game stand out, was the artstyle. This game is very cute. My mother would occasionally glance at my screen and see some adorable little animations and sprites running around the screen when I played this. Well done there.\n\nI don't have any real gripes about this game but, not going to lie, I needed a guide for a hint at a few certain points. I think one thing that could have made this game better would be a better hint system. Throughout the game you play as a nameless boy and his mother. When you're going through the puzzles, you can turn to mother and ask for a hint. The hints were pretty vague and didn't really help unfortunately. Also perhaps a journal system that keeps track of your quest and puzzle progress would have helped. There were a few quests where you had to find certain items around the map and sometimes I forgot how many of which items I needed to find. I know these are all very minor things but perhaps this could help out in the next game. \n\nOh and on a side note, it helps to know a little Japanese when you play this game. It is entirely in English but there are some small things around the game that are written in Romaji. Knowing how to read that helps understand the story. It does not at all hinder a player to not know what any of the writings mean, it just reinforces a few story elements if you can understand it.\n\nThe music in this game was just great. I knew Laura could sing because of To the Moon, but this is where she step into the spotlight and show us how talented she really is! All of the music was composed and produced by her (with a few guest singers at a few parts). I absolutely loved all of the music in this game!\n\nUnless you don't mind crying in public, I would recommend you play this game by yourself.

It'l be difficult to write, but I feel obligated to. Rakuen doesn't have gameplay that'll blow you away, or visuals that redefine an industry, but you know what it does have? The single most powerful story I've ever experienced. Shigihara tells a story of loss, love, innocense, imagination, wonder, humour, and tearful joy mixed with soul shattering grief. You learn of the patients on your floor of the hostpital. You learn of their struggles, their regrets, and their reasons for having the personalities they do through their alter egos in the world of Rakuen. I won't spoil anything, because this story is something you need to play. But, the ability of this game to get you invested in its world(s) is unmatched by most other titles on this platform, with exceptions like To the Moon. While this game has general value to mean something to everyone, it held a resonance to me that I might hold on to for the rest of my life. I lost my mother to MDS, a bone marrow cancer that disables the immune system, last July before I finished High School. I was overcome with grief naturally, but I began to doubt if I was handling it right. I felt like I wasn't shook enough. I've had these feelings of of doubt and stress for the past year, but after hearing that one of my favorite musicians/ sound desgners made a moving tale about cancer and loss, I immediately picked this title up. I finished it in a day, and I think I cried more after finishing this game than in the past year as a whole. It taught me that I wasn't dealing with loss wrong, because everyone's story with loss is unique. This game gave me peace that no therapist could. Please buy this game. Do not hold back tears. Get invested in the characters and the world of Rakuen, for the payoff is far and beyond worth the sadness this game brings. While you might not experience the same gravity that I did, you will feel. I promise you.\n\nEnd note: Thank you, Laura Shigihara.

It is therefore more story-based, but does have simpler game-like elements such as exploration, collecting items and solving riddles. Furthermore, the game's creator Laura Shigihara worked on Freebird Games' To The Moon, so it comes as no surprise that Rakuen is heavily inspired by this story-heavy modern classic, and even pays homage through an Easter egg (did you find it?). \n\nAs it is a game that inherently stresses the importance of the story rather than the gameplay itself, you will find that much care was put into making the game relatable; as the boy and his mother help people along their way, you uncover some very realistic issues [spoiler](Korea-Japan relations, the aftermath of family tragedies, how a gambling addiction can tear a family apart)[/spoiler]. I must also applaud the organic mother-son interactions, as well as the use of music and sound to create suspense. They also did a very good job of connecting the two worlds in interesting ways, which made the story a lot more interesting since you must make progress in either world in order to see changes in the other. This constant travel through different portals also nicely symbolizes the dreams and imagination of the little boy.\n\nI do, however, have some criticisms towards this game. One would be that I wish they hadn't been so explicit in giving hints on how to solve some puzzles. Now I'm not talking about the hint function, but rather, when you receive a quest or puzzle you are eager to solve on your own, the NPCs will say something like \"Ooooh I would loooove to go to that island, if oooonly I had a boat so I could go there. It would be so great if someone could make me a boat. If only\". Now that may perhaps be slightly exaggerated, but my point still stands: the game doesn't always give you chance to solve things on your own, which is quite a shame. The reason I think this is important to mention is that since the game is so story-heavy, I believe it needs to justify itself as an actual game, in order to not come off as just an interactional visual novel.\n\nNow this may just be personal preference, but I find that the frequent use of lyrical songs - although charming when used sparingly, and while it is something that sets it apart from To The Moon - got a bit cheesy. Yes, they were strategically placed throughout the game, but they would still be a bit sudden and made me feel less immersed in the game.

This isn't a typical RPG. It is also free from the RPGMaker stigma of poor quality. If you've played To The Moon and liked it and other story-driven games, then you'll probably like this game. If not, there's not much for you here. There are no combat elements, and only the most basic of puzzles. Most of the game is walking around from location to location, watching cut-scenes and scrolling through dialouge, with a few notable exceptions that I won't get into for spoiler reasons. This is a completely story driven adventure from beginning to end. It's a good thing that Rakuen has compelling characters and great writing, even if pacing feels off at times. Without spoiling things, the sections of the game get shorter and shorter as the game goes on. It'll probably take you about 8 hours to complete, unless you do none of the optional stuff. The game sticks with you long after you finish it, though. You'll probably be humming the songs as well, as the soundtrack is also great. The developer is mainly a composer, so this makes sense. \n\nIf you like story driven games and if you want to be sad, then this is the game for you.

I will, however, be as far from subjective as possible in this review.\n\nThe gameplay is obviously the weakest link in the chain. The puzzles make up a big chunk of the gameplay, and can range from somewhat intuitive to a trial-and-error wild goosehunt. The animations are less than stellar, and though some cannot easily look past such aforementioned flaws, the fact that the game was made in RPG maker can allow some slack to be cut.\n\nCharacter design wise, the game did a great job. The artwork on many of the NPCs felt organic and almost lept out of the screen. The melancholic yet effervescent plot is in also the plus column. Despite the game starting out with the weaker story arcs, it is perhaps the driving force behind players wanting to further progression. I especially loved the indirect storytelling through cartoon reenactments, paralled with real life mementos and areas. The game ends on a truly bittersweet note that is reminscent of To The Moon. \n\nThe soundtrack is perhaps the strongest field of this game. Immediately after loading up the menu screen on my first playthrough, an almost magical theme similar to the opening to a great visual novel plays, enchanting me instantaneously. Almost every soundtrack is memorable, and brings life to an otherwise visual-appealing yet generic RPG game. Specifically, soundtracks \"Fish Heads\" gave an almost PvZ-like vibe, \"Morizora's Cave\" having chords reminscent of FFVI, and \"Welcome to the Forest\" giving a vibrant tonality to the main village, just to name a few. \n\nThough I can certainly see certain individuals being turned off by the somewhat unsatisfying gameplay, this is a game I would highly recommend to fans of story oriented RPGs with a great soundtrack.

It relentlessly tells the story of a child in the hospital dealing with a crippling illness and copes with it by entering an imaginary world with this mother. With this imaginary world and the real world connected through the book Rakuen, this boy goes on adventures to try to fulfill a wish, while helping those around him in the process.\n\nThe storytelling of this game is absolutely top-notch and with a composer and singer like Laura Shigihara (Plants vs. Zombies, To The Moon) creating the music to this spectacle, it makes for a phenomenal experience. Shigihara's atmospheric composition ties everything together so perfectly that it makes for an incredible gaming experience.\n\nI wouldn't call it a perfect game. I did feel there were segments of the game where the story sort of dragged itself out while other parts felt way too short compared to other developed parts of the game. There was also one certain part of the story I found confusing and couldn't figure out how it tied together, but it could have been something missed in the story.\n\nHowever, my criticisms of this game were extremely limited because this was such a compelling gaming experience that if I did notice any flaws, they were completely forgotten due to how engrossing the story was.\n\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough, especially if you loved a game like To The Moon. The one thing I would warn going into this game is it is not for the faint of heart. This game is nearly relentless with how hard it hits with its melancholic storytelling. I am convinced if you do not cry at least once during this game, you do not have a soul. I can't count on one hand how many times this game made me tear up.

Using RPG-Maker as the structure, it provided some lighthearted (and sometimes darker) music to set the mood as you did various miniquests, tasks, and solved puzzles over a 6-8 hour story. The story of a boy in a hospital, going on adventures to help people in the Real World by stepping into their memories and dreams and fixing various aspects of them. This fantasy world reflects and affects the Real World, such that similarly named people, objects, and details exist in both (water a plant in the real world, and it goes from sapling to beanstalk in the fantasy, for instance). Seems pretty simple...\n\n...But then there's the Deeper Meaning. Via newspaper clippings, inferred meaning, and various details you have put together for yourself from clues and comments in-game, everyone and everything has something a bit more in-depth than what's on the surface. Every time I got a bit annoyed at some fetch quest or RPG trope, I'd see a hint of something more meaningful beneath it, and follow that thread until I reached the end. Each of these Deeper Meanings made me mist up a bit, and eventually culminated in a wonderful combination of story, music, and character that choked me up but good.\n\nI could go on about plot or graphics or sound or anything else, but really I'm recmmending this game because of those Deeper Meanings. While I'm sure I could compare it to To The Moon (or Bird Story), in the end this is a game that stands alone. It has a strong soundtrack, original music and vocals, excellent game mechanics, and clever writing that can be both touching and humorous. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who can put aside a few hours and get to know a few wonderful people, in a hospital, and go on a magical adventure.

Some of it I may retread, some of what I have to say may be new.\n\nThe first thing I have to say is that I have been following Laura for years on YouTube and other media. Her music has always been extremely powerful and moving, no matter what emotion it was make to invoke. So when she first announced her plans to make a game, I knew that the story was going to drive the emotions home with her powerful compositions. And in that, Rakuen did not fail. All the music, every little bit, is made to evoke something of the story and the environment. The leitmotifs for the big events are all stunning, and squeeze every bit of heart out of the scenes.\n\nNext, I definitely enjoyed the gameplay, even if I got a little confused on where I might have to go or which puzzle to attempt next. The game never slowed down for me, because the pace is like that of a leisurely walk in a park; you enjoy the journey as much as the destination. Obviously, near the end, everything rushes towards the climax, and the emotions become a whirlwind in your mind.\n\nNow, I am warning you, this next passage is going to contain spoilers, so if you do not want to read it, skip to my final paragraph. [spoiler] Having more than a passing familiarity with the Japanese language, anyone who knows what the word \"rakuen\" actually means knows that this story will only have a bittersweet conclusion. I knew that I was in for mostly heartache and tears as I played, and I definitely was crying most of the time. The fact that the Boy was going to pass from the world in some fashion was a given, by the name. However, the losses of Sue and Kisaburo were hard ones. When I went back to the hospital to see Kisaburo after the conclusion of his arc, I was powerfully struck with his absence. Then, seeing the Boy go to give the Ramune marble to Sue, only to see that she was gone, was just as heartbreaking. It really struck home in the final scene, when they're all on the boat to Rakuen. [/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, this story had me crying for quite some time. As bittersweet as it is, I would not take back my playthrough for anything. Laura, if you read these reviews, thank you so very much for making this. I continue, to this day, to follow you online, and I always enjoy your work.

I was very impressed and immersed in the world that she built and felt the backstories behind each character were deep and fufilling.\n\nThough I enjoyed the game, I have a few complaints, of which include the feeling that the game got rushed, this was due to the chapters getting shorter and shorter the further you get into the game, I feel that the effort put into the characters backstories were somewhat wasted as there was so much that could have been done with them before closing their chapters, especially in the marble girl and the main character. \n\nDue to some puzzles in the game being hard to solve (either due to travel time or need of a certain item that can be found somewhere over yonder or rather), the available guide on solutions to the puzzles are a great help for players, reducing the amount of time spent scratching heads and being frustrated over seemingly searching everywhere *cough spent an hour searching a house for a feather cuz I didnt know about it at first cough*\n\nThough I expected more in the story, it was overall an enjoyable experience so do go ahead and try it for yourself! :)", "timestamp_created": 1499009619, "timestamp_updated": 1499009619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33118568": {"recommendationid": "33118568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278209103", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502676838}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy wow, I did not expect this game to have been this detailed.

Its emotional storytelling and character-driven narrative will be the something I treasure for the rest of my life, and one that I wholeheartedly recommend to any who enjoy such games and stories.\n\nRakuen sets its story in a hospital with a young boy as its protagonist, surrounded by various distinct secondary characters whom the boy wants to help. While simple, its execution is anything but average. That so much detail is given to its cast of characters shows how much thought the developer Laura Shigihara has put into them. Even its \u201ctertiary\u201d characters have memorable qualities to them that make the world feel all the more lived-in and relatable.\n\nIts puzzles are as simple but well-executed as its setting and characters. The main bulk of the gameplay, beyond the reading, moving and text reading will be in regards to puzzle solving and fetch quest. If that is a turn off to people, I\u2019d still strongly recommend trying it out and/or attempting to overcome one\u2019s disdain for these gameplay elements. Its puzzles are fairly simple, and even with interesting takes/versions of classics, not nearly as impossible as many a puzzle and rpg games. Its fetch quest also don\u2019t take nearly as long or need as many items, something I greatly appreciate as its story, and not gameplay, were its focus.\nThe character-driven narrative was what truly kept me invested and interested in playing. With a sprinkling of mystery here and there for good measure. Its coverage of all manner of struggles with characters young and old was very compelling and gripping. I applaud the skill employed in respectfully addressing these issues yet still providing a hopeful and optimistic message for all. There is some ground to say that the message was heavy-handed in some aspects, but I believe it was finely executed and had messages and lessons worth sharing.\n\nEven among all of Rakuen\u2019s notable strengths, special mention has to be given to its soundtrack, a beautiful collection of songs that performs all its functions perfectly. A simple accompaniment to the game as background and theme, a character in its own right and an emotional enhancer when called for, and it is often. Its menu music, titled \u201cThe Keepers\u201d in the OST, halted me in my tracks for its duration before starting the game proper. While not the only noteworthy piece, it was certainly my favourite. I feel saying that this quality is expected of a composer is a disservice to her, Laura Shigahara; yes, the creator and composer are one and the same. The choice of pieces and the type of music are incredibly inspired and I look forward to hearing more of her work.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately\u201d I have no deep criticism of Rakuen to balance this review. The following are more minor grievances that bugged me rather than immersion-breaking issues. My understanding however is that most of them are due to limitations of the game engine, in this case RPG maker xp.\n\u2022\tMore resolution options, such as windowed mode (ALT+Enter allows a 640x480 resolution)\n\u2022\tNo steam overlay, which meant no screenshots. I just used printscreen\n\u2022\tKey rebinding, altering text speed and maybe the font size/type would be nice\n\u2022\tThe direction the character faces bugs out when picking objects up and down, facing left and right instead\n\nAs is pretty obvious, these aren\u2019t critical, but it\u2019d be nice to see. And a bit of polish can really make a great game shine even more. As for its graphics, it really does come down to personal taste. RPG maker games have a distinct look and feel to them, and Rakuen is subject to it as well. However, its sprites look anything but unpolished. What\u2019s more, important/significant characters also have unique anime-type portraits given to them that are lovingly designed.\n\nBefore my summary, I have to state that I have tried my hardest to avoid a comparison to another character-driven narrative game, specifically To the Moon, which Laura worked on in conjunction with its creator, Kan Gao. I hoped to judge Rakuen on its own merit, rather than in comparison to another, but the similarities/perceived inspirations are hard to ignore. Additionally, the two differ on several key parts; Rakuen is also longer in length, with far more on screen characters and puzzle gameplay. While shorter, To the Moon arguably explores its characters more in-depth and is the first of a series, though with little gameplay. Regardless, having played both I feel confident in saying that those who enjoy one will almost certainly enjoy the other.\n\nRakuen characters and stories moved me deeply. To learn so much about them and their struggles in a beautifully crafted world and lovingly composed music was an experience I deeply cherish. My only regret was not buying the game at full price to show my appreciation to the developer for such a fantastical adventure. I can only hope for more opportunities to go on such journeys again.", "timestamp_created": 1498412125, "timestamp_updated": 1511397818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32770669": {"recommendationid": "32770669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181853158", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498393273}, "language": "english", "review": "I've just completed this game, and I can't even describe how \"BEAUTIFUL\" this game is ..

Unfortunately, the gameplay is just horrible.\nIt is made of incredibly boring puzzles which usually consist of pulling switch A here, to get access to switch B, so you can trigger button C. Opening drawer #34 (which looks exactly as ugly as the other identical 33 drawers before) in order to maybe collect item 5 of 9 is just not my idea of fun.\n\nI am sorry, but some games of the 90s had more interesting gameplay. As a matter of fact, I understand now why \"To the Moon\" hardly had any real gameplay elements - so you could experience the story without being let down by subpar game mechanics. \n\"Rakuen\" on the other hand forces you to play through incredibly annoying areas which do nothing to advance the story only to feed you a little piece of the plot afterwards before forcing you through the next area.\n\nMy verdict: It seems Laura Shigihara is a very good artist, but not a good game designer.

Wer die beiden Spiele geliebt hat und liebt, wer eine gewisse emotionale Ader hat, wer auf tolle Musikuntermalung steht und einfach ein kleines ber\u00fchrendes Abenteuer erleben m\u00f6chte, der ist hier genau richtig. Bitte zuschlagen!\n\nGebraucht habe ich insgesamt 10 Spielstunden, das topt die beiden anderen Spiele nat\u00fcrlich um L\u00e4ngen.\n\nMan spielt einen kleinen Jungen, welcher im Krankenhaus liegt und dort mit allerlei Mitpatienten in Kontakt kommt. Die Geschichte dreht sich um Verlust\u00e4ngste, um N\u00e4chstenliebe, um h\u00e4usliche Gewalt, Demenz und nat\u00fcrlich den Tod, ergo alles allt\u00e4gliche Dinge, die man sich immer wieder bewusst machen kann und sollte.\n\nW\u00e4hrend des Spiels erlebt man viele Schicksale, sein eigenes Leben spielt eine Rolle, das Leben der Anderen in der Klinik. Dabei gibt es eine Art metaphorische gemeinte Parallelwelt, die die Schicksale noch besser darzustellen vermag.\n\nViel mehr will ich eigentlich auch gar nicht loswerden, das Spiel und die Musik haben mich nachdenklich hinterlassen - traurig, gleichzeitig erf\u00fcllt - gro\u00dfes Kino.

bittersweet, yet endearingly hopeful, emotional rollercoaster. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me chills, it broke my heart and soul, and it made me wish things were different. Bring some tissues because there will probably be a 99% chance of precipitation originating from your tear ducts. \n\nThe story is about a Boy who is in a hospital. He has a book called Rakuen that his Mom reads to him every night and finds out the world inside the book, Morizora\u2019s Forest, is real. He\u2019s able to travel to that world through doors that appear in the hospital and the game combines elements from both worlds into the story. There are characters in the hospital that also show up in Morizora\u2019s Forest, and you have to find out what happened to these people (in both worlds) \u2013 what are their dreams, regrets, and hopes?  \n\nThere is no combat in this game \u2013 it focuses more on exploration and character development. The puzzles were not too challenging, nor too frustrating. The story itself is broken into 5 different parts/arcs and all of the arcs blended together seamlessly. I got really invested into the characters and their storylines. I could relate to each story in some way, which got me even more intrigued to find out what happened to these characters. There are a ton of endearing characters, like a little girl named Sue who collects marbles that have planets inside of them and Tony, a grumpy old man who guards a broken music box. \n\nThere is such a huge contrast between the hospital and Morizora\u2019s Forest. The hospital is gray and drab and is the location where most of the scary-ish scenes occur. It\u2019s where the majority of the depressing elements of the story will come to play. Morizora\u2019s Forest, however, is vibrant, colorful, and has adorable inhabitants. There are beams of sun that move as you do, giving a resplendent feel to the forest\u2019s charm. The music is upbeat and everyone there is (generally) happy and very comical. \n\nAlthough the game can be very sad, there is a lot of humor in the game as well and provides good comic relief during the unrelenting sadness. There were moments where I would be bawling my eyes out but there\u2019d be some humor laced into the scene, so I\u2019d be laughing with snot dribbling out of my nose. The world of the forest itself was full of ridiculously humorous characters. I was dying when I saw what the equivalent of a cat is in the Forest.\n\nOne thing that I appreciated, and loved, was that Mom was a huge presence in the game. It established a great dynamic of Mom\u2019s and Boy\u2019s relationship and showed how far Mom would go for her son. Mom was always there with you, to guide you, to give you helpful hints if you aren\u2019t sure what to do next, and to even hold your hand when things got scary. I\u2019m 27 years old, but I felt so much comfort and reassurance in having Mom there with me all the time, especially during scary scenes. Mom was such a badass \u2013 she\u2019s strong, witty, smart, kind, reassuring, sassy, super knowledgeable about tea, and always looks at the goodness in people - and she even comes with dad jokes! She\u2019s a beacon of hope in the darkness. \n\nThe graphics and art style are super cute. I like cute things (sue me, I\u2019m a grill) so when I saw how adorable the Leebles, buds, minimoris, and more from Morizora\u2019s Forest were, I was a goner - I died from cuteness. \n\nThe music was phenomenal. I can\u2019t really say much more than it was amazing and added so much to the mood and atmosphere. The music alone would make me want to cry sometimes. \n\nThe game itself is pretty short and I wish it had been longer \u2013 if only because I didn\u2019t want it to end! I took my time with the game since I wanted to explore every inch of both worlds. It took me 9.5 hours to finish the game \u2013 that includes all the stopping to bawl my eyes out and finding the strength to go on. \n\nThis game is so magical and heartwarming and instantly became one of my top favorites. It will take you on a beautiful and amazing journey. I can't recommend this game enough!\n\nEdit: spelling errors", "timestamp_created": 1497472814, "timestamp_updated": 1511853010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32417160": {"recommendationid": "32417160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040656363", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497095999}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a beautiful story with an amazing soundtrack.

It alternates between goofy humour, twee cuteness and utterly heartbreaking tragedy in a way that's similar to games like Undertale, To The Moon and Mother 3 and is every bit as good as those games are.\n\nIt isn't completely flawless and may not be for everybody though. A lot of the gameplay consists of fetch quests that can, at times, feel a little bit like filler and  there are a couple of characters that are very archetypal, without a whole lot of depth. As mentioned before, the game is very twee. I like that, personally, but it could be off putting to some. If you don't like your games to be cute, then this isn't for you because this game is adorable. That's not to say it can't get dark though.\n\nThe gameplay isn't all bad. It's a lot more involved than, say, To The Moon in that there are real puzzles to solve and even sections where you can die. None of the puzzles are hard but when they're not just fetch quests they can be engaging. Exploration is enjoyable and unlocking new areas and shortcuts in the map is very rewarding.\n\nThe story is obviously the real star of the show and it's extremely good for the most part. The majority of the game is funny, lighthearted and a little bit surreal which makes the parts that aren't really stick out. As you can probably gather from the blurb, the game can be very, very sad when it wants to be but it can also be quite creepy. There's a lot of music that wouldn't feel out of place in a survival horror title and the game is very good at making you feel isolated and alone at times.\n\nThe music and art are both beautiful and really make the world come alive. I don't think the story would be half as effective if either of these elements were weaker. From the ominous, to the chipper, to the tragic, every single moment is represented perfectly. The soundtrack also makes for a great listen outside of the context of the game.\n\nThe whole game feels like an adaptation of some great children's novel. Even though the themes and content can get pretty heavy and even though the game is, ultimately, a very sad one, this is still something I wish I had as a kid. But even as an adult the themes feel relevant and resonate with me. It's like the game version of a Studio Ghibli film, there really is something for all ages here and it's both whimsical and tragic in equal measure.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite games of the year so far. Wonderfully written, aesthetically beautiful and even pretty fun.

Still, it's not very important.\n\nThanks for this experience and I'm waiting for another one :) Keep up the great work Laura and the rest of the team!", "timestamp_created": 1496574552, "timestamp_updated": 1496574552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32167067": {"recommendationid": "32167067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184518771", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496565196}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5927\u6982\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u672c\u6765\u5c31\u6bd4\u8f83\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u7ae5\u8bdd\uff1f\u53cd\u6b63\u73a9\u5230\u6700\u540e\u771f\u7684\u633a\u611f\u52a8\u7684\u3002\n\n\u5267\u60c5\u5411\u7684\u5192\u9669\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8bb2\u8ff0\u533b\u9662\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7537\u5b69\u548c\u6bcd\u4eb2\u4e00\u8d77\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u5e7b\u60f3\u4e16\u754c\u5192\u9669\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u533b\u9662\u4e2d\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u4eba\u4ee5\u5524\u9192\u68ee\u6797\u5b88\u62a4\u795e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u5df1\u613f\u671b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u6865\u6bb5\u6709\u4e9b\u8001\u5957\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7f8e\u7ec6\u817b\uff0c\u4e4d\u770b\u7c97\u7cd9\u5b9e\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u5341\u8db3\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u642d\u914d\u4e0a\u52a8\u4eba\u7684BGM\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u51fb\u8fd8\u662f\u53ef\u89c2\u7684\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u9519\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u300aTo the Moon\u300b\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u5931\u671b\u3002\u4ee4\u6211\u60ca\u559c\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u672c\u4f5c\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u300aTo the Moon\u300b\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u2014\u2014\u81f3\u5c11\u4f60\u4e0d\u7528\u518d\u9762\u5bf9\u90a3\u4e9b\u8e69\u811a\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b3e\u7528RPG Maker\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u5192\u9669\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u7eaf\u89e3\u8c1c\u65e0\u7591\u975e\u5e38\u660e\u667a\u3002\u8c1c\u9898\u4e5f\u90fd\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u5c31\u50cf\u4f60\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u542c\u5988\u5988\u8bb2\u7761\u524d\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5e7b\u60f3\u8fdb\u5165\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u6240\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5192\u9669\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u8c1c\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5f97\u6bd4\u8f83\u751f\u786c\uff0c\u6709\u79cd\u4e3a\u89e3\u8c1c\u800c\u89e3\u8c1c\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u8282\u594f\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8fd8\u5b89\u6392\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u4e5f\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f60\u66f4\u52a0\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n\n\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u72ec\u7acb\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1496547716, "timestamp_updated": 1499826146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32166217": {"recommendationid": "32166217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368109750", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496965212}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first started to play this game, I was more confused than engaged.

I usually hate comparing but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't looking for something that could do for me what \"To the moon\" did and I'm pleased to say I have found a game that can do it in some form or fashion.\nNow Rakuen is absolutely brilliant and it's well worth your money and time. It is as you probably already know a heavily story driven game but that is far from all. The adorable character art and cozy RPG maker feel combined with absolutely fantastically composed music makes this game feel like home. You know how you return to mom's spaghetti meatballs and you just feel safe? Well that's what opening Rakuen feels like. It feels like someone sat down and spent some time because they cared and the product transfers that work of love and passion directly to you through great story telling, amusing dialogue and fitting music. For a game with nothing but music and a few sound effects to convey such emotions is incredible. One of the very few games that's been able to make me shed a tear.\nPlay this game alone. Don't play it without audio on like some time waste game in public where you skip dialogue. There is no fun gameplay or repetetive grinding you can waste your time on.

However, art for other characters like the Buds and Onions was a lot better. The backgrounds for the fanasty world really stood out to me.\n\nMusic and Sound- Beautiful score, songs fit the moment and areas very well. They didn't become annoying at any point. In some parts where there is singing there is voice acting. Keep in mind this is EXTREMELY rare. The voice acting is good, high quality. \n\nCharacters- I liked the majority of characters, even one off ones. I wish we could of spent more time with the main characters. You get connected to the characters, but it never feels like the character interacted with you much or connected with you except for Sue and (sort of) Tony. I was always wishing I could do something more for them, even if it was small, because that's kind of what these characters need. I felt helpless watching them, unable to help the way I wanted to. It never got to the point where it was annoying at all, it was more like... just emphasizing with the characters. Of course, that feeling of helplessness is kind of what the game's about. Many of the charcters feel lost and unable to do anything in their situaitions. It's out of their control... Aw man, I thought I was making a negative point but now it's positive! I haven't connected with characters like this in a long while. \n\nStory- Atmosphere is utilized very well. It actually made me anxious at some points, like in the Hospital or during [spoiler]Winston's story.[/spoiler] Character driven. \n\nGameplay- No combat, that's not an issue for me, but it's important. Consists of puzzles, walking around, talking to characters. Avoid this if you like (or need) your games with combat. \n\nA true gem worth your time. Don't let it pass you by just because of the RPGMaker Tag. Well worth the price, a great score, and charming \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1496446336, "timestamp_updated": 1496446336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32139875": {"recommendationid": "32139875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169564725", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495264001}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game", "timestamp_created": 1496444862, "timestamp_updated": 1496444862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32132812": {"recommendationid": "32132812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326176151", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496425363}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game a lot! A wide cast  of relatable and enjoyable characters. Puzzles are quite generic most of the time and are a breeze to go through, but when they become a head scratcher it's usually because the puzzle was not explained very well, e.g. the four seasons puzzle it took me quite a lot time to solve it, and I pretty much figured it out after solving the puzzle accidentally.\n\nHowever I don't believe the joy in playing this game is in the gameplay, much like games of this type such as To The Moon which I'm sure Rakuen will be compared to a lot because of your involvement in it, as these games are all about the journey and the characters which are done extremely well in this game.\n\nExploring the world is very enjoyable, and it's nice to back track when you gain new abilities and open up new areas. And all the NPCs are fun and quirky and I felt compelled to go around talkig to every single one of them just to be surprised by whatever they say.\n\nAnd of course, Laura Shigihara's music plays an important part in the emotional delivery, especially the vocal pieces that play during key moments. Just powerful stuff.\n\nOverall, it's a very worthwhile experience and I would recommend this game to any that enjoys a heart felt journey and interacting with a world of interesting characters, definitely take your time with this game to explore as it is very rewarding.", "timestamp_created": 1496420969, "timestamp_updated": 1496425456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32114572": {"recommendationid": "32114572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998133210", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496347283}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked To The Moon you have to play Rakuen.", "timestamp_created": 1496347793, "timestamp_updated": 1496347793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32113695": {"recommendationid": "32113695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128451875", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502991361}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein wundersch\u00f6nes RPG, welches mit einer wunderbaren Musik unterlegt ist.

Like \"To the Moon\", Rakuen is a more story-driven, rather than gameplay-driven, experience and introduces the player into its universe of stark contrast. A hospital on one side, in which the only joy to be around is brought by the often time rather quirky inhabitants (and yourself). And not-quite Rakuen on the other side: a colorful fantasy world that helps the two main characters - son and mother - not only to explore and resolve the stories of the patients in the \"real world\", but as well come to terms with the overarching storyline itself.\n\n\"Rakuen\" is heartfelt.

And not only the main story is crafted this well, every character in this world feels unique, like a real living being.\n\nFor 10 Euro (15 incl. Soundtrack - definitely worth it!!) I highly recommend Rakuen,\nbecause - even if it suffers under the same 'weaknesses' as other storydriven games, e.g. not offering enough gameplay, it does not need to hide behind To The Moon, Life is Strange etc. as it will definitely touch your feelings, and this game did it even more than any other game that I have played before.\n\nPlease spread the word and give Rakuen a try even if you are not a fan of RPGMaker products,\nas this is the perfect example of a storydriven game highlighted with the right use of music at the right time.\n\nThank you Laura Shigihara for this experience!", "timestamp_created": 1495968278, "timestamp_updated": 1495968278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709091", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32012879": {"recommendationid": "32012879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056119776", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507058412}, "language": "english", "review": "Comparison of this game to To The Moon is inevitable. So I'm going to provide 2 reviews for people who have/haven't played that:\n\n1. If you have [b]not[/b] played To The Moon (in which case [b]Don't read or watch anything about it before playing it![/b]) this review is for you:\nOk... So you are contemplating getting this game and you want help on that decision.\nIt is a linear, simple rpg / puzzle game minus the fights. 10-15 hours max if you take your time reading everything and try to do everything. Much faster if you rush through it. \nThis game is a project by a professional game musician, so yes the music is strong with this one. But it is at times a bit too eh, you know, kids cartoons style.\nPuzles are easy. Actually to make it easier game locks you off a lot of times until you figure something out, so it is hard to miss solutions.\nThe story is heart-warming. It does have its flaws and at places it feels bits and pieces have been cut off or not fully developed but it is not incoherent at any point. That is important because this game is basically about its story, not gameplay.\nGraphics are developed with a heart warming sensation in mind. And it is done properly. The magical world in mind of a child is so beautiful that coming back down to this world felt so cold after finishing the game!\nThere are a couple of clever things about this game I don't want to spoil. It does have its twists and it does play with your heart but it is not too dramatic.\nThe phylosophy is quite Japanese. The developer is half Japanese but I did not expect her to see things so Japanese for somebody who lives in US. Some concepts are just very Shinto-like (Final-Fantasy-like if you will).\nOverall, it is fun, you get a bit of laugh and tear here and there, and it does leave an impact on you. It provides a perspective without trying to be preaching it. People like developers of this game need our support, not as game developers, but rather as people who live among us. We want more people who think like this among us! \nWould I recommend it? If you are not going to expect a gameplay challenge or a long game (and hours of play is the least of my concerns when I rate a game), I very much would recommend it.\n\n \n2. So, you have played To the Moon and you want to see how this compares. (If you haven't, stop reading right now!) then this is what I'd tell you:\nConcept is similar yes, but it is a different game. The answer depends on what you expect. To the Moon nodes to the 80s style rpg genre but does its own thing. This game at times feels quite like a game of that era plus beautiful graphics and sound minus the fights.\nTo The Moon has a more complex story. Probably this game has more stuff in it, more places to visit, more things to read, etc. (overall I'd say twice as much material) but less twist and turn.\nMusically To The Moon is more abstract. It is more of something you'd listen to as an adult. Music of this one at times feels more like going to a theatre with your kid and trying to enjoy what a particular giant media corporation considers good entertainment for children. It may be your thing, it may be not.\nGraphics style is a bit more refined. To the Moon is dark and its art style is also dark. This one is the colors of a child's mind.\nThis game is less emotionally charged. I played To the Moon over a couple of mid-week evenings after work. Sleeping was a bit difficult afterwards with the atmosphere that it created. \"For River\" was not leaving me alone and still it is one of the most emotionally charged game songs I can think of. I didn't go through anything of that sort here. Don't get me wrong: This is a touching story. And it will have an impact on you after finishing it. But yeah, if you have played To the Moon you know that one is a different beast.\nAnd one last bit, this game starts fairly slow. It grows in pace and material through it. To the Moon was bold throughout. So if you are giving this a try, don't expect things to pick up from get go.\nDo I recommend it? If you think this will do to you what To the Moon did to many of us, you may get disappointed.

I would say the first thing that brought me to this game was that it was made by a person who-in part-did a beautiful soundtrack for To the Moon. So I came in expecting something like that. \nAnd boy did it do it\u2019s best to deliver.\nI still recommend this game, but it is-to my knowledge-a first time project for this team. With that, they have the usual \u2018pick up these items to build this\u2019 kind of stuff to fill the story. But I wasn\u2019t expecting much from the story, what I was looking forward to was the soundtrack.\nOh wow the soundtrack is amazing. Except for the few areas where there is-for no reason-no music. Just a stark contrast to the usual beautiful music that is the perfect thing for each mood. And I understand that sometimes, for impact, silence is the best, but when you go down a well into a place with nothing scary, it\u2019s not-in my opinion-the right time for silence.\nHowever, the story through all of it was amazing. At first you believe the story is \u201cKid in hospital goes to magical world with Mom\u201d and you would be right. But there is more. Chatter about the hospital being rebuilt. Destroyed rooms and blocked off back rooms (Which you can get through with the ax that you can bring into the hospital for some reason not yet explained). But every story is heartbreaking before it becomes heartwarming. \nDo I recommend this story game. Of course. Perfect to play for all ages.

It's clear how much love went into every aspect of this game, from the characters to the art to the soundtrack. There is a perfect balance of warmth, humor, eeriness, sadness, hope... there were parts where I laughed out loud, parts where I was legitimately scared, and parts where I cried. Traits of a great story!\n\nThe game really builds on itself as you go, reasserting itself until the end when the message is delivered straight to your heart, and it's a message that makes you rethink how you feel about life, makes you want to (at least for me) become a kinder, stronger person.\n\nNobody embodies the theme of this story better than the character of the Mom. I knew she was going to be awesome and she was indeed my favorite character in the whole game! She's witty, kind, strong, and always there for you. It's so unique in the world of video games that you get to have Mom in your party. There were parts in the game where I was spooked or even downright scared, but the fact that she was with me made me feel surprisingly safe and reassured. Because she walks through the hospital patients' stories with the Boy, it was interesting thinking about how as an adult, her experience of the stories might differ from the Boy's experience.\n\nI also enjoyed the gameplay and how seamlessly the world of the hospital and the world of the Leebles were woven together.\n\nIf you think you might enjoy a heartwarming story, then this is the game for you!", "timestamp_created": 1495736336, "timestamp_updated": 1495829475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31951167": {"recommendationid": "31951167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010313860", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509245454}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautiful games I have ever played", "timestamp_created": 1495717101, "timestamp_updated": 1495717101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31944952": {"recommendationid": "31944952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047495857", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495337642}, "language": "english", "review": "A small game with a big heart, that's probably the best way I can describe this game. \n\n[i]Rakuen[/i] tells the story of a hospitalized boy who one day asks his mom to accompany him to the world of his favourite storybook, Rakuen, to ask the Guardian of the Forest for a wish. However, before the Guardian grants his wish, he sets a series of tasks for the boy to complete that revolve around exploring and resolving the different troubles that beset the other patients in the hospital. Thus begins the boy's adventure as he travels between the hospital and the magical world of Rakuen, meets new friends, and faces different challenges, all the while unveiling the patients' stories as well as his own.\n\nWhile it reminded me of [i]To The Moon[/i], I'd say it plays more like the old Zelda games I used to play on my Gameboy Color, such as [i]Link's Awakening[/i]. Exploration is tied to your progress throughout the game as you acquire new tools that open up previously locked paths. Puzzles are also present in this game, even if they are not particularly difficult to solve. They are all fairly intuitive and take a trial-and-error approach that never feels cumbersome. Do not however, expect combat, of any kind. While Link may need a sword and shield to do battle in monster-infested Hyrule, the world of Rakuen is quite peaceful and welcoming, and whatever \"monsters\" you may encounter cannot be defeated with a blade. There is still an inventory as you sometimes need to gather materials to build certain tools or collect special items to complete quests.\n\nThe story itself is well-executed and incredibly moving. The game smoothly transitions between worlds to explore the lives of the patients, sometimes as characters in Rakuen, other times as their real-world selves. For instance, the grumpy old man is depicted as a bear in the world of Rakuen, and most of his story is explored there. On the other hand, the story of the little girl, Sue, is initially explored through your interactions with her at the hospital before transitioning to Rakuen as the story progresses. While every one of the patients' stories struck a cord with me, I must admit I really enjoyed Sue's story, mostly because of her interactions with the boy and her wonderful imagination. The game also has a few heart-warming surprises in store that I won't spoil for you.\n\nIf I had to critique something however, it would probably be the fact that [i]Rakuen[/i] spoils the ending very early on. While I admit it was something I had anticipated before playing, I did not think the game would be so blunt about it that early. It moved me to tears right then and there and I still kept playing it so it must have done something right. Also, bear in mind that the closer you get to the end, the more exposition you will see and the less gameplay you will encounter. Lastly, I was a bit taken aback by the scope of the boy's own story, even when there were clues sprinkled throughout the game that hinted at it. I feel however, that his story would have been tighter with a slightly narrower scope. \n\nOn a technical side note, the game's resolution is limited to 640x480 due to the engine used (RPG Maker XP). While this never detracted from my enjoyment I put it out there so you're aware. Incidentally, this game is perfectly suited for play on a handheld like the 3DS, and I sincerely hope it comes to the Nintendo Store soon.\n\nThe world of Rakuen itself is beautiful to explore, enhanced by the surprising variety of characters and the extensive and rich soundtrack. Seriously, the soundtrack on Bandcamp has 52 tracks, what's over an hour of music, with so many good tracks that it puts quite a lot of AAA game soundtracks to shame. Heck, the game itself puts many AAA titles to shame! For me, [i]Rakuen[/i] is right up there with games like [i]To The Moon[/i], [i]Bastion[/i], [i]Dust: An Elysian Tail[/i], among others. A lot of love was poured into making this game and it shows many times over.\n\nUltimately, [i]Rakuen[/i] is a game I heartily recommend at full price. With a beautiful story that will move you to tears and a world well-worth revisiting, [i]Rakuen[/i] is one of those rare gems that, sadly, go so often unnoticed.

I will tell some friends about this game.", "timestamp_created": 1495570022, "timestamp_updated": 1495570022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505127",

both discover and play.\nIt was such a pleasure to play this hidden gem and I hope more people just purchase this game and give it a try, you won't be disapointed.\n\nIf you would prefer to watch the video review instead of reading the written review then  just click the link below\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BdVgjT560k&ab_channel=GamePlays\n\n\nSo what is Rakuen ?\nWell Rakuen is a 2D top down non combative roll playing adventure game with a similar look and feel to the 16 bit super nintendo/sega era ( think of games like the legend of zelda )\nThis game has a very similar play style.\n\nIt's a game by Indie developer Laura Shigihara, who also by the way produces and perfoms some the music and songs in this game which really helps contribute to the telling and the actual feeling of the story.\n\nNow the name Rakuen is a Japanese word which when translated in to English means pleasure garden or paradise, and this is where a lot of the game takes place.\n\nYou play as a young boy who wears a cool paper samurai hat and is lying in a hospital bed for some reason, his mother frequently reads the book Rakuen to him.\n\nyou learn that Rakuen or the pleasure garden is a wonderful magical land where a mysterious creature lives who is the guardian of the forrest and this guardian has the abilty to grant wishes and if the boy wants to they can visit this place together, the boy states he would like to visit the guardian to make a wish.\n\nNow to help releive the boredom of being cooped up in your hospital bed the doctor allows you to explore the hospital.\nAs you begin to explore you realise that the hospital has been damaged in some way, the reason for this will become more apparent as the story progresses.\n\nAs you continue around the hospital you encounter various patients each with their own individual personality, story and problems.\nTheir problems touch on some very dark and real world issues such as loneliness Dementia bullying and even death.\nthis really gives the characters some meaning and depth, it makes you actually care about what happens to them.\nNow The patients ask you to do various tasks for them such as retrieving lost items or collecting certain materials or solving basic puzzles, but in order to do this you find youself traveling back and forth to a parallel universe that is connected to reality through mysterious doors that appear, these doors will give you access to the stories fantasy world.\n\nNow When you first arrive in this fantasy world you will be accompanied by your mother, your mother simply helps aid you in the telling of the stroy.\nyou can speak to her for hints about puzzels or if you just forget your objective, other than that she really serves no other purpose which is a shame as i think there could have been more interaction with one another but thats just a minor gripe.\nHowever she plays a major and poignant and down right emotional role towards the end of the game, So you've been warned.\n\nSo You both head off to see the guardian of the forrest and find out that he has been in a deep slumber for some time, in order to wake him and for him to grant you your wish you must first find and collect various songs that tie in with all of the patients you have met, thus creating individual story archs and quest lines for the patients you have met along the way.\nthe Weird and wonderful creatures that you will encounter in this world are actually some of the patients back in the reality of the hospital, for example an angry bear in the fantasy world who is terrorising a village is actually a grupmy old man named Tony in the hospital, he asks you to help him fix his music box.\nThis involves you carrying out quests in both worlds and by completing these quests in the fantasty world it has a knock on effect in reality.\nBy doing this you learn more about their past and hear their stories which brilliantly cross over from the fantasy world in to reality.\nThis is a very simple format used through out the game, yet it works so well.\n\nNow as you navigate your way through this world  you will notice how happy and bright and colourful and cheerful it is which is a complete contrast to the gloomy monochrome drab look and feel to the hospital.\nGiving the world a sense of escapasim from the actual reality.\nThe artwork of both worlds is really well done from the lovely looking sky islands and bright and vibrant village to the dark and gloomy feel to both the hospital and under ground caves that you have to navigate your way though.\nthe lack of voice acting in the game is replaced by a text based commentary where you simply have to read the dialog boxes that appears on screen, this in no way detracts from the game but instead it perfectly blends in, now the soundtrack to this game is the real star if pefeclty sets the scenes from joyous occasions to the down right tear inducing moments, i enjoyed it so much that i actually purchased the soundtrack.\n\nNow im sure all this may all sound rather dull and boring to you, as i said at the beginning there is no combat in this game and there are very few ways you can actualy die, as danger is not really a part of the game bar a few timed situations.\nbut trust me its not dull or boring, its really not.\nfor this game is a mark of really good story telling it lacks ever so slightly in the begining of the game whilst your trying to figure out everything that is going on, but after a while it really does keep you hooked and your wanting to find out more.\nAs i said previoulsly it address some very weighty topics as the boy and the patients try to make sense or their cruel reality. \nThis game really is an emotional roller coaster of a ride so get ready and strap yourself in.\nThe end scene between the boy and his mother is beautifully well done and is just something you will have to experience for yourself as it tries to point out the message i beleive the game is trying to portray.\nThat no matter how hard things are, its how we react to them that matters.\n\nThe game took me about 8 hours to complete and this can be done faster but there are things to collect that do help prolong the game.\nThe game costs \u00a36.99 in the UK and is well worth the money but i bought the bundle which includes the sound track for \u00a310.90.\n\nSo to finish off this review all i will say is that \nI love it when you find a hidden gem like this and you get to simply sit back and play a game that takes you on such a unique and wonderful journy filled with fun and laugher and moments of real sadness that actually make you stop and think about what you do have in your own life.\nNow I really dont want this to be a hidden gem I want this to be noticed I want this to played I want the developer to get the credit she deserves as a lot of indie developers kind of get hidden in vast aray of games that are on steam.\nSo if you can afford it please go out there and buy it and help support the developer.\nSo Finally Its with high expectaions that i eagerly await the next jounry she takes us all on.", "timestamp_created": 1495569184, "timestamp_updated": 1495916181,

There's my playtime.\n\nOh, boy... where do i even start?\n\nThis game may be one of the best i've played in the last 2 years. Why? Let's come to that.\n\n\"Emotional Rollercoaster\" might describe this title pretty well. But, one note here: Not these boring rollercoasters which go up and down. This? This can be compared to those rides where you hang freely, gettting thrown into one loop after another. This game takes your heart and soul and frequently changes between caressing and strangling.\n\nIf you liked \"To the Moon\", you will like this one too. Maybe even better, as i do. But let's get to the facts.\n\nGraphic:\nIt IS a RPG-Maker Game. Meaning, 640x480 with the option of turning on full screen, pixelated graphics are everywhere. But! It's not as apparent as in other games. There are beautifully drawn pictures of most of the characters who speak and high quality backgrounds. The world itself is crafted very well, unlike other RPG Maker Games it does not feel barren and empty, there are a lots of colours and everything feels like it just needs to be where it is. If you can look over the graphics, you will experience a fantastically written story.\n\nStory:\nWhile i won't spoiler, i have to say it's one of the saddest stories i've experienced in a game. Expect to change between laughing, because of witty and well written humour and crying, because of the events happening to the characters. These themself are, in short, lovable. Even the small side characters may crack a joke which makes you smile.\n\nGameplay:\nBasic. Very basic. You don't fight. You get to run around, talk with a lot of people, investigate events, search every nook and cranny for collectibles and complete a variety of \"quests\", to progress the story. Occasionally you have a time based escape, which you can fail, but the game autosaves in about every room or area you enter, so it won't be that bad. It's a typical walking simulator, quite similar to \"To the Moon\". And while i took about 6 hours to complete the game, i'm sure you can do it in 4 or even less. So it's not much, but that is absolutely okay. The story has to end at some point and it does not feel rushed or stretched out. It felt right.\n\nSoundtrack:\nAwesome. For a RPG Maker Game? Absolutely outstanding. Not even the actual singing part of Laura Shigihara alone, but also the music in the game itself. It's catchy, it fits the mood of the scene. Very well done.\n\nAs you may have deduced: I highly recommend this game if you can forgive the typical RPG Maker graphics.

Unlike To The Moon, I think Rakuen resonates more with its soul of exploring the relationship between the player character and his mother.  This is lightly touched territory for games, and I'd love to see other games with personal mechanics like Rakuen's \"talk to mom\" action.\n\nIf I had to complain, however, the game is uneven.  None of the puzzles are difficult, but many require stumbling on the solution.  Maps like the hospital or village are richly thought out, but a few other areas feel tacked on.

It\u2019s a tale about a boy coming to terms with his own illness while helping those around him to do the same. The story is heartfelt and so very human that I would recommend the game to any who would listen.

It has one of the most emotional stories in video game history and characters you will adore.  It is fun from the first act to the last.  It constantly surprises you, delights you and makes you think.  It is 7-10 hours you will be extremely glad you spent.\n\nHowever, if you're like me you will only even see this game by accident because you have already blocked the RPGMaker tag on steam because there is so much dross built with it.  Ignore the fact it has the RPGMaker tag.  It's OK.  Trust me.  It isn't a typical RPGMaker game.  Forget it is even mentioned.  Fingers in the ears,  La La La La.\n\nBuy it now.  It's a bargain at full price.  If it's in a sale, buy it twice and give it to a buddy.  You won't have played anything close to as well written as this is.  Buy it because the script is awesome.  Buy it because the characters are supremely unique, imaginative and memorable.  Buy it because the story has emotional highs and lows you just won't have experienced in any game before, ever.

This game's puzzles are fairly straightfoward and it provides plenty of clues in order to solve almost all of the puzzles. The puzzles serve as a medium to tell the narrative. That being said there are some fairly difficult ones here and there. \n\nThe game's soundtrack is wonderful, and it has a bevy of different styles and tones that really showcase the talent put into the game.

Todo lo anterior bajo una excelente y cuidada ambientacion, por la gran calidad del soundtrack (compuesto por ella misma), y la impresionante cantidad de detalles que encuentras en cada rinc\u00f3n de los \"2 mundos\". \n\nObviamente no podemos comparar este juego con otros gigantes de la industria, pero lo destaco por ser obra proveniente desde los mundos indies, de la mano de Laura Shigihara y compa\u00f1ia, bajo plataformas como RPG Maker XP.

This game was made to appeal to a specific type of person, and I think enthusiastic hyperbole can backfire when it draws in people other than the intended audience, who are disappointed and end up calling the game bad.  It's not bad, it just fits a relatively small niche.  So I'm going to try to be honest here.\n\nFirst and foremost, Rakuen is super sugary saccharine sweet.  I'm not saying this as a criticism, I'm saying it because it's a central part of the experience, and the main thing that I think is going to divide opinions on the game.  Imagine the corniest cartoon Christmas special you've seen, then double the dosage of sap, complete with actual musical numbers.  If that sounds amazing to you, go ahead and buy the game.  If it's any kind of a turn-off, you should probably stay away.  If you need more details, well, they're forthcoming.\n\nWhile the game is sweet, it's also very sad.  The reason the game's world is so sentimental is because the plot is about people who need idealistic stories like that to help them come to terms with the tragedies of reality.  There's a running theme of being distant from loved ones in some way, and seeking any way possible to close the gap.  And, well, heck, the game takes place primarily in a hospital.  What direction do YOU think the story is going to go?\n\nSo that covers tone, but is the story GOOD?  Well, I think the game accomplished its intended goals, and that's the only quality I can really measure.  Whether you like it or not really comes down to how you respond to the intensity of the emotions the game is going for.  If you don't embrace it for what it is, you're probably just going to be weirded out or even annoyed by all of it.  But if you're into it, let me tell you, once the game gets going, it does not let up.  Somehow the first time you're left sobbing on the floor isn't enough to prepare you for the two or three times it happens again right after that, even though you will see it coming.  Though to be fair, this doesn't describe the entire game; for the first 2/3rds of the game, you get plenty of breaks to dance around in sunshine and rainbows.  (Seriously, expect to see literal sunshine and rainbows in this game.  How is anyone still this idealistic in TYOL 2017?)\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering what the gameplay is like before making a decision on whether the game's right for you.  If so, then you should probably just go ahead and give it a pass.  This is not a gameplay-oriented game.  This is an RPG Maker adventure game without combat, that is to say, gameplay consists of walking around a map and talking to people.  You're given fetchquest-style tasks to fulfill, there's a few light puzzles here and there, there's some items to collect, but really most of that is just to help keep you awake in between the moments that you're talking to people.  If you've played any RPG Maker game like this, you'll know exactly what to expect from this one.  This is a game to play for the story and exploration, not the gameplay.\n\nIf you want another specific game to compare it to, I made the connection to To The Moon that a lot of other people seem to have made.  Very similar themes, except Rakuen covers more than just one person's story.\n\nOh yeah, and it's worth mentioning the music, since it really does stand out.  Music's important to me and I honestly miss the RPG soundtracks from the days of the SNES and the original Playstation, and playing this game absolutely made me feel like I was playing something like Legend of Mana over again.  Arguably you could say that's more of a review of the soundtrack than the game itself, but one of the things I'm specifically nostalgic for is being able to explore a town and talk to all the people in it while listening to memorable music to set the atmosphere, music that was more than just background filler, music with a heart and personality that matched the town I was exploring.  Thanks to Rakuen, I got to do that again.\n\nThat's about all I got, hopefully that's enough to make an informed decision.  In summary: Only SUCKAS don't play Rakuen!!!\n\nI'm sorry for the outburst.

I fell in love with Laura Shigihara's music when I first played Plants vs Zombies almost a decade ago and have tried to follow her work ever since.

That's not to say I didn't expect great things from her across the board, but I definitely came into this thinking primarily of the music.\n\nOf course, the music did not disappoint but I really can't get over how GOOD this game was!!! It's a beautiful game with charming, memorable characters. You can honestly feel how much love went into each and every part of the game from its maps to its sprite designs, to its carefully told story. The world is so colourful and lovely, you can't help but want to explore every nook and cranny. Every NPC has such funny or interesting things to say that you'll find yourself going back through every map over and over just to eke out every bit of dialogue and worldbuilding this game has to offer. The game is pretty short--in an (almost) 100% run, it only took me about 9 hours (be careful--there's some missable collectables that will trip you up in the end if you don't follow a walkthrough), but it's 9 hours well spent. It's just the right length and it manages to get its themes and ideas across perfectly well without dragging it out. (Although I certainly loved the game enough that I was getting melancholic as I reached the end because I knew my time in the game's world was coming to an end!) \n\nAnd, like I said, the music is wonderful and it matches the game so well.

The few times I tested it, they still appeared in the lounge. There's no guarantee it works for all the items, so please be careful~\n* Music will continue to play even if you pause (f10? f12? something like that). I haven't tested if it also happens with cutscenes, but it most definitely does for the ending credits.

The story is unique in that it wraps complex subjects like Dementia, long term Coma, and illnesses into a whimsical setting experienced through the eyes of a child, and it works.  Like To the Moon, the game focuses heavily in the character development over mechanical gameplay.  The main story is told through experiencing the backstories of several character you meet throughout the game; each with their own arcs complete with high and lowpoints.  The arcs takes you through a main overworld reality and a very stylized \"alternate\" reality; which, influence eachother at specific points throughout the game requiring the player to switch between them to solve certain puzzles.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n  [*]Excellent Story.\n  [*]Fantastic music (Do yourself a favor and pick up the Soundtrack version).\n  [*]Relatable and interesting characters.\n  [*]Appealing art design, especially in the alternate reality.\n  [*]Mom offers hints if stuck and adds to dialog between characters. The true MVP of this game.\n[/list]\n\nNeutral:\n[list]\n  [*]The puzzles are mostly simple and this could be a pro or a con depending on your outlook.\n  [*]There is a lot of walking between places.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n  [*]Limited by the RPG Maker framework (Controls mostly, no resolution selection, and no volume settings).\n  [*]Controls behave like in To the Moon.  They are awkward at times (uses arrow keys, enter, and Q for example) and cannot be reassigned.\n  [*]Areas involving confined spaces with multiple turns/zig-zags are troublesome to navigate at times because of the controls.\n  [*]The main story arc is a bit predictable, but still offers some surprises.  Although, the payoff will still hit hard even if you know it is coming.\n  [*]One-shot experience.  There isn't much to replay value.\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my time in Rakuen.

As someone who greatly enjoyed To The Moon, I thought that Rakuen would be perfect for me. However, despite the game's best efforts, it ultimately is crushed under the weight of its own ambition and feels more like a tedious slog than a journey through the highs and lows of the human condition. \n\nIt may not be fair to compare Rakuen to To The Moon, but unfortunately the developer opens itself up to criticism when its main selling point is that it is a \"To the Moon inspired game.\" Interstingly enough, the game falls flat on its face whenever it tries to be its own game. To the Moon's gameplay was essentially non-existant, which ended up making it a super tight experience that focused solely on narrative. Rakuen, on the other hand, adds a series of puzzles and quests that feel more tedious than anything else. \n\nThese puzzles break up an otherwise excellently written and engaging story that I would love to experience on its own. These gameplay segments are so breathtakingly boring that I ended up stopping halfway threw a chapter because a puzzle demanded that I memorize chess pieces - no really. The game expected me to remember the exact location of chess pieces on a chess board. \n\nAnother problem the game suffers from is that it tells its story from two perspectives: one grounded in reality and one grounded in fantasy. The original setting takes place in a hospital, which serves as a perfect backdrop for the very real and serious issues that each character must face. Unfortunately, the drama is severely undercut when Rakuen chooses instead to tell these stories in the fantasy world where people are replaced with humanoid cat creatures and cartoon grizzly bears. I get how the fantasy backdrop is suppose to lessen the severity of the issues but it ends up only softening the emotional gut punch that is the main attraction to these types games. \n\n\nTL;DR Buy To the Moon instead or play it again if you already have it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1494564970, "timestamp_updated": 1494564970, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.391171", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31693673": {"recommendationid": "31693673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111830700", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499195203}, "language": "polish", "review": "Rakuen to nowa, niezwykle ujuj\u0105ca forma przekazania nam tego, jak wa\u017cne w \u017cyciu s\u0105 aspekty, o kt\u00f3re dbamy.

This is the only game that I have played that has made me completely sob and cry so that in itself is incredibly special.\n\nStarting out with the postives. The stories that the game tells are quite good and leave a great emotional impact. Going inbetween the hospital and fantasy world creates an interesting gameplay dynamic. The characters that you meet in the fantasy world are mostly incredibly charming and are a joy to talk to. The spritework can range from \"yup this is an RPG maker game\" to \"wow that actually looks amazing.\" The animations of some of the sprites definitely put a smile on my face and you can tell a lot of work went into them. The soundtrack is wonderful and while it probably won't win any awards, it fits the game perfectly and it was a joy to listen to. I got plenty of genuine laughs from the scenarios that occured in the fantasy world and had plenty of tear jerking moments. The ending hit me so hard I actually couldn't stop crying as the credits were rolling. I think anyone who has dealt with a relative or a close friend who had a long term illness will get more out of the story due to being able to relate to it.\n\nSome of the main problems I have with the game is that it feels at times tonally inconsistent in it's gameplay. You start out doing basic adventure game stuff, i.e finding items, seeing what people want, trying to solve problems, etc. This is how it plays for the first hour or so with no real emotinal punches before  it really gets into the meat of it which is helping and dealing with the problems of the other patients in the hospital. This is where the game gets sad in the story, and inconsistent in how it tells it. \n\nWithout spoiling any of the details, the first one you have to go through feels radically different from the others. Going inbetween a completely twisted version of the hospital full of puzzles and enemies, which also gives you details on what has happened in the real world, and with a parallel story taking place in the fantasy world; it works incredibly well in telling an original story. The twisted hospital feels oppressive and creates fear and anxiety with what is happening in the story, through it's gameplay. The main problem is that this is the only part of the game that feels like that. \n\nThe second you go through an abandoned house, with no where near the same atmosphere. Still similar puzzles but the oppressive atmosphere is gone. This could be fine if they didn't completely abandon it for the rest of the stories. The 3rd's \"puzzles\" mostly take place in the fantasy world, completely removed from the character's actual story. This portion while funny and entertaining, it was topped of with what just amounted to cutscenes to tell the story of what happened to the hospital patient. The 4th takes it even further and mostly relegates it to cutscenes with very little gameplay. The shift in storytelling feels bad due to the fact that the first one was more powerful due to how it's told. Being in a hospital is scary. Being sick is scary. Going through that and the catharsis you can get at the end of the first section felt good and you don't really get that in the later ones. It's just cutscenes, and while they are good cutscenes, it makes me upset that the first part was done better.\n\nWhile this above portion sounds incredibly negative, please don't let that deter you. The game designer in me just got a little upset because it could have been better.

Get it. Buy it. Play it. FEEL.\n\nEdit:\nSo, after playing it for 10 hours, splitting it between days, getting through countless tissues and listening to the soundtrack over and over again, here is my honest review.\n\nRakuen is a game that I bought because I'm such a big fan of 'To The Moon' and Laura Shigihara' music is the best. It's soothing, emotional and seems to fit into every scene perfectly.\nShe has created a touching game, where you can make friends, see wonderful words and just generally have fun.\nNow, from the get go, you are aware that this game is dealing with a little boy, sick in the hospital.\nSPOILERS (just FYI): This game deals with life, death and how families handle those tough times when a loved one is in the hospital. \nIt's got a beautiful message, about strength, courage and love, and the fear that we all feel deep inside, when we don't know if things are going to be alright.

The Boy also learns that Morizora will grant one wish to anyone that can complete his challenges as well :)\n\nAfter finding out from his Mum that Rakuen is indeed a real place!, secret doors start appearing in the hospital, and the Boy and his Mum travel together to explore this amazing and beautiful world ^_^\n\nYour goal in Rakuen is to help out the residents living with you in the hospital, and consequently, their alter-ego's in Morizora's Forest :D There are a lot of different characters to interact with - some of them include a girl who has lost her best friend and is trying to find her, to a man who has lost his memory.\n\nYou play through each of the resident's journeys, quite literally in their own shoes, as you discover how it is they came to be at the hospital, their backstory, and how to help them overcome their own personal challenges :)\n\nI won't spoil anything else, but you do end up learning a lot about the Boy as you complete each of the residents' challenges and progress through the game ^_^\n\nThe characters themselves are VERY likeable, and personally, I felt a very strong connection with all of them when I played through Rakuen, which is very rare straight-off :) (Usually it takes me a while to like a video game character until a bit later on in the story, no matter what type of genre of game it is). They also have their own unique personalities and backstories to share, and I loved getting to know each character and sharing in their adventures :D\n\nThere is a LOT of music in Rakuen, most of it instrumental, but some of the tracks are also vocal - which are tied with each of the hospital characters you come across :D Laura herself has composed 99% of these tracks, and has done an amazingly magnificent job on them! ^_^ I would DEFINITELY recommend listening to the soundtrack on its own if you get a chance, it's WELL worth a listen! :D\n\nTo summarise, if you love story based games with wonderful characters, beautiful music, and a few dungeon-like puzzles, then Rakuen is a game I would highly recommend! Be warned though, the game isn't all cheery and does have some sad parts, so it WILL make you cry on some bits, so I'd have a box of tissues on hand just in case <3\n\nThanks so much again Laura for making one of THE best and most beautiful story games out there, you are amazing to of come up with something so wonderful! <3\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1494438445, "timestamp_updated": 1494438445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536590", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31668803": {"recommendationid": "31668803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066319312", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495028393}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Rpg game just try it.

Never before have I encountered a \"fantasy\" game that addressed the human condition and nature so well. \n\nVisuals are relatively simple, but provide excellent contrast and immediately capture your attention. Soundtrack is amazing, as would be expected from the co-composer of To The Moon's soundtrack. There's plenty of puzzle solving to be done in Rakuen, unlike To The Moon, but the puzzles never felt bothersome and served to complement the narrative well. \n\nIf you're looking for a story-centric game that both appeals to your childhood imagination while addressing the woes of adulthood and life, look no further. This game deserves so much more attention. To try and explain further why this game is so powerful would be to spoil your experience. Please support these developers and try the game for yourself. \n\nIn the end, Rakuen is not about fixing every mistake or shortcoming in life, but making the best of what you have.\n\nAnd that's ok.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515712242, "timestamp_updated": 1515712242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39266791": {"recommendationid": "39266791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031459628", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 480, "last_played": 1515318982}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] And before it's time to leave, would you build a little world with me?

The art is lovely, the music is absolutely breathtaking, the story is so delicately well crafted, and the down-to-earth writing of the script is second to none.\n\nLaura Shigihara and co. have created a love letter to 16-bit RPGs. Despite there being no random battles or any of the gameplay staples of that era, the bright and colorful world and zany characters, as well as a couple more literal nods to influential games, really do that era of gaming a justice that I have not seen in years. The world feels like Earthbound meets Secret of Mana meets Chrono Trigger. As a SNES kid, this resonated with me deeply. \n\nEmotionally, I feel like it's easily in my personal top five most emotionally touching games. \n\nIf you're on the fence about this game and happen upon this review, please do yourself a favour and support this wonderful piece of art.

In fact, this game might just be better than all three. But, maybe that's because the story was more personally relatable to me (More on that later).\n\nBut what is it that makes this game so good?\n\nThe graphics? They're outstanding. They are very familiar to anyone that has played any of the Freebird games. They're light, cute and surprisingly detailed. The animations feel natural and the vibrancy of the colour palette makes the entire game, it's characters and its story, come alive. It can be cheery, it can be creepy. It's perfect.\n\nThe music? Amazing, beyond words. Just like how Kan uses Piano to make his games come alive, Shigihara uses a strange combination of drum and samples to make the  game-world seem real. Shigihara's vocals are a really nice addition too, they really made me think of To The Moon more when playing \n\nThe Story.\nRight, just before I say anything else, I want to emphasise: PLAY THE GAME BLIND!!! Don't even search it on google, just play! Stop reading the review and buy it!\nIf you played To The Moon or a game like that, you know what I'm going with this... \nThe game's story is it's crowining part. It's amazingly balanced. It'll make you smile and laugh. Scared and fearless. And it will all end in one of the most heartfelt, beautiful endings I have ever had the privilege of witnessing. \nThere are so many memorable characters in the game, they all feel as though they are real, and this only immerses you further. The only real complaint I have is that one or two of the characters are just there for the sake of being there, without much development. But, there's no real easy solution to this and it really doesn't affect your experience while playing. \nThe game rewards you for exploring, and there's a multitude of different sidequests and little things to collect and do that will keep you occupied and give a little bit more replayability. Humour is one of the game's strong suites too, and you'll laugh. Alot. \nThe story gives an important moral too. I won't spoil and say what that is, but it's wonderful in its own way.\n\nI don't really think I have anything more to say. This game hit me on an emotional level, made me cry and smile at the same time. But, regardless of that, I am stronger having played it. And, you should too. It's an experience that everyone should have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Oh, and this stuff is spoilers. Only read if you finished it, or come back.*\n\n[spoiler]Ok, seriously. That story was so heartfelt that the ending had me LITERALLY saying \"no\". I cried my eyes out for a good 30 minutes. Oh, and 'Rakuen' means 'Heaven' in Japanese. That only made me cry more.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1516566633, "timestamp_updated": 1516566633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39509604": {"recommendationid": "39509604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275414780", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1516538147}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f5c\u8005\u662f\u4e2a\u5f88\u6709\u624d\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\uff0c\u5531\u6b4c\u5f88\u597d\u542c\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u5e94\u8be5\u66f4\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u6653 \uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u690d\u7269\u5927\u6218\u50f5\u5c38\u4e2d\u5979\u6f14\u5531\u4e86\u4e3b\u9898\u66f2\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1516538637, "timestamp_updated": 1516538637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39504359": {"recommendationid": "39504359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243438258", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 324, "last_played": 1516444448}, "language": "english", "review": "This values what it means to have a family that loves you.", "timestamp_created": 1516522788, "timestamp_updated": 1516522788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39489731": {"recommendationid": "39489731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289337437", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 440, "last_played": 1516471781}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u8ba9\u5988\u5988\u4e00\u8d77\u5192\u9669\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u61c2\uff0c\u4f46\u5230\u4e86\u540e\u9762\u968f\u7740\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u63a8\u52a8\u8ba9\u6211\u611f\u89e6\u9887\u6df1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1516471772, "timestamp_updated": 1516471772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39485965": {"recommendationid": "39485965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074880281", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 293, "last_played": 1516461519}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein tolles Spiel, sowohl inhaltlich als auch visuell sch\u00f6n gestaltet.

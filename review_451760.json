I think most people would be able to point out some implausible events, but I would argue that they are few and less egregious than in your average visual novel. Most people don't pick up this game for an award winning story; they pick it up for cute lesbians, and [i] god damn [/i] are they cute. On that front, my expectations were more than met.\n\nBut what really appeals to me about this game is that it's not just cute, it's [i] classy [/i]. The main focus of this game is a relationship, and maybe I've been reading the wrong visual novels, but this relationship was by far the most normal one I've ever encountered in a game like this. Most anime relationships have some fantasy that they pander to, and this one is no exception, but to me (remember, NOT an expert here), it's a healthy, reasonable fantasy. It's something you [i] should [/i] want for yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed watching these two girls get to know each other, work through their problems, and build trust. \n\nThis game has a patch to add 18+ content, which I highly recommend doing if you are able (just drop the adult.rpa file into steamapps/common/highway blossoms/game). I installed the patch incorrectly and missed the first scene, and after going back with the patch correctly installed, I can confidently say that the sex adds to the overall experience of the game, being both a normal and important part of relationships. Also, frankly, it was hot as fuck and you'd be missing out.\n\nIt looks like Highway Blossoms might be getting voice acting soon, too. While I do think that will make it an even better game, I don't know if I'll be able to go through it again without the voices I had already mentally assigned the characters. If you are like me and think that would be weird, you might want to wait until that update comes out. \n\nFucking fantastic game. Worth full price, a steal at $2.50. 9/10. Great way to spend a day.

Unlike other VN's, Highway Blossoms does a great job of hooking the reader, keeping them entertained, and playing with their emotions once you've become invested enough.

Si tratta quindi di un'ambientazione molto atipica nelle Visual Novel (da rimarcare che \u00e8 di produzione occidentale ma utilizza il famoso stile asiatico per i personaggi) e fu proprio questo ad accendere il mio interesse.\n\nQui siamo Amber, una giovane ragazza che \u00e8 in viaggio con il suo vecchio camper verso la California per assistere ad un festival della musica. Durante il viaggio si imbatter\u00e0 in Marina, una giovane ragazza con la sua macchina in panne. Un po' mossa dalla piet\u00e0 e un po' per non lasciare sola Marina nel mezzo del deserto, Amber le offre un passaggio fino alla prossima stazione di benzina. Qui si verr\u00e0 a scoprire che Marina \u00e8 partita da sola con la macchina del fratello, senza avvisare nessuno per cercare un tesoro appartenente ad un ex-minatore. E quindi cos\u00ec inizia il viaggio di Amber (che sar\u00e0 molto scettica a proposito) e Marina nei Four Corners alla ricerca del tesoro.\n\nSi tratta di una VN molto ben scritta, passionale e intensa, anche se la trama in alcuni punti appare un po' prevedibile, \u00e8 fatta bene e narrata in modo realistico, senza avere quella sorta di \"Anime/Manga logic\". Infatti pi\u00f9 di una volta con le varie situazioni (alcune esilaranti) mi sono ritrovato a vedere i miei pensieri riassunti da Amber. \n\n\u00c8 presente anche una patch 18+ ma che fortunatamente non trasforma il gioco in un qualcosa di esageratamente osceno, ma semplicemente sblocca delle scene di sesso passionale.\n\nSia la grafica sia le musiche sono apprezzabili e ben fatte. Inoltre completando il gioco (4-5 orette sono sufficienti) si sblocca una sorta di NG+ chiamata Goofball mode che rende la VN pi\u00f9 divertente e stupida. Si tratta di un simpatico extra che vi prender\u00e0 poco tempo e strapper\u00e0 pi\u00f9 di una volta un sorriso sulla vostra faccia.\n\nL'unico difetto che ho trovato nella VN \u00e8 un po' l'inizio, che ho trovato un po' noioso. La VN evidentemente ha bisogno di tempo per ingranare. Ma a parte questo \u00e8 una VN che consiglio se apprezzate le VN, se siete fan dello yuri e del genere On-the-road.\n\nVoto: 6.5", "timestamp_created": 1510563274, "timestamp_updated": 1510563294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520767", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36478541": {"recommendationid": "36478541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074598634", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510682300}, "language": "english", "review": "I just wanted to say that the RV's engine's soundeffect was really comforting and i love it endlessly, I've never felt more relaxed.

In fact, it's become one of my favourite visual novels ever, and for a product priced at a mere \u00a37 that's exceptional.\n\nA lot of what makes it work is the central protagonists Amber and Marina. Amber's realism focused persona capable of poking fun at everything contrasts well with Marina's energetic marvelling at the world. The relationship that develops between the two is amazing and I found myself rooting for them at every given opportunity. The pair are supported by other interesting characters too. Even Mariah, who the story designates as the resident bitch, is surprisingly likeable and important to the story.\n\nAdmittedly, a lot of this story relies on actions that seem insane from a regular person's perspective, but I'm willing to indulge that insanity because it developed into a story that kept me hooked from beginning to end. There was never a point that I considered slow or padded out. Instead events flow smoothly from one adventure to the next and the careful balance ensures that the novel can explore a variety of themes that all tie in well to the backgrounds of the protagonists.\n\nI love the art as well. The character designs not only look fantastic but are distinctly memorable, and the background scenes are varied and interesting frames for the story to unfold in. For a novel where most of the events take place in desert environments they've done well to keep that interesting. The soundtrack is amazing as well, providing a strong variety of tunes in the background and even tying some of that into the narrative. The lack of voice acting is a shame but in no way dulls my positivity about the novel.\n\nSo unless you don't like the genre this is definitely something to have in the library.", "timestamp_created": 1510265739, "timestamp_updated": 1511043555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36376076": {"recommendationid": "36376076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051131239", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509738117}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Eu realmente tentei ir at\u00e9 o final do jogo, mas n\u00e3o tive for\u00e7as para aguentar o t\u00e9dio deste VN.

No meio disso, tem o envolvimento das duas, que tamb\u00e9m parece meio for\u00e7ado, admitindo que a Marina \u00e9 basicamente uma crian\u00e7a no corpo de uma adulta e a Amber tenta proteger ela de sua pr\u00f3pria estupidez.

There\u2019s less than a dozen characters that even have sprites in Highway Blossoms, but each of the main cast members are wonderfully fleshed out in the ~5 hours you spend with them. \nThe story shines brightest when focusing on the interplay of loss and love, and the uncertainty that can come from mixing grief with romance. Really, it\u2019s heartfelt and lovely, and tugs at the ole strings at just the right times. If you willing to open your mind and your heart for it, even just a little bit, Highway Blossoms may well wriggle in before you know it. \n\n\nBreak: I couldn\u2019t think of anything interesting to put here, so this Scott Pilgrim quote from earlier will [url=https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12744085_506686812825713_7864633856073370842_n.jpg?oh=4e3839aca07bf33c0207e7152d7a88d9&oe=5A7AA039] have to do.[/url]\n\n\nSoundtrack: [u] Worth Buying [/u]\n\nIt\u2019s a smaller soundtrack, clocking in at 26 tracks and a little over an hour, but the music in it is of generally high quality, aside from some small problems with how the music was edited, like some tracks having large amounts of dead air or ending in the middle of a phrase. The music effectively evokes the setting of the southwest, occasionally using a harmonica for that western kind of feel, but mostly using lighter tones coupled with guitars to give a feeling evocative of the open road. The soundtrack is quiet, honestly, but that\u2019s part of why I love it. It serves as a background for the story, and accentuates what\u2019s happening without overbearing you. The stuff by Jake Abernathie sticks out most to me, with his mellow acoustic pieces, but the rest of the soundtrack is good as well, and sitting at around an hour of music for 5 dollars, I think it\u2019s a fine price point. That, and Marina\u2019s Mixtape. It\u2019s so goddamn dumb I love it.\n\n\n\nAlright, now I can talk for way longer than I should, in case anyone wants to listen to me ramble.\n\nI found this game indirectly, you could say. Way back in the day, say around 5 years ago, I read a VN called Katawa Shoujo, which to anyone particularly Nippon savvy, sounds like cripple porn. Which it kinda is, but isn\u2019t at the same time. It\u2019s complicated. Anyway, one of the CG artists on KS goes by the moniker of Weee, and the only reason I initially looked at Highway Blossoms was because of their involvement. I know, strange way of picking a game, by a single CG artist, but hey, cut me some slack. \n\nThe point I\u2019m getting at with this was that this didn\u2019t even pop on my radar initially. If I were to see this on the front page of Steam, I\u2019d likely dismiss it out of hand as something akin to the Sakura games, or Nekopara (last mention I swear), basically just porn with more left clicks. Katawa Shoujo had the same perception problem, and was amazing despite its initial impressions. So, on the merit of Weee\u2019s involvement, I gave HB the same time of day that I gave KS. Like I joked in the TL; DR, yes, there is an 18+ patch, but it\u2019s tasteful and at the service of the story. The sexual content in Highway Blossoms isn\u2019t there to entice the reader, it\u2019s there because it has to be. Sex isn\u2019t a reward for figuring out the \u201cpuzzle\u201d that is a character\u2019s romance tree, like in Mass Effect. It\u2019s a normal part of most relationships, so removing any sexual elements from a story like this, about a couple falling in love, would be dishonest at best. Plus, at the end of the day, the 18+ patch is entirely optional. I would advise installing it since it\u2019s a part of the narrative, and important to the story in its own way, but it\u2019s not the crux of the story. The game is still worth playing without it.\n\nI could get into the whole \u201cgames as a medium, and the place of visual novels therein\u201d thing, but I get the feeling that anyone who\u2019s bothered to read this far into my review isn\u2019t going to be offended by the notion that this game is on Steam, so at the end of the day all I want to say is that it\u2019s worth noting that there are no decisions or branching paths in HB. The game starts, and you begin clicking or set Auto, and read to your hearts content. Depending on your reading speed, this can last you from anywhere between 5-14 hours, but probably more like 6. I personally clocked around 5 hours for the main game, and then spent another hour on the silly extra content entitled \u201cGoofball Mode\u201d, which essentially has them riffing on their own game, and makes a repeat readthrough more interesting. If you\u2019re the busy type, you can always hit the skip button, and the game will stop on any lines of text you haven\u2019t read before, so you can catch the jokes and shenanigans without having to reread the whole story. That\u2019s what I did, but I\u2019m planning on rereading HB anyway, as the music has been stuck in my head for the last week and I just have an itch to spend more time with the characters.\n\nAlright, we\u2019ve hit most of the stuff that I wanted to talk about, but I still have some time left to gush about my favorite part of the game. In many words, I think most people seem to be overlooking one of the stronger points of the narrative, specifically Amber\u2019s struggles with the grieving process. I get it, it\u2019s a mushy romance story, of course the love interest and wooing thereof is the most important part, but it\u2019s the interplay of that with Amber attempting to work through her Grandfather\u2019s passing that was my favorite part of the game. I struggle to put it into exact words without spoiling some things, but I can say this: the grieving process can be very confusing, and trying to find exactly what means what in your head after losing a loved one is a monumental task. Suffice it to say, I think the writing has a lot going for it. Dialogue is well written, Amber\u2019s train of thought is filled with voice and personality, and all the characters are well defined and unique. There\u2019s little to complain about writing wise, aside from some of the contrivances that I mentioned in the TL; DR with certain events being improbably lucky, but it\u2019s a small enough problem that the narrative doesn\u2019t suffer due to it.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s worth noting what Highway Blossoms both is and isn\u2019t:\n\n[b]It is[/b] a lesbian romance novel.\n[b]It is not[/b] porn.\n[b]It is[/b] a well written story that manages to say something unique about the grieving process, and how loss can affect different people.\n[b]It is not[/b] a waste of your money, or time.\n[b]It is[/b] very gay.\n\nHighway Blossoms is in no way going to be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. It\u2019s a pretty niche thing really, and I can hardly blame anyone for not wanting to play it. It\u2019s a work of love, of devotion from a small team of writers, animators, musicians, artists, and programmers. It\u2019s cute as hell, and if you\u2019re looking for something to sweeten up your life a little, there\u2019s no better place to do that than the open road.\n\n\nGive it a read, and maybe give chocolate milk a second chance.\n\n\n[i] \u201cThe L-Word?

Note: I played this kinetic novel with the official 18+ patch installed.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\nAbsolutely wonderful. Each character has so much depth and in the six hours that you're reading about them, you feel just that much closer to the yuri duo, Amber and Marina. There are quite a few other regular characters as well in the story and they all have their role and contribute a lot to the story. My favorite character would have to be Amber as some of the things she does reminds me of myself sometimes.\n\nStory: 10/10\nAt first I wasn't too sure about the story. A journey through some American history and landmarks as the girls follow the trail of a long gone prospector, but alas the author manages to spectacularly always bring the focus back to the story of Amber and Marina and the feelings that the two girls develop for one another. You even start to share their excitement as they travel state to state and the story just envelops you in a kind embrace. Just remember, it's always okay to cry.\n\nArt: 10/10\nThe artstyle was very unique, or at least I thought so. You could feel their expressions and read their faces, you start falling in love with them.

Also some of the signage in the backgrounds made me laugh a bit, but it was all cute.\n\nMusic: 9/10\nThe credits music was a great way to finish the novel and honestly the BGM during the scenes was very non-intrusive and fit the scenes very well. All I would say is that you hear some of the same BGM a lot and it just kinda gets drowned out after hearing it for so long. Still, excellent soundtrack.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nPleasant UI, everything worked without any hitches, and even the acheivements are enjoyable. You can tell a lot of thought and enjoyment went into making the acheivements. Six hours to complete the main story is excellent. Not to mention that there is a lot that keeps you engaged in the game including new content unlocked after completing the story and acheivement hunting. Sometimes though the menu buttons weren't all very responsive especially in the Extras menu. \n\nExtra Thought: If you are comfortable with nudity and some erotica, I recommend playing with the 18+ patch. It's very tasteful and in my opinion allows you to feel the girls' relationship on a deeper level. It is in no way a fanservice novel and adds a whole new level to the story. If you are not comfortable, do not worry, you are not missing any story by opting out of the 18+ patch.\n\nThis is a very wholesome yuri story that will make you feel all sorts of emotions.

Most of the games in my Steam collection are of the \"HULK SMASH!!!1!\" variety, and I really had no idea what to expect from this, but figured I'd give it a try anyways.  Well, it sure wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nIt was better.\n\nThis was my first experience with both VN's (visual novels) and yuri stories (Google what a yuri story is if you don't know).  Wow.  I really came to like the main characters, even identifying with Amber on an emotional level.  This novel-length story (it took me 11+ hours to get through the whole thing, although I am kind of a slow reader) is well-written, tugging at your heartstrings in parts (dammit, who's cutting onions around here??) or making you literally laugh out loud in others.\n\nDesert Blossoms is a story of two young women who meet by chance on the roads of the American southwest.  They go on a treasure-seeking road trip adventure together, and being opposites in many ways find that they each have a [i]lot[/i] to teach each other about life--and love, as their friendship blossoms into attraction and then full-blown love.  Amber, the one too mature for her age and carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.  And Marina, the naive happy-go-lucky immature ditz (sorry) who could nonetheless bring a smile to anyone's face with her big heart and girlish attitude.  Each navigating the roads of the southwest and of their evolving relationship.  I thought Marina's character was a bit of an anime trope (though I do know people in real life with her attitude and way of thinking), but it played well against Amber's sense of uber-responsibility and protectiveness.\n\nI've never read a romance novel in my life, nor do I have much interest in doing so.  But this story [i]really[/i] hooks into your emotions and had me captivated throughout.  I will probably re-read it in a few months when they release the Remastered version.  (Yay for free updates!)  The story is for the most part PG-13 material, although there is an \"adult patch\" out there that will add or unlock content not suitable for teh kiddiez.  I just read the regular story though and believe me, it's more than fine without the nudity and hoochee-wawa. ;) If you're on the fence about buying this, do it.

I've been trying to get into *quality* VNs for a while now and I honestly feel like this is one of the best ones I've experienced so far. I'm not much into romantic stories either, but this really pulled me in and I couldn't help but just feel happy reading through it. This is a kinetic novel, too. For those that don't understand, that means it is *the* \"book in digital form\" Visual Novel genre. There are no choices, it's a beginning-to-end linear story.\n\nBasiclaly, the premise is that you're driving across the country(The US) to go to a music festival(I assume it's \"cochella\" or whatever it's called) in California. While driving, you just happen to see a young looking woman waving down people because her car broke down. That's all I'll give you, as a lot more I could say ties into the overall story and what makes it special. The relationship between Marina and Amber was probably my favourite, specfically near the end and how it overall develops, and that's the main point of the story. While I'm not exactly a cassanova that's well-versed in the ways of romance, I felt like the way the story progresses and the way the relationship grows was done very well and came off as believable(or how I'd expect any kind of relationship between two people that care about each other and understand each other would be like). I didn't even find any moment where I stopped and thought \"Eh... That's kind of awkward\". It was a great experience, especially considering how romantics just isn't my thing at all. I can truly say that the game fully immersed me into it because of how good it was.\n\nThe music was amazing. As far as I know, everything was uniquely made for this game specifically. One sing I liked in particular was the credits song, as it really just had a perfect vibe to it with how the story finishes up. I guess a good comparison would be Life is Strange - The music in the game really builds up with nice and atmospheric experience, and it applies to this game too. I often found myself wondering \"What if I had a similar experience to this game? What if one day I went out on a roadtrip and just had a crazy experience myself?\". Y'know, the usual \"I am fully immersed\" scenario.\n\nGraphics I always feel like depend with visual novels. It's in the name - \"Visual\" - so it clearly matters, but at the same time I can't emphasize enough about how much the story is the home-run for this. The visuals were varely well done, especially the intro segment, as it's a moving intro scene. The characters were exceptionally drawn, and I use the word exceptionally specifically because it goes way above my usual standards. The backgrounds were also nice to look at (e.g. the campfire scene, or the race scene). I dunno, not much to say. The visuals are amazing.\n\nAlso, adult patch. I really gotta address this. Completely unneccessary to use it unless you consider the scenes important enough to keep in but the story was so good I actually felt guilty using the patch. I didn't even really feel like I needed the context from the adult patch scenes because I had already gotten the gist of why they were important in other more hard-hitting segments.\n\nI guess if I were to suggest anyone to buy this, I'd say that you should expect a simple story between two people and their growing relationship between each other. Making a story that revolves around that premise isn't easy, either. Everybody has their own ideal concept of a \"relationship\" but I think this game really hit the nail on the head considering what it was working with and in the end I had a nice happy vibe about the game.\n\n7.5 hours played, Pretty descent for $11, but I believe I got it for a lot cheaper.", "timestamp_created": 1505977825, "timestamp_updated": 1505977825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35095322": {"recommendationid": "35095322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041595633", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506233325}, "language": "english", "review": "Hmm, what to say about this title that hasn't already been said? What words could even do justice to how I feel?\n\nLet's make one thing clear: reading Highway Blossoms was an unforgettable experience.\n\nI can't recall any recent media work I've consumed that has made me as obsessed with it as HB has. My thoughts are overtaken by this story. Replaying scenes in my mind and sighing wistfully at how well done they were. Imagining myself hanging out with Marina and Amber, because they are legitimately loveable characters that I would absolutely want to hang out with in real life (Amber reminds me so much of me, it's amazing). Being inspired enough to cement my plans to get an RV and roam around the highways endlessly.\n\nThis was a powerful story, I'm telling you.\n\nI guess I can give this a proper review treatment, too, if my babbling about how deeply this VN touched me didn't convince you to buy it. Seriously, please buy it. When they release the fully-voiced version you'll get it for free, whereas if you wait until after the voiced version releases, it'll be more expensive. I mean, it'd be worth it either way, but it's up to you. But you really should buy this.\n\nVisuals: 8/10\nNot really anything to complain about here. Any limitations in how the visuals are done is likely an artifact of how the engine itself works (they use Ren'Py, I believe). The portraits are cute and well done; the characters have enough different expressions and poses that it doesn't feel like they're just copypasted talking heads. The backgrounds are gorgeous, if simple in detail. The text boxes are done nicely, and you can adjust the opacity and stuff if you want to make it more readable for you.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe music in this is excellent. I definitely sprang for the soundtrack so I could listen to it anytime. It always suits the mood really well, besides being great music on its own (Far Between is becoming one of my favourite songs ever). I'm actually listening to the soundtrack as I type this. Once the fully-voiced version releases I'll probably update this to 10/10 (the voices in the trailer are so close to what I imagined for the characters anyway).\n\nStory/writing: 10/10\nThe writing in Highway Blossoms is so, so good. The story is wonderful itself, but what really shines is how well-developed the main characters become throughout the story. Both Amber and Marina are so likeable and so relatable; I found I was really able to get into both of their heads, so while I didn't always agree with them, I could understand why they did and said the things they did. And frankly, I'd much rather disagree with my otherwise-relatable protagonist and yell at her NO AMBER WHY DID YOU DO THAT HOW COULD YOU OMG than to not understand her decision at all. Even the trio, Mariah included (annoying though she may be), are really loveable characters. The pacing is great, the dramatic tension is built up and released very satisfyingly, and yeah, I definitely cried a couple times. Also, once you finish your first run through, I encourage you to immediately turn on the goofball mode and play it again; the extra dialogue (and extra visuals, I was surprised to note) are absolutely hilarious.\n\nTo summarize: BUY HIGHWAY BLOSSOMS.

They meet by chance, become friends, and, eventually, fall in love with each other. \n\nFor the most part, it's a beautiful and relaxed feel-good story filled with fun and likable characters, some adventure, treasure hunting, and lots of real-life landmarks, be it natural wonders or man-made roadside attractions. (It is well worth the effort to keep a browser handy and look up all the locations they travel to for a bit of culture and education on the side.) \n\nThere are some hiccups during the second half of the game when Amber's (our point of view character) internalized angst causes some drama that feels rather forced and unnecessary, but aside from that, the story avoids most of the common pitfalls of the romance genre that I've come to loath ([spoiler]like, say, love triangles[/spoiler]). So kudos for that, and what drama is found in the story never really gets out of hand too much, so I can't really fault it for that either.\n\nProduction values, generally speaking, are pretty good for a visual novel. Given that this type of game, for the most part, consists of static sprites standing in front of static backdrops with some nondescript music playing in the background, [i]Highway Blossoms[/i] comes as quite the surprise. There is lots of movement in their sprites, quite a few unusual camera angles, some 3D models of the RV, lots of ambient sounds, and so on. The artwork is pretty good, too, and very accurate compared to the real life locations. (As far as I could tell with the help of my friendly neighborhood search engine, anyway.)\n\nThe cast will not be much of a surprise to anybody who is familiar with anime tropes or American stereotypes, but it is used well and even the side characters are portrayed in a very likable and often funny manner. Tess and Mariah, especially, have found a place in my heart and I can't help but hope for a spin-off based on their next adventure.\n\nI haven't played the \"New Game +\" mode (called \"Goofball Mode\") yet, but I'm very much looking forward to seeing a sillier spin on the story just as I'm looking forward to the free remastered version that is supposed to be rolling out soon-ish. \n\nWhat I'd really like to see though, is a sequel. The ending was very appropriate for a story about a road trip, but the characters clearly have some more tales to tell, some more road trips to go on, and maybe even some more treasure to find.\n\nAll in all, and despite some minor hiccups, I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes a nice feel-good story, road trip, or romance and isn't put off by the lack of player interaction. (It is a visual novel in the true sense of the word, foregoing even the pretense of player choice or interaction in favor of just telling its story.)", "timestamp_created": 1505708097,

as I do enjoy some element of choice when playing games. But for some reason this one spoke to me. Maybe it was the art style, or the music, or perhaps the fact that it didn't feel the need to shove fanservice in my face in an attempt to get me to buy it. So, I parted with some money to check this story out.\n\nAnd what a story it is.\n\nThe pacing of this story is perfect, and written so well. The characters are easy to fall in love with; Amber's wit and partial cyncism, Marina's optimism and at-times air-headedness. Even the near emotionless Tess is enjoyable in her own special way. As for the plot itself? It really knows how to absorb you into the tale. I had to know what happened next in the story, so by the time I finished it (in one sitting), it was well past 2 in the morning.\n\nThe character art is exceptionally good, and I do enjoy how the characters actually move around the screen when they're being described as moving. The background art is stunning as well, and I love that, with one or two exceptions, each location in the game has it's own specific background. The music is also a big part of the game and I did enjoy just taking a break from the story now and then to enjoy it. If I wasn't trying to save money at the monent, I'd definitely buy the soundtrack as well.\n\nOverall:\nWhile this might not look as flashy or interesting as some other VNs on steam, I promise you'll enjoy hopping onto this emtional and well told ride of a story.

I bought it on a sale since I was bored and looking for cute stories to read through someday. It languished in my library for months before I booted it up a few days ago.\n\n16 hours later, I've had such an enchanting time. The game's wonderful soundtrack, thoughtfully developed characters, and themes of sincere friendship and recovery really stuck to me. Kinda expected a \"yuri VN\" and what I got wasn't that yuri or that VN? As far as it relates to the Japanese ones I'm used to anyway. It's an American story made by American developers about two American girls set in an Americana-heavy roadtrip adventure.\n\nAlso, speaking as a queer girl, this definitely felt like a story about queer girls written for other queer girls? Even the sex scenes (assuming you download the expanded content patch, which I greatly recommend) are less about titillation and more about developing their character dynamic and reifying the themes everpresent in the story. They don't feel pornographic at all.\n\n10/10\n\nCame for the cute lesbians, stayed for the heartfelt story of love and loss and love again.

It's two young girls on a quest for gold, and something more. And in this is Highway Blossoms' greatest strength: its simple, honest humanity. \n\nWhat is it like to love someone? What is it like to lose someone? This Visual Novel doesn't pretend to have the answers. But what it does offer is a window, a beautifully real glimpse into a relationship in an oddball setting. Is the writing perfect? No. Are the backgrounds and music memorable? Not quite. Perhaps as entertainment, it might be found wanting. As an experience, it certainly isn't. I mean that in the least pretentious way possible. It couldn't change my mind about the desert or country music, but it almost made me cry in front of my roommate.

I was absolutely blown away. I had to take crack to get my mind off of it. The characters, pacing, art and music are all excellent. At first I found some characters to be annoying, but by the end I loved them. At first the music only seemed capable, but then I often found myself ignoring the scenes entirely and just taking in the music. In one instance, the song looped so many times it stopped playing before I had finished the scene. I plan on buying the soundtrack, if only to support these wonderful, wonderful developers.\n\nI want to leave a note about the adult patch, as I did play with it installed. It was one of my favorite parts of Highway Blossoms, but not because it's smut. It doesn't add a lot of content, but what is there is so well-writen and soft-spoken that it felt like it deserved to be there as a part of their story rather than as a bonus to get you off. It, like the rest of this visual novel, is a very human depiction of love and passion with actual nuance, so much so that I was awkwardly crying during one of the sex scenes. It's my favorite adult patch in anything to date. Anyway.\n\nYou don't have to play with the patch, it's great.

It's up there with best of all of them, actually, now that I think about it. The story is really engaging and interesting even from early on, before it starts to really focus on romance blossoming. When the tone starts to shift, it feels right. Some of the story is a little predictable, but the characters were so likable that I adored every minute of it anyway. Honestly, I kind of liked that facets of the story were predictable, and while there was some tension at times, it seldom if ever felt oppressive. \n\nIt's worth noting that a really big theme of this story is moving on after losing a loved one. It's a subject treated with tremendous care and respect, and I think that anyone who can relate to that might appreciate a heads up before going in. It is pretty emotionally intense. I definitely didn't expect for things to get to me as much as they did, but I very nearly cried a few times at things, and the story definitely provoked a lot of emotions from me ^^\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty alright, but I wished there were some more songs. Fortunately, there is a 'remastered' version of this coming soon if I'm not mistaken that fixes that. If you buy it now, while it's cheap, you'll get the remaster patch free, wink wink. \n\nH-scenes are nice and all, but I think this is one where it wouldn't be bad to skip the 18+ patch. Don't get me wrong - the intimacy in this story is handled quite well. It didn't feel overly fanservicey or anything, and it actually played a pretty important part in the story, so I don't think you're WRONG to get the patch, but I think that this story would still read and play wonderfully with fade-to-blacks instead. \n\nAll and all, this game really tugged at the heartstrings.

Less than a year after his death, Amber is on her way to an annual music festival when she picks up a young lady, the sweet, naive Marina, who is on the search for gold that a miner supposedly hid across the Southwestern part of the US. With another group also hot on the trail, this unlikely duo will find more than gold on their travels.\n\nPros: Simply put, this is a seriously heartfelt game. The story is well done and pulls you in every step of the way. The characters, especially our main pair, are likeable amd sympathetic, even the cantankerous and foul mouthed Mariah (arguably). The gradual building of Amber and Marina's relationship over the course of the story is also fairly believable, going from mere acquiantences to partners, then to friends, and eventually to full blown lovers (yep, in case you didn't guess, this is a yuri game~). Speaking of yuri, is sex scenes, available on steam through a patch, are fairly tasteful and work in the context of the story. And while the treasure hunt is a secondary part of the story, it's still interesting and fun to read along with. As a minor mention, the music in this is very good, though it may get repetitive since there's not a LOT of it.\n\nCons: In case you don't know, this game is a visual NOVEL. This simply means that you have no input with where the story goes and what happens, not even moving around or choosing to check certain areas. So as a warning, if you prefer traditional games that give you that sense of control, this game is VERY much not for you. Also, if lesbians do not interest you, it would also be a good idea to avoid this.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I really can't recommend this enough. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this is if you're not interested in visual novels, especially ones that don't give you any control over what occurs. Otherwise, enjoy the story and especially the characters. Also, if you're considering buying it, just know that within the year of 2017, the developers plan to raise the price as they remaster ther game with voice acting.

This game treats things in a charming and mature way, it lets you connect with the characters and actually care for them in some way or another. The supporting cast is well written, funny when funny is needed and mature or serious when needed.\n\nOverall I think this game is amazing for its low price even though it is a 5-10 hour long static visual novel. I would recommend this to anyone who is either looking for a good story and/or dealing with some sort of personal issues.

Once the journey is over, the characters are free to further their new relationship. There was one overly dramatic arc that I didn\u2019t care for, in fact an extra character pointed out that her self drama was stupid (I call these situations a Japaneses cheap dramatic cliche and a waste of readers time).

This review has spoilers.\n\nI didn\u2019t really play many VN in my life but this one didn\u2019t please me much. My advice is to buy only when is on sale and if you really want to play a yuri (girl likes girl) VN that the main characters aren\u2019t sisters or that they don\u2019t die at the end.\n\nFirst, the event that triggers the story is not convincing. The first hour watching is very boring and gave me the feeling that the story was going to be as plain as the presented premise of the adventure. The main character is a prickly pear that drives a RV (urgh) and the other one is a bubbly sweet, tending to stupidness, girl.\n\nThe supporting characters are also plain and very annoying. One of them is overssexualized, dressed in a stupid way: I mean, who is going to use bikini under overalls and let the front part open revealing your body in the desert while driving a RV? I would force myself to buy that style if it was a more beach setting but\u2026 no. Pure fan service and nonsense.\n\nThe only thing that made me play through the end was the fact that me and my girlfriend made a similar road trip towards that area (but we left from LA) and I felt nostalgic thinking about the places we\u2019ve been. The setting was well written. Ah and of course the story is about a lesbian. The only part of the story that pleased me was after the first kiss until Las Vegas. The main character freaking out because she can\u2019t discern her relationship with her grandpa and the one with her girlfriend was super weird and not convincing. I also have to say that the sex scenes were convincing and, writing wise, didn\u2019t bother me. I was really expecting the worse.\n\nVisually, this VN comes short of the expected. I missed more different reactions and poses, especially for some moments. It would be great if they put more scenes like when they were at the firecamp. I got bothered many times due to the lack of emotion in the drawings. Sometimes I just focused on the text because the imagery wasn\u2019t following the story. The sexualized women characters (Mariah especially) and the sex scene with childish women bodies\u2026 wrong.\n\nThis is what happens when a guy writes a story about lesbian women.\n\nobs.: I have 10 hours because I left my computer on while doing other stuff... :rolleyes:", "timestamp_created": 1499999225, "timestamp_updated": 1499999260, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33524448": {"recommendationid": "33524448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001747146", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499988277}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're interested in anything but the patch, don't play it.

It reads like a teenager's idea of an amazing and 'deep' romantic adventure, or someone's early attempts at yuri. It's cute, and a good first try, but I really regret putting three hours into it. The art doesn't do anything for me and the music, while OK, was clearly 'inspired' by some well-known songs which I found really annoying.

Personally, I just don't see it. The plot is every blend of cliche and campy that you could find in the road trip and romance genres smashed together with Yuri. Lots of lines made me cringe with how well it slotted perfectly into so many terrible road trip and romance movies I've seen before. Because of this the story is predictable to a capital T with me guessing all the beats it was going to take miles before it happened.\n\nThe characters exemplify this to an extreme degree. You have the \"strong\", silent protagonist who's made to face their feelings and open up by the bubbly and cheerful road trip partner. The lead has some tragedy that emotionally damages her and the bond between the pair reaches it's peak, faces the conflict and ultimately resolves with strong-silent finding out bubbly-cheerful was what they needed all along, helped by a loudmouthed gruff no-nonsense anti-hero who shows their vulnerable side to smack strong-silent with some sense.\n\nThe music is ok. I couldn't make the music out from your run-of-the-mill royalty free BG music you'd find on a website and was surprised to find out it's all original.\n\nThe art is beautiful though. Every scene is very detailed and in high resolution and the character models are incredibly well illustrated.\n\nI applied the nudie patch for my playthrough because I didn't want to miss out on anything *wink wink*. In all seriousness, sex in anything other than porn doesn't really do it for me and I just didn't want to miss out on any dialog that might have happened during the 2 scenes the game has. Honestly, you're not missing much if you don't apply the patch except for well illustrated girls lying on top of each other and doing the Bow-chucka-brown-cow on each other in a couple of poses.

Sure it's no Walking Dead or Game of Thrones in terms of epicness in its story, it's more of a Sasameki Koto or Girlfriends, and if you are familiar with those two names in Yuri then you'll love Highway Blossoms. \n\nTook me about 8 hours to read through since I take everything in slowly and process it all differently, but you might be different. If you're going in expecting an ecchi romp or a visual novel with loads of fan service and accidental nudity, you might be disapointed (key word here: might). There are two sex scenes and they are certainly not the main draw of this visual novel and that's about the only \"ero stuff\" that is here, so if you're paying full price for this game just for that then you will probably be disappointed. Having said that, it was well written and does not try to be hentai, if you've read through Girlfriends (a Manga I highly reccomend) then you'll know what to expect here. So yeah it's not supposed to be an erotic adventure, it's not \"Leisure Suit Liara\" (which wouldn't be a bad idea for a game actually), it's just a great story about two girls falling in love and then after all they go through, have sex twice towards the ending stretch of the game.\n\nAnd on that bombshell... all I can say is if you like visual novels and the Yuri genre then you'll absolutely love this!", "timestamp_created": 1499307050, "timestamp_updated": 1499307050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33266607": {"recommendationid": "33266607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276526983", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 118, "last_played": 1514122554}, "language": "english", "review": "Doing this for the Pillar of Community, kappa", "timestamp_created": 1499245284, "timestamp_updated": 1499245284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33227089": {"recommendationid": "33227089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084726491", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497651270}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has its unique touch, mixing emotions that can go threw your heart and also 18+ patch that actually wasnt my first focus because of how much i enjoyed the story.

It probably is because the end didn't satisfy me, or the fact that some events were going too fast (especially on the romance part), who knows. I was enjoying it, a lot, but the end felt a bit off. Then again, endings often aren't as satisfying as we want them to be.\nThat's why I'd still recommend it. It's a nice reading. It could also be relatable for people who once felt grief, or actually are grieving even today.

Das trifft auch diesen wundrvollen Girls Love-Visual Novel zu. Kurz zur Story: \nAmber ist eine junge Frau, die die meiste Zeit ihres Lebens mit ihrem Gro\u00dfvater in einem Wohnmobil auf den Stra\u00dfen Amerikas verbracht  hat. Als dieser dann stirbt, bringt dies ihr ganzes Leben durcheinander und hinterl\u00e4sst sie ziemlich antriebslos. Auf dem Weg zum Coachella, einem gro\u00dfen Musikfestival, mit dem Ziel, seinen letzten Wunsch zu erf\u00fcllen, trifft sie auf Marina, die eine Autopanne erlitten hat. Nach einigem Z\u00f6gern l\u00e4sst sich Amber \u00fcberreden, ihr zu helfen, und bietet ihr an, sie zur n\u00e4chstgelegenen Rastst\u00e4tte zu fahren. Dort \u00fcberschlagen sich die Ereignisse: Marina hat ihr Portemonnaie vergessen, Amber erf\u00e4hrt von Marinas eigentlichem Reisegrund, n\u00e4mlich einer Schatzsuche, und die beiden treffen auf Mariah, ihre sp\u00e4tere Konkurrentin. Da Marina pl\u00f6tzlich ohne Handy, Auto und Geld dasteht, sieht Amber gar keine andere M\u00f6glichkeit, als sie zur\u00fcck nach Hause zu fahren. Doch anstatt den Heimweg anzutreffen, \u00fcberredet Marina ihre neue Reisegef\u00e4hrtin dazu, sie an den ersten Ort der Schatzsuche zu bringen. Amber l\u00e4sst sich \u00fcberreden und als die beiden tats\u00e4chlich den ersten Teil des versteckten Goldes finden, ist auch Amber auf den Geschmack gekommen. Auf der Suche nach den anderen beiden Teilen des Schatzes, f\u00fchrt es die beiden jungen Frauen quer durch Mexiko und Amerika, in Nationalparks und sogar nach Las Vegas. Neben vielen, teils interessanten, teils seltsamen, Leuten, st\u00f6\u00dft Amber allm\u00e4hlich auch auf ihre Gef\u00fchle f\u00fcr ihre Begleiterin. Doch das Leben ist ja bekanntlich nie einfach und so bringt auch die Konfrontation mit ebenjenen Gef\u00fchlen Konsequenzen mit sich. Gelingt es Amber, sich ihrer wirklichen Gef\u00fchle bewusst zu werden?\n\nHinzu m\u00f6chte ich erw\u00e4hnen, dass ich eigentlich kein gro\u00dfer Fan von dem Genre Visual Novel bin. Normalerweise finde ich sie meistens viel zu teuer vor dem Hintergrund, dass man sie nur liest und die Animationen bzw. Standbilder teils nur rar ges\u00e4t sind. Dahingehend ist Highway Blossoms nicht viel anders. Man kann keine Entscheidungen treffen, man liest stundenlang nur Text und die Animationen h\u00e4tten manchmal mehr sein k\u00f6nnen. Jedoch  brilliert das Game mit einer so am\u00fcsanten und au\u00dferordentlich spannenden Story und mit einer handvoll wirklich interessanter und liebevoll ausgearbeiteter Charaktere und hat mich zehn Stunden lang k\u00f6stlich unterhalten. Die Zeit verflog rasend schnell und ich konnte kaum aufh\u00f6ren. Die ganze Geschichte war einfach so liebevoll und die Beziehung der beiden M\u00e4dchen so authentisch und gar nicht \u00fcberladen mit Klischees, dass ich vollauf begeistert war von all den Details. Selbst die unzensierten Adult-Szenen wirkten nie too much und waren gut ausgeschrieben. \nTats\u00e4chlich w\u00fcrde ich sogar sagen, dass dieser VN das Geld wert ist - warten, bis man es in einem Bundle oder im Sale abgreifen kann, lohnt sich aber nat\u00fcrlich genauso!\n", "timestamp_created": 1498294144, "timestamp_updated": 1498294144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521531", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32707472": {"recommendationid": "32707472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001154506", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498272353}, "language": "english", "review": "Fair warning, this is more a novel than game, and actually deserving of the genre \"Visual Novel\".

Nonetheless it was quite a decent ride, and pretty much delivers what it promises.\n\nFirst of all, top notch music and art for a VN. The backgrounds are well drawn, and captures the essence of the American deserts. It's refreshing to see different art styles though it may trigger some OCD people, but hey so far so good. The excellent usage of camera is appreciated, helps with the immersion and the emotions expressed by the characters. The soundtrack hits home completely, it symbolizes what a road trip is like on American deserts, and also ties into how the characters' emotions play out. Fucking amazing.\n\nAs for gameplay, since this is a kinetic VN, you pretty much just only need to let your eyes do the work. There are no choices for you to make, no consequences etc. This greatly benefitted the game, as the whole VN plays out just like a movie, which is just like any road trip if you'd ask me. After you finish the game, prepare yourself for another ride in Goofball Mode, albeit a shorter playthough, though bit more fun. \n\nThe characters are nicely fleshed out, Amber's wittiness with Marina's general childish curiosity creates a nice contrast, making both heroines very memorable in their own way. Though the writers may have pushed the tomboyness of Amber a bit too much to my liking. The supporting cast of characters are interesting in their own right. The treasure hunting trio made up of the hothead Mariah, the levelheaded Joe and the silent yet ever observative Tess. Their gearhead antics differs them a lot from other supporting characters in VNs, which makes me hope a sequel of sorts will be focused on them instead. They are appropriately used without being presented as overly annoying rivals, and gives Amber some valuable advice. There is one character named Cassi that only had 1 scene, which baffled me as to whether she was part of some cut content or an oversight on the devs' part.\n\n[h1] Potential spoilers for plot [/h1]\nThe story just screams \"America\" to me, and it's definitely a welcomed theme, as most VNs tend to be set in Japan, and its really nice that this game took the different approach. The plot is divided into 3 parts, the treasure hunt, the road trip and AmberxMarina. There is also a ton of foreshadowing in the story, yet it doesn't affect the main plot at all.\n\nThe treasure hunt probably had a bit more scenes that are hard to get excited, like Canyon de Chelly, though once you get past that, you'll be treated to a fun adventure. The miner's journal is optional, though you may find it an amusing short read. A nice thing to have. \n\nThe road trip is like getting a taste of the different locations our heroines visit. One can kind of learn a bit of the history of the locations, and maybe a few things to pay attention to when on a road trip in these locations. I'm tempted to visit these places one day.\n\nOnto the main course, the AmberxMarina relationship. Come on, who doesn't like Yuri? Jokes aside, this part has been given the most development, with the seeds planted already in the treasure hunt plot, allowing the relationship to develop at a believable pace. They both make up for what each other lacks, it may seem mismatched to some, but at least its not some tsundere crap we're getting from Animu these days. Familial bonds is a strong factor to both girls' motivations, allowing them to exchange interesting casual conversations that help define their character and uniqueness. The joy and struggles both girls face is so genuine that its heart-warming and heart-wrenching respectively.\n\nThe treasure hunt plot does feel a bit too lucky, however, given that its not the main focus, I guess a happy ending for a treasure hunt is acceptable. Despite this, if I were to be very nitpicky, the plot doesn't really feel all that special compared to other aspects of the game, which somewhat helped grounded the game in realism, as it does sort of depict the struggles in any ordinary relationship.\n\nNow onto the side stuff, achievements are fairly easy to get in this game, bit of a fun nod from the devs on the lenny achievement. The adult patch is optional, I played with it, and found it not too distracting from the main story. Just short and steamy. Love it. It would be nice, if the soundtrack can be accessed in-game, but hey, its amazing regardless. Occasional typos here and there, but no game is perfect, and it didn't really hinder my experience at all. It also seems I may have gotten lucky, or perhaps its due to me completing the game in one sitting, no technical issues for me. As to the lack of voice acting, I don't really mind, in fact I rather it not ever appearing in this game. Letting the soundtrack do its thing, and having the characters convey their emotions through it is far more immersive and relaxing.\n\nBit of a lengthy review, but I felt like I had to write what's on my mind and here we are.

More serious story spoilers are actually spoilered.\n\n------------------------\n\nStill here? Okay.\n\nI think it's important to understand right up front that this is not a game or a dating simulator in even the slightest way. This is a comic book, a manga perhaps? The most interaction you have with the story is turning the page and selecting or de-selecting the silly modes. You are never a player who can take actions and make choices; you are a reader.\n\nBut for those who do like good literature, well... the protagonist is a blatant a male-viewer-insert--she's pretty much just a re-brand of a similar male archetype, down to the masculine speech/internal monologuing patterns, and she and the other focused female characters (thankfully not the child) are obviously drawn as eye candy. The latter is particularly pervasive to invasive, as boobs are shoved in your face for almost the entire story, and it somewhat taints the work.\n\nBorrowing heavily from extremely cliche anime archetypes and stereotypes really doesn't do the characters any favours either. Neither does the part where [spoiler]the developers poke fun at themselves, and to some degree the expected audience, by having a street artist paint the boobs as being even bigger[/spoiler], to be honest.\n\nAnd there's a distinct lack of tension whenever the story turns back to the \"gold rush\" plot line because [spoiler]the protagonist wins almost every time, usually without a lot of effort. The only time she doesn't, it's not because of the only clear antagonist, whom she beats every time--it's just bad luck. The happy ending is [i]nice[/i], [/spoiler]and the way character development and action are tied together at the climax is well-enough done, but the \"gold rush\" plot line is simply not satisfying--[spoiler]it's quite heavily sold, but then becomes unimportant, and the protagonist's victory there grows to feel inevitable pretty early.[/spoiler]\n\nI have mixed feelings because there are some positives. The humour seems to be where it's needed, in particular, the action is pretty good, I did mention the climax is pretty good, and the scene with [spoiler]just the protagonist and Mariah in the luxury RV[/spoiler] is oddly gratifying.\n\nI'm still waiting for Steam to implement some kind of middle rating between \"recommend\" and \"do not.\" In the meantime, I would say not to buy this at full price. It's better than the trash novels one of my grandmothers hoarded, and I was entertained somewhat, but neither are worth the $10 you could order or download a [i]good[/i] book for.\n\n-------\n\nI don't recommend the adult content patch at all, incidentally; the skin and chests already being placed right above the words at all times was distracting enough when they weren't sometimes uncovered. The developers themselves say the patch adds nothing to the plot, and in my experience it distracts, thus detracts, from everything meaningful that surrounds the adult content and what the adult content causes. And I have trouble putting a finger on why, but the writing of them irritated me. Perhaps it's just an inconsistency between the style of them and the style of the rest of the story; I'm not re-reading to find out.\n\nAlso, some of the added or changed images look like your average internet \"nude edits\", i.e. someone painted over a clothed character and made them look a little proportionally [i]weird[/i] in the process--or did they just forget important facts, such as that boobs don't normally scrunch together without something holding them that way? The style and ability expressed in the ones that don't look like nude edits don't really stand out from what you can find anywhere on the internet for free, and I think this is in part due to the choice of a pretty generic character style for the whole story to begin with.\n\nI guess if you need that kind of fun, but you also require some degree of story or emotional investment, and you don't mind that the protagonist is basically a male character with a female sprite tacked on... I'm not sure why you would pay $10 for the experience, though.\n\nPlease understand that I am not saying all of this to be a prude; there is nothing wrong with sex (sometimes graphic, if necessary) in a story.

Se poi vedo che le suddette kinetic novel hanno qui su Steam i tag \"Nudit\u00e0\" e/o \"Sexual Content\", le probabilit\u00e0 che le eviti aumentano notevolmente - sar\u00f2 prevenuto, ma nelle visual novel notoriamente \"sesso e tette\" mal si sposano con il concetto di \"buona storia da leggere\", dato che generalmente la storia diventa solo un pretesto per inserire il suddetto \"sesso e tette\" qua e l\u00e0.\n\nFortunatamente, per\u00f2, ci sono delle eccezioni: a volte sono determinate da \"meriti artistici\", come Nekopara, mentre a volte per meriti narrativi, come questo gioco, Highway Blossoms - gioco che mi ha stupito e entusiasmato come non mi capitava da un bel pezzo a questa parte con una visual novel.\nLa storia di base \u00e8 quasi \"banale\": una ragazza, Amber, alla guida del suo camper in mezzo al deserto, d\u00e0 un passaggio ad una ragazza che \u00e8 rimasta ferma con la propria auto, Marina. Come Amber presto scoprir\u00e0, Marina si \u00e8 messa, come tante altre persone, alla ricerca di un tesoro, diviso in pi\u00f9 parti, sepolto in alcuni luoghi dei quali si conoscono soltanto alcuni vaghi indizi. Nonostante la riluttanza iniziale, e le differenze caratteriali (Amber \u00e8 una ragazza di mondo, dal carattere deciso e con una vasta conoscenza pratica delle cose, mentre Marina ha la testa tra le nuvole, un carattere pi\u00f9 dolce ed una vasta ignoranza del mondo), le due partono insieme alla ricerca di questa fantomatica fortuna nascosta chiss\u00e0 dove...\nAl di l\u00e0 della storia in s\u00e8, che pu\u00f2 piacere o non piacere, o dello stile artistico, che personalmente trovo molto piacevole, la cosa secondo me bella, ma veramente bella, di questa visual novel \u00e8 la narrazione - detto in poche parole, \u00e8 scritta benissimo. Ha uno stile narrativo semplice, quasi essenziale, eppure tocca sempre i tasti giusti, riesce a rendere emozionante la storia e a farti vivere le sensazioni e le emozioni dei personaggi come se le stessi provando sulla tua stessa pelle. E i vari protagonisti, in particolar modo ovviamente Amber e Marina, sono caratterizzati divinamente - non ci vuole infatti molto per trovarsi a \"pensare come loro\", e i dialoghi che li coinvolgono sono veramente un piacere da leggere. Pure le scene di sesso sono pochissime e funzionali alla storia, cosa che mi ha piacevolmente sorpreso e ha sfatato quel brutto \"mito\" di cui vi parlavo nell'introduzione a questa recensione.\nUn applauso (virtuale) quindi agli AlienWorks, gli sviluppatori di questo gioco, e un deciso pollice in su di votazione - una valutazione ampiamente meritata.\n\nP.S.: immaginando che il 70% dell'utenza media che sfoglia questa pagina lo faccia perch\u00e9 ha visto il tag \"Nudit\u00e0\", o quello \"Sexual Content\" X-D, vi dico subito che (1) questo gioco \u00e8 \"yuri\", ovvero donna x donna (fate voi quindi le dovute considerazioni su cosa ci\u00f2 significhi) e (2) la versione su Steam \u00e8 quella \"All Age\" - ergo, nessun contenuto per adulti. Se volete aggiungere tale contenuto, vi baster\u00e0 andare sul sito ufficiale e scaricare GRATUITAMENTE una sorta di patch - non andate quindi a cercarla chiss\u00e0 dove, c'\u00e8 direttamente sul sito ufficiale. Tra parentesi tale patch \u00e8 NECESSARIA se volete avere il 100% degli achievement.\n\nP.P.S.: questo gioco ha, cosa quasi unica per una kinetic, una sorta di New Game+ - una volta finito il gioco, infatti, \u00e8 possibile attivare una modalit\u00e0 che cambia alcune piccole parti della storia e aggiunge degli \"effetti\"... rimango volutamente sul vago, ma vi dico subito che dev'essere il risultato di una sbornia particolarmente potente da parte degli autori.

Don't forget your tissue and lotion... or if you're female, penetration toy. (As for any \"other\" genders, cleary this isn't for you as there are no trans people in the story, nor should there be. Triggered? Good. Moving on...)\n\nI really enjoyed the story. It felt more American made than Asian made, which is a nice change. The writing lost me a few times, like when it was getting technical of landmark locations in the dessert states, but wanted to find a good spot to stop and come back later instead of in the middle.\n\nThe characters are very well fleshed out, didn't spot any flaws or issues with them. Character development felt spotty but it's there, don't worry, they do change gradually. The minor/supporting characters fit their role just fine and didn't feel over or under used. The major characters, however, were bit of a grind to get through; namely Amber and Marina. The development of these two could've been a bit faster in some parts, but was glad to see the pacing pick up later on.\n\nThe plot has two things going on: treasure and romance. The switch between the two is smooth and at appropriate times. When the treasure story was finished, it went full romance from there (which made it a bit boring for me but wasn't... I guess \"Twilight\" level of romance). It's nice to read a story that isn't based on mythology or magical powers or \"I have big boobs, look at me as they bounce!\" like most asian VN's do these days, but instead down to earth and based on realistic settings that anyone can relate to better.\n\nThe game offers no choice for the player as it is a one linear path from start to finish. There is also no voice acting.\n\nMy only problems to me was that some of the sliders in the settings (volumes, text speed) were gone but yet there. It's not really an inconvenience for me. Another was that just after I finished installing, my AV labled it as a trojan (which freaked me out instantly) but turns out some update they did awhile go is triggering a flase flag and would require to white list the .exe file.\n\nIt's really touching, gives you a few laughs here and there with the writing and visuals it gives to help lighten the mood. There will be times you want to go \"Just kiss already!\" but don't worry it'll get there at it's own pace\n\n-----\n\nCheck out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BPUGL]BluePaw's Underrated Games List[/url]\nJoin and/or follow if you wish.", "timestamp_created": 1497296599, "timestamp_updated": 1511392172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477435", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32365854": {"recommendationid": "32365854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086774158", "num_games_owned": 1385, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497273514}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6211\u5f88\u5c11\u8a8d\u771f\u7684\u5f9e\u982d\u5230\u5c3e\u8dd1\u5b8c\u4e00\u6b3eAVG\n\u5f9ehumble bundle\u64bf\u5230\u9019\u6b3e\u4e4b\u5f8c\n\u672c\u4f86\u4e5f\u6253\u7b97\u901f\u5237\u500b\u6210\u5c31\u5c31\u597d\n\u4f46\u662f\u88ab\u7247\u982d\u7684\u6c1b\u570d\u5438\u5f15\u4f4f\uff0c\u5fcd\u4e0d\u4f4f\u8dd1\u5b8c\u4e86\u6574\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\n\u7136\u5f8c\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u70ba\u96fb\u5b50\u5c0f\u8aaa\u904a\u6232\u7559\u4e0b\u597d\u8a55\n\nHighway Blossoms\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u7f8e\u5f0f\u516c\u8def\u5c0f\u8aaa\u548c\u65e5\u7cfbAVG\u7684\u7279\u8272\n\u6587\u5b57\u5e73\u5be6\u4e14\u5145\u6eff\u5e7d\u9ed8\u611f\uff0c\u8b80\u8d77\u4f86\u5f88\u8f15\u9b06\n\u6c92\u6709\u523b\u610f\u8ce3\u5f04\u60b2\u5287\u535a\u53d6\u6dda\u6c34\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u8f15\u9b06\u4e2d\u4e5f\u85cf\u8457\u7368\u7279\u7684\u97fb\u5473\n\u6709\u9ede\u5bc2\u5bde\u548c\u9109\u6101\uff0c\u6709\u9ede\u5b09\u76ae\u5f0f\u7684\u5b64\u7368\uff0c\u6709\u9ede\u9ed1\u5496\u5561\u7684\u9999\u8207\u82e6\n\n\u6c92\u6709\u5927\u958b\u5927\u95d4\u7684\u5c55\u958b\uff0c\u5e7e\u4e4e\u53ef\u4ee5\u9810\u6e2c\u5230\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u767c\u5c55\n\u4f46\u662f\u90a3\u7a2e\u7368\u7279\u7684\u97fb\u5473\u6703\u523a\u6fc0\u8457\u4f60\u8b80\u4e0b\u53bb\n\n\nP.S. \u6709\u6f22\u5316\u7d44\u6b63\u5728\u505a\u9019\u90e8\u7684\u6f22\u5316", "timestamp_created": 1497276751, "timestamp_updated": 1497276751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32357783": {"recommendationid": "32357783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118153024", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497173422}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you desire to feel the wind in your hair, to experience the freedom of the open road?

Lots of CGs where other games would use sprites. Sprites are nice, too. I fell in love with the paintings of the West.\nProgramming: 4/5 -- In like, the third-ish chapter there were some issues where the text box would hide while sprites switched expressions.

The characters are relatable and realistic, the scenario isn't overtly ridiculous, also it's at least a bit over the top. It does a very good job of making you actually care for Amber and Marina. \n\nI would highly recommend playing with the uncensor patch, since like any truely good VN (aka unlike most VNs), the sex scenes aren't there simply for fan service, but actually serve a as very important part of the character and plot development. \n\nIt's relatively short; I finished it in probably about 5 hours of actual play time. It does have a 2nd mode, which allows for \"goofball\" scenes; I don't think I'll be playing it again just for those however. I felt it was a good length for the story it was telling. Unlike, for example, Grisaia no Kajitsu, I never felt that you were trying to slog through a bunch of dreck in order to get to the good stuff. Honestly, I find that far too many VNs seem to mistake length for quality, and end up padding the story with a bunch of stuff that just makes me despise it. This did not happen here. \n\nThe art was good; you should be able to get a decent idea of what to expect based off just the screenshots available on Steam. The soundtrack helped set the mood nicely. \n\nI initially purchased this having missed the fact it is a kinetic novel rather than a full branching VN. Or Are KNs a subset of VNs? Anyways, in general I really do wish that the tags up top would emphasize that more, since the difference between choices and no choices is a pretty big deal IMHO. That having been said, it does make it pretty clear in the description, so that's my fault for missing it. \n\nAnyways, I'm rather pleased with the value I got for the purchase; bought during a valentine's day sale for 40% off. \n\nAlso, if it matters at all, the cards this game drops sell for a weirdly high price; selling them ended up offsetting almost a quarter of the purchase price.", "timestamp_created": 1490579826, "timestamp_updated": 1490579826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30663059": {"recommendationid": "30663059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120472802", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489551586}, "language": "english", "review": "EZ Mode. 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1490157575, "timestamp_updated": 1490157575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30496842": {"recommendationid": "30496842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216474225", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490424919}, "language": "english", "review": "Gay/10.

If you are into interesting background depictions (American Mid-West, treasure hunt around real geographic locations, desert music festival, on the road scenarios...), this is a BUY!\n\n2. If you are into visual novels (beware: no game or interaction!) with good graphics (persons and backgrounds) and lots of different (and also good) music, this is a GOOD BUY!\n\n3. If you are into stories with a bit of action telling behind it - where a treasure search against time and some adversaries  (also good depicted and with good story elements) actually leads to a gold finding...and a far grater love treasure in the course of action ;-) - this is a RECOMMENDED BUY!\n\n4. If you are into romantic story telling of two young adults with some dramatic elements in it due to personal problems regarding familiy loss and commitment fears - this is a VERY RECOMMENDED BUY!\n\n5. If you are into yuri / girl x girl stories where you can actually believe (due to good character and personality and action depictions) that both girls fell in love in the course of the story, this is an ABSOLUTE MUST BUY!\n\n...because, simply put, there are many stories out there which are not believable at all (and even wishful thinking doesn't help).\n\n6. There is some optional 18+ mature content as well (not within Steam, please read other postings below on how to activate it) which actually is no plot device but fits just fine into the story.\n\nIMO the graphics are not so interesting (though they are worth watching ;-)) as is the story-telling during those scenes, again it depicts rather well the character and background story of both girls. For 18+, you CAN BUY!\n\n\nPerhaps I should write a far longer review because I like Highway Blossoms very much, I truly recommend this novel.\n\n\nIMO Very good work, Alienworks!\n\n\nBy the way: The girls' names are Amber and Marina... :-)", "timestamp_created": 1487533395, "timestamp_updated": 1487533395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499616", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30012567": {"recommendationid": "30012567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019143680", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487433961}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game on a whim after stumbling upon it in the Steam Store a few days ago. It was on sale, and the reviews were pretty good, so I bought it. Not without some qualms: it was made by a studio I'd never heard about, and the setting seemed difficult to nail down in a kinetic novel like this one. I wasn't sure if I'd regret my decision or not.\n\nThankfully, Highway Blossoms is one of the most charming and entertaining visual/kinetic novel I've read in a long time. I don't regret buying it in the slightest.\n\nI'm not going to bother giving a synopsis--lots of other people have done that already. Anyway, a synopsis wouldn't do the characters, scenarios, and events in this novel justice. It's brief, only officially 4-6 hours (I finished in three because I couldn't put it down), and it's clich\u00e9d and hamfisted in a few points, but these flaws don't distract from something with this much heart, tact, and beauty. Some of the art is impeccable, the soundtrack is brilliant at points (especially the credits song), and the characters never failed to make me laugh or gasp when that was their intent. I've always been a sucker for love stories--I guess it shows--but this is one story I'll be a sucker for for a long time coming. It makes me want to go out on an adventure of my own some day.\n\nTL;DR: Give this game a try. Even if you don't LOVE it, you might get something out of it.

And he did seem to talk more - and more freely - while driving than any other time, and he did seem to often communicate through the weird obscure music he played in his car more than he did through words.\n\nSo... gifting this game to me was really appropriate. I think... unknowingly so.\n\nAnd this game really helped, but... not so much in the form of \"I know what Amber is going through\", since - well, that's utterly no use to me other to know it doesn't lead to anything good - but in the form of \"just plain helping out with stuff is one thing, but I really need to wake up and play the Marina role to try and bring my suffering, grieving family out of gloom\". And you know... it kind of worked.\n\nThumbs up to this game for inspiration, even if I feel like it didn't intend to be.\n\nBut, more of a review for the actual game - it's alright! It's an odd little VN which is half treasure hunting, rivalry and tourism, and then half romance, grieving and angst. Though the first half does naturally flow into the other, and there is crossover, it definitely feels like it's split down the middle, and that the first half ended kind of abruptly. \n\nAs you might have gathered, I thought the amount of detail to the characters was pretty good, though I might place more into the two main characters than other readers due to my personal connection. I also really appreciated the trio of rival characters, they were fun.\n\nI quite enjoyed the tourism - I'm not from the US so other than the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas it's just \"oh hey it's that place I've seen on TV. It has a name?!\" So I ended up googling for images of the places they went to, and that was fun. I do feel like a game with such emphasis on actual places should have used more background images - detailed ones - to convey the majesty of the locations covered, because it was quite central to the game. That's not to say that there were hardly any, it is to say that it could have done with more since it was all about sharing the experience.\n\nThe rivalry, the romance, the treasure hunting, the grieving and angst... I also thought were good, though I think some parts near the end could have been handled a little better. I think I'd venture into major spoilers if I tried to explain.\n\nOverall, though, it's good and I recommend this kinetic VN.", "timestamp_created": 1487031624, "timestamp_updated": 1487031695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652197", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29876480": {"recommendationid": "29876480", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995128738", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486913937}, "language": "english", "review": "A lesbian road trip was exactly what I needed.", "timestamp_created": 1486915606, "timestamp_updated": 1486915606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29852711": {"recommendationid": "29852711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130513127", "num_games_owned": 815, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486833440}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1]Highway Blossoms \u2014\u2014 \u516c\u8def\u767e\u5408\u76db[/h1]\n\u6e29\u99a8\u52a8\u4eba\u7684\u767e\u5408\u6545\u4e8b\n\n+\u7cbe\u7f8e\u7684CG\u7acb\u7ed8\n\uff08\u5168\u7a0b\u5c11\u6709\u5d29\u611f\uff0c\u90e8\u5206CG\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u6c1b\u56f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\uff09\n+\u98ce\u683c\u72ec\u7279\u7684BGM\n\uff08\u66f2\u98ce\u975e\u5e38\u5951\u5408\u7f8e\u56fd\u897f\u90e8\u6dd8\u91d1\u70ed\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u6c14\u6c1b\u7684bgm\u4e5f\u5f88\u5230\u4f4d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5c3e\u66f2\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u542c\uff09\n+\u6e29\u99a8\u52a8\u4eba\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\n\uff08\u767b\u573a\u4eba\u7269\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u60c5\u8282\u548c\u4eba\u7269\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63cf\u5199\u4e86\u4e3b\u89d2Amber\u5185\u5fc3\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u4e0e\u7ea0\u7ed3\u3002\u6545\u4e8b\u53d1\u5c55\u6d41\u7545\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u6c34\u5230\u6e20\u6210\uff0c\u4e0eAmber\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ecf\u5386\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5171\u60c5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u52a8\u5bb9\uff09\n\n+-\u65e0CV\n\uff08\u5c0f\u5236\u4f5c\u6ca1\u529e\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u4e5f\u4e0d\u89c1\u5f97\u662f\u574f\u4e8b\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8111\u8865\u81ea\u5df1\u5fc3\u76ee\u4e2d\u6700\u68d2\u7684Yuri\u97f3~\uff09\n\n-\u65e0\u5b98\u4e2d\n\uff08\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u5173\u7cfb\uff01\u62e5\u6709The Power of Yuri\uff0c\u67e5\u5b57\u5178\u4e5f\u80fd\u5543\u4e0b\u6765\uff01\uff09\n\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8bda\u5fc3\u8bda\u610f\u5ff5\u4e00\u53e5\uff1a\u201c[b]\u767e\u5408\u5927\u6cd5\u597d\uff01[/b]\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1486833629, "timestamp_updated": 1486841784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29754308": {"recommendationid": "29754308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160149221", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486442332}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u767e\u5408\u5417\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u9009\u62e9\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1486438932, "timestamp_updated": 1486438932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29743226": {"recommendationid": "29743226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102731949", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486394718}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u043e. \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442, \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b. \u041d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435 12 \u0438\u0437 10.", "timestamp_created": 1486394919, "timestamp_updated": 1511376974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29668877": {"recommendationid": "29668877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045936900", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486127090}, "language": "english", "review": "This was absolutely one of the best VN's I've ever read.

a fantastic VN I couldn't reccomend it more. Now it is a VN so there isn't any kind of choice, but still the lgbt+ Representation in this VN is great. Or really L in this case but still!.

Sometimes its a bit cliche, but its a love story, it happens \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nThe VN stars five charaters (six if you include gramps) with the focus on Marina and Amber. I won't spoil anything, more than that little blurb has already. (Nothing big don't worry) But I do want to take a moment to just mention how much I love the side three characters.

But that's mostly because I read pretty fast, so I clocked in around 4 hours or so of reading instead of the stated 6 hours or so stated. Guess all that fanfiction reading skills got put to good use lmao. \n\nOne thing I liked about the writing in general was how trim it was. There's almost no filler throughout the entire story and I can appreciate a game that tells a simple, great story rather than just dragging on for no particular reason but to increase your playtime. The other thing I liked was the humor, which got quite alot of chuckles from me throughout. Also, I found the main couple Amber and Marina heart stoppingly cute, and their dialouge even more so. \n\nArt-wise, the game is flawless. CG's and backgrounds are superb on my monitor and the words in the text box are easy to read and easy on the eyes. Character sprites (is that the right word?) do occasionally move and I love how sutble and effective it was in trying to make everything more lifelike. Masterful programming. There is no bugs, as far as I can tell,  which makes it the icing on top of the cake. \n\nThe music is pleasant throughout as well. I never once thought the background music was grating. On the contrary I found it rather relaxing to listen to, so I'll definitely be getting the DLC soundtrack. Highway Blossoms also makes good use of its music as well as silence.

During an otherwise uneventful drive through a desert in New Mexico, she comes across Marina whose car has just ran out of gas leaving her stranded. She picks her up and heads off to the nearest gas station. It is there that Amber learns about the second gold rush in the region. An old miner's journal has recently been discovered and published detailing instructions on where to find several hidden stashes of gold. Mostly by Marina's prodding, the duo head out on an adventure throughout the Southwest to find this treasure, though they are not the only ones looking for it.\n\nThis game is a kinetic novel, a type of visual novel where there are no branching storylines and only one ending. It can be played as fast as the player can read it. I would estimate that it would take the average reader around 6-8 hours to read it from beginning to end.\n\nI thought the story was pretty good overall. It was enjoyable to read and humorous at times while also developing the relationship between the main characters at a good pace. Although the story was certainly enjoyable, I did feel it was more on the predictable side. There are no real plot twists and the ending is not exactly surprising. Still, as a feel-good story, it does the job well.\n\nThe characters were a bright spot as well. The two main characters, Amber and Marina, come off as cute and likable and I enjoyed seeing their relationship unfold. They are somewhat clich\u00e9d, though, with Amber being the tomboy and Marina being the more girly girl.\n\nTwo other aspects of this game deserve special mention. The first would be the art. The setting of the game, the Southwestern United States, is a bit unconventional for visual novels. I thought [i]Highway Blossoms[/i] did an excellent job of utilizing its setting. The background artwork was fantastic all around as it brought to life the desert environment. The sprites of the characters were well drawn, distinctive, and colorful. The only critique I have is that the CGs were a bit inconsistent with the rest of the artwork.\n\nThe other outstanding aspect of this game would be the music. A lot of it really reminded me of music that you might hear in a western film befitting the game's setting well. I sometimes found myself pausing at moments during play just to listen to the music a little. It really enhanced the experience of reading this.\n\nOverall, despite a somewhat predictable plot, this is an enjoyable visual novel that includes great artwork, excellent music, and likable characters.

Ce qui suis, c'est pour ceux qui veulent le d\u00e9tail de mon ressenti sur Highway Blossom.\n\nJ'aime bien les visual novels, j'en ai fait un assez bon nombre, je pense, pour me consid\u00e9rer comme un amateur. Pour moi, ce qui fait que j'accroche ou pas \u00e0 un jeu de ce genre (dont le gameplay se limite \u00e0 lire du texte et, parfois, faire des choix pour les protagonistes), c'est le sc\u00e9nario, pour r\u00e9sumer. Apr\u00e8s tout, c'est l'essence du genre ! Si l'histoire est bonne, j'accroche. Si les personnages sont int\u00e9ressants ou intrigants, je m'y int\u00e9resse. Si l'action qui est racont\u00e9e est captivante, je m'y immerge sans retenue.\n\nRien de tout \u00e7a ne s'est produit avec ce jeu, durant les presque 2h que j'y ai jou\u00e9. Bien que visuellement agr\u00e9able, cette nouvelle ne m'a pas pris, n'a pas titill\u00e9 ma curiosit\u00e9. Les 2 personnages principaux, assez clich\u00e9s quoique \u00e7a ne me g\u00e8ne pas en soi, ne m'ont pas donn\u00e9 envie de connaitre leur histoire, que l'on devine d'ailleurs rapidement. Le contexte de l'histoire, comme son d\u00e9roulement, ne m'ont fait ni chaud ni froid. En bref, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 assez indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 tout ce qui fait le coeur d'un visual novel \u00e0 mon sens, avec ce jeu.\nBien s\u00fbr, je n'ai jou\u00e9 qu'aux 2 premi\u00e8res heures de l'histoire, histoire qui demande 8h de lecture d'apr\u00e8s ce que j'ai lu ; mais le fait est que j'ai rarement lu un d\u00e9marrage aussi mou, aussi plat. M\u00eame le d\u00e9but de If My Heart Had Wings me semble plus captivant en comparaison, et pourtant c'est un des VN les plus denses que j'ai fait.\nDu coup, j'ai vite d\u00e9croch\u00e9, et j'ai fini par speedrunner le jeu pour avoir les achievements et pouvoir le d\u00e9sinstaller.\n\nCe qui ne veut pas dire que HB est n\u00e9cessairement mauvais ; c'est plus probablement moi qui suis devenu plus exigeant avec ce genre vid\u00e9oludique ; faut dire qu'apr\u00e8s Grisaia No Kajitsu et Danganronpa, la barre est haute niveau sc\u00e9nario.\nEn soi, je pense m\u00eame que ce jeu peut tout \u00e0 fait plaire \u00e0 certains lecteurs, ceux qui aiment les histoires de road-trip \u00e0 l'am\u00e9ricaine, les aventures de chasse au tr\u00e9sor, et \u00e9ventuellement les romances fille/fille (faut DL le patch pour les 2 sc\u00e8nes, mais honn\u00eatement, je pense qu'on peut trouver mieux ailleurs pour ce seul point).\n\nDu coup, pourquoi le pouce bleu ? Bah parce que m\u00eame si je n'ai pas aim\u00e9 ce jeu, j'attends de voir ce que va donner la prochaine sortie de ce petit studio, que je n'ai pas le coeur de d\u00e9foncer all\u00e8grement. J'veux dire, les CG sont jolis, les musiques se laissent \u00e9couter m\u00eame si la country n'est pas mon style favori, et pour 10 balles, j'estime ne pas voir \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9, loin de l\u00e0.

rollercoaster ride.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I am generally not a big fan of VN's. Most of them don't manage to keep my attention for long enough, be it due to bad writing, boring characters or scenes that drag on for too long.\n\nHighway Blossoms however get's everything right. The dialogues are well written and at times witty. The characters are interesting, likeable and relatable and the development they go through, especially Amber, will keep you interested from start to finish.\n\nThe overall story offers a sense of adventure, comedy, action, drama and romance.\n\nThe artstyle for both the scenery as well as the characters is unique and gorgeous.\n\nOne of the things that stand out the most for a VN like Highway Blossoms is the Soundtrack.

The treasure hunt itself is more of a plot device than the main focus, which might be disappointing to anyone who was expecting more of an in-depth gold-rush adventure, but honestly the story is charming enough that it wasn't a concern for me. Alot of that came from the relationship between our two main characters. Amber is a very likeable protagonist even at her worst moments (and those breakfast puns she pulls out would make Sans very proud) while Marina is a very sweet yet kinda ditzy girl, her optimism never fails to make me smile although she did make me face-palm a few times. Their relationship feels natural and frankly adorable, but doesn\u2019t forget that these are people with flaws that can get in the way of running smoothly. Our secondary leads, the trio of Mariah, Joe and Tess are also a lot of fun and very quirky. I must admit my favourite character overall is probably Mariah, which is weird because I\u2019m not usually a fan of jerk characters but there was something really endearing about her so props to the writers for that. I also like how Highway Blossoms doesn\u2019t explain everything but hints enough to get the imagination rolling, like the Trio\u2019s backstory or even more about the miners journal itself. Heck after finishing the game I still think there\u2019s something more to why Marina came out in the desert on her own but we get no more explanation than what she says, which is infuriating yet riveting at the same time. \n\nThe artwork was gorgeous, each character design stood out and matched the personalities brilliantly. And the editing even got a bit hectic at times, it really added to the intense moments of the story, while the range of expressions were delightful to see (my particular favourite was Amber\u2019s snarky face whenever she made a joke or took a jab at someone). Music is another strong point here and it\u2019s one of those soundtracks I could easily listen to on its own, lots of guitars and that steady, easy driving atmosphere. It\u2019s the kind of music I grew up listening to, mostly from my Dad, which actually means for me personally I could really connect to Amber\u2019s loss of her Grandad and how much that music plays a part of her life, but even if you don\u2019t have that connection I can still highly recommend this soundtrack.\n\nThe writing, artwork and music were enough to make me enjoy the game, but let\u2019s get onto the bit that really made me fall in love with it: the extras! You\u2019ve probably noticed there\u2019s 17 achievements, but you only get 10 of them for going through the story. The rest is all for glorious extras! Took me a while to get the very last one as it takes a bit of fiddling ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0), but it didn\u2019t feel like a boring hassle to do so. There\u2019s the usual stuff, CG gallery, credits etc, and there\u2019s also a gallery of guest art which is gorgeous, I\u2019m definitely checking out these artists once I\u2019ve posted this review. But then there\u2019s the extra modes. You have goofball mode, which is worth going through the whole game again (on skip seen text) just to see these rather marvellous self-aware new dialogue, random text popups, and memes! Oh god this team has such a great sense of humour! The other mode is \u2018EZ Mode\u2019, which threw me off when I saw the option come up because this game is kinetic. There are no choices to make so why make it easier? But I played it and\u2026 if you compare an episode of \u2018Yu Gi Oh!\u2019 to an episode of \u2018Yu Gi Oh! Abridged\u2019 then you should get a good idea what EZ Mode is like compared to how the game is normally. \n\nWell that\u2019s all I have to ramble about, overall this is a cute Yuri game with a fun story, enjoyable characters, and that extra special touch that just makes it a great experience. Highway Blossoms is one I can recommend to pretty much anyone who likes fun stories and good characters.

These themes include, but are not limited to: mourning, loss, coming of age, family, legacy, and of course, relationships.\n\nThe most touching and important themes in the VN come from a lot of the inner-monologuing of the main character and narrator, Amber, as she deals with the loss of her grandfather, and a set of events she finds herself in, including meeting the other main in the story, Marina. The monologuing is never hamfisted, and tends to be very introspective, realistic, and will without doubt have you thinking of your current, or past relationships.\n\nAnother great plus to note is the soundtrack, which punctuates the strong, emotional and even comedic themes very well, all while being true to the American theme and setting the story finds itself in.\n\nThe weak points of the story lie in some of the 'wish fulfillment' aspects of how the story unfolds,with situations that are slightly too good to be true, but the pacing, and the more important personal relationships of the characters relegate this concern to a minor niggle.\n\nAll in all, the VN is definitely a triumph for the Yuri genre, and for Western VNs and definitely worth picking up for anyone who enjoys a good, thoughtful interpersonal story, and who's probably sick of replaying Sono Hanabira for the 30th time.", "timestamp_created": 1469252942, "timestamp_updated": 1469259464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24441871": {"recommendationid": "24441871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120712256", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473459415}, "language": "english", "review": "To say I love this VN would be an understatement - I haven't enjoyed a story this much since Katawa Shoujo or Life is Strange, the only thing that makes me sad is that it ends - 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1469107543, "timestamp_updated": 1469110674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24436357": {"recommendationid": "24436357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043418025", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479442265}, "language": "english", "review": "In addition to its exciting and heartwarming storytelling, really shows just how well Ren'py can be used. \n\n10/10 wish it never ended", "timestamp_created": 1469075524, "timestamp_updated": 1469075524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24430932": {"recommendationid": "24430932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995320314", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466928035}, "language": "english", "review": "I quite enjoy visual novels, and kinetic novels (visual novels without choices), particularly of the yuri type, so this did draw my eye, but what really attracted me to this was that the game was about traveling in the US, which is uncommon, to say the least, for VNs (and KNs(.  \n\nThis is a short but sweet yuri KN, with some replayability (new modes that add a bit of humorous fun are unlocked after finishing the story).

Ich war mir zuerst nicht ganz sicher, was mich erwarten w\u00fcrde. \nAber letztendlich war das Spiel immerhin so gut, dass ich sicherlich 3/4 davon an einem Tag durchgelesen habe. \nDinge, die mir besonders an dem Spiel gefallen haben waren zum Beispiel, dass sehr viele Hintergr\u00fcnde gezeichnet wurden. Ich habe glaube ich in keiner VN soviele Szenarienwechsel erleben d\u00fcrfen. Auch gab es einige Nebencharaktere, welche wohlgemerkt hin und wieder sogar \u00e4lter als 30 Jahre zu sein schienen. Sieht man selten. \nMein Lieblingscharakter ist Amber, ihr Charakterdesign ist schlicht, aber es gef\u00e4llt mir ziemlich gut. Vor allem dieser eine Blick, den sie \u00f6fters verwendet, finde ich gro\u00dfartig. Auch ihre Pers\u00f6nlichkeit gef\u00e4llt mir, wenngleich Amber gegen Ende etwas...seltsam wird. Ambers und Marinas Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten wirklich zusammen sehr dynamisch. Die beiden erinnern mich an Ritona und Selphine aus Fault, wobei diese Charakterarchetypen ja oft zusammen verwendet werden. Ich h\u00e4tte mir gew\u00fcnscht, h\u00e4tte man Marina noch etwas mehr Charaktertiefe gegeben. z.B. wurden zwei Fragen nicht in der VN beantwortet, welche ihr zus\u00e4tzlich Tiefe h\u00e4tten geben k\u00f6nnen.\nSpoiler: Einmal, warum sie unbedingt auf Schatzsuche gehen wollte und dann, was sie Amber kaufen wollte.\n\nDie VN gibt es nur in Englisch, was f\u00fcr mich aber kein Hinderniss darstellte. Die Texte sind nicht zu komplex und konnten auch gut \u00fcberflogen werden. Nur die Tagebucheintr\u00e4ge habe ich einfach \u00fcbersprungen. Es war mir zuviel Text und es wurde danach eh noch einmal alles von Amber zusammengefasst. Weshalb sich also bem\u00fchen? xD\nInsgesamt ist es eher eine leichtherzig-witzige Visual Novel, welche ich nur empfehlen kann. \n\nSpoiler:\nDer Bonusmodus war schon etwas seltsam, aber witzig.\nUnd ich fand die Idee recht innovativ, dass Amber ihren *&!\u00a7 vorget\u00e4uscht hat, um Marina nicht zu verletzen.

I got so hooked to it that I stayed up all night just to finish it. The characters are adorable and amazing and yes. I do ship Amber x Marina it's my OTP to be honest. Anyway, if you don't like the 'sexual' visual novels then this one is right up your alley. I enjoyed it without the adult version. If you love yuri, you'll love the ship and don't fangirl too hard around people as well. \n\nIt's got yuri romance, little bit of sadness, enjoyment and it's based off real landmarks! Loving how this is set in the desert and not Japan. Gives a nice old western feel to it. Love the characters personalities they fit them perfectly. The art is amazing! I recommend this game if you're looking for a light hearted yuri romance that will send you in tears of joy and sadness. \n\nPsst, I might be doing an Amber cosplay so look out for it as well on Twitter-- \n\n--- SPOILER WARNING TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET ---\n\nMy favourte picture art in the game would have to be when Amber and Mariah are racing to the second treasure.

I found this, \"Highway Blossoms\". Since I already read some Yuri Manga, I decided to buy it. It's my first Visual Novel, and I will let you know in a short review how i think about it.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nI love the story so much because its something different since it takes place in the Southwest.\nAmber, a ninteen years old girl, is driving with her motorhome to a music festival. She meets Marina, a cute eighteen years old girl but the problem is, Marina's car is stolen. Marina lets Amber know about a treassure so Amber decides to give Marina a ride to search for it. \n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\nI like the Characters very much. Every Character was different and i nearly liked every one of them becuase they are very lovely designed. \n\n[h1] Visual/Audio [/h1]\nThe Visual Novel is very nice animated/drawn. If you compare it to other Visual Novels on Steam, you will realise that its nearly one of the best on Steam. You can play it for sure in Fullscreen without losing quality (HD). Oh gawd i liked the audio in the background so much.. you just had so much feels only because of the music. Just nearly cried at some moments. The song in the end was very lovely so please dont skip the credits.\n\n[h1] To sum up [/h1]\nI would surely rate this Visual Novel 9/10 if not even 10/10. I will read it a second time, because you get more options to read since you finished it once. Its just sad to know that its over, because you just have so much feelings during reading. If you are not sure to buy it JUST BUY IT and give it a try. And dont forget to install the adult patch, for the sex scenes.\n\n(Im sorry for my bad english :P)", "timestamp_created": 1467939485, "timestamp_updated": 1467970843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24161347": {"recommendationid": "24161347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122002513", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484461301}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e14\u0e35\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1467910951, "timestamp_updated": 1467910951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24148780": {"recommendationid": "24148780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138241510", "num_games_owned": 1051, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507421121}, "language": "english", "review": "Bread-chan's Guide to the Perverse;\n\n1.

I got really attached to the characters, which made me kinda sad to see it end. The game took be about 8 hours to finish it. I also love the soundtrack, it gives everything the right mood!

I thought the MC was around age 23 when she was introduced but it turns out she's 19 and they even directly address that she seems older than she is which kind of bugged me. Also the MC never specifically mentions she's a lesbian. I do actually kind of like how they didn't make a big deal out of it and you can figure it out by yourself pretty quick by the way she checks out nearly every woman she encounters.

And I'm glad I did.\n\nThe writing was emotional, the artwork was fantastic and the music was perfect in every part. I loved all of the characters and they were all (for the most part) well written. The H-scenes were optional, but they were slotted in perfectly I never would have noticed they weren't there all the time.\n\nWhat did I not like?\n\n1) The numerous spelling and grammer errors throughout; incorrect words, repeated words, missing words, etc. These will likely be fixed in updates, but at the time of this writing, they were pervasive enough to warrent a lost point.\n\n2) The lack of character development of the three side characters Mariah, Tess and Joseph. Honestly, I found them far more interesting than the two main characters and would have liked to learn more about their pasts and just plain have them play more of a role. Marina as well. I felt she didn't get anywhere near the amount of development that Amber got.\n\n3) Lack of choice. I know the story is about the romance between Amber and Marina, but I would have liked the option to romance Mariah instead. I just didn't like Marina that much. I thought it might be an option when Tess mentions Mariah has never had a boyfriend, and then the scene where Amber and Mariah get drunk in the motorhome, but it was just a tease.\n\n4) The H-scenes felt short and rather sub-par. They are optional, so they didn't factor into my review score, but I was a bit disappointed with them.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\nI really liked it and want more.

The characters are cute, albeit not really fleshed out, and I enjoyed their interactions; however, as previously mentioned, they were not really that complex of characters and I actually enjoyed the side trio much more than the two main characters. I was also none to impressed with the plot jumps which seemed scattered throughout the story. One such instance is when the main character, Amber if I remember correctly, states that they both have secrets they do not want to tell each other and in the next instance both know each other secrets, but the viewer is left none the wiser.

Later on I was gifted the game from one of my friends on Steam, and of course I thanked them. :) \n\nNow I don't want to spoil anything, but when I first played it, as I said above, it was my first VN, so I didn't know what to expect. I saw text, but that was it, so I was a bit dissapointed at first, not the games fault of course, I didn't think VN's were all text based, (silly me). But I've come to appreciate them more now after having went through this one.\n\nI actually thought the story wasn't as long as I thought it was when I first started it up, so I read through most of it as fast as I could, not actually paying much attention to the story itself, later on I realized how much I started to actually get into the story, so I went back a bit at the start of the story in order to understand the story much better, and glad I did. I enjoyed this VN a lot more than I thought I would from the start. I got many emotions from it, sadness, happiness, I even giggled a bit every now and then, as I progressed through the story more and more, I found myself wanting more and more, hoping it wouldn't end too soon. I believe it's worth the money given how much it took me to complete it. I haven't went back and tried the extra option though. \n\nSo aside from the fact that this was my first VN. Do I regret it? Nope, not at all. Do I reccomend it? Absolutely. The developers did a good job in my opinion getting the player feeling the right emotions at the right time.

It's a cute tale of love in the strangest of places, of heartbreak, and of a deep sadness.

And unlike most other VNs, it features a bevvy of contributions from other artists, adding stylistic but palatable changes to character appearances and backgrounds every now and then. The music is beautiful, the plot is easy to follow, and the inclusion of achievements makes absolutely no sense for such a straightforward game. \n\nIn short, it's virtually the opposite of a Sakura game.

I complain because some things didn't get that much time, and that there is no epilogue, because of not assuming there'll be another episode.\n- Deus ex machina moments and aspects of the story. Only one really glaring, the others are less unrealistically convenient.\n- No voice acting: Like choices, it'd just be huge plus, if it was done well.\n- Amber: Merely my own opinion, as is this whole review. See below if you're curious.\n\nMy last point may cause disappointment to some other players, but obviously didn't for many. For the whole experience I still recommend this kinetic novel, and thank the effort put into it.\n\nFor those who want to read more, before buying the game, and want to know why Amber is on the negative side for me (no real spoilers):\n\n[spoiler]It's Amber's story, she narrates it, we can also read her thoughts, and hers only. Until more than half of the story, she remained interesting and potentially likable for me, because she had yet a lot of space to extend into as a person. However approaching the end, I started liking her less and less, nearly disliking her by the end. After I slept on it, I could summarize what I believe bothers me about her as: She is pretty much like a guy, rather than a girl, and thinking about it, maybe a surprisingly reduced amount of changes would be needed to switch the protagonists' gender. This opinion may come from that her qualities and flaws are such that I'd sooner associate with a guy than with a girl. More details in the next section, for those who finished the game or insist on more details to decide.[/spoiler]\n\nFor people who finished the game or don't mind heavy spoilers:\n\n[spoiler]Until Amber got close enough to Marina to start teasing her, she remained unknown enough for me to anticipate more kindness and caring from her. From then on, though, I only discovered that she didn't have much of those left hidden, instead there were an overwhelming amount of flaws to discover:\n- A very low empathy level.\n- Insensitivity, in the form of teasing that may really hurt, and is only fun for who teases. Could also compare to the behavior of some children, that some people don't grow out of, I imagine because they don't realize how it feels for whom it's said to, leading back to lack of empathy.\n- Lack of consideration and attention. E.g., despite supposedly being in love with her, she admittedly didn't pay much attention to Marina's tastes, or attempted to find out more through conversation, like what she can't eat. It is also hard to believe the idea of buying more clothes for Marina only came to her mind at the end. It may have been a production decision, to avoid different outfits, along with shopping scenes, but story-wise it still came off like that for me. It was on my mind for a while by then, but at least when they decided to look for all the treasure together, it would've been natural to think of that necessity in my opinion. Not to mention not buying a phone in the end, at least for Marina, to replace her old one. They could've bought it together, and it would've indeed been very useful very soon...\n- Lack of appreciation of Tess's cute aloofness. This is a joke, but true.\n- Having difficultly expressing and discussing her emotions. She'd rather end up talking to a guy \u2013 or her rival in his absence \u2013 about her problems, than to the very person they affected the most, and who is supposedly also the most important right then to her. Should be praised for not cheating on her to confirm how little she meant?\n\nHer qualities are generally on the masculine side, which isn't a bad thing, just feels unbalanced when added together:\n+ Great driving skills.\n+ Sense of direction.\n+ Ability to intimidate.\n+ Affinity mostly \u2013 or only \u2013 to practical skills.\n\nSome of these could be attributed to her upbringing and her grandfather's heavy influence. The intention might've been to make her more like a butch, too. Even if there are such reasons, I think the lists above, along with her\n* choice of clothes\n* considering it her job to fulfill a guardian role\n* not being conscious of her body\n* objective stance towards relationships\n* almost complete lack of concerns when it comes to liking other girls or being together with one,\n\nwould make it rather easy, as far as the writing is concerned, through changing references, and only a few events, to adapt it to a male protagonist instead. Most of the inner monologues and actions shouldn't even be touched, that's how it seems to me, looking back. This may bother a few more people, who expect a bit different female protagonist.\n\nI quite early thought of how nice it'd be to read the story narrated by Marina, because Amber seemed more like whom I'd romance, but I'm not sure I wouldn't have changed my mind in the latter half, even if that was possible. What prevented me most from liking Amber was how she dealt with the consequences of her actions, after her night in the desert and reuniting with Marina. Additionally, the reason why she tried to send her away could've been \u2013 rather than protecting Marina \u2013 to avoid an unwanted relationship, when she only looked for a replacement and some comfort after losing a loved \u2013 the most loved \u2013 one of hers. Ultimately the concern is the same, but in the process Marina was definitely hurt, yet after they reconcile, Amber only tells about how happy she is, without any sense of guilt, or thinking about how she should make amends.\n\nMoving on from Amber, something else I started missing as the story progressed, just as Amber did her tackling hugs, were Marina's hopping and bouncing sprite movements, her specialty from early on. Although such movements were still mentioned sometimes in text, Marina seems to have lost quite a bit of her cheerfulness during the time with Amber, which isn't a too positive change.\n\nQuite a few signs could indicate their relationship won't continue too well over time, but the lack of epilogue entrusts this to everyone's imagination. The ending is happy, but on a hill right after severe ups and downs.\n\nIt's a pity we don't get to know more about the trio's circumstances, not like Amber ever tried.\n\nFinally, my order of the characters according to how much I liked them, and why:\n\nMarina (Really the best person we get to know more about in the story, despite her flaws. She didn't steal any car accidentally.)\nTess (Amber really wouldn't want a honest and calm little sister like her?)\nJoseph (Takes care of Mariah and Tess, despite being a slacker.)\nCassi (Was nice even after her disappointment.)\nStation Attendant (As far as we get to know him, he's helpful.)\nDino (Harmless.)\nMariah (She showed more consideration than Amber, never mind how uncharacteristically.)\nAmber (She really doesn't deserve Marina unless she can change.)\nLinda (She [b]is[/b] harmful.)\nMr. Jumbo (Please don't exist.)\n\nDisqualified: Howard and the rest.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1466808072, "timestamp_updated": 1467062396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23770614": {"recommendationid": "23770614", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998133210", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466805611}, "language": "german", "review": "The story itself is not that important, but i really enjoyed the characters and the writing.", "timestamp_created": 1466804921, "timestamp_updated": 1466804921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23767235": {"recommendationid": "23767235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040768301", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466616088}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little story but it would have been better in another medium, like a webcomic.

I spent 9 hours on my first playthrough of the game, and found it quite enjoyable. I expect to spend around 8 hours in goofball mode, which is an additional mode that's unlocked once you've finished the game.\n\nThis game, simply put, is amazing. This was my first Visual Novel ever, and I'm glad to have set such a high standard for the genre. Several elements tie this game together; the visual aspects, the general feel, and the music being key factors. The character development was very well done, leaving me with a quirky opinion of the characters, because I felt like I knew them by the end of the game. The story was very intricately put together, with the romance and drama being both cute and cringe-worthy at the same time (in a good way.)\n\nThe developers are very active, and keep frequent tabs on the discussions. They have released several patches that fix both minor and major bugs. An additional patch adds the full content to the game, adding several erotic sequences that adds to the emotional level of the game.\n\nThe visual aspect of the game is pure gorgeous. The art style kept me enthralled with the game, and I hopped on whenever I had a free moment. The characters are expressed through minor changes of their facial expressions, or by physical attire and arm movements. The characters also move around a bit, leaving the bare idea of animation.\n\nThe world that the game describes through pure text, accompanied with the visuals, leaves an impact of a well-thought-out description for an area. I felt like I was personally there in all the sequences and individual scenes.\nOne of the most important parts of the game was the music. The music was perfect, spot-on, flawless. The music, throughout the game, tied in very well with the sequences, and even added to the humourous sequences, with music cutting off at seemingly random moments to emphasize a point made in the text, or with the visual movements of the characters. I intend to buy the soundtrack when I can.\n\nOne of the most important elements of any game is the story-telling, and the emotional involvement.\nThe story of Amber, throughout the game, left me both breathless and tearing up. I might be the exception, but the game had me drawn in, from start to finish. I'm not really sure how to express the depth of the characters, and the emotions they go through, but it feels like you, the player, are going through the same trials as the characters are.\n\nThere are a few minor things that the game struggled with, and these tended to slightly draw me out of the emotional eggshells that the characters made me feel like I was walking on. Throughout the game, there are minor typoes that don't affect the story. There was only one that had me baffled for a minute as I tried to piece together what the purpose of that specific line in the text was. The conspicious lack of a change of clothing is a bit unusual, to say the least.\n\nThe game is well worth the money.

Plenty of gems, too, but wading through the refuse to find one is an art in itself.\n\n[i]Highway Blossoms[/i] is one of those exceptions.\n\nThat's not say it's a revelation. Outside the American Southwest setting, [i]Highway Blossoms[/i] is little more than an average coming-of-age romance meets road film starring two young women, each with their own complementary personalities and existential crises -- time-tested cliches at their best.\n\nBut that doesn't make it any less compelling. What it lacks in novelty, [i]Highway Blossoms[/i] more than makes up for it with romantic charm and superb tact, filled to the brim with saccharine ups and heart-wrenching downs that hit in all the right places but never once feel out of place; even the H scenes impress, the subtlety and tenderness unexpected coming from a lesbian romance written by two men.\n\nThe art is by all means above-average for an OEL novel, but for me, aesthetically out of place. A more realistic sense of stylization with just a pinch of East Asian flair would have worked better given the heavy Americana vibe, something the original score captures perfectly -- dusty guitars and contemplative minimalism serve as the ideal mood setters, arguably the biggest highlight to be found here.\n\nThen again, I'm a sucker for a good love story, and that's exactly what [i]Highway Blossoms[/i] does best: touching romantic exposition via mixed media and an excellent reminder as to why I enjoy this genre in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1466601032, "timestamp_updated": 1466601247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23704669": {"recommendationid": "23704669", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980301749", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501601982}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430, \u0442\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u0443 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432.\n\u0427\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e (\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0442 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e) \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441 - \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435. \u0420\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b. \n\u041d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041d\u0443 \u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b. \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0436\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0435\u0435. \n\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e, \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0447\u0451\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f\u0442\u044c... \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \n\u0417.\u042b. \u0411\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435!

This is a great start.\n\n8/10\n\nRead my full. detailed review here: https://kupowrites.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/highway-blossoms-vn-review", "timestamp_created": 1466495938, "timestamp_updated": 1466495938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23681939": {"recommendationid": "23681939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116310191", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468961718}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u5c31\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1466495818, "timestamp_updated": 1466495818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23681923": {"recommendationid": "23681923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154545285", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466496451}, "language": "english", "review": "Developed by AlienWorks and published by Sekai Project onto steam. Highway Blossoms is a short yuri story set in American Southwest. It takes place after an old gold rush miner\u2019s journal is discovered, supposedly detailing and containing clues about where he hid parts of his stash.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts of with Amber, who couldn\u2019t care less about the treasure let alone know about the treasure existence. Wandering the Southwest in an inherited motorhome, she mourns the loss of her grandfather, totally unaware of the hunt taking place around her. Not until she meets Marina, a young hitchhiker wandering through the deserts of New Mexico. Things start to pick up from there after she lets Marina get a ride from her and gets to know about the treasure.\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]\nFor the visual aspects I think it is generally well done and the art style is very pleasing to the eye and it gives off a nice ambiance around the visual novel itself with the use of vivid colors. I relatively enjoy the music in Highway Blossoms though I would like to state that at certain parts of the story no music was used and It got a little awkward.\n\n[h1]To sum up[/h1]\nWould I recommend Highway Blossoms? As a huge fan of Yuri genre it would go against my nature to not recommend Highway Blossoms. Highway Blossoms is well worth your time if you are into yuri and like a American theme.\n\n[url=https://azusantiara.com/2016/06/21/highway-blossoms-review/]Click here for full review with images and more![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1466495731, "timestamp_updated": 1466495870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763423", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23680101": {"recommendationid": "23680101", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993398716", "num_games_owned": 1986, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466403138}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, but interesting story about love and grief.

The lead characters, Amber and Marina, are both likeable, their interactions together often cute, and many of their quips genuinely amusing. Having the story set not only in the United States but not in a high school was a breath of fresh air. Although I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve played a huge number of visual novels the premise of road trips is interesting and unlike anything I\u2019ve seen since Katahane.\n\nThat being said, the story is at its strongest when it is not being a discount National Treasure. The treasure hunt plot felt unnecessary in the long run, and the story could have easily been a sightseeing tour on the way to California, finding the beauty in nature and growing closer without the motivation of money (still, I can see the treasure hunt being a metaphor and the actual treasure not being anything gold). There is also some drama in the tail-end of the story that is resolved far too quickly and cleanly. \n\nDespite these faults I can still recommend this to anyone looking for a yuri-themed visual novel. The music was above average compared to anything else I\u2019ve heard in the genre, and despite there being no voice acting the characters are highly expressive even thorugh static sprites, which often move around the screen to give the impression of animation. The artwork for the sprites is quite good, but the CG art is inconstant, some of them giving Amber noticeably shorter hair than she has.   \n\nPros:\n+Great characters \n+Good music\n+Unconventional setting\n\nCons:\n-Story feels unfocused at times\n-Inconsistent art", "timestamp_created": 1466408150, "timestamp_updated": 1466484190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23660846": {"recommendationid": "23660846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020176661", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466370042}, "language": "english", "review": "This may look like your usual yuri VN, but between the setting, the rock-flavored soundtrack, and the more mature (in the general sense of the word, though of course in the adult version there's that too) feel, Highway Blossoms isn't quite so usual at all outside the anime art style (though even that at least is very [i]good[/i] anime-style art).  Even the main relationship feels pretty fresh for the most part, though there's some of the usual moments in it.  In general, it looks good, sounds great, and feels almost perfect, knowing when to be silly and when to be more grounded and serious.\n\nIt's not perfect; the pacing feels off at times, ocassionally rushing through or dragging a bit, and there were a few bugs and missing features that they've thankfully been working hard to fix.  There's a few other tiny things here and there that I didn't like or didn't agree with, but nothing else really worth mentioning.\n\n(Having played it both with and without the developers' adult patch, I'd like to note that the scenes cut for this version include at least one that's a major part of the story; not having it doesn't break the plot, it's still easy enough to figure out what happened, but it does make things feel disjointed for a bit.

I was hooked to this VN from start to finish, and while that could be because the characters look, act and feel exactly like my relationship, I'm pretty sure it's because it's a great bundle of fun. \nIt might not be the longest, but it all fits together incredibly well. The graphics/aesthetics are beautiful and fit together really well, the soundtrack, while slightly irritating to start, quickly became very fitting, and the entire thing was amazing. It was well polished, and I only found two typos in the entire thing. All but one of the side characters had sprites too, which I really liked (whereas longer games such as IMHHW and Everlasting Summer didn't have) and so I feel this game was truly loved - and it makes you love it too.\nThere are no choices, however, it is a linear VN, so that's worth noting (There is no actual gameplay). With the story, there was a good half an hour where I thought \"This is a bit odd\" but I can't complain because it's plausible - the characters could fit that scenario, so it's all good. There is also [strike]no gallery[/strike] [i](There is now a gallery)[/i] or jump options on the menu, so if you wanna skip through it to replay certain bits and such, then you can't really, though the skip option is very quick, and the easy way to scroll through previously read scenes is very nice. It would have been nice if there was a better way to understand the keys, (like middle mouse button to hide the ui and see the picture, and V activating text to speech). But honestly these things don't matter to me. Just click, appreicate, and play the whole thing!\nThe story is mostly about their cute/sweet relationship, and not really about the gold rush thing. I mean, thats a huge thing, but it's not so much of a challenge, but the situation for our plot to be told. The relationship story is very sweet, and there are some good references and funny moments.\nA couple achievements involving settings didn't popup until I looked at the gallery after beating the game, but that was not an issue really - since anyone hunting for achievements would beat the game.\nThis is really just a very relatable, very sweet, very cute, and very polished yuri VN, of moderate length, and it's definitely worth it's price. \nFor those questioning the adult content, it wasn't much, it wasn't forced, and it complimented the story very well, though I think you'd be okay without it too if you're disgusted by that sort of thing. It's not too intense though, but enjoyable none the less :^ )\nThe relationship development didn't seem stretched, I think it was realisitic, and not obvious that it would happen from the start. As opposed to everything pushing them together like this is a Hollywood romcom or something, things aren't always perfect for them, and just hnng. \nGosh, I really don't know what to say at this point, everything I've said sounds like a criticism but I honestly can't think of more flaws other than what I have said.

I may be a bit stingy at buying new games, but passing up a newyuri visual novel is something I have found hard to do in the past, and today was no exception. I loaded Highway Blossoms up expecting it to be a simple, feel good, story, with well drawn visuals, and an experience a bit on the short side. What I got was exactly that, but a bit more.\n\nTo begin, I must confess that I have visual novels a bit hard to get into in the past. Even highly regarded ones have been left with unfinished savefiles and a yet to be fulfilled promise of completion. It's not a lack of quality that got me, but just a slowness to get into things, and a bit of the unknown regarding the payoff once the story does get going.\nI was hoping for this one to possibly warm me up to the genre; and I have to admit, It most likely has succeeded. Regardless though, this a review from someone that isn't particularly well versed in the world of visual novels.\n\nBesides the just the yuri, the Mojave desert location was an interesting one and defiantly helped draw me in a bit.\nThe Mojave can be beautiful, and they did a great job representing this. Even the more generic background scenes are fun to look at, and when one gets to the set-pieces, one realizes the artists really knew what they where doing.\nThey are beautiful scenes, with just the right amount of lighting  animation to add to the story without distracting. The characters are well drawn, and appealing to look at. The animation used is effective in the conversation scenes, with just the right amount of drawn images to keep it from becoming repetitive. The devs don't overstep themselves the more movement heavy scenes, and the way they leave it to the imagination is well executed. TLDR - It looks great, with many a cute character many a doing cute things in a very well drawn, pretty world.\n\nThe story isn't too bad. It isn't nessisarly the most believable thing, and has a few plot holes here and there, but it serves it's purpose as a way to drive the interactions forward. It was goofy at times, and did have a slight feel of\nbeing contrived, but I was easily able to put the oddness aside and enjoy it. This is probably due to how well the characters fit into the grand scheme of things. The story did do a great job at giving you the feeling a following \ntwo folks going on the more interesting side of adventure; the kind with that entails a large place to explore and nowhere fast to be. The pacing was a bit strange though. It feels like the characters mention certain locations and such, and then by obligation the story would follow up to that location later on. It left a slew of mostly unrelated feeling events only connected by the characters themselves, and little else. Highway Blossoms' story at times also felt like it was following a flow chart. An event would happen that would feel out of character, just to simply add some drama. Or they would go to an exotic location, just because. It would be a bigger problem in something else, but it is redeemed by what I think is the strongest part of this experience, the character interactions.\n\nFrom a writing perspective, the characters personalities are fleshed out, relatable, and interesting. Their backstories are not completely revealed, but instead hinted at throughout via character interactions and the the main \ncharacter's observations. Their personalities are also well defined as well, and all that, in conjunction with some extremely good writing, equal some fantastic and believable interactions. The conversations go from being genuinely \nfunny, to sad, to heartfelt, to relaxed, and it all flows extremly well. It is alot of fun watching these extremely well designed characters do things, and react to the situations that they are thrown into. I was whole hearteningly\nrooting for the obvious yuri parring not only because I enjoy the characters, but also due to how well the two interacted. I love all the characters, even if the MC is a bit of a dingus. \n\nHighway Blossoms isn't the longest experience, but an enjoyable one. It gives a good sense of adventure, while still giving a great romance story to boot.", "timestamp_created": 1466244468, "timestamp_updated": 1466244468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499890", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23629290": {"recommendationid": "23629290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009885192", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467088756}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was adorable and the characters were great.

If you just want to relax and zone out to a game, this does the trick.\n\nI have not yet finished the game. I'm a little over 6 hours in and, I'm writing this as if I'm in the future and have finished the game. I'll put some edits at the bottom to fix stuff as I complete the game.\n\nOverall: This game ended up being pretty ok. I mean the story isn't going to win any awards (no offence), but the characters made the story enjoyable. It was a little slow at times but, durring treasure hunts the pace would pick up, and I'd find myself spam clicking through the scenes to see what would happen. The game so far <-------(I actually haven't finished it yet) is on a steady course gathering steam as I feel shit will probably go down soon. If you do want to buy this game, I'd say wait until some more reviews come out as, I don't know If I can accurately give you a decent rating on it overall.\n\nArt: \"9/10\" The art was wayyyy better than I thought it would be, I mean I thought this game would be a long shot but it ended up looking better than a lot of the huge publisher Japanese stuff, which is a feat in itself coming from a prettymuch no-name studio (with like 5 people working on it). The art was good however, it lacked in quantity. The backdrops were very well drawn however when like 90% of your scenes are in a motorhome you'd think they would have some angles that allowed you to see the backdrop outside of the vehicle more, instead you get a bunch of detailed shots of the inside of an old motorhome. (Of course driving through the desert there probably wouldn't be much to look at anyway) I say the art's a solid 9/10. Not as much as I wanted but, what was there was good.\n\nStory: \"6/10\" I'll be honest I had to force myself to click through some of this game the reason being, it lacked depth. I mean the game is tagged casual, which fits it perfectly however, I find myself wishing it had a more powerful story. It's the kind of story that would make for a great short animated series however, having to read it all out takes away from the cutness of the driving in an RV for hours. The story starts to pick up an hour or two in, and grows more and more enjoyable as it goes on. I did find myself having to take a break every once and a while though, I wasn't expecting this to be a huge page turner. FIX: (It gets a lot more dramatic in the second half)\n\nWhat else is there?\n\nCharacters: \"7/10\" The characters are unique and refreshing throughout the story. Not crazy deep but, I didn't want deep characters in a game like this. They fit well and I don't think there's much more to say.\n\nSound: \"7/10\" I wrote sound, but what I really mean is the music. If you didn't know this game has no naration; I didn't know but I also didn't read the discription. Again with the whole \"it worked pretty well thing.\" I feel like this vn would be pretty weird if there was voice acting. It's written in a more western style, and good english speaking voice actors are hard to come by. I'm glad they didn't throw some shitty voice acting into the mix.\n\nMusic: \"7/10\" The music worked well with most of the scenes though, some could use a change of pace. The songs would occasionally die out and then not start up for a few min which left it feeling empty, if that makes sense.\n\nI'm sure there's some other things but this has already gone way longer than I had planned so I'm ending it here.\n\nSemi-Final verdict: 11/10 \"it's ok\"\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention this game says it's yuri and.. that's like sorta true but you need to patch it to get the extra content/dlc bonus ecchi shit, whatever you want to call it ya pervs. This is steam afterall.\n\nEDIT #2: It did pick up in the second half.

While in the first stages you won't notice it, in later stages the game preys on you not seeing enemies, because they blend perfectly with the backgrounds. Color pallete is rather stale and it kills any variety of envintorments. Soundtrack is pure greatness and it really fits. Game is incredibly violent and I love it, although it gets stale after a while and the game becomes tedious when you notice it has nothing to it, because stage design is rather non-existent, because it is arena 2D shooter and arenas look nearly identical.\nWhen they try stage design, it sucks, because it's cheap and it only gets you, because you don't know what will come next.\n\nGame is most of the time artifically hard and cheap, it rarely does offer a fair challenge. While in first 2 acts you won't notice that, because the game is fairly easy until you hit Jungle Outpost and the game starts going downhill from there, because you notice all of the flaws. Arenas are small, it will get really hard to avoid damage, especially from homing missles, when you are bombared by enemies from top to bottom. And since there is barely any AI to talk about, to make enemies a threat, they can shoot through walls sometimes.\nIdea of difficulty in this game is \"throw a lot of crap on the screen with no power ups with barely any room to move and avoid damage\". It is almost like Dark Souls 2 in that regard, where the game is only hard, because there is too much crap on the screen.\nThere are 6 weapons in this game, but half of them are situational (chainsaw to gain health) and mostly useless (chainsaw, rail gun, flamethrower, grenade launcher), most of the time you will run with assault rifle and shotgun. Rest you will use rarely or try to avoid using them, because you will take damage that you will likely not avoid, because arena is too small. \nThere is barely any content, 5 acts, 4 stages each, with one act being finale boss fight. Yes, there is one single boss fight in this game and you know what? It's actually one of the easiest parts of the game, because arena is huge, you have space to avoid damage (unlike cheap level ending chapter before this stage) while boss mostly flies around and attacks from time to time. You just whale away on him with grenade launcher and rail gun and he's dead. It is braindead and unimaginitive, boss is just a flying pile of junk, literally.\n\nAs for the ending, Terminator reference with a \"twist\". \nAnd to tell you the truth, it sums up this game perfectly. It is just a middle finger straight to your face.\nBarely 3 hours and I'm left disappointed, because with more polish, it could've been great, but in the end of the day, it is a huge waste.", "timestamp_created": 1515463764, "timestamp_updated": 1515980703, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39148448": {"recommendationid": "39148448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093325346", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "last_played": 1515624407}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is FUN!

You can find secret skulls hidden in each levels but they only  unlock more difficulty levels.\n*Ennemies: The large majority of ennemies are human sized: a small blob of pixel in the middle of a pixel scenery, they don't spot you immediately but are dead accruate and can shoot you from offscreen, some can fly most don't, some fight with melee and leap or suicide themselves on top of you. The rest of the bestiary are bulletsponges consisting of floating robots with circular saw that go trought walls(your shots do'nt exept the railgun), larger cyborgs and police cars with missiles and rockets, and the final boss, thats it.\n*Weaponry: you can kick or chainsaw most ennemies into hooks and sawblades at the risk of getting damaged, shotgun works well close only, assault rifle is inacruate and run out of ammo quickly, flametrhower and grenade launcher can damage you and the railgun need to charge and chomp ammo like nothing.\nYour health and ammo pool is small and require caution yet the pickups the ennemies leave behind vanishes quickly and force you to allways jump forward, things get blurry when stuck in a room full of ennemies, you must move fast, shoot acruate with no margin of error.\n\nOverall, it 's the gameplay loop that tired me the most: I feel like I kept throwing myself at the level until I finally memorised all of its tricks only to get thrown to the next one and do the same thing all over again.

Look up in the disscussions page and you'll find a pinned message from the devs linking you to a video totorial.\nBloody good fun.", "timestamp_created": 1500316701, "timestamp_updated": 1500316701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33606475": {"recommendationid": "33606475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034306697", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 477, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500293282}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]A short but difficult, very-bloody 2D shooter.[/b]\n\nAll in-game commands are rebindable for both KB+M and a controller. If you get the hang of using a controller, the game actually becomes a bit easier due to the built-in auto-lock feature that turns on when you aim at an enemy's general direction. On KB+M, your aiming has to be more precise and it's even harder when most enemies are small on the screen. Both ways are very playable and just becomes a matter of preference on how it should be played.\n\nThe pixel art is very detailed, minus the actual character models. The protagonist and the enemies (save for the one boss in the game) are extremely small on-screen and have very little detail on them compared to the rest of the game's graphics. They're so small and lacking in detail that they can sometimes be hard to spot amidst the chaos and environment.\n\nThe sounds & music in the game are great. The music accentuates the overall theme of fast murdering and the sounds are pretty detailed from the various enemy screams to the weapons that actually sound like they have impact to them.\n\nThere's hardly a plot in the game. According to the Steam Store Page, you're a cyborg sent to purge what's left of humanity. Simple.\n\nConcept of the game's also simple, go from point A to point B to beat the level. There are 24 levels in total; 3 for demo/tutorial, 4 each for 5 areas, and 1 boss level. Most levels have you traversing whole paths while some just have you stay in one large area fighting waves of telegraphically spawned enemies until the game tells you you can proceed. Each level takes around 3-4 minutes on average to finish, but that's if you succeed. There are no checkpoints either, meaning that death results in starting the current level from the beginning. Enemy spawns and traps are always cued in some way but dealing with them still requires some skill.\nThe game's also designed for speedrunning thanks to the hidden movement mechanics like grenade jumping and bunny hopping. Some secret collectibles can only be obtained through these methods anyway.\n\nYou're given a lot of control over your character's movement. You can cancel jumps for a fast drop, bunnyhop, shotgun-boost, and so on. All this at your disposal for a variety of reasons but that's if you know how to even use them properly.\n\nIt's easy to die against anything here. Enemies however, telegraph their attacks with an exclamation mark on their heads that indicate they've spotted you and are about to attack, even the ones that are slightly off-screen. You always have enough time to avoid their incoming fire via strafing or jumping out of the way in case you can't fire at them for whatever reason. If you manage to land a bullet, kick, or chainsaw hit in on a common enemy, they get stunned for a second or two. If you're out of their vision for a while, they go back to \"patrolling\". All that said, there's usually a hefty amount of enemies surrounding you with attacks anyway, making the game as tough as it is with the enemy mechanics being one of the things that balances out the difficulty.\n\nThere are only six weapons throughout the entire game and they're all useful and feel powerful. The chainsaw though is useless for the most part but for anyone who really knows when to make use of it, it can save ammo when needed. Ammo pick-ups aren't too scarce but you can only carry so much of it that you've still got to make as many shots count as possible.\n\nThe game likes to advertise itself on how difficult it is. There are three difficulty settings available from the start, Hard, Harder, and Hardest. The \"easiest\" difficulty mode is \"Hard\" unless you download the free \"EASY MODE\" DLC. If you collect enough of the secret collectibles, you unlock the last difficulty option, Impossible. The change from Hard to Harder is that you have less health. The change from Harder to Hardest is that you can no longer find health and armor. And Hardest to Impossible has you have even less health. Other than those, the rest of the game is the same regardless of the difficulty setting.\nWhile I like the challenge in the game, I don't find that it gets much more fun the higher the difficulty you go. Because of the decrease in health and lack of health/armor, you've got to be more cautious and take the game more slowly. The music and overall tone of the game wants you to run & kill fast but the higher difficulty strongly discourages that. On Impossible difficulty, you're pretty much dead in just a few hits, telling you to take it even slower. The challenge is there but it strays from the pacing.\n\nA basic playthrough for a decent enough player may take 3-5 hours to beat. It's not a long game and the replayability isn't too large either, though it's there for those who just want a challenge. There's a level creation system with some new features that aren't in the base game for some reason. It's not very simple to use and there aren't a whole lot of user created levels on the Workshop right now.\nThe levels are fairly designed, the sounds & music are excellent, the graphics are great minus the character models, and it's as bloody & difficult as advertised.", "timestamp_created": 1500293106, "timestamp_updated": 1500295922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33601644": {"recommendationid": "33601644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291656516", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502500185}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.\n\nPros:\n\nMusic\nSound FX\nControls\nLevel Design\nVisuals\nChallenge\nWeapons\nViolence\n\nCons:\n\nNone\n\nDifficulty:\nI was on the fence about getting Butcher since I was concerned it might be too difficult. Butcher is very challenging and it is a very hard game. But, it's hard in a way that keeps you coming back for more. You have to think about how you can improve your strategy and react to enemy behavior. The game draws you back in after you take a break to regroup or calm your nerves from an intense session. Conquering a level feels like an accomplishment and pushes you on to continue fighting your way through stages. The lowest difficulty setting for Butcher is hard. I realized after beating it that there is DLC that unlocks a casual difficulty setting. I'd suggest attempting it with everything you have on hard mode. If you reach your wit's end and feel like throwing in the towel, give casual mode a whirl so that you can experience all of the levels and complete the game. Trust me, it's worth it either way.\n\nSimilarities:\nI'm a huge fan of Broforce. Butcher is similar to Broforce with its 2d pixelated graphics. Butcher allows for you to shoot diagnonally, whereas Broforce only lets you shoot directly in front of you. Broforce tends to focus more on comedy. Butcher is more intense and violent.\n\nCheckpoints:\nButcher does not have checkpoints. The game is designed for the player to survive a level in its entirety. At first this might seem off-putting or frustrating. But, part of the joy of the game is learning to manage your ammo and utilizing appropriate weapons for different types of enemies. Completing a level wouldn't be as rewarding if you could just inch your way through it with checkpoints.\n\nControls:\nThe controls in this game are smooth and responsive. This is good, because you must react quickly to enemies and move fast when pinned down. I used a PS4 controller and I recommend using a controller over a mouse/keyboard if you can. At times, your thumbs can get a bit sore from riding the analog sticks while aiming during intense battles. This is usually a sign that you need to take a break from the game and regroup.\n\nMusic:\nBesides the menu music which I wasn't that fond of, I absolutely loved the soundtrack for this game. It's textbook industrial with thumping beats and dark synthesizers. It really sets the mood and none of the stage music grated on me during repeated attempts at finishing levels. For the final boss battle, I tried turning off the music. Not because I didn't like it, but because I was trying to calm my nerves from the intensity of the music. It ended up helping a bit and I was able to calm down enough to focus on my attack strategy.\n\nWeapons:\nThe weapons are awesome in this game. You get a chainsaw, shotgun, assault rifle, flamethrower, grenade launcher, and rail gun. You become intimately familiar with how each weapon works and what kind of damage you can inflict on enemies. When you equip the rail gun, be sure and note that you can hold the fire button to charge the weapon for a more devastating blast. I was not initially aware that you could do this and I was firing it without a charge. This made some stages insanely difficult for me. I managed to make it through them after several tries and a lot of cursing, but it would have been so much easier had I known how to charge it.\n\nLevels:\nEach set of stages has a certain theme. You start off in an industrial complex, invade a military base, explore a jungle outpost, infiltrate a research lab in a volcano, and fight your way through a futuristic city that reminded me of Blade Runner. Most stages are linear and allow for exploration and platforming, but certain sections have arenas where you get locked in and have to fight enemies that appear out of thin air. The arenas are some of the most difficult aspects of the game, but these melees allow for you to hone your skills and dominate the sections that give you a little breathing room.\n\nCharacter Size:\nYour character is tiny. Even smaller than characters in Broforce. I would suggest playing this game on a big screen. I played the game on a projector displaying on an entire wall in my house. If you have a lot of screen real estate, you shouldn't have any trouble keeping tabs on your character and the intricacies of enemy movements. There's a lot going on in this game and you don't want to get lost squinting at pixels from across the room on a small screen. The game is also dark. This adds to the mood, but if you have too much contrast you might have trouble seeing the details of level environments.\n\nSkulls:\nSkulls seem to be hidden in walls and ceilings that seem completely out of reach. I scooped up a handful, but most I completely disregarded. Often times you are just trying to survive let alone worry about collecting extra goodies. I found myself hoarding ammo and health versus taking risks exploring levels for skulls. Maybe on subsequent play-throughs I'll take the time to try and hunt these down. But, for now, I was just relieved to survive the game on hard mode without rage quitting.\n\nTips:\nAs I said before, charge the rail gun. Take breaks from the game when you are overwhelmed. Take some time to think about your strategy and how you can improve. Part of the joy of this game is problem solving and self improvement. Find your rhythm. As you progress, your movements start to become more controlled and deliberate. Familiarize yourself with the capabilities of your weapons and use the best tool for the job. Conserve your ammo. Don't waste your bullets and try to focus on accurately aiming even when things get hectic. When you encounter characters without weapons, don't mow them over with the chainsaw if you have full health. Save them for later if you need a health boost. Take cover. Use the environment to your advantage and protect your character from taking damage out in the open. Don't give up! You can do this!\n\nConclusion:\nI honestly love everything about this game. If you love games like Broforce and are up for a challenge, you will love Butcher. I wish there were more quality run and gun platformers out there. 1st person shooters give me motion sickness, so for me this is the next best thing. It truly feels like a side scrolling Doom game and the sound of all the weapons mixed with the industrial soundtrack is exhilarating. It's damn fun to play and cathartic. Do yourself a favor and buy this rollercoaster ride of a game. I really don't think you'll regret it.

While taking obvious visual inspiration from Abuse (1996)'s dark and grimy run-and-gun action and the gory violence of Doom, Quake, and even Liero, the game still manages to create its own, entirely consistent low-resolution aesthetic. \nWhile this combination of grimy visual style and low pixel count may initially cause concerns regarding the ability to follow the game's difficult, fast-paced gameplay (a concern I shared when I first saw this game), Butcher utilizes well designed tells and bright/high contrast visual cues to allow players to effectively keep track of enemy alertness, status, and line of sight, as well as much-needed health and ammo pickups. \nThe game's Liero-inspired gore system works in perfect tandem with the game's aesthetic and gameplay - splashing, sticking, dangling and dripping all over each level (blood also remains after death, a feature that can be can be disabled in gameplay options) but thanks to good visual design, it never creates unneccessary difficulty by blending in with the enemies and clouding your line of sight. \nOn top of it all, Butcher's visuals really never seriously breaks the illusion of being a 96/97-era MS-DOS game. Everything appears palleted and consistent, even utilizing software-style hard lighting you'd often see from games in that era.\n\nThe good things continue with Butcher's gameplay. \nLike many games of the DOS shareware era this game is rooted in, Butcher divides its 21 levels into 5 differently-themed 'episodes' and a boss level. These are accessed through a Quake-style hub/gate level, and entry to each episode is unlocked upon completing the one prior. Levels are designed intuitively and you are usually given enough time to react to sudden traps and enemy reinforcements through both the game's inherent visual design and visible cues built into the level architecture. Traps and environmental hazards in each map can be effectively used against your enemies via the melee attack, and level layouts seem to be designed with both the players movement, weaponset and enemies in constant consideration. Secret areas are also scattered throughout, most of which containing health/ammo, a collectable robot skull, or both.\nEnemies are diverse and hard, but generally well-balanced, and almost all of them have a reaction time/grace period upon entering their line of sight, an alert/attack state, and a flinch/stun state when taking damage, all of which are accounted for in the game's level design and weaponset. Enemies will teleport in during lockdown/arena sections that are scattered throughout the levels, but a bright electrical effect will always appear where one is about to spawn, giving you enough to to zero in on them and cull them out before you get overwhelmed. On top of this, stronger enemies take noticably longer to spawn in during an arena battle, and have an easily-visible healthbar above their sprites, which makes it much more viable to prioritize them during a shootout.\n\nThe weapons are one of my favorite elements of Butcher, mostly due to the nuance in their design. The Abuse-style mouse-based aiming system is fluid and easy to use, and each weapon has a limited maximum ammo supply (with the exception of the starting chainsaw) as well as unique applications and situational usefulness throughout the game. \nThe chainsaw can be used very effectively in levels with tight corridors and/or platforms where you can easily get the drop on an enemy, since the chainsaw's rapid damage-rate forces them into what is essentially a stunlock and quickly kills them. It's also incredibly useful against melee enemies for this reason.\nThe shotgun is going to be a common mainstay since it has a ton of use in close-to-mid range combat. It has a incredibly grace period between shots, which is good for helping to get a lock on the next enemy without wasting much ammo.\nThe assault rifle is another weapon you'll find a lot of use from, especially in mid-long range where your shotgun isn't as effective, as well as situations where you need a quick rapid-fire weapon. However, firing this gun rapidly does cause a small amount of screenshake, which can be disorienting, so it's probably recommended to fire in bursts for best accuracy and ammo conservation.\nThe flamethrower is a short-range weapon that is effected by gravity and with flames that ride along the walls and floors, which is great for getting enemies around corners. Like most of the mid-upper tier weapons, certain higher strength enemies have a weakness to the flamethrower.\nThere are a few more weapons in the game than what I've just mentioned, but it's probably best you discover them on your own. It's also worth noting that, while enemies drop health and ammo, the limit on the amount of ammo you can carry at any time actively encourages you to switch sweapons and manage resources depending on the situation so that you don't run out during a hairy situation, an element glossed over in way too many old-school styled shooters these days.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic with a variety dark synth, ambient, and industrial-style tracks that are reminiscient of something inbetween Quake and Crusader: No Remorse, and it compliments the gameplay pretty damn well. The sound design in general is pretty well crafted and balanced.\n\nLong story short:\nThis game is great and you should get it, especially if you grew up on this kinda stuff back in the day.\nIt feels very sincere in its love for mid-90's games, but not at the cost of its own identity - and most importantly, it's fun.", "timestamp_created": 1498494170, "timestamp_updated": 1498494965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32814223": {"recommendationid": "32814223", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961234164", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485063770}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you enjoy oldschool fast-paced shooters like 'Quake' and 'Doom'?\nDo like the trial-and-error process of beating hard levels in hard-as-nails platformer games like 'Super Meat Boy'?\nDo you not care if a game does literally nothing innovative or new, as long as it's a good experience?\n\nIf you answered 'yes' to any of the above questions, then you probably [b]won't[/b] [i]hate[/i] 'BUTCHER'!\n\nHi, I'm Winterous, you might know me from other popular reviews, such as \"I don't have any examples to put here\".\nButcher is a game. It's a well made game. It's a well-designed game. It's a graphically pleasing game.\nIt's a game that is, overall, pretty good.\n\nThat's it. Graphics and theme aside (which are great) it does nothing new or interesting, it's pretty much just Quake in the form of a 2d platformer.\n\nYou need to go through the process of understanding the level, what you need to avoid, all that jazz; there's no way outside of blind luck to get through the game on the first try. Even when you know what to do, it's pretty difficult to execute it without getting hurt.\n\nIt's a hard game, it's a ruthless game, it will make you replay the same level over and over before you finish it, and again several times if you're trying to find the secrets; but it is, overall, a good, solid, well-made game. If you want something new, it's probably not for you.\n\nAnd that's a good TL;DR: There's nothing NEW about 'BUTCHER', there's nothing SPECIAL about 'BUTCHER', it's [i]just[/i] a solid, well made game, with very nice low-res pixel art.", "timestamp_created": 1498482539, "timestamp_updated": 1498482616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32789429": {"recommendationid": "32789429", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972411610", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504228173}, "language": "english", "review": "Delicious carnage...", "timestamp_created": 1498426115, "timestamp_updated": 1498426115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32725209": {"recommendationid": "32725209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064893270", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498250802}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Pros :[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Beatiful retro-styled graphics.\n    [*]Amazing soundtrack.\n    [*]Low requirements to run the game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons :[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]The game is brutally hard, because of bullshit game mechanics. For example, enemies teleport from nowhere, forcing the player to memorize their spawn patterns. It's not fun because it's hard, it's bad because it's hard.\n    [*]The game is mocking you for choosing \"casual\" mode. Enemies have a lot longer respond time, deal less damage, and have less health. This is not \"casual\" mode, it's easy mode.\n    [*]In my opinion, the only thing fun and kind of thrilling about the game is it's difficulty. The game does not look gory, at least not as gory as Hotline Miami for example. Playing BUTCHER is only fun in the first level, then you get the middle finger in the form of a difficulty spike.\n    [*]The game has no story.

In comparison to other brutal games, like Doom or Hotline Miami, their stories are more complex than BUTCHER's : The games have characters, bad guys, good guys etc.\n[/list]\n\nIn conclusion, I do not recommend BUTCHER to any gamer that loves gore or challenges.

Writing this review after beating Impossible mode and F%king the world ultimately.\n\nThis is a game where remembering what is about to happen really helps, and what kind of weapons are best suited for the situation. Lobbing a grenade on your way down a pit to gib some hostiles, flaming a cluster guards, scattering a victim with your shotgun, railing a rowdy bunch with your rail gun through a wall or \"stealthy\" dispatching unsuspecting foes with a chainsaw, every weapon has a purpose it excels at.\n\nAs for the games claim of \"The easiest mode is 'Hard' \", that is true. Once you get used to the game, though, it is not so hard. After completing the game on that mode, you may realize that \"hard\" was not enough, and jump straight to \"hardest\" like I did. With the experience form \"hard\" mode, you can bravely storm each level, caring less about hiding behind precious cover and instead decimating your foes before they can react. \"Impossible\" mode is a real treat. After getting a taste of that, you will be wanting to beat the game at that difficulty, which is not as scary as you would expect.\n\nIn mechanics, this is a solid game. The only glitches I have encountered (which have been noticed while playing \"Impossible\" mode) is that there are times when the player will get snagged while dropping from or jumping up to a solid ledge. The other minor glitch (experienced only once) occurs only in death, when you and the boss of the game die at the same time. The level will not automatically reset after a second or two, and so you must exit to the menu manually.\nBig, fancy traps are advertised for the game, but they are mostly used against you. Rarely do you get to use those special traps on your enemies, so I feel that cuts back on the game slightly.\n\nThis game was a 10/10. It felt extremely satisfying being able to beat it, since I rarely, if ever, like a game so much that I want to beat it in the most Impossible way possible. Seeing blood fly and paint the walls red as split bodies flew through the air, playing \"skeet shooting\" by kicking meat toys and blasting them apart with the shotgun, just loved it.

Your goal is to exterminate the remainder of humanity. You, as the ruthless and emotionless cyborg are responsible for decimating, decapitating, eviscerating, mutilating and destroying anything that moves and even remotely resembles living flesh and matter. Ready up your weapons and dust off your sensors since Mother is sending you to the nearest orbiting space station close to Earth to fulfill your purpose.\n\n- Graphics -\nBasic 2D side scroller\nGory, flashy, heavily \"retro\" stylized\nOverall brown-greyish colour palette with red/yellow/InsertGlowyColourHere highlights\nHas some stylized fog and lighting effects\n\n- Sound -\nThe guns sound good, all of them pack a punch and you can hear it\nMusic is good, especially the track from the trailers, it just fits the game so well! :)\nGore sounds meaty as fuck, I likey!\n\n- Gameplay -\nThe game plays like a bastard child of DOOM and Soldat.\nYou move your cyborg with WASD while shotting and aiming in all directions with your mouse.\nThe game has the following weapons, in order of obtaining them : \n1 chainsaw\n2 shotgun\n3 assault rifle\n4 flamethrower\n5 granade launcher\n6 railgun\nThe game has basically 8 enemy types, they are as follows - ninja, guy with whatever weapon, jetpack guy with whatever weapon, flying snake thing with a sawblade on a chain (?), big tanky guy with homing rockets, flying cop car shooting rockets, piranhas or whatever those fish are, cheetah/tiger thing.\n\n- Level Design -\nThe game consists of a hub space station with teleporters to each chapter and the final boss.\nEach chapter has 4 levels, there are 5 chapters + boss. So there are 20 levels + 1 boss room at the end.\nLevels have a lot of environmental hazards such as saw blades, moving saw blades, saw blade spiders, spikes, drops, holes, lava, fire, crushing blocks etc etc. The levels follow a basic pattern of connecting rooms with corridors, then locking you in a room where you have to defeat enemies to progress. In those situations the game starts spawning enemies all around you and your goal is to survive.\n\nSo overall... would I recommend the game? Yeah but probably on a sale and ONLY if you are like me and you like games with a lot of gore, chaotic fast paced action and - in this case - in 2D side scrolling platformer setting.\nYou will die a lot in this game because you will get surprised by spawns. You need to learn them to beat the levels. Weapons will feel a bit stale and run of the mill, nothing different or exotic. You will try to cheese the game by shooting enemies through walls with your railgun because you can, because that's the optimal way to play it and after you've finished the game you will think to yourself \"That's it?\".\n\nI wish there were more weapons. I wish there were more enemies. More distinguishable map variety. Maybe a different spawn system, random level generator so you can replay the game over and over for the fast paced craziness and gore.\nI refuse to replay the same levels over and over just to get that cool kick from the gore and such, maaaybe for the achievments if I feel desperate enough and I have absolutely nothing better to do that day...\n\nWhile playing the game I kept thinking \"It would be cool to have this gore and shooting in some rogue lite\". Maybe expand on the universe, anything to flesh the game out some more.\n\nGet it on a sale, if anything.\nThanks for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1494277203, "timestamp_updated": 1494277203,

That'll teach me to trust those.\n\nIt's kind of a 2D Painkiller, you very often get locked in arenas and enemies spawn around you leaving you a split-second to react. Well, it's like Painkiller if you always wished that Painkiller made you jump around on platforms all the time while trying to shoot enemies... more on this below. The game [b]absolutely doesn't give you a Doom or Quake feeling[/b], that part of the game description is misleading.\n\nPros:\n\n- Loads of blood and gore, cool fire and lighting effects, satisfying gun sounds\n- Nice parallax backgrounds\n- Shooting with the mouse, a rare feature I've missed from platformers like Abuse and Soldat.\n\nCons:\n\n- One hand being busy with the mouse means that jumping and dropping from platforms is on the same hand as moving left and right, so jumping will be awkward no matter how you configure controls. The problem is that there's a lot of jumping around AND jumping down platforms required to avoid fire or being stabbed to death in the aforementioned arena, so expect a lot of awkardness and unnatural straining of your left hand. This might actually be better with a controller, haven't tried yet, but then you give up on the precision mouse shooting.\n\nMouse shooting worked in Abuse because the emphasis was on the shooting, not platforming, and you didn't need a \"get down from platform\" button. It worked in Soldat because it was a PvP game with a limited number of human enemies and a relatively methodical pace, not a horde game.\n\nIf this game had only solid platforms you cannot traverse downwards (think Super Metroid for those who never played Abuse) it would already be much better off because it would have one less platforming button to worry about. In that sense the game is let down by its level design.\n\n- [b]Game makes you worry about clips and reloading[/b], definitely not a feature of the games it claims to be inspired by. There are no good visual clues for that (and you wouldn't have time to look at them anyways, see: jumping around), so you have to count your shots or rely on sound... or most likely, try to take a shot and have the gun not react and reload instead, while the enemy shoots you in the face. In this kind of frantic shooter it's more of a stupid distraction, Doom and Quake lacked reloading for a good reason, not because the technology didn't allow it.\n\n- [b]Very pixelated, hard to see brown enemies on a brown background[/b]. Distinctions between foreground and background objects are badly indicated, you have to learn by trying to go through stuff or most likely, by being shot at through stuff. Doesn't go great with the following point.\n\n- Weapons don't have a max range (similar to Soldat in that sense) and AI enemies are programmed to shoot with full accuracy, so you constantly get shot from the other side of the screen or through a tiny gap between two obstacles by enemies you barely see. Limiting ranges or making all platforms block fire would have made the action more in-your-face.\n\n- Very difficult as advertised, only it has some very obnoxious enemies that teleport to you and nearly instakill you if you don't react. Unless you have insane reflexes you're likely to get very frustrated by those. Again, this was not a feature of Doom/Quake or any good shooter I remember, for that matter.\n\n- You play the bad guy. Meh. I prefer playing the good guys.\n\n- \"Community\" or those responsible for over-hyping are a bunch of friggin' foaming at the mouth elitists who put down anyone who dares criticize the game (just wait for the comment section below, that should be proof enough). Basically game's a magnet for antisocial teenagers in need of validation.\n\nMight give it another shot since I exceeded the refund time anyways, but this whole pretending to be Doom or Quake-inspired and then locking you up in arenas left a bad taste in my mouth and tipped the review in the negative.", "timestamp_created": 1493206270, "timestamp_updated": 1493208253, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595161", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31333472": {"recommendationid": "31333472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061974601", "num_games_owned": 583, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515218949}, "language": "english", "review": "Ohhhh that's how I like it ... silly fast, chaotic, full of blood, over the top and with an industrial soundtrack.\nThis game puts a smile on my face.\n\nYes it's difficult, you'll find yourself trying the same level 20-30 times, but it's not frustrating: the levels design is relatively fair and well thought.\nThe engine is stable, the controls are responsive, runs perfectly on Linux, there are nice Steam cards, funny achievements, a great level editor, Steam workshop integration (additional levels), speedrun mode, a delicious soundtrack and the Devs are dedicated and supportive.\n\nIt's a little short but frequently on sale, for once I wouldn't mind getting some DLC\nand local co-op would be the icing on the cake ;)", "timestamp_created": 1493009316, "timestamp_updated": 1493009316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645825", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31330337": {"recommendationid": "31330337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044099345", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1516149216}, "language": "english", "review": "A game for cynical people.", "timestamp_created": 1492990622, "timestamp_updated": 1512090089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31328932": {"recommendationid": "31328932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107948716", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514725695}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game, with very interesting gameplay, design and story.\nCan't complete level?

(but it becomes easier with a controller, this will be explained farther down) This game is brutal in the damage that is done to your spritely murder machine, the bodies of your spritely enemies, and to your mental health as you die time and time again (if you are at maximum difficulty that is). Also brutal are the manners your enemies die in. Any that are on the ground wounded will still be screaming until they finish bleeding or until you stomp, shoot, burn, cut, or explode the life out of them. While that is happening blood will seep into the walls and floors, arenas will be absolutly splattered with blood high and low. While the characters might look ugly and under detailed, the art overall is great. The atmosphere itself is heavy with ill omens, the very air is pregnant with the threat of violence, and open rooms lie still, silently waiting to be interupted by screaming. All one must do is press that pulsing red button.\n\nYet I do not believe I have said enough just yet. You play as a killing machine sent to Earth to finish the humans off to the last man. Each section you leave blows up insuring every human in the area dies, and that is after you go through four levels of killing everyone in your way to the exit. You engage the carnage with a chainsaw and a shotgun and aquire more weaponry as you progress. Nothing that has not been in a game before, but it all works wonderfully (that sounds screwed up).  These weapons are all capable of reducing humans to chunks, put enough bullets from the assault rifle into someone and they will be eviscerated, or if you do not sometimes they will just be blown in half... with their intestines still connecting the two parts (remember these are pixel graphics we are seeing, still oddly satisfying... yeah I know violence, I am writing this review for a reason). Now commiting this violence can be made easier with a controller (here we have arrived as promised) because there is auto-aim. Which can actually help with the immersion as you are playing as a robot, it makes sense to have near perfect accuracy allowing you to snap to targets quickly. The entire game can easily be played with a controller (though the final boss can be a bit of a pain as the auto-aim really loves holding onto it) but you will want to experiment with your own bindings.\n\nMany times you will be in a large, open room with the exit blocked. To continue the big glowey button of victim summoning must be pressed to start a screaming murder party. Once you get used to these areas you can only feel tense anticipation as you know what is about to happen. You can just feel it adding more to the already dim atmosphere as the music continues to add. The tracks range from ominus build-up to metal action. The music is done well and is a worthy contribution to this short, dark scene of rampage. Alas the game is short but maybe the developer will add more, or maybe the community will as there is now a level editor with a direct link to Steam Workshop. Yet it is all so satisfying that I do not just want to play it again, I want to tear through it.\n\nImagine BUTCHER as a small paint bucket filled up to the brim with carnage at a reasonable price, it will only coat a small section of your library, but damn it looks good. If this has enticed your shooter appetite then I can only recommend you stop reading and purchase it.

El punto de mira de este juego se puede comparar a un eje general en la jugabilidad: cualquier acci\u00f3n y desarrollo ya sea incluso inverso pasa por el eje.\n\nButcher es de punter\u00eda y movilidad y los personajes ser\u00e1n peque\u00f1os para poder llevar a la pr\u00e1ctica un buen campo de tiro que tiene que representar una medida de distancia v\u00e1lida junto a los \u00e1ngulos y trayectorias. El juego tiene un sistema bastante comprendido de esto y pr\u00e1cticamente ser\u00e1 lo \u00fanico potenciado y expuesto en la jugabilidad. La movilidad se representa por un escenario de plataformas, el salto y una semiprogresi\u00f3n por el escenario.\n\nLo bueno empieza ahora y es que te das cuenta que los enemigos tienen una IA y un sistema para detectar bastante parecido a como lo hace el personaje principal. El sistema de detenci\u00f3n pasa porque todos o casi todos est\u00e1n preparados para atacar, y aunque uno est\u00e9 de espaldas, al oir algo, necesitar\u00e1 menos de un segundo para dispararte.

When you hit an enemy they get stunned for a brief moment, giving you just enough time to duck behind a ledge, grab a health pickup, etc.\n\nEach level has a unique layout, so I didn't feel like I had to play through any repetitive designs. All of the five areas (4 levels each) are set in different locations, so each place gives off a certain feel when playing through it. Notable levels are the jungle and the city, both of which had a distinct style. All of this kept the visuals interesting to look at, (or at least for me)\n\nThe level editor seems to be well made. It features pretty much every texture used in the campaign, a neat node-based scripting system (basic triggers, spawners, doors, arenas, lights, etc), and two layers to put tiles on (background, and foreground). It even has workshop support!\n\nIt might be considered a short game to some (21 levels total), but for the price it felt totally worth it.

Don't take that to mean it's a ripoff or a clone, though. No, despite its obvious influences, Butcher is a beast all its own.\n\nYou play as a cyborg robot thing. You're sent to a dystopian version of Earth with one mission and one mission only: exterminate all remaining life on the planet. Think Terminator as directed by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nWith that setup, you are thrown into the first level armed with a chainsaw and shotgun. There are no tutorials or anything, but thankfully, Butcher is an easy to learn, extremely tough to master game. The game is actually a 2D side scroller, and your character is surprisingly fragile even on the lowest difficulty (which, as the tagline boasts, is Hard). This means there's a very strong emphasis on using cover and knowing where to be in the given level. It's a strong mix of platforming and twitch based shooting, best experienced with a mouse and keyboard if you ask me, because this game pulls no punches.\n\nIn addition to being what is possibly the bloodiest game since Hotline Miami 2 (bodies explode into chunks and blood on death, you can impale enemies on meat hooks scattered throughout the environment, and the sound effects are approrpiately squishy), this is one of the toughest games in recent memory. You will die. A lot. Simple as that. Even near the beginning, when you're still new to the game, it does not go easy on the player. Enemies can and will kill you in just a few hits, so you need to be light on your feet. Thing is though, you can't just spray and pray. You need to be precise, because even when your weapon is maxed out with ammo, you can run out in a sticky situation faster than you'd think. There's this constant juggling of being safe from hamr and being able to hit your enemies while keeping as much ammo as possible that gives the game unbelieveable tension.\n\nThankfully, you gain one new weapon per worly, with standards like the shotgun and assault rifle, to more effective weapons like a grenade launcher and a railgun, which can be charged and fired through walls. May as well mention the last weapon, which is a flamethrower. Good for crowd control. \n\nEach level is well designed and takes full advantage of their settings to produce some fun and difficult gimmicks. One of my favorite levels in the game is in the Volcano research base. There are two halves to the area. Enemies will come in the side you're on, but after a time limit, the room will fill with lava and you need to hurry to the other side and repeat the process. Defeat a wave of enemies before the lava rises and some replenishing items will appear. There's plenty more creative and fun things like that throughout the twenty one levels.\n\nBy the end, you're going to feel like a much more accomplished gamer, because the situations this game throws at you are absolutely insane. By the end, each level will feature wave after wave of enemies all hell bent on killing you. Meanwhile, cover is rarer and rarer. You'll die so much, it should make you throw your computer. Thankfully, this game does have what I like to call \"The Hotline Miami Method;\" when you die, you reappear almost instantly at the beginning of the level. But levels are short, which means you never have to rreplay huge chunks at a time.\n\nButcher isn't for everyone due to its rather extreme (but over the top) violence and absolutely insane difficulty level. But if you enjoy both those things, this is a required play, as it is the good kind of difficulty. The kind where you could theoretically get through the entire game without taking a hit with enough practice, akin to the aforementioned Hotline Miami and Super Meat Boy. I personally loved it, though, and rather than getting frustrated, I moreso found myself saying \"Just one mroe try\" with each death. And before I knew it, hours had gone by. Bloody hours.

It took me about 2 hours and seven minutes to complete on the easiest dificulty (Hard) and it left me with some good clutch memories. \n\nSome good things!\n\nThe background art really helps contribute to the atmosphere of the game. In all the zones I could tell they put good time and thought into level design.\n\nSomething this game does very well is make you use all of your weapons. Since ammo management is key and they don't give infinite of it, you must make sure to swap weapons regularly so you can be prepered for something new.\n\nThe developers are working on the game still and just recently they added a level editor with workshop support. I spent some time in the edditor and you can do a lot which I find very exciting. I hope people will be able to create custom campains for people to work on.

It's about using everything at your disposal--chainsaws and railguns, blade traps and crushers, speed and level exploits--to crush an enemy that's quite adept at crushing you.  \n\nThe difficulty and aesthetics are an obvious nod to the 90's, but the movement exploits are perhaps just as important:  Using your chainsaw in unexpected ways to launch yourself across the map or bunnyhop to otherwise unreachable locations; rocket-jumping with the grenade launcher; blazing past enemies as you attempt to crush speedrun records and collect hidden skulls that are often in obscure or time-sensitive locations.  It should all feel distinctly nostaligic to anybody familiar with the murky brown hues of nonsensical industrial sprawls and lava pits.    \n\nAt 21 levels and a speedrun goal of 45 minutes (though the average player will likely spend 2-3 hours on their first run), BUTCHER never overstays its welcome, although it encourages you to revisit levels to uncover secrets, improve speedrun times, and even reattempt runs at higher difficulties.  There's a small assortment of weapons, a decent mix of enemies (ranging from noncombatants to cyberdemon-like cyborgs and mutant wildcats), and some great sound effects.  \n\nTL;DR:  BUTCHER is a short but challenging game that will likely appeal to anybody who was raised on games like Quake, Contra, and Crusader (or anybody who might think those games are the bees' knees).  \n\nPROS:\n+ Perfect length for a game, but lots of replayability for those craving more\n+ Weapons are distinct and useful; enemies are diverse and challenging\n+ Great sound effects and an OST that fits perfectly\n\nCONS;\n- Even with the small (6) selection of weapons, switching weapons can be frantic and awkward on a controller because you have to scroll up/down through everything until you find what you're looking for.  \n- A few of the hidden skulls are in areas that require pretty bullshitty techniques (that you may otherwise never use) to reach \n- Aesthetically solid, but perhaps a little too far on the \"tiny\" side of things.  It would have been nice for the art style to accomodate a LITTLE more detail in characters and weapons.\n- The sole boss fight is alright, but the game could have definitely used 1 or 2 more unique boss fights to mix things up.", "timestamp_created": 1484515597, "timestamp_updated": 1484515849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29233207": {"recommendationid": "29233207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010084548", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495823648}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Roligt spel, hade l\u00e4st att det var riktigt sv\u00e5rt och k\u00f6pte det mot b\u00e4ttre vetande, har spelat m\u00e5nga timmar och har kommit bara till level 3.

But on the other hand I've sneaking and being careful to be no more or less a valid option.\n\nA common description I've seen people give this title is \"DOOM As a platformer!\" and whilst I do understand it, I feel like both of those games at the core flow in a much different manner. \n\nThe game is challenging, with decent level design, challenging gameplay, chunky weapons, decent audio acrossed the board, and a pretty gritty feeling retro aesthetic that suits the game well.\n\nI'd say in looking for complaints, one area I'd persobally point to are this games traps, they're devious and annoying. Unless you've played and died from it before, you'll tend to kick the bucket as this game has a bit if trial and error. Tied with the fact death forces you to completely restart the level, it can definitely get annoying. Regardless of this games difficulty, and even cheap nature at times, rarely did I find myself getting frustrated, and even then I wasn't enraged. ( again I haven't finished the game yet so the cheapness may get worse, but I cant say as of yet. \n\nSo yes, as of right now, I'd recomend it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482911359, "timestamp_updated": 1482911359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28738011": {"recommendationid": "28738011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011866221", "num_games_owned": 639, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509418966}, "language": "english", "review": "I kicked a guy into lava.\n\nI kicked a guy into a hook.\n\nI kicked a guy on a jetpack, shot him, made his fuel explode and burn the dude behind.\n\nThen I jumped over another jetpack dude and kicked him down into lava. \n\nWho needs guns?\n\nI do.\n\nOh yeah and lmao when the enemies guts come out, get stuck and they \"hang out\" with you.\n\nOr they are killed basically but still alive in a lore type sense and screaming and bleeding and then you kick them around to paint the walls a fresher coat of red.", "timestamp_created": 1482897554, "timestamp_updated": 1482897664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28726248": {"recommendationid": "28726248", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993556585", "num_games_owned": 998, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513513737}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u044f \u0431\u044b \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b. 10 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1482871551, "timestamp_updated": 1482871551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28720546": {"recommendationid": "28720546", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975876281", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505147863}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet, contains exactly what it says on the tin.", "timestamp_created": 1482861264, "timestamp_updated": 1482861264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28695177": {"recommendationid": "28695177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152883018", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508585827}, "language": "russian", "review": "My ideal of pixel games! but need rpg elements i think, and more levels ofcourse  :d", "timestamp_created": 1482804099, "timestamp_updated": 1482808787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458062", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28694179": {"recommendationid": "28694179", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969017846", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499991005}, "language": "english", "review": "Really cool game.

The times I got stuck in this game, I succeeded through tedious trial and error. I don't feel like there's much of a skill arc, nor is there a whole lot to learn from beyond sharpening your aim. Take Nuclear Throne for example: sure, aim is a huge deal\u2014but equally important are upgrade picks, learning how to use your character, and navigating a level effectively. All of these skills contribute to how far you progress into your \"run\". This game is almost solely based around reflex. I wanted to enjoy it, but after a while the whole \"keep griding until you finally beat the level\" gameplay style is annoying, and I don't feel there's a whole lot I can do to get better beyond playing more.\n\nIdk, maybe I'm just impatient.

There is minor platforming that takes place in the game but its much subdued in favor of precision aiming and deadly combat. Its not just that either, the level design, the health bar and general hud, the level hub, the end level screen were it display's the number of enemies killed and the secrets you've collected, and especially the industrial and oppresive atmosphere, it all comes together to form this feeling in your mind that your playing a first person shooter masquerading as a 2d one. \n\nButcher one ups those 90's shooters in the gore department with its genuinely impressive blood physics system. Blood splatters on to walls and spills on to floors, drips off of platforms onto the ground below, enemies scream and cry out as they slowly die if shot non-fatally, you can chew enemies in half with your weapons splaying their intestines all over the floor, enemies can be drowned, fed to piranhas impaled on hooks crushed and exploded into gibs, popped like cherries, the list goes on and on, it gives it a flair and brutality that accentuates the high difficulty, and this game is HARD son, I remember when I started my first play through on \"hard\" difficulty (The lowest difficulty btw) when I was in the forest area I thought to myself \"shit man how am I even going to beat this game.\" but as you play and learn the behavior of the enemies and hone your reflexes and improve your aim, you can feel yourself getting better and better until you finally beat it, and then its time to start on the next difficulty level, Its cool to think back to how I was having such trouble with just hard and now I'm on my third play through on Hardest. The key is not to give up or relent, don't let the game win, its like beating your head against a brick wall until it breaks but each time you hit it your blows get stronger and harder, you get better at it. Its a real accomplishment to make a game like this where you feel a sense of progression merely from honing your skills rather than leveling up skills or something like that.\n\nThe soundtrack is a really special thing, if I could describe it I would say it resembles a mix between the ambient industrial nine inch nails soundtrack of quake with something more fast and nearly break-beat like.

Todos los niveles tienen un climax, donde el reto se vuelve mas intenso, generando un ritmo muy variado a pesar de la corta duraci\u00f3n de los niveles.\n\nA pesar de ser un juego exigente, es muy pero muy corto. Se termina en 3-4 horas y en general la sensaci\u00f3n es que el contenido es muy poco o no se termina de explotar.

I don't want to feel patronised for the first few levels, I want it to show me what to expect and what I've got myself in for!\n\nThe pixel animation is beautifully done and the response to your input is pretty much 1:1 which makes really really satisfiying when you blast something to kingdom come.

So I pressed escape to be greeted with a flashing sign saying \"this game is running too slowly, please change the video settings\". \n\nOK fair enough, I lowered resolution. Nothing, Lowered again. Same thing. Went down to the lowest setting and still got the same results. As you can imgaine, I wasn't happy. This system will run CSGO without a hitch, but yet a pixel game if failing. \n\nSo I went on to message the developer (Sebastian) with a letter of disgust, saying something along th lines of \" why on earth wont this pixel game work on a high end system running Linux\" I think I even asked for a refund.\n\nWith in a few minutes I got a reply from Sebastian giving me a few pointers and asking me to enable debug mode to see what FPS I was getting. \n\nI reply with my reuslts and after a few back and forth emails Sebastian sent me a DRM free version of the game that was an updated version, for me to test. Unfortunately, this version had the same issues.\n\nWithin minutes I was sent an email containing 3 versions of the game which he kindly asked me to test. Which I was more than happy to oblige. \n\nWe emailed back and forth with me supplying me results and him narrowing down issues to get the best version working for me. It didn't take long until all issues had been resolved and the game was running perfectly.", "timestamp_created": 1478117416, "timestamp_updated": 1478117416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26362258": {"recommendationid": "26362258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177984381", "num_games_owned": 782, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483032179}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00d3timo jogo, o ruim \u00e9 que quando tu morre tu volta no come\u00e7o do mapa...\n\nQUE RAIVA", "timestamp_created": 1478033920, "timestamp_updated": 1478033920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26362249": {"recommendationid": "26362249", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961474652", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500908093}, "language": "polish", "review": "Krwawa, dopracowana strzelanka w starym stylu.

I don't really have a good intro, so I'm just going to launch right into my points.\n\nBUTCHER is essentially DOOM if DOOM were a 2-D platformer, with a nice variety of guns, lots of diverse enemies, health that goes up to 200% of what you start with, and tons of gore. It's also really hard, but I'll get into that later. The plot is fairly simple: you are some sort of futuristic Terminator (that is to say, a Terminator) who has been sent for whatever reason to the last human colony to render humanity extinct by killing everyone you find as messily as possible. A simple setup, yes, but one with much potential.\n\nThe game does a lot of things really well. The weapons each have their niche, and all feel good to use. The enemies are similarly diverse, with each providing their own challenges and having their own weaknesses and quirks. The sound design is almost haunting at times, and everything sounds like it's in pain. The game controls well, which is necessary when things get tense. There are 26 levels in total (some of them entirely built around a single puzzle or theme, which I always enjoy), making the game about as long as it needs to be without drawing things out too much. The gore is stupendous, and is persistent between deaths, allowing one to paint entire levels with blood. The pixel art is some of the best I've ever seen; in scenes set in space, I would occasionally just sit and marvel at how good everthing looked. The art on the gore is similarly high-quality; if you run your chainsaw when there are no enemies around, blood will splatter onto surrounding walls and floors in almost realistic fashion. You can also kick people onto hooks on the end of chains for an ammo-free instakill, which I want in more games now that I know it exists. The gameplay itself is adrenaline-soaked hair-trigger fun, as you run around and try to shoot anything that moves before it takes away a third of your health. It's a wonderful experience.\n\nHowever, BUTCHER is not without its flaws. The inclusion of fall damage doesn't really make sense in a non-realistic 2-D platformer, and the chainsaw does surprisingly little damage and doesn't really do anything that the kick can't do better. Secrets are hidden throughout levels, but if you die after collecting one you have to get it again, which can be annoying after a while. There are also 5 different worlds, but the first one, the Ironworks, fits best with the gameplay and theme (feverish intensity and angry reds, oranges, and browns) by a wide margin, making the other areas seem like a letdown by comparison. At one point, the fourth world just gives up on its aesthetic and copies the Ironworks because it's so much more fun.\n\nThese are minor problems, however, compared with the game's main issue: difficulty. The game is advertised as hard, and it certainly is. I have no problem with a game being hard. However, a difference exists between high difficulty and bullshit, and BUTCHER crosses into bullshit far too often. Difficulty is fair, while bullshit is not. Randomized elements that matter, hazards that a player going through a section for the first time could not predict or avoid, and mandatory loss of health are all bullshitty things to do, and BUTCHER utilizes the second in particular quite often, causing many frustrating moments. This, coupled with the fact that dying means one has to restart the entire level (which isn't bullshit, but still is never a good idea and doesn't make a game harder, just more tedious), means that one can spend hours on a particularly difficult section without any progress, or even a fairly easy section locked behind a much bullshittier one, and that doesn't reflect well on the game at all. \n\n(I'm not saying that people aren't allowed to make bullshitty games. Go ahead! But when you do, you lose the right to say that your game is for \"hardcore gamers,\" because it's not. Bullshitty games are only for people with way to much time on their hands and/or a high tolerance for frustration, like me.)\n\nBUTCHER has problems, yes, but past those problems is a really, really solid game. The combat works well, the art is excellent, the music's good, the gore is gratuitous, and the achievements are mostly references to 80s action films. If you're willing to put up with some stupid design choices, it's definitely worth a purchase.\n\nTL;DR BLOOD, GRISTLE, AND SWEAT", "timestamp_created": 1477093598, "timestamp_updated": 1477093943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26136263": {"recommendationid": "26136263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051650126", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496426537}, "language": "english", "review": "Fights in [i]BUTCHER[/i] regularly involve being outnumbered by enemies that can deal tons of damage in a single hit (if not kill you outright). Ammo, while plentiful, is just a little bit tighter than what many 2D shooter players are used to. Health and armor pickups are hard earned, and the highest difficulties take them out altogether, demanding a near-perfect playthrough on each level. And when you inevitably get blown into chunks of meat and steel, you're sent back to the start of the level - no checkpoints, no quicksaves. As developers Transhuman Design is quick to remind players, [I]BUTCHER[/I] is hard.\n\nAnd it's true. [i]BUTCHER[/i]'s dynamics are not the same as typical shooters like [i]Contra[/i], [i]Metal Slug[/i], or even Crack Dot Com's [i]Abuse[/i], [I]BUTCHER[/I]'s closest ancestor. Enemies take aim as soon as they can see you, and their fast bullets and homing rockets require quick reflexes to dodge into and out of cover. The 360 degree mouse aiming demands precision that most 2D shooters don't, giving a playstyle closer to something like [i]Quake[/i] (which also fits the trickjumping and speedrunning that the game offers, along with the oppressively monochrome, ultraviolent atmosphere). Your NES-era shooter skills will come up a bit short for what this game asks for.\n\nBut I think it's important to also state that [I]BUTCHER[/I] is, at its core, fair. Enemies warn you when they're about to fire, and they can't target you if you can't see them. If you hit an enemy but don't manage to kill them, they get stunned long enough for you to either finish them off or get behind cover before they shoot back. There is always enough ammo to do your job, and your chainsaw with infinite gas isn't there for nothing. The AI is predictable, the levels are learnable, and the difficulty is absolutely possible.\n\nInterestingly, these mechanics make [I]BUTCHER[/I] feel like a 2D crossbreed of [i]Quake[/i] and [i]Time Crisis[/i], creating a tight and tense game of jumping, ducking, and slaughtering that grabbed me from the moment I filled a man with enough buckshot to make him writhe helplessly on the floor and gurgle on his own blood before slicing into his screaming partner until his intestines roped out of him like a mass of unraveling, dripping meat.\n\nIt's fun.", "timestamp_created": 1477000966, "timestamp_updated": 1477419477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26134644": {"recommendationid": "26134644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970576349", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1515430238}, "language": "english", "review": "BUTCHER...\n\n...is the TOTALLY BRUTAL, BLOOD-SLATHERED SIDE-SCROLLER YOU ALWAYS WANTED. \n\nBuy it yesterday.\n\nIt's brutal.", "timestamp_created": 1476992895, "timestamp_updated": 1476992895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26131674": {"recommendationid": "26131674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119557024", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499095488}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good fast action game just to wind down with", "timestamp_created": 1476981336, "timestamp_updated": 1476981336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26127506": {"recommendationid": "26127506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027022941", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501870027}, "language": "english", "review": "+gore\n+gore\n+gore\n+gore\n+gore \n+gore\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1476959886, "timestamp_updated": 1477006304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488503", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26115964": {"recommendationid": "26115964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292588117", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476887921}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "- sangrento\n- dificuldade elevada\n- jogo 8 bits que roda suave at\u00e9 em pc da xuxa\n- divertido\n- tem uma MOTOSERRA\n\nconclus\u00e3o=COMPRE!\n\n( ps = com certeza vc se tornar\u00e1 um tanto psicopata dps desse jogo )", "timestamp_created": 1476888420, "timestamp_updated": 1476888420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26101352": {"recommendationid": "26101352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102013547", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500312525}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes yes.

El juego es realmente dificil y las primeras horas es un poco desesperante la cantidad de veces que se llega a morir. Una vez te haces con la mecanica del juego, sigue siendo dificil pero se nota que podemos ir avanzando con algo mas de soltura, utilizando el entorno y sobretodo sincronizando nuestros movimientos con los timings de disparo de los enemigos.\n\nEs un juego que penaliza mucho los errores pudiendo convertir una partida casi perfecta en un desastre, por un peque\u00f1o despiste. Esto hace que el juego sea muy muy adictivo.\n\nEmpezamos con una motosierra y una escopeta. La munici\u00f3n es bastante limitada. O lo era hasta que por quejas de la gente en los foros han subido bastante el drop. Espero que no en todos los niveles de dificultad.\n\nLa motosierra es muy divertida, pero requiere ya de cierta experiencia para poder usarla sin terminar hecho polvo por disparos a quemarropa.\n\nMas adelante desbloqueamos diferentes armas que se juegan de forma completamente diferente, lo que hace que el juego sea bastante completo en ese sentido.\n\nLos graficos, a pesar de que son muy retro y pixelados, tienen a mi parecer una calidad brutal. Un pixel art y unos efectos de particulas bastante logrados. El juego es muy muy sangriento, aunque creo que se puede suavizar o incluso desactivar en las opciones.\n\nSonido tambi\u00e9n muy logrado. Tanto musica como FX.\n\nEl juego se desarrolla en zonas de 4 niveles y la verdad es que la ambientacion se ve muy completa y cambia completamente la jugabilidad de una zona a otra. Ya sea a\u00f1adiendo lava, enemigos mas grandes, maquinas de matar, pira\u00f1as, etc..\n\nEn resumen, un juego dificil, violento y extremadamente adictivo, que recomiendo 100% y que creo que por lo que vale es imprescindible para los fans del genero.\n\nPor si os sirve de ayuda, os dejo un \"First Look\" video que he hecho y en el que podreis ver la primera zona, la \"Ironworks Facility\".

What you see is what you get:  non-stop action and buckets of blood and gore.

Everything's well animated; weeds sway when you walk through them, swinging chains, flowing lava and water, animals, etc.  Killer music that adds to the tension, sound effects are LOUD and violent.  Very challenging and encourages additional play-throughs for speed runs, plus it's just very satisfying blowing away hordes of enemies, watching them clutch their guts in pain after you give them a shotgun blast.

You are just burnt out and the level and shooting senarios get dull and repetitive. I wish that it would tell you when you killed someone, because when I shoot someone with a shot gun and them stumble back and fall down, I think they are dead, but then the seeming less dead enemy gets back up and shoot me in the back. This could be easily fixed by showing a little que like a little skull apearing above their dead bodies or a little \"+1 kill\" phrase apear next to your character. Ive seen some complaints about how the color pallete is the same throughout the game (which in my opinion is awesome) and because of the red and gray colors it can make seeing an enemy hard, like as if the're camoflaged. I honoestly dont think this is a very big problem, I think it adds to the hardness of the game (and besides once you develop some muscle memory for the game it becomes very easy to spot enemies) Also as a side note this game is f*cking HARD. I mean Super Meat Boy hard, and im playing on the easiest difficulty! I love that the game is hard because once you beat a really tough level you feel like you have mastered the game and feel super acomplished. But the game being really tough to beat may turn some people off.\n\nOk\n\nNow for the good!\n\nFirst off, the idea of you being a terminator-robot-killing machine is awesome! You feel like a total badass when you kill a guy, pick up his bullets, kill another guy with those bullets, then walk over to his dead body ad completely mutilate it with your chain saw. The pixel art and the blood and the music completely set the tone! You really feel like you are living in a post apocalyptic world and the design of everthing looks like Doom, The Movie Alien, and Super Meat Boy had a mangled,  hellish, baby. The level design is perfect and is the perfect blend of strategy, difficulty, and guns-blazing rambo style. Ammo and health conservation are extremely important which adds a nice layer of almost survival-ish feel to the game. The shooting and platforming are really smooth and it all seems to flow really nicely.\n\n\nOverall I would rate BUTCHER, a solid 8.5/10, and a must paly\n\n\nWISHLIST:\n\nDrop-In Co-op: this would be so much fun to play with your bro on the couch or online through the mic, I highly recommend the devs add online Co-op and local Co-op for up to 4 players.\n\nOnline Versus: OMG it would be so fun to be dropped in to map with six other players with a gun of their choice, and battle to the death, or team desthmatch. It would be too much fun.\n\nLevel Creator: This game is dying for a level editor, people could create so many amazing levels in the steam workshop. The campaine is already amazing and it would be really nice to have some communtity level to play once you finish (if you even can beat the campain)\n\nIf the devs added these things I would rate this game a shining 10/10 its still a must play game, even without these features", "timestamp_created": 1476241118, "timestamp_updated": 1476241118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25989995": {"recommendationid": "25989995", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986267331", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483330211}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very good black screen simulator.

It was released at the 5th of October 2016 and promises to be an extremely hard Doom/Quake inspired, 2D, fast, sidescrolling shooter. In this review I\u2019ll tell you how and if it lives up to the promises along with other things.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nImmediately you\u2019ll notice the devs didn\u2019t lie about the resemblance, Butcher truly is what I imagine a 2D Doom to be. It\u2019s brutal, fast and very, very bloody, albeit a bit more tactical than any classic FPS and definitely more challenging than any Quake or Doom game up to date. There are four difficulties, the easiest of which is called hard, of course. \n\nI got a bit of a Hotline Miami vibe from how the difficulty was structured, for most human-like enemies it would roughly take the same amount of damage to die as it takes you, so unlike corridor shooters where you\u2019d just run and gun, sometimes it\u2019s recommended to stop and actually think about your approach and/or take things slower, it adds a strategic layer of depth. Of course, like in all classic shooters you have enemies which are way bigger and tougher than you, with more impactful guns, but much slower.\n\nOne of the things I didn\u2019t like was how long it took to get new guns. For example, you get the best gun in the game near the very end, at the beginning of the last chapter, which doesn\u2019t give you a lot of time to actually enjoy it. Even after beating the game you can\u2019t just go back and start a New Game+ where you have all the things previously unlocked. A simple solution would be to give you less ammo for the better guns, but give them earlier in the game.\n\nWhich brings me to another point, after you find a new more powerful gun, you\u2019d all of a sudden get the almost same amount of ammo you get for the starting ones, that isn\u2019t necessarily a complaint though, since ammo in general isn\u2019t exactly much, you might find yourself in a situation where you have no ammo if you forget to manage.\n\nI found the gameplay to be a very good mixture of shooting, platforming and adaptive thinking. Everything feels smooth and just right. Things are very diversified, you'll never get sick of a specific aspect of the game. Most importantly, everything combined makes for an immensely fun experience.\n\n[h1]World, Length and Level Design[/h1]\nLet\u2019s start off with the world, there is a very non-existent story as you would probably expect with these sorts of games, however Butcher has a very big emphasis on blood and gore. All of the levels are very atmospheric and stay true to the overall theme. There is an abundance of small details e.g. being able to break mostly any prop, completely mutilate bodies and even a few hidden things which I\u2019ll let you discover for yourself.\n\nAs far as levels and level design goes, they aren\u2019t exactly the labyrinths of Doom, but they are definitely more open than your traditional sidescrollers, the inclusion of secrets is nice as well, although most of the time they don\u2019t provide much benefit to the player.\nLet\u2019s talk a bit about variety, content and length. For a 10$ game I\u2019d say it holds up quite well, what I mean is, there isn\u2019t exactly an abundance of content, but the things which are present are all done amazingly well. I wish it was longer, had more guns, more levels etc., simply because everything is done superbly well. I can\u2019t really complain given the price, I\u2019ve paid more for much shorter games with severely less content. I really want the devs to consider DLC or even a more expensive sequel with more content. Point is, I want more, and I think you will too.\n\nThe overall length of BUTCHER at the standard (Hard) difficulty is between 4-7 hours, depending how fast you learn and how often you die. It\u2019s a very unforgiving game, doesn\u2019t take you much to die and when you do, it restarts the whole level. The number of guns is a bit disappointing, there are a total of 6 guns, but all are drastically different from each other, and you\u2019ll find yourself utilizing all of them depending on the given situation and circumstance.\n\nThere will be plenty different enemies you encounter though, from humans to robots and they progressively get tougher, but Butcher doesn\u2019t just throw away the previously encountered ones, instead the game uses the newly introduced as an extra ingredient, which adds a lot of variety gameplay wise and forces you to constantly change your approach, actively encouraging adaptive, on the spot thinking.\n\n[h1]Graphics, Sound and Technical Details[/h1]\nBUTCHER sounds and looks exactly like a 90s shooter, I found myself enjoying the soundtrack quite a bit, and graphically it\u2019s very, very pleasing given that you like this type of art style. As I mentioned before, there are a lot of details everywhere, both mechanics wise and graphically. Everything combined contributes to the atmosphere and creates an extremely satisfying experience.\n\nI\u2019ve had absolutely no frame dips even on my potato, the game plays at a constant 60fps even on weaker and/or older systems. I haven\u2019t encountered a single game-breaking glitch, or any sort of glitches, to be honest. Controls on mouse and keyboard are very smooth and responsive, also fully rebindable, for the ones of you which prefer gamepads, there is fully functional support for that as well.\n\nThere isn\u2019t an excessive number of options, but all the important things, I can think of, are there. You can toggle between on-off for certain effects and post-processing, there are separate audio sliders for music and game sound and, thankfully, you can adjust several gameplay related options as you see fit.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI was very pleasantly surprised by BUTCHER and enjoyed every minute of it. My main problem is the length and overall amount of content, but given the price I can\u2019t really complain. Everything present in the game is done amazingly well, from weapons to music. Gameplay is fun and brutally challenging. \n\nThe levels all have their own quirky mechanics, and the atmosphere is amazing. I can, without a doubt, recommend this. Depending on how masochistic you are, you could try the harder difficulties and complete the game more than once or twice. Achievements are there for the OCD parts of you as well. I had a complete blast and hope you do as well.\n\nIf you like this sort of in-depth detailed reviews please let me know in the comments. Want to check out more similar reviews for other games?

(It's no longer available though.)\n\n\nBUTCHER is a very peculiar game from the makers of Soldat, King Arthur's Gold and Trench Run. It's a classic, two-dimensional, visceral, unforgiving, rabid n' rapid gun n' run adventure akin to this of Abuse. You take control of a Terminator-esque cyborg whose goal is total extermination of mankind. In order to achieve this goal, you're gonna unleash absolute hell on 5 different locations with 4 levels each and fight the boss at the very end.\n\nAdmirers of pixelated graphics will be right at home. The dark pixel art compliments the game incredibly well, with dirty and gritty environments giving off the vibe of corrupted, polluted and heavily industrialized Earth - almost similar to Quake II's Stroggos. The pixelated gore is simply bravissimo. Red dripping chunks of eliminated opponents fly around frivolously, adorning nearby furniture, walls, floors and ceilings. This is also where a very interesting artistic decision was made - If you die, your body explodes, the screen melts away Doom-style and you get sent back to the beginning of the level, and this is where you might notice another thing: the bloody mess you left in your previous \"life\" is still there and it only accumulates further with each restart of the level.\n\nBUTCHER employs various classic gameplay mechanics such as no reloading, weapon-assisted trickjumping, trial and error gameplay and sometimes speedrun-friendly level design (the game even has achievements for that) chock-full of tricky traps and sweet secrets. To contrast this promising list of features, sometimes you get locked in a small area where you have to defend yourself until you kill everyone and the next wave arrives, and so on. The developers weren't afraid to take a leaf from 2016 DOOM's book to test your survival skills, although it might come off as tedious or downright frustrating.\n\nThe game provides you with various \"tools\" and ways to assist you in your goal of eradication of all life. The initial arsenal comes off as boring, but very practical. Then you gain access to more... sophisticated weaponry in later levels. From the trusty chainsaw and the satisfactory shotgun all the way up to the trickjump-friendly grenade launcher and the chargeable wall-penetrating railgun. \n\nWeaponry aside, you are able to kick your enemies away, knocking them back in the desired direction. You can kick your foes off ledges, making them die from falling down or diving heads first into a pool of molten rock. You can also kick them upwards - with enough precision, you can impale and hang your foe on a nearby hook or launch them at a big buzzsaw with just a single kick, resulting in a delightful instakill without using up your precious ammunition.\n\nYou will face many enemies during your journey - riflemen, machete-wielding berserkers, jetpack troopers, buzzsaw-flailing robots, heavy troopers with homing rocket launchers and police cars, with honorable mention of wild Cheetahs and regular workers who operate switches connected to lethal machinery. Initial enemies might not be very challenging but they are very accurate and tend to come in packs very often, which might be overwhelming on higher difficulties.\n\nTo keep your blood pressure in check, enemies who receive any kind of damage become dizzy and are unable to shoot or track you down for a split second. The environment is very helpful as well - a shotgun burst aimed at a small pool of molten rock will result in a big splash which damages and stuns anything it touches, including you. Killing flamethrower troops causes them to explode, resulting in collateral damage the nearby soldiers might not be fond of.\n\nSound design of BUTCHER is worthy of mentioning. The dark Industrial soundtrack composed by Maciej Niedzielski ravages your eardrums relentlessly as you mow down hordes of foes, making them scream in agony before they get gibbed into a red carpet of guts, but you get used to it quickly as there is little variety of environmental cues and additional NPC sounds.\n\nThe only thing where I might have concerns is its longetivity - BUTCHER is a short and linear game which you can complete in two or three hours at most, if you're playing on the lowest difficulty.

That said, you ending up playing levels over and over and over again which ruins a lot fun.\n\nI mean, i know, it should be one of \"those hard\" games, maybe like \"i wanna be the guy\" but at least this game was kinda \"fun\" (using this word carefully~) wile the butcher is kinda frustrating\n\n- You mostly dont see a enemy before he already hit you or killed you\n- Some traps came so fast in a unfair row that the time to react is very hard\n- You have only a very limited pack of ammos for EACH weapon.\n\nSaid that, im at least somehow glad your beginner weapon is a shotgun coz aiming is also hard, said coz of the very \"pixelish\" graphic.\n\nI mean, honestly, nostalgie looks better, the Butcher looks on flatscreens like someone tried to create a retro-like looking game but adds some acid effect over it. really, the sprites looks really ugly on big screens nowadays and even games like lemmings where the sprites actually were small look better nowadays on such screens.\n\n[h1]So should you buy it?[/h1]\nHonestly, if you like very hard AND unfair games you might enjoy it, for myself i dont. Its not hard in a way you actually enjoy it, its unfair hard since its created that way. it feels like the creators actually tried something original but failed somehow - or they are sadistic...\nI just dont recomment it to people who might think the trailer looks \"neat\", srs, its a mess of grey & red and on big screens it looks like a mess of pixels.

Roughly 3 hours not including time spent in game paused.\n\nStarting with the reason I bought the game, it showed up as a \"New Release\" the day I purchased it, (the day it came out) it was on sale, (10% off) and most had an appealing graphic. \nVisiting the store page, the narration of the video caught my attention more than the video itself. We've all seen Pixel games trying to capture an old school feeling by now, but the sales pitch video was incredibly well done. \nThe immediate reaction was nostalgic, and the game's art direction felt uncompromised.\n\nThe game is heavily reminiscent of DOOM, as people playing have already learned, but doesn't lack it's own unique charm. \nThe simplest flip is that you're fighting humans as opposed to being the human fighting demons. No matter how simple a pixelated representation of a human being is, you're going to feel more connected to the waves of enemies you're going through, solely because you know what they're meant to represent. \nThat said, you don't always know exactly what they represent (in terms of weaponry.) This may be because I personally didn't pay enough attention to the models, or that often times in exterminations, you wouldn't have time to take in visual cues, or simply because the developers wanted to get the most out of the lack of variety in enemy types by making each encounter as surprising as possible. \nIf the latter is the case, then it was very well done, because as early as I found myself noticing the lack of weapon diversity between enemies, I found myself realizing I would never really care. Each enemy poses a realistic threat, and I'm no less afraid of the grunt with a shotgun, than I am of the assault rifle. \nEnemy types were also slightly varied by the jetpack enemy types, and their death animation is so satisfying, you would be hard pressed to find someone who could honestly tell you it got old fast.\n\nI didn't get tired of anything no matter how many times I repeated a level, but I would liked to have seen more saw spiders, or hazards that really made you think about your position. The way the game is set up a saw killing me never felt wholly unfair, and usally felt like my fault, keeping anger out of the game, and instead making me want to improve. \nIt was good to look through the achievements and see that the game was built with speedrunning in mind, and will likely be the first game I attempt to git gud at enough to speedrun in an unbroken segment. \nHowever, I would really enjoy to see challenge levels or additional boss battles implemented in a future update. If there's enough there, I'm sure it would warrant a $5 price tag that people would happily pay. \n\nIn terms of core gameplay, Butcher is nothing that hasn't been done before, so it leans heavily on it's difficulty, aesthetic, and sound design. You could say that all these things make the game and saying it leans on them has negative connotations, but core gameplay is imperative. \nOf course, the core gameplay is something tried and true. Slight platforming, point and click to shoot, don't stop moving. So the core gameplay isn't an issue, and is entirely enjoyable, again, it's just nothing new or innovative. \nWith that out of the way, the visuals are fantastic. At times you feel like you're seeing a lot of the same palette, and the colors are very monotone aside from a few signs in The Last City and the Bloom on lava in various areas, but it helped me feel like this was a human race plagued by tehse sorts of raids, and near collapse. The visuals lend to the immersion quite well for a pixel game, and although I would liked to have seen a few more colorful areas, or colorful markings on certain objects, enemeis, etc, there isn't much negative to say about a color scheme that lends well to the idea behind the game.\nThe art style as a whole felt uncompromised from start to finish. I was impressed by the industrail look that remained prevalent throughout, especially that of saw-spiders, and the gore was over the top and extremely satisfying for a 2D game.\n\nThe sound design was something I enjoyed quite a bit as well. I may not have been paying attention to a lot of the different kinds of music playing on stages, but the music caught my attention less than the game's ambient noise. \nThat's not to say that the music wasn't enjoyable, and actually got my interest to a point that I'd like to do something with the game's music in the future, but getting back to the sound.\nEnemy deaths were well done to the point that every time an enemy killed gave off an audio cue you felt satisfied. This ties back into the game's difficulty in knowing that every enemy is deadly, so that every audio cue for an enemy death is rewarding. \nThe screams, moans, screeches when an enemy dies from a flame, the saws, animals, being underwater, all very well done, from order of best to worst. (The lowest praise is good)\n\n\nWrapping up.\nPros.\n-Paced well (for the most part)\n-Great sound design/Good soundtrack\n-Visuals lend to the immersion\n-Doesn't get boring quickly\n-Price tag\n-Nostalgic without being unoriginal\n-Speed running encouraged\n-Difficult without being unfair\n-Satisfying shooter\n\nCons.\n-Short\n-Unrewarding final stage \n-Core gameplay is something most people have experienced\n-Levels are never long enough to warrant a checkpoint\n-Exterminations overused (Due to length of the game and ability to space them)\n-Color pallete can seem washed out or monotone\n-Rarely saw enemy types specific weapons were introduced for (Flamethrower, grenade launcher)\n\nI would include that no real explanation of the game's story can be eitehr a pro or a con. Some people are interested in the lore of a world. I personally was satisfied with just \"Go kill shit for the fuck of it.\" The ending reinforced this for me and I found it wholly satisfying. \nIf the game can garner enough attention to warrant additional content to the extent of nearly doubling the game's length, (or the creation of a sequel/prequel) that might be something people would be interested in seeing. \n\nTL;DR This game kicked my nuts in half.

Nothing can't be stopped with enough murder applied to ensure goal completion.\n\nA fantastic and extremely savage run and gun that gives you swift kicks in the nuts whilst strapping you to the rack and making thoroughly sure you get your s**t absolutely ruined over and over again. It's magical. \n\nThe soundtrack is engineered to invoke maximum rage and this only helps the game in every aspect possible. Excellent variety, clear aspect of what to do and don't and overall an extremely challenging yet more than fair game about the end of the human race.\n\nDevs giving clear feedback, taking themselves not too seriously and overall having amazing support. Updates are virtually guaranteed, so this is added to the list of \"this game gets cookies and milk for having a good team behind it\"\n\nYou will absolutely want to pick this up ! \n\n[h1]10/10[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qBlPa-9v_M\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02bwfcV2h9A", "timestamp_created": 1475869369, "timestamp_updated": 1476173458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581756", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25910314": {"recommendationid": "25910314", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970365980", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475929127}, "language": "english", "review": "Theres so much to love about this game, I hate thumbing it down.\n\nThe art direction, the sound design, its all a fantastic throwback to the 90s, especially the difficulty.

Sure, anyone can get used to it and sure it's experimental - but you can't rebind the controls to fit your specific needs. The developers tried ti simplify the controls (pressing up on the joystick makes your character jump... pressing down will make you drop to the next platform under you) but it just makes the game harder as these controls are awkward.\n\n[B]The color palette:[/B] One thing is certain, the developers brag about  the blood and gore, it's hard to see the true beauty of it because everything is too red! So these blood effects and death animations seem to get lost in translation and quite frankly, caused my eyes to strain.\n\n[B]The Camera:[/b] The way the camera  follows the character makes the game feel shakey.\n\n[B]Browser like:[/b] Althoughthe game may have been built from the ground up for Steam, it feels very much like the browser version. The game only takes up 90% of the screen (no matter what resolution) and the animation and gameflow is not perfect.\n\nThese are all legit reasons to NOT recommended the game.

It can be tricky even in the first stage with limited pickups, ammo and weapons when a couple of well placed hits will turn you into a cloud of metal and blood. If you are the kind of player who enjoyed the Cave Story Ballos end game levels or the risk reward game play of Teleglitch then this is a game for you.\n\n- Nice Design -\n\nThe art style is very nice for those that like a low-fi aesthetic but also for fans of dark industrial level design and ultra gore. For a pixelesque game it contains a lot of detail, which really helps adds to the atmosphere. The music is great also and really sets the tone well. Levels structure is like a few classic platformers with a hub world that shows progression through 'episodes' or worlds, each containing 4/5 stages.

Several years ago Micha\u0142 and Sigvatr (the man behind some controversial internet art) spent some time making a game called \"Berserker\", which was supposed to be the most violent thing ever, but something didn't work out and the project got canned. \n\nBUTCHER, I believe, is *the* ultraviolent game that Micha\u0142 has been wanting to make all these years. It's dark, unforgiving and unrepentant. The gameplay is very no-buIIshit, and so tight that it hurts. Nothing is the game's fault - if you die, it's because you're not good enough. The graphics work really well, leaving just enough to the imagination and giving off a distinct DooM/Quake/Alien vibe. The gore is irreproachable, from the slurping of the shoes against a whole floor of dead humans to the way an entire enemy splatters with blood and pieces around the room due to a chainsaw stuck in their entrails. The soundtrack and sound design are very fitting and well-done, I will definitely be adding the music to my playlist. \n\nI recommend BUTCHER wholeheartedly.

The premise and atmosphere are similar, menus and music comprised. Difficulty as well.\n\nBUTCHER is a 2D shooter, thus a platformer, and has to play differently than the aforementioned FPS games. Now think of a mix between Broforce and Hotline Miami. What we have here is a very intense game in which you pay dearly every mistake, as death forces you to restart a level. You sometimes need to know which enemies will come where, and prepare the right weapon to deal with them. The arsenal comprises shotgun, flamethrower and railgun. Every weapon has its use and feels great to use, from the damages tearing soldiers apart, to the screen that shakes to emphasize the violence of the shot.\n\nFor the most part the game mechanics are very old-school. No double jump, no dash or anything of the like. Instead the game makes up with very well crafted gunfights with two interesting details:\n\n\n[list]\n    [*]Simple platforms can be shot through. Which means that you have a lot of freedom of movement in maps that can be very vertical, while not having your aim blocked by all the platforms. Conversely, there are thicker platforms and walls that cannot be penetrated by bullets, and those can be effectively used as cover.\n\n    [*]In a way that reminds of Metal Gear or Broforce, enemies that have seen the player and are ready to shoot have an exclamation mark on top of their head. This nice idea allows the player to quickly see enemies despite their dark figures, and to be ready for a shot coming from that direction. You will never feel that you got shot by a random enemy, you always know what\u2019s coming.\n[/list]\n\nEffectively, the game is stripped down of anything related to chance, and the player has to brutally force their way through sheer skill. Aim and jump! \n\nLength-wise, it took me about 5-6 hours to finish the game without finding all the secrets. This might be a little bit short, however if it was a lot longer the game would risk feeling repetitive. \n\nAt first I thought that the game was brutally difficult, quite keen to put a deadly trap at the end of an already difficult level after a series of deadly arenas. But then I learned to use the weapons better and predict the enemy shots, and never felt that the game was being unfair or too unbeatable.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s discuss the art style. I know that some people reject it for its very minimalistic pixel-art approach. The soldiers almost look like they are out of the Command & Conquer strategy games! However, I find those graphics very evocative, with my imagination filling the blanks. If it was more detailed, it would feel a bit cartoonish. Overall it adds to the filthy, disturbing atmosphere, as if you were thrown in a futuristic but rusty meat grinder. It fits perfectly with the agonizing screams from the enemies that fell and are bleeding out.\n\nIn conclusion, BUTCHER is old-school to the bone, with a few additional features that make the game very relevant and enjoyable to play. A killer atmosphere and challenging gunfights make for a grisly offering to the gods of ultraviolence.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=775431925", "timestamp_created": 1475694149, "timestamp_updated": 1475694228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25873829": {"recommendationid": "25873829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201259019", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509533833}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 would cleanse the Earth of human vermin...\nif I could get past Ironworks Facility :,)", "timestamp_created": 1475694006, "timestamp_updated": 1475694006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39505150": {"recommendationid": "39505150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133668099", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507733509}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3088\u304f\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u304f\u3066\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u3057\u307e\u304f\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306f\u4ffa\u3060\u3051\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u306f\u305a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFxxx Yxx", "timestamp_created": 1516525558, "timestamp_updated": 1516525558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39487453": {"recommendationid": "39487453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394336550", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 387, "last_played": 1516507796}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an exercise in ball-bustingly difficult skill-based carnage.\nAnd I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nAlso there are cougars in this game.

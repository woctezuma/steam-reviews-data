I have to admit, at first I thought the characters and setting seemed kinda juvenile. You're a total gajin weeb who travels to Japan on a foreign exchange program, and there you meet a tomboy, a tsundere, and the traditional beautiful and demure girl. I was like \"Pfft, is this something I read in middle school? I wonder what kinda kooky shonen hijinx will happen this time...\"\n\nBut boy was I wrong.\n\nI don't even know where to begin my praise for this game. Each of the characters are so well developed that they transcend their archetypes and feel like actual people with their own hopes, dreams, motivations, fears, etc and I really cared for each of them. What started as a fun romp turned into an incredibly heartfelt story that tugged at my heartstrings. The three female leads are entirely voice acted and their sprite animations are engaging and dynamic. The art is beautiful, the music is lovely (I might even buy the soundtrack!), and the overall presentation is just so well done.\n\nYou'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll definitely want to play through each route and feel all the feels. This game completely exceeded my expectations and is definitely one of my favourite VNs.

Overall, I feel it's kind of lacking in content. The game was rather short, and a lot of it wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked. That being said, it certainly isn't a bad VN, and it has its moments.\n\nNote: I have only completed, and only will complete Karin and Sakura's routes. Aoi just isn't my type, so I don't want to do another playthrough for her route.\n\nMy breakdown:\n\nPROS:\n+Animation. This is the second VN I've played with fully animated sprites (The other being Crystalline), and whilst it isn't flawless, it is fluid and well drawn.\n+CG and Sprite Art. The art is, for the most part, solid. CG's are well drawn (with only two or three having any form of issues to do with line work), and the sprites are well drawn with a unique style to them.\n+Voice Acting. The Japanese voice actors were convincing, and played their part well (from an English speakers point of view). I really only had problems when they spoke english, as it just didn't seem right at all.\n+Audio cues. Something I haven't seen before is the use of audio cues during choices. Depending on how well the character receives an answer, they will play a loud sparkly noise that gives a much more transparent look to the VN. This helps a lot as it means you don't really need a guide to get the right ending.\n\nCONS:\n-Crashes. I had three crashes whilst playing the game. All were right before a CG appearing. Reloading the game fixed it, but this has never happened to me with a VN before, so I have to criticise it.\n-Story. I felt the story was lack lustre. The common route felt somewhat tedious, and like I wasn't getting anywhere. Not the feeling you should be leaving in the reader.\n-Main character. The main character is a knob. He's pretty much everything unlikeable in a MC. He's generic without any form of progression, he's dense, and he's completely clueless socially. No VN MC should act this way, unless you plan on having him develop into being a better person along the way.\n-Inconsistent. This kind of ties into the story once again, but a lot of actions taken early on mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. Characters mentioned early on are never brought up again, and character motivations/direction are seemingly random, with literally no consistency.\n-Background CG's. A lot of the CG's are completely inconsistent with the rest of the games style. It's off-putting.\n\n-Scores-\nStory: 4\nCharacters: 6\nArt: 8\nMusic: 7\nEnjoyment: 6\n\nOverall: 6/10\n\ntl;dr.

But I figured I'd play it through to see if it got better. Before you select a designated 'route', the game isn't anything good. At least, not to me. I found the moving/talking sprites to be a bit much and a tad odd, and your character is an oblivious weeaboo not likable one bit. And the three characters you interact with are the only ones you ever meet in the game, which in a way is good as there are no surprises, but if you're not fond of them then tought luck. \n\nThis is all in the first act though. The game poses a very neat system for selecting your route; each character whose route you can take represents a location you can visit in your school trip; Okinawa, Osaka or Kyoto. The choices you make in the first act determine which of them you are able to take, and then you can choose which you'd like to play. This is good as you're not forced to take a route you don't want to take. Not that getting the right route is difficult; this isn't a very 'interactive' VN (the route I played didn't have a single choice) so the choices are rather easy. \n\nAfter I chose my route and the 'real' game began, it vastly improved. The story wasn't that different, but it seemed to be less... overly happy/silly, which is good. I hadn't expected to really enjoy it, but by the end I was invested in the story and it worked well, and it did a marvelous job at tricking me with a false ending. \n\nOne of the game's weakest aspects is the soundtrack. It's not overly 'bad', rather than underwhelming. The main theme is really poorly-done, and it seems the game had so little tracks to work with it even repeats the main theme. It's to the extent that the game's best moments take place in the absence of music; rather than having it emphasize the current events in the story, which is a shame. \n\nOne playthrough, of which there are three, took me about 4 hours. A decent length, but regardless felt a bit on the short side. I didn't really mind since the game was strong and never overstayed its welcome, but if you're looking for a really long and deep story, don't come here. What's here is a short yet sweet visual novel. Although not really educational or informative for anybody looking to travel to Japan, it's still enjoyable and a good play. \n\nOf course, visuals novles are not everybody's cup of tea, and I'm not just talking about the 18+ ero ones either, but as a whole, some people like them and others don't. If you're considering getting into the genre, this would be a decent start if you can get past the inital parts of the game.

I have pretty much completed the entireity of this game (except for one route) and I have to say that all the hours that I have spent on this game have been well spent. This game is more oriented towards romance and the sort with a few added bits of humour. Even if you are not one for romance vns, I still suggest you to give it a try as the romance is actually quite realistic and not over the top. Regarding the art style of this vn, I believe it was really well done. Practically every aspect regarding asthetics were done really well: back grounds were great; amazing soundtrack but not too amazing to detract from the story. Regarding the story, I found it a bit lacking and rather unoriginal but hey, this is a lighthearted vn. It's not supposed to give the reader a headache. There are a few bits where there is a healthy dose of drama but not too much to make me grimace.

Almost immediately, I struggled to see myself as him. It's not that he's a bad guy, but I'm nothing like him, either.\n2) You don't get enough opportunities to make choices. The girls routinely ask your character questions, but only rarely are you, the player, allowed to make a decision on what is said in response. \n3) There are no animations for characters outside the three female leads - everyone else is just words on a screen.\n4) The music is really pedestrian. \n\nThe game is only $7.50 right now, so, yes, I can comfortably say that, for that price, people should buy it. But this was hardly some earth-shattering experience for me.\n\n*Edit*\n\nFinished it up a couple of nights ago - my final thoughts (SPOILERS):\n\nUltimately, while TSL is well put together, the game is marred by one over-arching problem that it simply cannot overcome, and that is that two of the three girls have *significant* personality flaws that would be a red flag for any sane suitor. Sakura is a liar - she lies several times throughout the plot, but her initial, signficant exchange with the player is a needless, terrible deception motivated by nothing more than avarice. I could never get past the fact that she made up a story about a sickly sister just to call dibs on a comic book - that isn't just mean, it's downright sociopathic.\n\nKarin, on the other hand, never shakes the initial tough-girl persona, even with the introduction of a shallow cuteness obsession that comes to dominate her later plot. Moreover, she's a narcissist of the first order, and her arc is dragged down by a sequence of me-first events that leaves you convinced that the only person who would ever tolerate her company would be doing so out of a desire to squeeze her largest-in-the-group chest.\n\nSpeaking of that, I have to mention one final downfall, and that is the near total lack of fanservice. I'm not sure why Steam asks for a birthday to access TSL, because, outside of a few enormously tame bathing suit cameos, we hardly ever see more than a passing flash of skin. In fact, one larger, later part of Aoi's story has her wearing a mika shaman costume, which, while adorable, is about the antithesis of sexy.", "timestamp_created": 1460528962, "timestamp_updated":

It's nice to see that some visual novels do some animations with their characters, such as this one. This game doesn;t really seem to take any shortcuts when it comes to the animations and the game play itself. The game itself has only 3 routes, which can either lead to a succesful love-life or a disaster, which offer limited replay value to the game to see what happens in the other endings.\n\n[h1]Game Play[/h1]\nThe gameplay of Tokyo School Life is simple and is well designed for the purpose of this type of game. The choices that you make in this game is rather linear, The endings of the game are fairly different from one another, and therefore replaying tha game makes it a bit mroe interesting itself to see what the other endings are. There are affection points in the game that yoy gain by choosing the appropriate choices in the current situation. Each character can get a maimum of 4 affection points, which determins the final outcome of the game. The game itself is very fun for everyone who likes visual novel games, each choice in the game revolves around the themes of each character, which makes the story seem extremely organized and not a jumbled mess. The story itself doesn't exceed for very long, which is a bit unreasonable for the amount that the game is asking for the game itself, I myself didn't seem to get to know the characters as much as I wanted to.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Art Style[/h1]\nFor a visual novel, it seems that the developers didn't hold back for this game and the animtations that they created for the characters. For most visual novels there are a just sill images with no experssion ont their face or movement animation. The end result of the gamer having a experience with the characters is that they have movement and expressions on their faces which makes this visual novel even better and stands out from the other visual novels. The background that comes with each of the areas that you visit is very high quality art and looks nice and fluid, combind with the animated characters it seems to flow very nicely. The voice acting of the three girls that you meet is very good, along with the instrumental music which is very nice to hear whilst playing this game.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game itself is very fun and stands out from the other visual novels that are on steam now a days. The characters that you meet are nicely animated and the voice acting is fairly nice. The backgrounds of each of the places you visit are in very high quailty art style. This flows very nice with the animtations and expressions of each of the three girls you meet whlist playing.

"review": "[u]Introduction[/u]\n\nMade by M2 Co Ltd and published by  Dogenzaka Lab, Tokyo School Life is a cultural learning experience with a dollop of sugary Dating Simulation to boot.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\n\nThe story is as fluffy and light as candy but this works in its favour for this title. This is aiming at least to be a partial education experience and needs some appeal. which it delivers with some sweet, light hearted humour. A student from the United States obsessed with Japanese Culture fulfils  his lifelong dream and becomes an exchange student in Tokyo for two months.. He lives with three  girls, Sakura, Aoi and Karin. During his time there they give him memories he will never forget. This is pure escapism and a chance to live vicariously. So sit back, don't think too hard and enjoy the ride.\n\n[u]Characters[/u]\n\nThe three female characters  fit into the stereotypes expected; Karin is sexy, Sakura is classy and Aoi is cute but all with some quirks. Most of these quirks might be familiar to anime fans but still give some nice, funny moments. Despite some stereotypes  the characters are all well written and very likeable. This was clearly  intended  as Karin could of easily of been a bitch and Aoi could of been a lolicon character but the focus is on their somewhat typical personalities. There is a romantic ending for each girl which can be gained through getting enough affection points. There is also a forever alone ending for completionists and a special message for completing all endings. \n\n[u]Learning[/u]\n\nAs previously mentioned there is some learning aspects about Japanese culture for everyone such as food, customs and information about the History of Tokyo and other places in Japan. If you don't play these type of games often the anime aspects such as mangas might be completely new to you. For people interested in practising their language skills there is the choice of  Japanese, Hiragana and Romaji.\n\n[u]Artwork[/u]\n\nThis uses uses M2 2D Emote Engine and multi-platform novel engine, Kaleido ADV Workshop. The end result for the gamer is 2D sprites that have movements and expressions. The effect is subtle but it makes the characters come to life as opposed to still images. It blends smoothly with the high quality background art and looks very fluid. The voice acting of the three girls is a very good and as expressive as the aforementioned 2D Sprites. It is a treat on the ears. The background  instrumental music is not intrusive and very pleasant to the ear too.\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/609478105736254972/85E40880EFFCA812890402B97B276E81D8CA1E2E/\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nMary Poppins said \" A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down\"...well you may prefer a spoonful of salt as this may too cute or as an anime fan would call it \"moe\" for you. Despite the games shortness the overall  excellent quality does not make this too overpriced.\n\nDespite the 18 warning this is a family friendly game, the strongest being a bikini shot. Finally I  need to mention a very similar game on steam, Go Go Nippon: My first trip to Japan. In short, this is the superior game. So let's end the review with the very catchy theme tune \"MOE to  Yoouu! which perfectly encapsulates this game:\n\n[i]Moe to me[/i]\n[i]Moe for you[/i],\n[i]Too much moe[/i]\n[i]Are we excited or confused?[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1454090346, "timestamp_updated": 1454090477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822425", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20791975": {"recommendationid": "20791975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169388102", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453966256}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this I would be Hyped for a sequel this game had great voice actors and character design as well as animation and the soundtrack was really good", "timestamp_created": 1453924716, "timestamp_updated": 1453924716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20778006": {"recommendationid": "20778006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048358772", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453857519}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a charming visit into the lives of three Japanese girls.

Pour faire simple, vous vous contentez de lire et de choisir certaines r\u00e9ponses de votre personnage (les choix les plus importants notamment).\nDans Tokyo School Life, vous \u00eates un \u00e9tudiant am\u00e9ricain envoy\u00e9 au Japon suite \u00e0 un \u00e9change scolaire. Vous rencontrerez petit \u00e0 petit les 3 protagonistes de l'histoire qui ont chacune des personnalit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes. Premi\u00e8rement, vous rencontrez Karin, une fille extravertie (et qui s'\u00e9nerve vite d'ailleurs) mais qui aime toutes les choses qu'elle dit \"mignons\". Ensuite, vous croisez Aoi, une fille sympathique et d\u00e9vou\u00e9e \u00e0 aider tout ceux qui l'entourent. Enfin, vous rencontrez Sakura, une fille myst\u00e9rieuse et plut\u00f4t timide (qui est en secret une otaku d'ailleurs). Vous remarquerez d'ailleurs par la suite que toutes habitent au m\u00eame endroit que vous (une sorte de r\u00e9sidence typiquement japonaise).\nEt c'est dans ce cadre de vie que vous passerez vos journ\u00e9es en leur compagnie. Sympathique, non ? ;)\nPour parler plus amplement de l'histoire ou plut\u00f4t des 3 fins (une par personnage), je vous encourage vivement \u00e0 essayer les 3, d'une part pour d\u00e9couvrir le c\u00f4t\u00e9 cach\u00e9 de chacune mais aussi pour allonger un peu la maigre dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu (malheureusement d'ailleurs). Mais cela n'emp\u00eache pas que j'en garde de tr\u00e8s bons souvenirs et je pense que ce sera votre cas quand m\u00eame. ^^\n\nBons points :\n- Tr\u00e8s bonne histoire !\n- Des personnages attachants avec des personnalit\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes\n- C'est sans doute la meilleure Visual Novel que je n'ai jamais test\u00e9 !\n- Des animations ultra fluides\n- Des voix magnifiques (personnellement j'adore d\u00e9j\u00e0 le japonais comme langue)\n- Musique plut\u00f4t sympathique, il faut bien l'avouer\n- Pas besoin de bourriner la touche de screenshot, il y a une gallerie int\u00e9gr\u00e9e :3\n\nMauvais points :\n- Trop court :c\n- Peut-\u00eatre trop peu de choix (c'est pas trop d\u00e9rangeant mais c'est important de le souligner je pense)\n- Je trouve certaines choses plut\u00f4t abus\u00e9es, comme le fait que le h\u00e9ros sache parler parfaitement le japonnais (basique certes) juste en ayant regarder des animes et en ayant lu des mangas\n- Je suis tellement d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9 de l'avoir fini si vite :c\n\nEn conclusion, Tokyo School Life reste certes un peu cher (15\u20ac pour 7/8h de jeu) mais il en reste quand m\u00eame inoubliable pour la qualit\u00e9 de son histoire et du caract\u00e8re de ses personnages.

I finished all three routes myself, and I liked all three of the stories.\n\nThe music is pretty nice too, matches the moods in the game, and the theme song is upbeat and cute. \n\nThe amount of choices you can make and their impact could have been a little bit better, but overal this is a pretty solid VN that I can recommend to anyone who likes VNs.", "timestamp_created": 1444407941, "timestamp_updated": 1444407941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18387721": {"recommendationid": "18387721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077608050", "num_games_owned": 902, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495964711}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3059\u3063\u3068\u307c\u3051\u305f\u30f2\u30bf\u30af\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u3057\u3064\u30643\u4eba\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u3068\u306e\u4ea4\u6d41\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u30ce\u30d9\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\n\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u306f\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u5206\u5c90\u3059\u308b3\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u30a8\u30ed\u8981\u7d20\u306f\u6b86\u3069\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u5065\u5168\u3067\u3059\uff57\n\n2D\u7d75\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u7d50\u69cb\u6fc0\u3057\u304f\u52d5\u3044\u3066\u300c\u3053\u308c\u306f3D\u306a\u306e\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304b\uff1f\u300d\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u307b\u3069\u3002\n3\u4eba\u306e\u30d2\u30ed\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u304c\u3069\u308c\u3082\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u3044\u3002\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3082\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u3066\u7279\u306b\u7279\u306b\u4e0d\u6e80\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u524d\u306f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u6709\u3063\u3066\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3057\u305a\u3089\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001Win10\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u4eca\u306f\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3082\u4fee\u6b63\u3055\u308c\u6cbb\u3063\u3066\u308b\u69d8\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1444339409, "timestamp_updated": 1455915351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18335633": {"recommendationid": "18335633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080912198", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423963033}, "language": "english", "review": "30 minutes into this game and I end up with:\n.

Either their art is unexceptional or the story/characters are bland and mediocre at best. Tokyo School Life is different in a WHOLE lot of ways(speaking from my experience)\n\nTokyo School Life utilizes the EMOTE engine. This is easily recognizable because the characters have a very 2D/3D fluid motion going on about them.(This can be compared to the Oreimo PSP games) This by itself makes the game look gorgeous. Contrary to what I believed before I played the game, this is a non-Adult title, so there are no erotic/porn scenes. The story in this game is freaking amazing! Wraps up nicely and leaves zero points left unresolved.\n\nGameplay: \nThe gameplay is extremely simple, as it should be designed. There are up to 8 choices that you will run into during your \nprogression in the game. These choices do not branch out the story in any way, the choices are very much linear. Affection points are measured from 0-2 points. You gain these points by choosing the appropriate choices. Each character will receive a maximum of 4 affection points. There is a 9th choice that will allow you to choose 1 of the 3 character's final ending routes. This is the only point in the game that branches out from the main story.\n\nStory:\nThe story revoles around you, the gaijin MC that comes from 'MURICA. Now If you play a lot of visual novels or watch a lot of anime, you'll realize this game pulls a lot of cliches. When I played this game it didnt bother me that much at all because to me it didnt feel forced (which would be a problem for me). The story successfully dives into a little bit of each characters traits and personality. Each choice in the game revolves around the themes of each character, which makes the story seem extremely organized and not a jumbled mess. The only complaint I have about the story is that I wish is lasted a little more longer to get into knowing the characters a lot more. This is where we get into the-\n\nCharacters:\nLol I'm going to be extremely frank. Sakura is the best girl, Aoi and Karin I can never care for. This goes back into the story and my personal experiences. I can relate to Sakura a lot more than Aoi and Karin. Not only that, I feel like the story did a really good job in making Sakura into a likeable character. The fact that she's a fraile girl, an otaku, has a slight sense of humor, is a little dense, has an aura of innocence despite being a high school girl, and begins to develop into a better character thanks to the MC makes her my favorite. Aoi is the karate girl, and Karin is an idol tsundere, meh.\n\nArt:\nThe EMOTE engine makes this game stand out among the thousands of other VNs. The character design is very cute. The weak side of the games art is in the background art. It can be very inconsistent with other background regarding quality. The menu interface was really nice to look at however.\n\nMusic:\nLike any other VN game. A jpop opening and popy BGM's. Nothing that really stood out to me. It does fit\nvery well with the overall atmosphere of the game. In other words it didnt stand out too much, which is what \"background\"music should do.\n\nReplay-ability: \nI can honestly see myself playing through Sakura's route again because I love her character so much.\nAs for Aoi's or Karin's routes I cant see myself doing that at all. \n\nOverall, This is the best non-Adult VN game I have every played. As far as ratings go, I'll give Tokyo School Life a:\n\n8/10 would be a 9 if they made more likeable characters.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1442556570, "timestamp_updated": 1442556570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18010471": {"recommendationid": "18010471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028512801", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442124947}, "language": "english", "review": "Story about a weeaboo going to Japan.\nThe story's not bad but predictible.\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1442126005, "timestamp_updated": 1442126005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17954121": {"recommendationid": "17954121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085155460", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440609628}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is about an exchange student that will study in japan for some time.

A lot of times I found myself laughing or cringing at characters, or even becoming concerned about characters. If you have the $15 to dish out on this visual novel, I highly suggest it.

I am proud of what I have done, but after much reflecting, I feel like I am qualified enough to add some insightful input to those wondering whether they should buy this title. So far I have completed nearly all three storylines (as far as I know), and I am pretty sure that there is only one ending for each path. I may be wrong about this, but the story only has one crucial decision that decides which girl you fall for, and there are no \"bad-endings\".\n\nI have not played many Visual Novel games in my time, but my first \"legitimate\" one was Katawa Shoujo (which I enjoyed thoroughly). Katawa Shoujo may have spoiled what I expected from any VN game afterwards, so try to understand things from my point of view. \n\nTokyo School Life is a visual novel game where the protagonist (you) is on a two month trip to Japan as an exchange student from the USA. You have loved and admired Japan since childhood, and it has always been your dream to one day take a trip there. You taught yourself how to speak Japanese from watching anime, and have been talking with an old man you call \"Sensei\" about his time here. When you arrive, you are excited to experience all the great Japanese culture, visit some great landmarks, and most of all meet some cute girls. Early on in the game you have some bad first encounters with who will later be your love interests, and your roommates. You are staying in a dorm at a shrine with three other girls, and no supervising adults, so go at it. What will your life be like here in Japan? Will you get what you came for, or will the reality of Japan crush your weaboo heart?\n\n\nPros: (I don't have a lot to say about the pros, they are pretty basic points).\n\n- The female characters are likeable, and have nice personalities along with being attractive (by art standards). They all have strong characteristics, and I found them to be relatively original (design-wise).\n\n- The art is well done, and the animation aspect is a nice touch to the usual static image that I am used to. The character art is fantastic, and the backgrounds are pretty nice.\n\n- The voice acting was spot on, and though I don't understand Japanese, I feel like the voices added a lot to the experience and provided a more immersive environment.\n\n- The music is catchy, and even f you don't enjoy it, you can mute it or wait the until the scene changes.\n\n- There are some moments where the game teaches you things about Japan, but the information is nothing special.\n\nCons: (I have a lot more to say here, but that's only because the problems are easier to go into than the positives.)\n\n- The protagonist (who you play as) is pretty unlikeable, and hard to relate with. He could say some dumb things, and despite his extensive knowledge of Japan, and that he learned to speak Japanese fluently FROM WATCHING ANIME (If this is even possible, he would have to have watched more anime than I can fathom), he was kind of clueless about some pretty basic stuff. This protagonist was supposed to represent you, as you name him, and you are unable to see what he looks like to allow yourself to picture him being you. This is fine and dandy, but not in the way they presented him. I felt like I was being misrepresented, and would have probably enjoyed it much more if the protagonist was his own seperate person, instead of trying to be me.\n\n- I felt like the content was lacking in a way, and not necessarily in volume or play time. The story seemed rushed, and it could have definitely flowed better into a more coherent story line (my opinion, not fact). A lot of the game was often times charming, but it could also prove to be redundant, and some moments felt like filler material that wasn't really adding anything to the experience.\n\n- Building off of my last point, I think the story paths ended abruptly, and were pretty unsatisfying, causing me to want more, or at least better closure. The credits hit you like a brick wall, and I never expected them to pop up when they did. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say anything more about this.\n\n- There are only really four characters in this game, though some background characters show up as just lines of text, you never see anyone besides the three main girls or the people who were a part of the background image. I feel like a little more character variety would have been a huge positive to the game, but I can see from a development standpoint why this could be difficult.\n\n- As I said before, I am pretty sure the outcome of the story depends solely on one decision, but I have not tried every option to test this theory. The girl that you get based on that decision is pretty obvious, since each of the options has a picture of the girl. Also, though this isn't EXACTLY a con, the decision making is extremely easy. It is not hard to pick the best thing to say if you actually know what's going on, and each choice is accompanied by a sound (or lack thereof). The best option has the loudest sound, and the worst one will have no sound at all, so you are basically told whether you made the right choice or not right after making it.\n\nAll in all, this isn't any complex, thought-provoking read; but it is charming and enjoyable. If you're an expert visual novelist with high-standards, this probably isn't for you, but if you want to waste a good 14 hours pretending to talk with cute anime babes, that's a different story.\nThank you Unagi for having the same views as me", "timestamp_created": 1441234221, "timestamp_updated": 1441234221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17835617": {"recommendationid": "17835617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099964279", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449915943}, "language": "french", "review": "Sympathetic game !

The only downside is how short it is! Just when I was starting to get really invested in each of the characters, things were suddenly rushed and the stories ended. \n\nBut that's only a small factor to consider, the positive of the game heavily outweighs the small negative. Each of the 3 stories are fairly nice. Nothing incredible in terms of storywrighting, but it kept me entertained and I don't think anything was too generic. \n\nI really hope the developer takes the engine from this game to make a fully fleshed out, lengthly VN.

The truth is; there is nothing more graphic than what somebody would see on a public beach. \n\nThe game is cute though, the animations and voice acting are pretty good; and you bond with the girls quickly. They're pretty varied and give you that \"family\"-feeling, which is a really important theme throughout the whole game. You get to choose which girl you go after, and it's not really possible to mess up either, because you can always go back in dialogue. So, it's pretty relaxed to play.

It's not easy to tell which answer pleases which girl, not at least in the beginning of the game). \n\nAnyhow, long story short: \n+ Graphics, character movements/facial expressions and voice acting are nice \n+ The girls' personalities are different from each other \n+ You get to spend quite a lot of time with the girl you prefer, if you choose correctly \n+ Not too much anime clich\u00e9s.

That's the feeling I got from this game.\nAmong the practically nonexistent Japanese-made West-oriented kind of visual novels, this one is unmatched. But even if you know enough about Japan or simply don't care, you may find it interesting as it has enough to offer to stand on its own feet as a proper visual novel.\nBut first let me talk about one of the key features of Tokyo School Life, that being the Japanese learning component. It is several steps ahead of Go Go Nippon which simply featured a second text box in a really tiny font where you'd ruin your eyes reading kanji. There was no furigana either. Now you can choose to set the main and auxiliary text boxes (the latter appears in a corner of the screen, can be disabled) to display the language you want, be it English, straight-up Japanese or Japanese written in all hiragana/romaji (don't do this, seriously). My only complaint here is that furigana is always enabled, it's actually pretty distracting as your eyes tend to wander towards what they can easily read instead of the complex characters. From a learning perspective, it's like trying to revise something with the cheat sheet in front of you.\nTokyo School Life features 30 CGs (nothing unusual), 9 tracks (pretty good), voice acting and the e-mote system. Compared to Nekopara, the sprites in this game are a lot more animated. Watching Aoi bounce around always gave me a nice, warm feeling. :) I'm bothered by the fact that the girls never call you by your name in voice even if you don't change it from default, it's actually pretty rude in Japanese and even the original text handles it differently. Cutting corners I guess, and since most people on Steam wouldn't know about this subtlety I can't really blame the developers too much.\nYou've got the protagonist, who is a big fan of Japan and knows surprisingly little about it despite being fluent enough to understand all the kanji words they throw at him in writing, various sayings and expressions and even some archaic dialects. The guy still writes in all-hiragana (only applies to a few chatroom scenes) and doesn't know the words itadakimasu and gochisousama, which come right after \"baka\" and \"temee\" among the words you'll automatically learn from anime.\nAs to be expected, the heroines fall within some of the standard archetypes. You've got a yamato nadeshiko (the image of an ideal Japanese woman), a twin-tailed tsundere and the adorable little animal type (not biased, I swear).\nWithout spoiling the story, the common route mostly consists of standard-fare comedy and exploring Japan, the choices you make will determine whose routes will be available at the end, which can mean multiple options so feel free to be nice to all of the girls, as long as you secure the required 4 points with the one you're most interested in (some choices give you 2 points instead of 1). Once you're in someone's route, expect things to get serious after a while.

If you like Go! Go! Nippon, I believe you will like this game.\nFirst off it does do the usual route of things, you flying in at Narita airport, then it goes into the routes after a bit. You get introduced one by one to each of the three girls. Each choice you make will reflect at the end who you will end up with if not \"alone\". However the game itself has a great rendition of movement in a game that brings these 2d characters to life. The expressions and movement are more worked with. The voice acting top notch and the story so far workable. For the score I'd give it a 9.6/10. Reasons are it's a great game, should have more scenes however the fact is that this game did keep me interested and fulfillled it's role. The VN itself's unique characters bring out personality with how they are portrayed and that helped set the tone. The facts relevant here are truly well mentioned to also introduce people into the culture. In the means of you progressing, each girl's story goes with yours and each end has their own appeal. Karin was cool and cute pop idol. Sakura was quiet, calm, and reserved manga artist. Aoi is a cheerful, strong, and kind, dojo disciple. You even get to use your own name in here and the facts stated worked well. The Bg sound more \"in tune\" with the bg. The story was well indepth and flowed.

I feel that this game is not interactive enough to keep players intrested as the game layout depends on it having a good story line.\n\nThe thing that make anime sucsesfull is the basic inosent flirting and so on so forth witch this game has, but it feels to much like the base of every branch on the tree without any awsome factors of its own Eg some use magic, advanced tecnoligy or even ailiens. This game almost feels like a neer master at his craft but hasnt quite found the spark that creates perfection\n\nOn a hole the story isnt bad but a little less naration on the players half and mor animated sceans (for such things as crshing cartons of tea in hands rather than an explination) or even a less robotic way of presentasion.maybe tring a more smooth and natural aproch rather than tireing carboardy patten that we see so often in books.\n\nThe charictors are well thought out and seem verry human in  there personalitys with there own faults and good sides you can tell that the creator has some if not alot of expeireance with this sort of thing.\n\nLove the art work nothing better that a good old fation detailed background with simplistic charictors on to works like it always has. Good move.\n\nThe main problem i have with this game is that the interaction is low, you only occasionly come across multiple chioce questions wich at first dont seem overly important. THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE MORE INTERACTIVE PLEASE !!!!!!\nits more like being told a story in first person then actuly living in an anime world, witch is fine if u like that sort of thing\nbut its not for me or the other game/anime lovers i know.\n\nThe second thing is the naration its a little tiresome and over explanitry for the perpouse and sometimes feels like its in the wrong place or not needed but it shows how much the creator has put in to the basic story of the game.\n\nThe things i like is the typical anime style of this game it feels like a familiar place for an anime fan like me.\nI also like the jokes that are put in the game and makes the cheese anime scenarios funny and more enjoyable. The last point is the girls because thats what this game is about after all. three words Funny, Realistic in behavure and unpridictable.\n\nTo wrap this up and to stop the endless blabering, this game is one that take a little patience and understanding but can be enjoyable if you like you typical school life animes with lots of emotional probelems this might be somthing you should at least try. I will be keeping my eye out for this creators projects to come as i feel this game is a stepping stone for what they are capable of.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1435447550, "timestamp_updated": 1435447550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16748000": {"recommendationid": "16748000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059411256", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476140589}, "language": "english", "review": "Good music.

not about the girl you end up choosing, it's about which girl chooses you\" - Jay Leno\n\nHello, I am Nicholas-sempai - a certified level 3 weaboo (ranch dip lover and fluent in Japanese which I learnt in under 50 Naruto episodes), so I consider myself well acquainted with this game's approach and adaptive playstyle. As such - I will be splitting this review into three parts to commemorate the well designed characters, each of which carrying a very unique and certainly not generic persona. \n\nTo begin, we will delve into the psyche of  the Tsunardere one (what was her name again). Although originally I had assumed that she was just the typical hate/love, I was astounded when I stumbled across her CUTE quirk. Do mind the pun. Who would have thought that your typical tsunardere would want to be called cute? I mean, not only was this hard for me to comprehend, It really developed the character in such a way where I currently have feelings for her. Luckily I found a great body pillow deal (link below).\n\nYeah the \"i'm dying\" and \"i look like a boy\" ones really got me going too. 10/10 IGN my erection is still raging.", "timestamp_created": 1431802779, "timestamp_updated": 1431802779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502981", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15820595": {"recommendationid": "15820595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016325595", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431579705}, "language": "english", "review": "++ Dual-language option. More VNs need to have this.\n+ Animated sprites (here, it's E-mote) used to great effect. This is recent tech and not many VNs have this.  Most VNs for PC which do use it (including this one) tend not to be very good though, hence the opinion amongst some VN review circles to categorize it as somewhat gimmicky.\n- - - There is much better reading material out there.\n\n\nI bought this for the dual language feature. Nekopara [Neko Works 2014] has it as well. These are a godsend for learning the language, as usually I have to run two clients (one Japanese, one English) otherwise, sometimes on separate virtual machines or computers if the two clients cannot run simultaneously. This saves me a lot of time syncing the two windows or looking up my dictionaries for completely untranslated titles.\n\nThat said however, having just finished Symphonic Rain [Kogado 2004] and Hoshizora no Memoria [Favorite 2009] before that, I couldn't bring myself to stomach the content in Tokyo School Life beyond the first 10-15 minutes. The difference in quality of writing, and how much respect the writers treat the characters / protagonist with, is simply staggering. At least you know what you're getting into for Nekopara, and it is the better VN compared to this one.\n\nI've seen my share of hetare protagonists but this guy - who the game expects you to name after yourself - is a bumbling doofus. He claims he's a Japanophile, and was elated to be selected for a two-month student exchange program. Then how about studying up cultural practices and social no-nos before heading there, instead of causing a lady to trigger her personal alarm before even reaching the school? She may be the ticked-off tsundere, but the protagonist was eyeballing her up and down like the creep that he is, thinking about how good looking she is instead of helping her up and apologizing like a decent person would, after having bumped her flat on the ground and having his hand end up in an unfortunate place. Chikan, sekuhara yarou indeed. Also cliched as heck.\n\nThe other two cover characters are introduced in scenarios that are equally cringe-worthy - causing her to spill her tea all over herself, touching her hand when reaching for the same book... The characters are objectified and put into these kinds of situations just for the heck of it. Now, I am acutely aware that this stuff happens in other games and anime, but the distinct lack of cultural sensitivity here, the choice of words, how eager the game wants to get to these scenes, and how the protagonist irresponsibly bungles these situations due to his social ineptitude and especially, his internal monologue in that goes on in that baka head of his, leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. The developer [M2] is the only one that I've seen actually hosting English content from a Japanese domain name. I didn't know that beforehand as I thought this VN was hand-selected by a localization company. Both that and the story setting makes their target demographic obvious, but I also didn't expect this degree of disconnect.\n\nBased on the number of favorable reviews, if you like this game anyway, good for you I guess, but I will be extremely wary of such titles from now on. If you only buy games on Steam, if you haven't read Grisaia no Kajitsu [Frontwing 2011] already, wait until the Kickstarted localization comes out officially - that's far, far more representative of a quality VN. Or give eden* [Minori 2009] a go if you don't mind a different pacing and setting. Or look beyond Steam for the best material in this genre, which most any VN on Steam (at time of writing) can't even hold a candle to.", "timestamp_created": 1431579798, "timestamp_updated": 1431721308, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15784897": {"recommendationid": "15784897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044960847", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494418905}, "language": "thai", "review": "story : this game will give you feeling like watch anime.

The graphics are nice, so is the soundtrack, and you really start to like your character, beside the fact he knows little to nothing about culture, only history from his beloved Manga, Samurai Maiden.\n\nOne of my favorite things in this game is the lines. Not only are they recorded, so you feel like you are talkingto the girls, but also are they translated into either Romanji, Kana, or none if you so prefer. Oh and the characters are animated, thats a huge plus to, adding to the \"realism\"\n\nIs it worth the money? I would say yes. The story is a tad too short for my liking, but to newcomers in the genre of Visual Novels, this will be a great and easy start. Three routes, three different girls, each with a few manageable quirks, nice and apealing visuals, and all in all, an easy pill to swallow. And not to mention its funny twists, you might have not expected, and the necesarry half nude elements, we all know and love from anime and manga, and especially Visual Novels.\n\nReally nice and easy, with very few reasons to get upset in the storyline.\nThat is, if you are not like me, who rages at the outmost obvious trivia about japanese culture. \n\nSPOILER: Here are a few examples you might come across, which the character you play as HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS\nDried seaweed aka Nori used in the creation of Sushi, among other items of food, such as Onigiri or rice cakes\nItadakimasu aka a phrase used to express graditude towards the cook, before a meal\nYou will encounter more, but I am too lazy to write more (I am a couch potatoe)\n\nFavorite route: Sakura\n\nAlso I play these sort of games offline, hence my low play time in this Visual Novel", "timestamp_created": 1427659255, "timestamp_updated": 1427659368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15097417": {"recommendationid": "15097417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084101505", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430169915}, "language": "english", "review": "Another VN with a more 'Traditional' approach to the market.

Before you get to choose which girl you want to be with, the storyline is a bit random at times, specially at the beginning, but its should be all good once you get the hang of it. \n\nOverall 8/10\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nIt sure surprised me when I first looked at the visuals on this VN, my first impressions were low for the VNs graphics, but I realised that the graphics are beyond exceptional and the art is super stunning, I loved it. However, some of the art was too repetitive and could've been changed in some points in the game, but still an awesome sight~\n\nOverall 9/10\n\n[h1] Sound/Voice [/h1]\nAll the girls have a voice, which is a nice thing to have, the sound is 'good' not \"great\" but 'good' enough. This could've been improved especially in some of the scenes. I wasn't too impressed by the sounds, but the opening is sure great to listen to.\n\nOverall 6/10\n\n[h1] Price [/h1] \n\u00a311...This might be a little too much for a VN I think, I mean Its got the same price tag as If My Heart Had Wings...I really would wait until this VN would go on sale before buying it.

At the end of the day you go to the place you will be staying for the duration of your stay in Japan... Oh look, those same 3 girls are housemates in that very dorm. Cue mayhem.\n\n[h1][b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b][/h1]\nThis game is both hilarious and moving all at the same time, yet since this is a visual novel you're probably wondering [i]\"Hey Jon, why have you put a gameplay section in a visual novel review?\"[/i] What a swell question, my friend. TSL does things a little differently than other visual novels I've seen in the past.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, YOU are the protangonist, the actual YOU. You enter your name and everything (You seem to be american regardless though from what I can tell. Eh, close enough). You also at certain times select your answer to questions asked to you which will affect the last the options you get on the last question you are given. Thankfully these questions aren't entirely entirely cut and dry, you need to know the person well in order to get the best results; you may even need to restart in order to get a ending you missed ( there's 4 of 'em by the way ;) ).\n\n[h1][b][u]THE BAD STUFF[/u][/b][/h1]\nWhile I LOVE this fricking VN, does have it's flaws.\n\n- The YOU is very stereotyped, I never thought this to be a problem myself however I understand how this could be a downside for some people.\n\n- While the lovey-dovey parts of the VN aren't cheesy at all since they are far from drawn out (hell, there're a little too short) however, beyond that there is the odd corny line or two.\n\n- JAPANESE PROPAGANDA!!! In the context of the VN it does make sense since you are a forgiener thats studying in Japan; and regardless, the odd bit of country marketing can't hurt. It happens a little too much here for my liking.\n\n- One of the endings made me cry! REALLY! I'LL NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN!\n\n[h1][b][u]VERDICT[/u][/b][/h1]\nI loved this VN more than I thought I was going to by a longshot.

The stories don't really resolve well, instead ending abruptly with endings that feel more tacked-on than achieved through any form of progression. Stories end when the characters either realize they love each other, or some singular event happens. The ending is just a quick, few-minute epilogue that wraps everything up in a little bow. Aoi's story is the strongest, while Karin's feels unfinished and Sakura's feels more like an after-school special with a dollop of copout ending than a VN route. \n\n- Music is okay at first, but then starts to grate on your nerves after hearing the same bland tracks over and over. If you want music that will actually move you, this isn't the game for that; you'd best play Katawa Shoujo or any Key game. \n\n- Characters are stock. They react to your character's fumblings unrealistically and are borderline saints in how they tolerate his cultural faux pas. The protagonist is the only legitimate character (Aoi is in second place), and everyone else (again, other than Aoi) feel like stock puppets through which he can grow, rather than characters with their own dreams and desires. There is real effort in making them shine here, but quirks don't really make a character, and it falls flat. \n\n- There are no branching paths, no bad ends, no extra endings. You pick choices to determine whether you can pick the girl's route...and then that's it. This would be fine if the routes were longer and more involved, but seeing as they're not...yeah, it feels a little hollow. \n\n- The character designs are boring, for the most part. \n\n- This game is far too expensive for what you're getting. Fifteen dollars for maybe nine hours of gameplay? (Most of my hours were spent idle since I walked away from the keyboard several times while playing it) You're better off getting Planetarian or HuniePop to get the most out of your money. \n\nI wanted to like this a lot more than I did.

I must say it is darn impressive.\n\nHave you ever wonder what it is feel like to be a anime character or wish you want to be an anime guy surrounded by gorgeous anime girls. Well, this is as close as you can get. \n\nThe story is well written. It is so well written that it put most triple A developer to shame, It makes some of the triple A writers looks like they are bad students trying to save their failing grade with last minute work hoping it would fool the teachers to giving them a passing grade. \n\nIt starts off with the usual anime gimmick such as running into girls and feel their breast, walking into the bathroom while they are getting ready for bath (no nudity or sex in this game/ sorry guys) and spilling drink onto girls. After that, one of the main characters go angry. Just the usual anime gimmicks but tons and tons of hilarity like how the anime characters should react.\n\nThe Emote - engine really shines in this interactive media and this is one of very few subtle but KEY ELEMENTS in this type of interactive media. You can read such slight gesture such as nodding off early in the morning or when making emotional connection, the slight gesture, body language and movement really makes a world of difference between a good game and absolute stinker. It is just so absolutely DELICIOUS seeing all those small signs and perks.\n\nIn summary, think of it like romantic version of Telltale games.

Die Story ist mal etwas anders, anstatt das man einfach in eine Person reingeworfen wird die schon zur Schule geht usw, spielt man hier als Protagonist einen Jungen Mann der wie es aussieht nicht in Japan lebt sondern f\u00fcr \"2 Monate\" nach Japan f\u00e4hrt. Mehr will ich aber auch nicht sagen. \n\nDie Animation war total mein Fall! Ich finde es wunderbar wenn sich die Charaktere bewegen. \n\nDie Romanzen und die Storys waren einmalig. Es wurde lustig, traurig, dramatisch. Sehr gelungen.\n\nDie Musik, und die Stimmen waren ebenso super. Es hat an einfach nichts gefehlt.\n\nUnd nach dem man mit allen 3 durchgespielt hat, bekommt man noch ein \"kleines\" Extra.

So far I have only played through one of the girls stories completly and that took me around 8 hours. Not too bad for the price alone, and I do look forward to the other 2 girls stories, though to be honest I didnt really find any of the girls likeable enough to motivate me to go through theirs. I only finished the one girls story because I had to choose one.\n\nWhich brings me to the biggest issues with this game. Path branching. There are a fair number of times that you are given multiple choices on what you want to say, but as far as I could tell, nothing changes, and there is only one point when if matters what you pick, and its so obvious that it takes away the fun. It literally says, choose one of the three girls... \nSo why even give us choices before that point? \n\nOn top of that, some of the conflicts the protaganist finds himself in are so mild, but played off to being incredibly serious that it can be cringe worthy at times. (Particularly when talking about being cute, or being cool)\nThis wouldnt bother me, if that was just a small issue in a deep story, or even if they made them react a little more realistically, its just that the issues feel so...

I am neither proud nor ashamed of what I have done, but after much reflecting, I feel like I am qualified enough to add some insightful input to those wondering whether they should buy this title. So far I have completed nearly all three storylines (as far as I know), and I am pretty sure that there is only one ending for each path. I may be wrong about this, but the story only has one crucial decision that decides which girl you fall for, and there are no \"bad-endings\".\n\nI have not played many Visual Novel games in my time, but my first \"legitimate\" one was Katawa Shoujo (which I enjoyed thoroughly). Katawa Shoujo may have spoiled what I expected from any VN game afterwards, so try to understand things from my point of view. \n\nTokyo School Life is a visual novel game where the protagonist (you) is on a two month trip to Japan as an exchange student from the USA. You have loved and admired Japan since childhood, and it has always been your dream to one day take a trip there. You taught yourself how to speak Japanese from watching anime, and have been talking with an old man you call \"Sensei\" about his time here. When you arrive, you are excited to experience all the great Japanese culture, visit some great landmarks, and most of all meet some cute girls. Early on in the game you have some bad first encounters with who will later be your love interests, and your roommates. You are staying in a dorm at a shrine with three other girls, and no supervising adults, so go at it. What will your life be like here in Japan? Will you get what you came for, or will the reality of Japan crush your weaboo heart?\n\n\nPros: (I don't have a lot to say about the pros, they are pretty basic points).\n\n- The female characters are likeable, and have nice personalities along with being attractive (by art standards). They all have strong characteristics, and I found them to be relatively original (design-wise).\n\n- The art is well done, and the animation aspect is a nice touch to the usual static image that I am used to. The character art is fantastic, and the backgrounds are pretty nice.\n\n- The voice acting was spot on, and though I don't understand Japanese, I feel like the voices added a lot to the experience and provided a more immersive environment.\n\n-  The music is catchy, and even f you don't enjoy it, you can mute it or wait the until the scene changes.\n\n- There are some moments where the game teaches you things about Japan, but the information is nothing special.\n\nCons: (I have a lot more to say here, but that's only because the problems are easier to go into than the positives.)\n\n- The protagonist (who you play as) is pretty unlikeable, and hard to relate with. He could say some dumb things, and despite his extensive knowledge of Japan, and that he learned to speak Japanese fluently FROM WATCHING ANIME (If this is even possible, he would have to have watched more anime than I can fathom), he was kind of clueless about some pretty basic stuff. This protagonist was supposed to represent you, as you name him, and you are unable to see what he looks like to allow yourself to picture him being you. This is fine and dandy, but not in the way they presented him. I felt like I was being misrepresented, and would have probably enjoyed it much more if the protagonist was his own seperate person, instead of trying to be me.\n\n- I felt like the content was lacking in a way, and not necessarily in volume or play time. The story seemed rushed, and it could have definitely flowed better into a more coherent story line (my opinion, not fact). A lot of the game was often times charming, but it could also prove to be redundant, and some moments felt like filler material that wasn't really adding anything to the experience.\n\n- Building off of my last point, I think the story paths ended abruptly, and were pretty unsatisfying, causing me to want more, or at least better closure. The credits hit you like a brick wall, and I never expected them to pop up when they did. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say anything more about this.\n\n- There are only really four characters in this game, though some background characters show up as just lines of text, you never see anyone besides the three main girls or the people who were a part of the background image. I feel like a little more character variety would have been a huge positive to the game, but I can see from a development standpoint why this could be difficult.\n\n- As I said before, I am pretty sure the outcome of the story depends solely on one decision, but I have not tried every option to test this theory. The girl that you get based on that decision is pretty obvious, since each of the options has a picture of the girl. Also, though this isn't EXACTLY a con, the decision making is extremely easy. It is not hard to pick the best thing to say if you actually know what's going on, and each choice is accompanied by a sound (or lack thereof). The best option has the loudest sound, and the worst one will have no sound at all, so you are basically told whether you made the right choice or not right after making it.\n\nAll in all, this isn't any complex, thought-provoking read; but it is charming and enjoyable. If you're an expert visual novelist with high-standards, this probably isn't for you, but if you want to waste a good 14 hours pretending to talk with cute anime babes, that's a different story.", "timestamp_created": 1424128175, "timestamp_updated": 1424297210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830836", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14502090": {"recommendationid": "14502090", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974965663", "num_games_owned": 479, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457046484}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u5168\u4f53\u7684\u306b\u77ed\u3081\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\uff0c\u306c\u308b\u306c\u308b\u52d5\u304f\u53ef\u611b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u306f\u9a5a\u304b\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff0e\n\u3053\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u306f\u8cb7\u3044\u3067\uff08*\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff09 \uff7d", "timestamp_created": 1424108710, "timestamp_updated": 1424108710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14499565": {"recommendationid": "14499565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162519308", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424134534}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9GAL\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u6700\u8fd1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b89\u5fc3\u63a8\u4e00\u90e8GAL\u771f\u662f\u592a\u597d\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1424099022, "timestamp_updated": 1424099022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14499183": {"recommendationid": "14499183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096014532", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426989903}, "language": "english", "review": "This Vn is amazingly good.

This game is great! The day it came out, I was a little skeptical... But after staying up all the way till 4am, my judgement was gone and I bought it... NO. REGRETS.\n\nTokyo School Life is a Visual Novel of the bishoujo variety (It's basically a dating sim where you choose between several dialogue lines and those affect the girl that falls in love with you).\n\nIf you're here for Hentai, go on the internet, play NEKOPARA (not the steam version lol), I don't care. This is not where you will get it: There is NO patch, this game was not intended as an Eroge, it was intended as a heartwarming story!\n\nYou play as (Your Name Here. Yes. I'm serious!). Or atleast an 18 Year Old *What If...* version of yourself. The canon name is John Smith so let's call him John-san! You find out that the best student in class gets to go to a Japanese High School for 2 months, so you study your ass off and WIN! You get on a plane, hoping to find your sweet kawaii waifu.\n\nOn the way, you meet Karin, Aoi and Sakura (In that order), three girls with different personalities, who surprise, surprise! They are the ONLY people who live in your dorm! That sneaky perv sensei... I'm not complaining though.\n\nDepending on your choices (that are pretty obvious by the way, because the character's eyes blink like little stars if your answer pleases them...) and Depending on dialogue your final choice is locked. Normally that pisses me off, like those inFAMOUS endings... But here it actually makes sense! I won't spoil it for you though.\n\nGameplay wise, it's pretty damn solid! The story is funny, especially the iPad chat sessions between the girls discussing your choices (Gossip is so fun!). The E-mote technology, seen before in Nekopara, is actually more fluid and realistic now, sadly, there is no breat bounciness gauge. 0/10 would not bang again! Just kidding lol.\nAlso, I heard there is no fullscreen function unless you enter ALT+Enter, I have to check on that... So I can't really subtract points based on that.\nThere is some mild humour, especially involving otaku culture, so that's pretty cool.\nYou can go up to 900 saves, so that's pretty cool, and the languages in the game are great! You can also set the textbox speed to match the voices from the characters, so if you want to train Japanese, this isn't good for basics, but it's great for advanced learners.\n\nBad Things:\n\nThe voice acting is epic. If you don't like it, you can disable particular characters. That's right. Love Karin's, but hate Aoi's childish voice? Disable her voice.\nHowever, only these three have a voice. John-san doesn't have a voice, and that's great, because it's supposed to be you, and a Japanese voice would ruin the immersion. But even NEKOPARA had voices for the side characters, like the Moving Truck Guy...\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nTokyo School Life is good.

of this game) but then i did choose to go with Sakura she was cute mysterious, it even made me smile when she was happy, but after getting known to her illness i was really sad and i did really develop something for an fictional character, her story was so amazing and it made me cry after the end i thought she died i cryed actually, but after the caracter returns to japan and meets sakura i was like oh my god.., i cryed after seeing her again, and honestly if you would release the soundtrack on steam id buy it, ill give everyone an advice get the game you wont regret it.\n\n",

lips are synched to the voice.  It's really nice to the point that I'm wondering how I managed to play visual novels without these feature.\n\nI mean, I had a chance to see a sleepy girl totter back and forth in the early morning.  10/10 too cute.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nAn exchange student gets a chance to study abroad in Japan for two months.  I haven't really played much yet but it seems to do a fairly good job expressing what a newcomer with some preparation would feel when they visit Japan.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far it's kind funny how it's done, but you're definitely mistreated at the beginning.\n\nI'm not sure how long the game is yet.\n\n[u]Sound[/u]\nSchool life music.  Background sounds.  Female voice only.  The voice acting fits the characters.\n\n[u]Translation[/u]\nThe English that I've seen so far is quite good.  This quality may change later but for now I'll give it a pass.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThis game has some interesting features not found in run-of-the-mill visual novels.  As mentioned before, the animated sprites are one of them.  And not just blinking and lip moving, but entire expressive motions...like head tilting, nodding, shaking, characters bouncing energetically, eyes sparkling, characters swaying sleepily...\n\nI also like the smartphone conversations that appear occasionally.  It's fun watching the text scroll up as each girl adds their input to the conversation.  It's almost like a real chat in progress.\n\n[u]Misc Notes[/u]\nThe history has a neat feature where you can replay a previous moment in time if you click on that panel.

"Pretty solid VN so far. E-mote does indeed make it look really smooth. There's a lot of body movement for VN characters (think hands, arms, boobs) and facial expressions as well. It's very lively and aims to be funny. The dialogue may seem a little bit childish at times, though. This game is comparable to Go! Go! Nippon! in a way that they both tell you some informational/interesting stuff about Japan's culture or history inbetween character interaction, but it doesn't go as deep. For example, it doesn't tell you how to get to certain places, how much certain things costs, where to get a Suica card, etc. The main focus are the three girls.\n\nWhat's nice, though, is that it has multiple text options as it says in the description. If you're learning Japanese, this is extremely useful. What's even better is that the 3 main girls are fully voiced, so you can hear them talk Japanese and at the same time have the text in the chat menu display in English or Romaji and the additional text (in the top left corner of the screen) display in Japanese or hiragana (or any other combination of the 4).\n\nHowever, if you're not learning Japanese, or you're already extremely good at speaking/reading it, the price might seem a little too high. Overall, as somebody who recently started learning Japanese, I do recommend this game and I'm very sure I can learn quite a few things from it.", "timestamp_created": 1423790699, "timestamp_updated": 1423790956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794317", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14440098": {"recommendationid": "14440098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987184561", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480260801}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u7a93\u3068\u30b5\u30d6\u7a93\u3067\u9055\u3046\u8a00\u8a9e\u9078\u3079\u308b\u306e\u3067\u89aa\u5207\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\uff08\u7c89\u307f\u304b\u3093\n\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u524d\u306bSteam\u3067\u51fa\u305f\u67d0\u30cd\u30b3\u30b2\u30fc\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u305fe-mote\u304c\u3044\u3044\u5473\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3002\n\u5b9f\u7e3e\u3068\u304b\u30c8\u30ec\u30ab\u3068\u304b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3089\u3082\u3063\u3068\u826f\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3002\n\u30cf\u30fc\u30ec\u30e0\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3068\u5b09\u3057\u3044\u306a\u3041\uff08\uff81\uff97\uff6f\n\n\n\n\u6771\u4eac\u821e\u53f0\u306b\u3057\u305f\u89b3\u5149\u30b2\u30fc\uff08\uff1f\uff09\u306f\u305f\u307e\u306b\u307f\u308b\u3051\u3069\u4ed6\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u5730\u57df\u30b2\u30fc\u3082\u3084\u3063\u3066\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u79c1\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1423790387, "timestamp_updated": 1423791458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14439995": {"recommendationid": "14439995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093146971", "num_games_owned": 1682, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423789847}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\uff0c\u6ca1\u9519\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u6761\u4e2d\u6587\u8bc4\u6d4b", "timestamp_created": 1423789854, "timestamp_updated": 1423789854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446186", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14439866": {"recommendationid": "14439866", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982837520", "num_games_owned": 821, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424047102}, "language": "english", "review": "Tokyo School Life,\n\nIs it corny, is it cliche, is it..?\nI don't need to continue upon that, because it is.\n\nAnd..\n\nHa ha ha, hell yea, this is fun.

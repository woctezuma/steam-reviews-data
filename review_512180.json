The only thing i did not like about it is that it ends!\nIt's written really, really well. The style of writing fits the story setting and yet isn't very hard to read. Jokes, dramatic moments, romantic moments - they're all executed perfectly and you never feel disappointed in a scene. The plot itself is well-thought and getting through every mystery was really rewarding. \nThe characters are super likeable, I loved every single of them. Even not romanceable characters are awesome and I found myself really attached to them. I can honestly say i love the whole main cast. The heroine is amazing too, and I got really attached to her, cheering her on as the story progressed. \nThe artworks are amazing, as they are drawn by one of my favourite artists, Teita. Both sprites and CGs are excellent and I always paused the game for a while when i got to a new illustration, just to admire how pretty it is. Sprites, CGs, backgrounds and UI are all really well thought and fit together perfectly, creating a good visual experience too.\nThe soundtrack is very good too, and certainly adds value to the game. Popular, skilled Japanese voice actors don't disappoint and I might have replayed some lines just because they vere perfectly executed. Especially in dramatic moments voices added so much depth and feelings into scenes. \nOverall, I consider this game one of the best otome games available in English at the moment. Seeing how the price is not that big, I find it a must-have for every otome lover's game library.

Anyone who's looking for otome game based around this time period should definiately consider Nightshade. I was just browsing otome games on steam hoping to find something I might like and the time period + character selection attracted my attention. For one I actually really loved the designs for ALL characters so I decided to give it a chance and I most certainly do not regret the (still) high price (even with 20% off sale). The voices are phenomenal and I certainly swore I recognized some of the VA's. They all sound so great. Hanzo's VA sounding like Chikage from Hakuoki(Same VA? idk) and Kurohyuki reminding me of Toudou Heisuke from Wasurenagusa(I dont think it was the same VA tho. They just sound VERY similar) were my favorites. Goremon's voice was great too. It sounds so pleasing to listen to. Another recognizable VA would be Choujiro's VA who also voices Shuu from Diabolik Lovers and Saito Hajime from Hakuoki. So if you're a fan of one of them all the more reason to give this game a chance.\n\nAs of now I'm at the end of Kurohyuki's route and it's the only route I've actually played so far on my first run, I am thoroughly enjoying every moment of it and found myself sinking 6 hours in it alone playing it well into the night 2 nights in a row. It's that good. I'm pretty satisfied with the amount of CGs. Compared to most games I've played this game is pretty generous with CGs. Yeah sure its still not a whole lot but its certainly more than some games.

I was a fool; it's worth it. \n\nNightshade is, without question or doubt, my favorite game in this genre. Over the past year, I think I've played the bulk of the (localized) big hitters of otome: Amnesia, Hakuoki, a host of other Idea Factory / Otomate offerings on Vita (Norn9, Code Realize, Period Cube, Collar Malice, Bad Apple Wars, etc). I've played indie projects-- Cinderella Phenomenon, Cinders, Rose of Winter, Hustle Cat, Hatoful Boyfriend. Many I liked; some I loathed (Ozmafia!, lookin' at you). Nightshade, in my opinion, stands apart from them all, particularly for its well-developed and motivated characters, intelligently supported (if still unapologetically soapy) plot, lovely, lovely art, and inoffensive, even pleasant, sound design.\n\nMore detail:\n\nTo start, I really appreciate the protagonist, Enju. By necessity, the player character in the majority of romantic visual novels is a cypher best, if not solely, described as a Nice Girl. She wishes to avoid making waves, she wants to please everyone, she's shy but loves her friends: she is a perfectly normal, extremely contrived, HGTV nondescript beige intended for any player to step into and feel more or less at home. Moreover, to work through setting up the story's exposition, she must be oddly unfamiliar with the world she inhabits, unable to fend for herself (not to say incompetent, but...), and generally know as little as possible about anything. This narrative ignorance is even more crucial in the context of the character's relationships: to maximize the story's romantic arc, she must be in some conflict with the object of her affection, and since she's a Nice Girl, that restriction means conflict must usually come from her exaggerated modesty and shyness, and/or the gentleman's being Not Nice. Suffice to say: there's a narrative reason for all the bouts of convenient amnesia in these games, and there's likewise a reason for those tsundere lads that make Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy look like a sweet social butterfly. \n\nEnju is unquestionably a Nice Girl. But here's the thing that Nightshade does best, in part because I rarely see it done anywhere else: while Enju bears a superficial resemblance to her sisters in the genre, unlike many of them, she is a well-developed character with reasoned basis for those traits. Instead of incompetent, she is inexperienced; instead of merely ignorant, she is sheltered; instead of vague helplessness, she is tripped up by her own insecurities. That might sound like splitting hairs, until you are asked to find the trait relatable-- I'd argue that there's hope for a strong arc in a flawed character that is inexperienced, sheltered, and insecure, thrust into a harsh world beyond their ken; an incompetent, ignorant, and helpless character has a more bleak outlook, and I would consider them less \"flawed\" than flat and underdeveloped. Enju feels like a person, and if her starting point is inauspicious, she has a good distance to travel on her journey in character as much as geography.\n\nThis extends to every part of the writing, character and narrative both. No one in this game is perfect. The best shinobi of all time isn't going to have the best social skills; the cleverest flirt isn't going to be right in each assessment; that childhood friend that sets out to protect you from anything and everything bad is really doing you a disservice. This isn't a game that relies on a deus ex machina to save the day (mostly), and it doesn't assume that romance is summarized by a nice kiss at the end of a story-long misunderstanding: these characters have to get to know one another, develop trust, and we, the player, have to care about it. \n\nTo that end, the story is easy to follow, and everyone has a full motive when they take an action. There's no weird technology from the future that's really the past, no vampires, no magical girls, no amnesia. There's death in this game, and it has heft and consequences, [spoiler]not least when Enju herself kills someone[/spoiler]. Depending on who Enju is running with, tragedy may well lace even an otherwise officially \"happy\" ending. But none of the drama feels like it's just for show here, to me: when you take the characters given-- flawed individuals with histories that extend beyond the start of the game and desires that exist outside of their pants-- and put them into the narrative, what follows are the consequences of specific personalities, with different motives, morality, values, and abilities, tested in specific ways. No route is wrong, no route is \u2018golden\u2019. Some routes, friends die; in some, the bad guy gets away. \n\nIn sum: Nightshade is that rare, special otome that is complex in a good way, with a layered but tidy plot and well developed characters, not excluding the player character. The romance and the plot are balanced and pleasantly nuanced. It isn't the greatest love story ever told, but I'd gladly argue it's the best I've found in this medium.", "timestamp_created": 1512204160, "timestamp_updated": 1512204160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37850807": {"recommendationid": "37850807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348526362", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511843077}, "language": "english", "review": "In the progress of getting 100% :D \n\nRoutes finished; Goemon Ishikawa & Hanz\u014d Hattori\nWill then do (when I feel like it)\n1.

know if I can recommend this game ...\nThe art, music, voices and history, I loved it all.\nThe characters are all gorgeous, and well fleshed.\nThere are a few typos but nothing disturbing.\nThere is a lot of saves, and the secondary characters are really endearing (especially Kasumi, Ennosuke and Kyara, I love you guys!).\nThey are 13 chapters more or less for each character, English is not my native language so I took a little longer but I would say you have at least 10 hours with each character.\nI really liked Hanzo and Goemon and their stories, I recommend them a lot!\n\nIf you want to skip fast, you must also change the autoplay setting, I did not realize immediately, so it was a little bothersome.\n\nAnd now my biggest complaint: I HATED the stories of Gekkamaru, Chojiro and Kuroyuki.\nKuroyuki is despicable, but it's just my opinion ([spoiler]I do not like yandere that gives my MC Stockholm\u2019s syndrome[/spoiler]).\nAnd if you want a happy ending, do not play the stories of Gekkamaru and Chojiro ([spoiler]almost everyone in their stories dies .... Except the lovers, thankfully![/spoiler])\nI ended up skipping almost everything in their stories, I was so fed up!\n\nSo ... I'm half happy ... When I buy a game otome, I do not want to cry or be upset; I want a nice story.

Even for some of the routes, the events through the happy ending could make a grown man cry. Usually, an otoge would also have quite a predictable storyline, and in this case, there were some elements that were expected, but there were also so many twists that just slapped me across the face with no warning what so ever. At the same time, looking back, those twists were tied together nicely with the premise before.\n\nThere were, however, flaws in the composition of the story. The pace sometimes felt a bit too fast, or sometimes it felt like they were including unecessary scenes (honestly, there was way to much time spent on exagerating how the MC is a nice, merciful human). The flow didn't feel as comfortable as it would with something like a good anime. It's not the pinnacle of storytelling, but they did do quite well.\n\nThe characters (ahem- apart from Enju-) are well developed and extremely human. I honestly would pay for a DLC or sth with Kyara and Ieyasu as playable routes. There is well-timed humour, which is genuinely funny and endearing at the same time. The OST pulls together the mood nicely, and the voice acting is on. fucking. point. Especially Hanzo's. (tho the downside is that I couldn't bear to skip the dialogue like usually do just to hear the 10/10 voice acting). And you can probably see how beautiful the art is from the images on steam- it's consistantly high quality in game. \n\nAlthough, I have to say, the heroine can sometimes be extremely infuriating- she does have her times when she pulls through and is strong, but for alot of the storyline she cowers and has a weak personality which is really stereotypical for an otoge heroine.

I\u2019m talking in terms of everything. The combination of everything together was simply divine. \n\nI didn\u2019t think it would hit be in the feels - both happy and sad - as much as it has, but it surpassed it all.  \n\nThis game has been on my Steam wishlist for a while until a few days ago when I decided to play it on a whim.  \n\nI\u2019m so glad I did because it took my breathe away. \n\nThis game is a Japanese PSvita game that is now available in both English and Japanese on Steam. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend you play it. \nThe common route may be a bit slow-paced, but trust me. Once you get into the individual routes you\u2019re in for the shock - and happiness - of your life.  \n\nI\u2019m going to break it into categories to try to make some more sense about how fantastic this game is. \nSo\u2026 whether you\u2019ve played it or not, I hope you enjoy (:\n\nThe Plot:\n\nThe story follows our heroine, Enju (name can be changed but otherwise will be voiced) - born in the union between two clans. Being the leader\u2019s daughter, she\u2019s the princess of her village. But she\u2019s also a shinobi (Ninja). Or at least, she desperately wants to be. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing Enju wants more than prove her worth to her village. \nWhen our story begins, she finally gets her chance. She, along with a few of her friends, are to be set on a mission in the city of Kyo. \nBut things are not what they seem. And something terrible hides in the shadows. \nWho will Enju become? And who will she choose to go on this journey with her?\n\nThe common route starts slow and steady with a few action-scenes in between. It consists on 4 chapters. The choices you make during those times will decide which guy you\u2019ll end up with.  \nThe individual routes are fast-paced and very\u2026 shocking. You\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll cry, you\u2019ll love, you\u2019ll feel. For everyone in this game. \n\nI suggest you save the game in the beginning of each new chapter, as well as Quick save whenever presented with a choice in case you haven\u2019t chosen the \u201cright\u201d one and want to go back to change it. \n\nYou\u2019ll know you made the \u201cright\u201d choice when you see glowing flowers in front of your chosen character. \n\nIn the common route, the character you earn most affection (flowers) with is the one you\u2019ll end up with. \n\nThe plot of this game sounds easy-enough, but trust me when I say you will not\u2026 see what\u2019s coming. \n\nPrepare yourselves. \n\nThe Characters:\n\nHanzo: The strongest shinobi of his time. Believes in following the mission, no matter what. Is harsh, yet kind. Is serious, yet boyish. Gives you space to grow into yourself, yet is there whenever you need him. \n\nMy thoughts: Hnazo was the best route of this game. And one of the best characters I\u2019ve ever seen in otome games. \nI had a feeling he was going to be a good one, I just had no idea he was going to blow me away. \n\nThey are, simply put, the best for each other. In so many ways.\n\nKuroyuki: The childhood friend you haven\u2019t seen in 8 years. He\u2019s a tease, he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s forward, he\u2019s endearing. But is he the same boy you used to know? And what exactly happened to him during those 8 long years? \n\nMy thoughts: Kuroyuki\u2019s route was\u2026 pretty dark. In terms of character-development and romance. That being said - I ended up falling for him (probably against my better judgment). \n\ni can\u2019t say anything more here due to spoilers, but\u2026 just know you may experience annoyance, anger, but warm and fuzzy feelings at the end. \n\nPlaying him after Hanzo may cause you to think \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with you, Protagonist?!\u201d since the protagonist acts differently in each route - but especially between Hanzo and Kuroyuki\u2019s route. \nThat being said, bear with it. It\u2019s worth it (at least to me it was).\n\nGoro: a flirtatious stranger you meet when you get to the city of Kyo. He\u2019s always there to help, give advice, and make you smile. \n\nMy thoughts: While Goro isn\u2019t my usual type of otome guy, I found the lightheartedness of his route to be refreshing, much needed, and sweet. \nI would actually suggest playing him last if you wish you leave the game on the lightest of notes. \nI found his route to be a solid one and quite enjoyable (: \n\nChojiro: Your cousin and teacher. He\u2019s the one who taught you everything you know about being a shinobi. Much like Hanzo, he believes the way of the shinobi is finishing the mission no matter what, or die trying. \n\nMy thoughts: Chojiro\u2019s route was a good one, but could have been better. I found it to be lacking - but mostly overwhelming - in many ways. \nIt\u2019s\u2026 dark. Unlike with Kuroyuki, Chojiro\u2019s route is dark in terms of plot. Prepare yourselves with some tissues. \n\nGekkamaru: Your second childhood friend. The one who\u2019s been with you all this time. He\u2019s your bodyguard, your shield, and your protector. And he\u2019s always there when you need him - and even when you don\u2019t. He\u2019s the only one who goes above and beyond for you - even when it\u2019s not his own route. \n\nMy thoughts: At first, I didn\u2019t think I was going to like Gekkamaru\u2019s route. He was way over-protective, as well as not my usual otome guy type. But. It took me one time seeing him in the other routes to know I was going to like him. And I was not mistaken. This guy is the only one that\u2019s always there for the protagonist - no matter what. In every\u2026 single\u2026 route. \n\nI ended up loving Gekkamru very much so (!). He\u2019s definitely one of the best routes of this game, and his route answers - and deals with - the most questions.\n\nRecommended play-through (in terms of spoilers), would be: Hanzo - Goro - Kuroyuki - Chojiro - Gekkamaru. \nOf course, you can switch up between Hanzo and Goro as well as between Chojiro and Gekkamaru. \nOr, you can play the game however you like - although I actually suggest playing Chojiro and Gekkamaru routes last. \nPersonally, I played the game like this: Hanzo - Kuroyuki - Goro - Chojiro - Gekkamaru. \nSo it\u2019s really up to you (:\n\nI ended up loving them like this (from most favorite): Hanzo - Kuroyuki - Gekkamaru - Goro - Chojiro. \n\nThe Protagonist: \n\nEnju was, without a doubt (and yes, I\u2019m probably using this phrase a lot lately, sorry), one of the best things about this game. And I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve said this often about an otome game protagonists. \n\nShe was at her very best in Hanzo\u2019s route, but in every route she always showed us that fighting spirit of hers - the will to live and fight. \nAnd I couldn\u2019t help but love her for that. \n\nShe was obviously very mentally strong, but she was also physically capable of fighting - she just never knew she had it in her. \n\nWhat I admire most about a protagonist is their fighting spirit. Be in mentally, physically, or both, the will of the protagonist can do wonders to a game. \n\nAnother thing: in otome games, it\u2019s important to remember you can\u2019t just develop the romance-able characters, you have to develop the protagonist throughout the game, too. Which is something i found lacking in many games, but not in Nightshade. Not at all.\n\nSo\u2026 WELL DONE. \nYou went above and beyond for this protagonist. You made her the kind of protagonist I was proud to play as a character, and not just for the romance-able ones. \n\nWhen I think of this game, I end up not thinking about the guys - although I do - but of Enju (:\n\nThe Art:\n\nThe art\u2026 was\u2026 divine. \nThe scenery was breathtaking. \nEvery time I saw it I had to take it in for a few moments. \nIt was so beautiful, it felt so magical yet so real, that I could literally see myself walking these paths, breathing that air, and missing a time I was never part of. \n\nFor the rest of the review: https://selia707.tumblr.com/post/167262352557/nightshade-otome-game-review", "timestamp_created": 1509978484, "timestamp_updated": 1510130551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36236034": {"recommendationid": "36236034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112837237", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "last_played": 1513883508}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich kann nur so viel sagen.

The art is absolutely gorgeous at first glance and I found myself eagerly returning to play just for that reason alone. \n\nThe reason I like Nightshade so much is because the main 5 routes are not the only thing that it has going for them. Sure, I cried over the beautifully written main characters, but the side characters, Kyara, Ennosuke and Kasumi are nothing to turn your nose up at. They have a large part in making me bawl my eyes out almost every route. \n\nSurprisingly enough, I like the MC that you play as too; quite a lot. She has a reputation of being a quiet, but dedicated clan member - the daughter of the clan leader - and one of her things that I was instantly drawn to, is that she feels like she owes her clan absolutely everything, just for supporting her. Further in, it becomes apparent that she feels frustrated when she becomes a liability and will do just about anything to be useful. Depending on what route you choose, she can become a confident, assertive shinobi, or an uncertain, reliant on everyone person.\n\nSpeaking of which, the story is superb! Kudos to the writing team for thinking of something a little more imaginative than just your plain old 'she's a traitor, kill her'. I won't give too much away, but depending on the route that you choose early on, impacts which of the two stories are used (this will make sense after you play all the routes).\n\nAnd the story...\n\nThere is no lack of content. Seriously. My first session which involved 1 and a half routes, was 915 minutes long. I kid you not. I played this beautiful game for the entire day because I just couldn't rip myself away from it. The music, the SFX, the characters and story THEY ARE ALL AT THE BEST QUALITY.\n\nI didn't think that a VN would ever be able to pull off an intense fight scene, but thanks to the actual stakes of the fight, coupled with an MC WHO ACTUALLY FIGHTS WELL, I found myself enjoying the quicker paced scenes more than I thought I would. As another reviewer said before me THIS GAME MAKES STATIC ART INTERESTING. The use of the space was utilized to its utmost best. \n\nPacing is good. The art. I've already gone off about it once, but I have never taken so many screenshots in a game before - and sometimes it was just of the same character with a different pose, or against a different background. Teita is a genius. I'll say this, if this game ever gets adapted into an anime, it would be worth the watch just for the art alone.\n\nBonus content awaits you after finishing one ending of a route which is very, VERY nice. Should I mention that you can choose which of the voice actors narrates the main menu? Because that's a thing.\n\nSpeaking of voice actors, THEY ARE SHINING GEMS. I could listen to their voices forever (shoutout to Kuroyuki's VA).\n\nIn conclusion, if you are a fan of otome games - perhaps Hakuouki in particular - then absolutely get Nightshade. I too, was a little 'is it REALLY worth it' over the slightly higher price compared to other titles, but I am completely and utterly satisfied with the product that I received, and I know I'll be playing this for many more tear-filled hours, long after I've received all the endings.

Despert\u00e9 a las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana del sabado y desde ese momento no he podido dejar de jugarlo...no cre\u00ed sentirme tan afectada por la historia, en el punto de sentir un ataque de ansiedad porque no puedo ayudar al chico que escog\u00ed, estoy consciente de que es un personaje ficticio., sin embargo el apego emocional...oh boi.\n\nLas historias son complejas, todas tienen un comienzo base. Adem\u00e1s de que aunque eligas a cierto chico, vas a seguir descubriendo cosas de los dem\u00e1s aunque no sea su historia. \nDe algo estoy segura y es de que tienen un toque agridulce la mayor\u00eda de las historias, lo cual es bueno, no todo en la vida es miel sobre hojuelas, y m\u00e1s si terminas con un final bueno, habr\u00e1 valido la pena la monta\u00f1a rusa.\nEn cu\u00e1nto a la personalidad del MC, realemente no me hizo feliz ya que tiende a depender de los dem\u00e1s, adem\u00e1s de no ser fuerte, sumando la edad y las pocas cosas que sabe hacer...de verdad no me hace feliz, pero tiene momentos en donde pareciera que sabe lo que hace.\nEl dise\u00f1o del juego es muy bonito, en especial los personajes, ya que parpadean y se pueden ver las emociones, adem\u00e1s de la voz, lo cual lo hace muy especial, el sentimiento detr\u00e1s de la voz, la m\u00fasica de fondo y la historia lo complementan muy bien. Hay varias escenograf\u00edas repetidas, pero es algo menor.\nLos personajes ambientan bien el juego, algunos son predecibles. Cada chico tiene lo suyo (obviamente) pero realmente llegas a conocerlo bien (y a enamorarte con un ligero toque de dependencia ficticia).\n\nHabr\u00e1 personas que tengan m\u00e1s experiencia en este g\u00e9nero, sin embargo lo disfrut\u00e9 mucho, y aun lo sigo haciendo. <3", "timestamp_created": 1507584722, "timestamp_updated": 1511663645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Several routes had bittersweet moments, which kudos to that because there is no such thing as a super happy ending.

I'm totally confessing all my love to this game.\nAt first I was ready to sell my soul to all possible demons just for Kuroyuki's smile. This boy is way to adorable.\nThen Hanzo made me fall in love with him truly madly deeply (always liked serious, adult men). I would stay with him forever and ever. His bad ending just tore me apart and ripped my heart out.\nBut after that Goemon completely stole me (literally). This notorious thief has best story line (my opinion). I  never thought I will enjoy this kind of personality, he truly is amazing. \nGekkamaru is so warm and reliable. The one who will stay. He was lovely in his own way and made me chuckle a lot. \nAnd Brother Chojiro. I can say he was my least favorite, but he was great as well. \n\nBasically this game offers a man to any liking. They are all wonderful and different. \nFinally MC is not too annoying. I even agreed with her sometimes (it is rare for otome).  Of course sheepish base of personality is there, but MC is developing herself and growing during all story lines (especially Hanzo's route).   \n\nHigh level voice acting. Hanzo's voice gave me shivers and Goemon's voice relaxed me in some way.\nOutstanding character designs and artwork. Each guy looked attractive and gain interest at first.(but that Kuroyuki's smile and Hanzo's furrowed eyebrows, damn!)\nGreat opening soundtrack (can't stop listening) and background music finally is not annoying at otome game. For me it is very important.  \nBreathtaking story lines. Sometimes I found myself crying in the middle of story. \nI was quite surprised to see names Ieyasu Tokugawa and Hanzo Hattori. They are actual historical figures of Japan. And Iga village was real at Sengoku period.\nIt is worth to look info about Tensho Iga War. You'll find many familiar names and places. It's amazing how creators added historical figures and events into fictional story.\nGood re-play ability. Every boy has two endings, achievements for getting CG's and memoirs. \n\nAs you can see I am fully satisfied with every pence I spent. Regret nothing. \nNightshade made me find and lose.

From the art and the prologue I gotta admit I wasn't really expecting a whole lot.\n\nI ended up going for Kuroyuki's story line first, and was really worried that the game was just going to be full of problematic and abusive relationships. The story kind of saved itself at the end and at least gave reason for why he was how he was.\n\nI went into the next playthrough with a little trepidation and Geomon stole my !@$^G#@ heart.

She has goals and fears like she's a person or something! She got a few \"non-responses\" as I call them but generally had thoughtful dialogue and internal monologue.\n-This game is QUOTABLE. Like, things were said I will actually remember cause it was so COOL (in spoiler just to be safe):\n   [spoiler]\"He only taught you how to die. I wish he'd taught you how to live.\"\n   \"He never told me how to die.\"\n   \"You learnt it watching him. Same thing.\"[/spoiler]\n-Hands down, this game has the best translation I've ever seen in a VN. They did a great job.\n-When other reviews said I'd cry, I didn't believe them. Guys, my heart broke over characters that weren't even romanceable. And that was a GOOD ending. It hurt so good.\n-This game actually makes use of themes, instead of just trying to put together a situation for romance things to happen. I'm not going to say the story is great literature, but I did actually get invested. There are lessons for all the characters to learn. Yes, ALL, not just the protag. The \"bad\" ending is when those lessons aren't learned. The characters themselves are surprisingly well-rounded. Just...not the villains.\n-One of my pet peeves is when sexual assault on behalf of the LI is presented as romantic. So far, this has not been a problem, and the game actively steers away from it. Also, protag has a meaningful friendship with the men she's not romancing, and other women in the story too.\n-LIs vaguely fit into the common \"type\" tropes you see, but they were more dynamic than that. \n-Basically everything good the other reviews say about the protag's development are entirely accurate.\n\nCons\n-You may have to exercise your suspension of disbelief.\n-Villains are bad. Not just evil, but objectively one-dimensional.\n-Could do with a few more CGs, could do with some slightly better ones. They are adequate.\n-Very few choices to make, maybe just over 1 per chapter. Didn't really bother me, though, because I generally agreed with the choices and liked reading how they unfolded.\n\nRecap: EVERY NON-ENGLISH VN SHOULD USE THESE TRANSLATORS; They did the protag and friendship stuff super right; I felt real feelings for stupid fake people, like, 3 layers of tragedy. 11/10, give me more ninja tragedies.\n\nP.S. Don't listen to other reviews, Hanzo is not the best route (though it was very good). Chojiro is the best route. All the feels, guys.

I loved that the choices you made always seemed meaningful and were not arbitrary guesses, you could always figure out the best choice through some critical thinking and \"reading\" the character you're interacting with.  \n\nWhat I thought was the greatest part of this VN was the amount of character development you see in the main character (yourself) as well as the man you pick.  It's beyond a simple otome where you simply attempt to \"get the guy\",  the characters learn and mature and your relationship will reflect that in so many ways.\n\nAs a historical fiction it's easier for you to understand the world and context of the story, and helps flesh out all of the main events of the VN.  All of the characters are voice acted and they even took the effort to add in lip sync with the animations.  Small details like this add up and made me realize that the developers truly cared about making an quality game rather than just banging out another release.\n\nOn another note, do Hanzo and Gekkomaru's routes last!  Most intense routes IMO so it will be hard for the others to live up to your expectations afterwards\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499483677, "timestamp_updated": 1499483677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33360736": {"recommendationid": "33360736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042139052", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495945399}, "language": "english", "review": "GAAAAAH I LOVE THIS GAME. Honestly one of the best otomes I've played in a long time. Between the nice art, nice character, TEAR INDUCING MOMENTS, good voice acting and a strong MC (in some routes!), this game is definitely in my top 5. If you are interested in otome games, and aren't sure where to start, this is the best one to start with IF you're looking for lots of crying. I know I cried during every route. \n\nMy personal favs were Hanzo and Kuroyuki. Hanzo's route was written SO WELL. Not only did Hanzo's character compliment the MC, he actually developed her into a respectable ninja! And it wasn't just him helping her develope, she softened his heart right up! He goes from this merciless killer, not wanting any form of human contact to falling in love with this fierce little ninja who was wrongfully accused. \n\nKuroyuki, on the other hand, was my own guilt. He's a jokester, and pretty much my fav because of that. His route makes MC a clingy sh*t, but I mean he is a clingy sh*t in the first place. His route isn't that well written, but frick if that doesn't stop me from loving him. Guilty pleasure, I guess.\n\nSome of the other routes are good too- specifically Gekkamaru and Goemon's. I'd complete skip Chojiro's, his is kinda ehh. Gekkamaru's is tearfilled, and Goemon's... well his route was something. \n\nPlay the game!

Je nachdem welchen Chara man w\u00e4hlt, \u00e4ndert sich die Storyline ab etwa der Mitte des Spiels und nach dem jeweiligen Ende bekommt man einen Abspann mit dem jeweiligen Chara und spezifischen Bildern. \nJede Story hat ihre eigenen H\u00f6hepunkte, wobei ich sagen muss, dass mir die \"bad endings\" bisher besser gefallen, weil sie besser zur Mentalit\u00e4t der Shinobi passen ;) Die Thematik ist bei Drama/Romance/History anzusiedeln, es gibt kein 18+ Content, hier geht es wirklich mal wieder um die Story *-* (Gott sei Dank, in der letzten Zeit habe ich schon ein paar Mal daneben gegriffen x_X)\nDer Soundtrack ist supersch\u00f6n und ich mag die Synchronstimmen zu den einzelnen Charas, die sind sehr gut ausgew\u00e4hlt. Die Hintergr\u00fcnde sind detailreich, ich mag auch die Zeichnungen der Charas, wobei die Gesichtsausdr\u00fccke bei allen leider ein bisschen begrenzt sind. Aber das macht nichts, weil ansonsten sind sie gut her\u00fcber gebracht und besitzen ihre eigenen Details. Auch die Nebencharaktere sind mit Liebe entwickelt und nicht einfach nur da. Ich h\u00e4tte mir noch eine Route mit Ennosuke gew\u00fcnscht, aber wahrscheinlich h\u00e4tte er Goro dann zu viel Konkurrenz gemacht? xD \nDer Preis ist zwar hoch, aber man sitzt wirklich lange am Spiel, daher ist es gerechtfertigt. Ich habe f\u00fcr eine Route etwa 6 Stunden gebraucht, jetzt skippe ich immer bis ungef\u00e4hr zur H\u00e4lfte, weil sich geschichtlich wie gesagt erst ab da etwas \u00e4ndert, deshalb geht es jetzt etwas schneller ;) \nIch habe bisher drei Routen durchgespielt, am besten hat mir bisher die zu Hanzo Hattori gefallen.

I'm a sucker for men in kimonos so when I saw such high ratings on Steam I had to get it.\nOST is very well suited for the game and most CGs are passable in terms of quality. The VAs are amazing and bring each \ncharacter to life. The localization is pretty decent, I think a couple parts could've been changed to be more consistent.\nMy only gripe is the general story is pretty similar in all the routes even when each route branches out. I also wished\nthere were a bit more CGs but thats just a personal preference... The character designs are so pretty though ;-;.\nHighly recommend this game for anyone into not all fluff and cute moment otome games but one with a dark touch on the story. However, the storyline can get pretty boring after 5 characters, but if you can get past that this otoge is great! \nOne of my favorite otoges is Brothers Conflict and that had so much similar routes...I played almost all the routes too.\nTherefore the copy paste routes didn't bug me too much, except for the parts that were similar in other routes but\nsince you were on a different character it didn't count as the same thing, now that was frustrating.\nRegardless, really loved the game and like most people, Hanzo was bae.\n\nFull review of all the routes on my tumblr. \nhttp://carinareviews.tumblr.com/post/162687063266/pcsteam-review-nightshade", "timestamp_created": 1499386576, "timestamp_updated": 1499386576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33311443": {"recommendationid": "33311443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102891729", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499797651}, "language": "english", "review": "Hanzo's route on its own is worth every dollar. Best writing in a VN I've experienced so far and Tsuda Ken's voice acting is top notch as always. MC is strongest in this route as she discovers her own will to learn and survive while kicking ass. Hanzo also develops in tandem as MC grows. He seems like the heartless badass ninja trope stereotype at the beginning but as the route goes on it really shows how multi-dimensional his character is.

It\u2019s a little tragic for an otome, but the artwork and characters are stunningly beautiful and it's a very well polished game overall - which isn't really surprising given the price. The voice acting is extensive and very emotionally impactful; it really adds to the quality of the experience and if you have yet to try a game that's fully voiced (in Japanese FYI) you should definitely give it a go. \n\nAfter reading a few reviews however, I couldn't find too many that really address how dissatisfying the game can be, so despite the thumbs up here I go. \n\nThe story can be quite tragic, and when done properly it was very bittersweet, but more often than not I found it to be a bit jarring and at odds with the romantic character arcs. For example, the MC might have just witnessed [spoiler] the horrific deaths of people very close to her [/spoiler] and then moments later gets giddy and embarrassed because her crush held her hand? \n\nThe routes share a couple of interesting twists but when you boil it all down that's pretty much it. Most of the game is spent [spoiler]running through woods and having random encounters with enemies.[/spoiler] All in all I can't say that's something that woud ever deter me from enjoying an otome game - I'd be lying if I said I'm here for the plot - but lumped together with a couple of other niggles makes it all a bit of a naggle (mixed experience). \n\nThe protagonist is a bit floppy and does very little herself. I understand the need to be rescued every now and then, but when it\u2019s done constantly by not just the love interest, but every single guy around (and always out of nowhere), it gets very old fast. She's a bit like a sack of flour that's just thrown around and hoisted over people's shoulders all the time. If she manages to [spoiler] take down a skilled enemy on her first mission, [/spoiler] why can\u2019t she pull her head out of her ass and intervene, or even, god forbid, win, when people she cares about are threatened? \n\nThroughout the game it\u2019s emphasised that Enju has less experience than some of the others and that she must be protected etc. In fact, this is probably her defining characteristic and the writers seem to have bent backwards trying to create excuses for why she can't do something herself when other outcomes would just make more sense. There seems to have been more effort put into Enju's intense phobia of having a spine than anything else in the game. This leaves her with very little impact on the world around her, especially for someone so central to the politics and schemes of the era. She should essentially be making some of these important decisions but she ends up spectating and then dressing wounds more than anything else (you\u2019ll quickly find out for yourself that I\u2019m really not exaggerating). \n\nNo one buys an otome game expecting a highly realistic historical narrative, but when setting out any good story there should at least be some consistency in world building and characterisation.[spoiler]I have a sort of love hate thing going on for most otome games on the market and I'm just gonna shamelessly lay it out here because I'm so tired of seeing the same thing over and over again.[/spoiler]In almost all the routes, Enju has a lot of incentive to figure things out for herself or take action, but for a spy/assassin she\u2019s shockingly dim and na\u00efve, and it really irritated me to see that potential go to waste. I know it's pretty much the norm, but it would have been so satisfying to see a story crafted around someone capable and intelligent, filled with intrigue and espionage, without resorting to the classic born-yesterday-MC you find in every game. Her passive nature also makes almost every interaction feel one-sided or even kind of demeaning, which, barring a small niche demographic, can be very uncomfortable to read as a player.\n\nGenerally speaking, the characters are sweet and often likeable, especially the MC as she puts herself above others and it manages to come off as genuine thoughtfulness without being too irritating. As a protagonist, I thought her design and background were quite unique and it's nice to at least be an actual shinobi instead of the usual princess or bystander. A number of the scenes the characters all have together are funny and set up emotional attachments for the player, but the dialogue does feel a little padded out sometimes. There was a lot of exposition and occasionally the more dramatic scenes were very repetitive or lasted far longer than they needed to. Conversations often go in circles and everyone keeps saying the same thing over and over in different ways - not for dramatic effect but just... because? Not to mention a lot of the \"mysteries\" are not very mysterious at all and I'm pretty sure a 7 year old with a decent grasp of logic would be able to understand everything before the MC does. I'm not sure if this is all done under the assumption that teenage girls will somehow not be able to handle a more complicated narrative, or if the developers are just sticking to the \"delayed-reactions-are-easier-than-plots\" otome gold standard, but it does come off as a little insulting sometimes.", "timestamp_created": 1498096319, "timestamp_updated": 1500571965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865643", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32623683": {"recommendationid": "32623683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373802953", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512221710}, "language": "english", "review": "D-don't even think of playing this game if you have a weak heart. haa'haa'haa! Goodness I hate drama in the first place but this is too much!! I cried every chapter. Ahh. I regret playing Gekkamaru's route first. The feels! My head hurts from crying too much I dont even know if im typing the right thing. To be honest this only cause me pain, and I feel like the happy ending is not enough to ease the pain from all that happened. But I can't say I regret buying this despite that, cause this is a MASTERPIECE! The plot, effects, the twist of the story, everything! everything is excellet! (except sometimes my name changes from Misaki to Enju. Lol) So, I will still recommend this, BUT! I'm warning you, breath in breath out before playing this. You're lucky if you're reading this cause at least someone warned you unlike me! I was shocked!! Goodness!\nHaaa. I'm not making any sense anymore, mybe this will happen to you too after playing this ( or I just have a weak heart for drama ). \nAnyway, what I don't like about this is all five routes have the same storyline, but different characters. What I mean is, a lot of scenes are the same but you will never know when it will change, so its hard to just skip it. But hello? am kind of sick playing the same scenes for five routes you know. I thought at least the story will change. :( thats all.\nAnd to tell you the truth I played this after playing Amnesia: Memories, can you believe that? Are these otome games trying to kill me?! But oh well, I chose this. I need to recover, i think I need to play Mystic msgr, 707 silly jokes is all I need right now.\nBut if you think you can manage a lot of heartaches unlike me, then don't hesitate on buying this, as I've said this is a masterpiece. Handsdown to the people behind this.\nSo, I just finished it (except for memoirs) and came to update my review.\nMy favorites in terms of:\nRoutes: Hanzo - His route is the only one who makes me feel contented with the ending.\nPersonality: Hanzo - never mind my reasons above, I just love him that's all. I'm always with the character who doesn't talk much and scary looking. Lol. Oh and Chojiro, i like his personality too.\nFeels: hhmm. Though i cried and cried every route I can't decide if its Gekkamaru's or Chojiro's route. Gekkamaru is my first route and Chojiro is last so the feels is still fresh but I think its Gekkamaru cause I cried the whole day in his route. Can't even go to work the day after. Lol.\nFace: Hanzo- no need to explain. second is Goemon, he's so hot! Ugh!\nLove for the heroine: Kuroyuki. No one can beat him in that aspect, wanna know why? then play his route, you'll see. :D hehehe \nSo that's it.  don't want to play the bad ends, dont care about other cgs and memoirs anymore.

That may seem like a difficult task to pull off, but it's possible.  Now, I admit, the artwork is absolutely gorgeous and the voice acting phenomenal. BUT... those two things can't carry a story, and that's where Nightshade falters.  Plot issues aside, the characters are where the game truly shines and is what kept me interested  beyond my first play through.\n\nLet me get straight to gushing about the game's characters.  While I wasn't in love with each and every one of the obtainable love interests right off the bat, most were interesting and likeable enough for me to seek out the resolution to their individual storylines.  Yes, all of the standard character tropes are present, and although Nightshade doesn't break any boundaries when it comes to its romances, it does them well.  And honestly, that's all I'm really looking for out of these games, well-written romances.  Of course, while some of the guys are more appealing than others (Goemon and Hanzo), there's at least one that will have you completely smitten by the end, maybe two.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918425771\nWhen it comes to artwork, the game is stunning.  The character sprites are not only amazingly detailed but feature emotive facial movements that lip sync to the dialogue.  Although this isn't the first time a VN has accomplished the feat, it's always appreciated and certainly helps bring the characters to life.  Nightshade's CGs are some of the best in the genre and are not only beautifully drawn but emotionally poignant, wonderfully emphasizing the more dramatic scenes in the story.  The dialogue and voice work are also top notch with fluid writing and believable acting.  Seiyus generally do not make or break a game for me; if they're bad or distracting, I simply turn them off, no big deal.  I do admit they're really good here, and it helped immerse me in the times I felt my immersion beginning to wane.  \n\nUnfortunately, where Nightshade stumbles is in the plot department.  Granted, I've read worse otome stories, much worse, but there is WAY too much repetition in the sequence of events that follows the common route chapters.  Sure, there are some minor changes in details, but for the most part Enju spends a good portion of the game traveling through the forest evading capture by the same 3-4 shinobi clans.  It isn't until the final chapters that things change enough to rekindle my interest, but it's just not enough to keep me engaged past the 3rd character route.  By my 4th and 5th play through I had shut off my brain's story \"receptors\" and was merely hoping the relationship between Enju and her beau would quickly move beyond hand holding.  And no, I'm not expecting anything saucier than some light kissing, but when that's all I have to look forward to?  Well, just kiss already, dangit!!!  That said, there are plenty of feels to be had and a few enticingly steamy situations that had me begging for more.  The build-up of the romantic tension was handled splendidly in just about every route and is reason enough to play through them all. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=908388325\nSadly, the abundance of feels wasn't enough to leave a bigger impression on me. I really thought I'd walk away from the game with a stronger attachment for it than I have.  As a lover of pathos and angst, there's certainly enough here you'd think I'd be in heaven, but I feel kinda...meh.  Don't get me wrong, Goemon is worth the price of admission alone (seriously, if anyone claims to hate his character, FIGHT ME). I just wish there were more weight to the story, and maybe that's a result of not relating to Enju more.  Whatever the case, I feel a little empty now thinking how this beautiful game didn't quite live up to my lofty expectations.  Perhaps someday I'll come back and play it again without those same expectations holding me down.  Still, I recommend it if you enjoy otoge at all; even with its shortcomings, it's better than most of the current offerings on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1494545746, "timestamp_updated": 1494806138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866686", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31673839": {"recommendationid": "31673839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284980396", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514042443}, "language": "french", "review": "Bonne dur\u00e9e de vie.

All in all the story is pretty meh. Nothing too outstanding and nothing too out of the box. The art is fantastic though. Great quality all around, no weird poses. They really put a lot of work into the artwork for this VN and it's probably the best aspect of the game (to me at least).\n\nI would also like to applaud the animation for the fight sequences. It's nothing extravagant, but just having the characters move around the screen instead of reading blocks and blocks of text was a huge + for me. It was a big help when trying to visualize what was going on.\n\nThe game kept me interested for at least a few routes. After that the main plot, apart from the romance, was a snooze fest. It's also a bit confusing, because they use different plots and motivations for different routes. It kinda screwed up what I had originally thought was going to be a coherent overarching story. I really hate it when they do this. Because of this there is no real \"correct order\" to play the routes in. Though if you're really wanting to go by some sort of list I'd recommend doing Goemon -> Chojiro -> Hanzo -> Kuroyuki -> Gekkamaru.\n\n[b]--Skip here if you don't want spoilers--[/b]\n\nNow in terms of romance...\n\nI had the most beef with Chojiro's route. You spend half of his route pining for him instead of spending time with him. Ugh. He got cucked more than Gekkamaru, and Gekkamaru is the childhood friend archetype. What is this. AUGH, by the time you finally get to be in the same room as him I was already done with his route. Sorry. I did finish it, but nothing in that route could save my interest at that point.\n\nGekkamaru, on the other hand, had a pretty decent route overall. I was surprised cause his archetype usually ends up being the normal one. The control. The one you get out of the way cause everyone else will have a more interesting route. But I found his to be the most balanced route. Good from start to finish. 8/10 would maybe go through again.\n\nHis brother though...what a doozy. Drama from beginning to end. If you like that whole angsty spice, then you'll love Kuroyuki to bits. Not to say there aren't sweet moments, but I'm not into stockholm syndrome story. It's a big turn-off. He's a cute kid with a sad past, that's all I really have to say about his route.\n\nI saved Goemon and Hanzo for last because I love the stoic and playboy types. \nGoemon was...ok. I was a bit disappointed, guess I expected too much. His was route was far from being bad, I just felt there were a lot of missed opportunities. It's also the \"everyone lives happily ever after\" route so after playing every route where SOMEONE DIES I just...it was way too lighthearted to end with. I regret playing his route last lol.\n\nHanzo, on the other hand, was refreshing. Mainly because the mc doesn't act like a wimpy little girl even though she can obviously fight as a ninja too?? She talks a lot about wanting to prove she isn't a liability in the first few chapters, but she acts like a martyr in 4 out of 5 routes??? Can you tell I was really bothered by it? Cause I was. IT WAS SO NICE to see her stand up to fight instead of standing up to DIE for once. The romance was good. I didn't have any strong thoughts towards it. Oh, and his last cg was the most disappointing CG I have had the privilege to witness in this VN.\n\n[b]--End Skip--[/b]\n\nSome of the translations miss their mark, but what can you do. It's not terrible to the point where things are overlooked, so don't worry too much about it.\n\nI'd order the routes (imo):\n\n1. Hanzo\n2. Gekkamaru\n3. Goemon\n4. Kuroyuki\n5. Chojiro\n\n1 being the best overall, 5 being the worst overall.\nThis ranking is also influenced by my preferences, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nAll in all, I did enjoy Nightshade. It wasn't Bad but it wasn't Great. Would definitely recommend you buy this when it's on sale because its base price of $35 is (imo) too expensive for the amount of content you receive. If you look at how much time I spent playing this game, it's not too excessive.

They don't feel empty which can be an issue in some visual novels, especially the ones that focus on romantic routes.\n+ Wonderful voice acting, it's amazing how they could bring the characters to life - especially during emotional scenes.\n+ Artstyle, I really enjoyed how the non-CGs looked. The fact that they actually moved around made me enjoy the game even more, it's a small thing, but it's still amazing.\n+ The [b]music[/b], I loved the soundtracks in the game. The piano OSTs are absolutely wonderful and I'm going to pick up a copy of the soundtrack whenever I can.\n\n\n[h1] Cons...? [/h1]\n\n- I can't really think of any cons except the translation which can be a bit janky at times, but it's not something that ruins the experience, at least for me personally.

I very rarely feel the need to play several branches in a visual novel because I find I grow bored after I acheive a good ending with my favorite guy (who I choose very quickly based on overall impression and looks). Nightshade is the exception. \n\nEach of the charcters has depth which only adds to an already rich story enviroment. I like how this game focuses on character developement as the main shinobi events unfold and have a genuine effect on changing the way the character's behave and think.\n\nNot to mention that the art is beautiful and the emotion of the voice actors (I'm rather used to listening to Japanese) really adds to an emersive playing experience. \n\nI literally squealed with delight when I got reactions I wasn't quite expecting from a character that I judged initially as drab and uninteresting - this coming from someone who doesn't often feel emotionally attached to character's in 90% of the stories/movies/mangas that I consume.\n\nMy only criticism is the protaginist, she made me rather livid in one of the branches I played. I honestly dislike female protaginists that remain frozen and uncertain when action is desperately needed. That being said it could still be a good thing because I was invested enough to actually lose my temper.\n\nI highly recommend Nightshade. It was more than worth the expense and I will always look back at it fondly when I manage to finish all the branches.", "timestamp_created": 1493991917, "timestamp_updated": 1493991917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31552333": {"recommendationid": "31552333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031675511", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494561811}, "language": "english", "review": "Really beautiful art from the amazing Teita with some really interesting visual effects thrown in to go with your visual story. The battle scenes are really cool. The backgrounds are lovely but after 2-3 routes you will notice the recycled art. For me this did not detract from anything at all. Another fully voiced (minus the heroine) game with some top quality acting from some favorite voice talent. Your ears will thank you for playing. Each voice is really matched perfectly to the characters. The music fit well and I really enjoyed it. I wish I had gotten the OST bundle but I plan to buy the soundtrack anyway later.\n\nThe story itself is beautiful but often it gets rather tragic. These period warrior pieces tend to be on the sad side more often then not and Nightshade is no different. Saying that, the romance is well done and builds slowly over the course of each story. They did a great job of trying to keep it in the realm of believable. Sometimes I got really frustrated at the heroine's inability to decide if she is shy or not. There was also quite a lot more overlap/repeat in the stories of each route then I would have liked but at that point its just being picky. The story itself is good with a few interesting twists per route. \n\nEach route seems to only have 2 ends (good and bad). I wish there would have been more endings and/or more dialogue choices for each one. That could be a matter of preference though. I like when the story makes me feel like I have an impact on it. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it and there was no shortage of swooning thats for sure! Two thumbs up from this player :)  I would not at all mind seeing a part 2 to this one with a continuation of their stories or some sort of epilogue of their happy ever afters. \n\nThe menu/ui is pretty standard fare for a VN. Skip goes -really- fast but theres some options in the menu to customize that.  Auto mode is nice to sit back and enjoy. Theres also the standard gallery and a memory section to re-play chapters. Nothing to exciting. If you don't set the character name in the extra menu then all memories will default to 'Enju'.  You can also set the menu's character voice in the settings which is a nice little addition.\n\nUnrelated to the game itself but a personal gripe of mine... I really wish more companies would release some of the merchandise our way when they localize these titles! Theres so much they put out but its so impossible to find as we often don't get translations at all or until years later and have to scour auction sites.", "timestamp_created": 1493956364, "timestamp_updated": 1493956364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31545137": {"recommendationid": "31545137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337440764", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1514016468}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is very attractive and interesting.

No obvious plot holes, which is good.\n\nStat building wise is pretty simple, I actually achieved a good end without using any guide. it's pretty straightforward.\n\nMusic is okay, didn't really care much in the first place.

As well as wonderful and powerful. \"AHA! I KNEW IT!\" moments.\nAll the routes were thoroughly enjoyable, only one of them did I find subpar compared to the rest. Which typically I don't tend to even play all the character routes but this time I wanted to discover each detail of the plot surrounding Enju. \nNot all the routes intersect each other, but playing each of them you come to understand everything as a whole. Why someone wasn't present at the time, why this character felt this way, etc. etc.\nIt is well worth it to take time to play each of the characters. \n\nIt was beautiful and heart wrenching story to watch unfold.\nI also appreciated that many typical controls found in otome games were still present in steam (this is my first steam game!).\n\nThe designs are beautiful\nThe plot is well thought out (the story makes you so frustrated for the MC)\nThe MC I think is very realistic, at times she is weak, strong, devastated, driven, etc. A very dynamic character for the tragedy she is in.\n\nI love that we have the option to change the language text. So, this will be a wonderful study tool! I wish all my otome games had this option.\n\nOne downside, for those who do not understand Japanese there is one super cute thing I think the audience will miss out on...After the game, if you complete a route's happy ending, the character's route who you were one will say a brief phrase and it's adorable!! I'm surprised they didn't translate that in anywhere (if they did i missed it, oops).\n\nlastly, another feature I love, being able to change the system character voice.\n\nPlease support and check out this game if you have not already! \n", "timestamp_created": 1493597838, "timestamp_updated": 1493597838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31432252": {"recommendationid": "31432252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112135911", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493487819}, "language": "english", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1493444339, "timestamp_updated": 1493444339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519930", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31411282": {"recommendationid": "31411282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084858313", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494716265}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] A Fantastic Purchase [/h1]\nI bought this rather hesitantly, but I have absolutely no regrets.

[/b] [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n   [*]Beautiful artwork + character design\n   [*]Rich storytelling--there's a lot more going on than first meets the eye, and in order to fully appreciate the story from all its angles it may be best to follow this route: [spoiler] Goemon->Hanzo->Gekkamaru/Chojiro->Kuroyuki. I personally played it Goemon->Kuroyuki->Gekkamaru so far, and it has been a wild ride. [/spoiler]\n   [*]Hours upon hours of readable material\n   [*]Excellent voice acting\n   [*]Smooth and intuitive UI\n   [*]No stat-building (personal preference, but I play otome games to enjoy a story, not to worry about my stress level or whether or not I poured enough into my stats to secure a Good End--then again, this is a VN, so it's not surprising)\n   [*]A fair number of choices to make that influence the path of the game\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n   [*]Minor spelling and grammatical mistakes throughout. Not a big deal for me, but it can break immersion.\n   [*]There are a few spots where the script uses the preprogrammed name or just says [name:] instead of the one you entered--again, it breaks immersion a bit, but thankfully it doesn't occur in any really important spots.\n   [*]I honestly cannot think of any others.\n[/list]\n\nThis game may or may not break your heart. [spoiler] Kuroyuki is an enjoyable yandere but his route has a lot of spoilers for the game's plot which can make the other, lighter ones (like Goemon's and Hanzo's) less enjoyable if it's played early on; and I was not prepared [b] at all [/b] for the soulcrushing sadness of Gekkamaru's route.

I thought it was going to be light-hearted, ahahahaha.  Ha.  In terms of the feels department, it's way more so than Hakuouki to give a comparison.  The BGM is also excellent even though I have to lower it since I get distracted by it if I don't as usual in these games.  The artwork and CGs are really great as well, it'll definitely make you squee and other noises - even mentally.\n\nThe MC was pretty interesting, probably my favorite right after Code: Realize's and Scarlet Fate's.  She goes through development and changes on which route you go on especially some certain ninja.  I would use the Discord eyes if I could.  She's the kind sort but she has backbone and reacts as one would expect given her background.  I can't say much or it'll give away the plot.\n\nThe story itself is like a mystery/action/romance novel which was so good, there were literally no holes I could find and you'll notice that there are differences between some routes too.   The order I went is kuroyuki -> goemon -> gekka -> chojiro -> hanzo and I'm so glad I did because Hanzo's route is the greatest way to end this game on.  I have only done Happy Endings since I don't think I can manage the bad ones just yet since I don't think I can survive them.  \n\nHugely recommend this to any visual novel fan, it's very well worth the price.

I don\u2019t know about everyone else who played this game, but\u2026 were someone else other than me shocked by how impressive the story was written and programmed? If it\u2019s not the writing, it\u2019s the moving of characters, voice acting and music that grips you into the story. I need more.\n\nThis game can truly be considered one of the top \u201cmust have\u201d Otome games on steam. \n\nThere are so few of them on steam, but for the past 2 - 3 years, we have seen a slow and steady increase. And with a game as good as this, getting an English translation, will hopefully encourage other companies to import more games to people who can\u2019t read Japanese all that well (and I mean to Steam, not PSvita/Mobile).\n\nAlso\u2026 a fair warning if you\u2019re planning to buy this: This game is very addictive. I never imagined I would ever say this about an Otome, but it\u2019s true. With such a story, I found myself reading away for hours in one day. All because I wanted to know everything about the story.\n\n\n[b]Recommended route order:[/b]\nHanzo > Chojiro > Goemon > Kuroyuki/Gekkamaru\n[i](Gekkamaru\u2019s route is considered canon, but Kuroyuki\u2019s route is very special \u2013 so you can actually chose either as last route. Personally I chose to do Kuroyuki last. I have no regrets and honestly liked the ending more.)[/i]\n\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n+A long Otome game (we need more of these on steam!!)\n+Very intense and emotional story. The story also split into 2 different ones, depending on which route you\u2019re going for. Not only that, but each route had their own personal charm to them, so it would never feel repetitive whenever you decided to start on a new route.\n+Strong female MC (heroine).\n+Beautiful art style and CGs (< for the most part).\n+Great OST and sound effects.\n+Very good and solid voice acting [spoiler](although the kissing sounds were a little cringy, but it\u2019s always going to be like that, lol).[/spoiler] (However some of the Japanese voice acting isn\u2019t 100% translated compared to what\u2019s written on English. Some words are either changed or left out, but in the end, it pretty much means the same thing as what\u2019s written on English \u2013 it\u2019s just me being a little picky.)\n+The characters say your name if you chose to name yourself the default name the game gives you, \u201cEnju Ueno\u201d. I recommend using \u201cEnju\u201d while playing \u2013 it makes you more immersed into the story IMO. [spoiler]Especially during Kuroyuki\u2019s route![/spoiler]\n+Extra bonus scenarios when finishing a route.\n+Achievements.\n ~Not an [b]obvious[/b] \u2018text log\u2019 button. I found it purely by accident when I scrolled up with my mouse wheel while on a route. Once you are on that log though: It\u2019s well formatted, you can replay voice-clips, and you can even jump back to a previous moment to re-experience the dialogue/a battle (I was pretty impressed by that to be honest).\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n-Some of the CGs were bad, or I just couldn\u2019t relate to while reading the text and looking at the picture. The anatomy on some images were weird\u2026 [spoiler](Like the one where Chojiro is supposed to turn the Heroine\u2019s head and look at her, and she looks at him. And the last happy end CG with Hanzo \u2013 I was disappointed to look at it, and got confused, compared to what was actually written.)[/spoiler]. \nThis was most likely due to the perspective that some CGs were drawn in. During those moments though, it was actually hard to see the true emotions of the characters, and thought that the character sprites did a better job displaying their emotions.\n-Minor annoyances such as: a few punctuation errors in text, general text errors such as: default name shows in text when you have actually chosen to call yourself something else + Japanese signs, an annoying white flash when quick saving, and rare occasions of having a visual bug where MC\u2019s sprite/other character sprites/text box would flicker for a second.", "timestamp_created": 1493055317, "timestamp_updated": 1493055317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31331558": {"recommendationid": "31331558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316149378", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "last_played": 1514337666}, "language": "english", "review": "I am REALLY in love with this game..

I believe the story is concrete and worth the money so if you haven't bought it I highly recommend trying the game out. Personally my favorite routes were Kuroyuki and Hanzo~even though I say that, all of the routes so far have been really interesting so its hard to choose fav's. Another cool part of the game is that it lets the reader/player sometimes have a change of pov (sorry, hope that makes sense? You'll know what I mean if you play it) to another scene a few times. \n\nTo put it nice and short, since the other reviews did a fine job in talking about the game, do try out the game I'm sure you will be as addicted as I am!

What I loved the most about his route was the progression of their relationship and their characterizations were reasonably well done. I'm a sucker for the brooding/ workaholic/actions-speak-louder-than-words type of male characters so maybe that's why I loved Hanzo's route as much as I did. Hanzo's role isn't just to be MC's romantic interest but also as a mentor. I thought his treatment of her (In consideration of his age, his occupation, and his initial motivations) was reasonable and it didn't venture into Hanzo deviating into a completely different character in the end just so we can have our fan service. \n\nI was very worried that the MC would devolve into a 2 dimensional character whose only purpose is to be the damsel in distress so that the romantic interest can play the knight in shining armor. Obviously, there are some moments when the MC will have to be rescued but the story is developed well enough to where you feel actual anxiety instead of exasperation. She actually uses her ninja skills, fights, and trains so she can be better. Imagine that. I also love me some angst and this one definitely delivered it in spades. The price is so worth it even with just Hanzo. Nevertheless, I soldiered on and tried Chojiro's and Goemon's routes.\n\nDidn't mean to fan girl so much over Hanzo, but...uh...yeah. Definitely play his route. You won't regret it.\n\nOverall, this game has A+ voice acting, music and art. The supporting characters are pretty good (with the exception of Kasumi specially in Chojiro's route). If I had one bad thing to say about the game, it's that the overarching plot doesn't really change too much regardless of which route you take but I guess it makes up for it by giving you a different dilemma depending on which romantic interest you're with.\n\nI definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good Otome game! \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492976506, "timestamp_updated": 1492976506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31321542": {"recommendationid": "31321542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140306503", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493009906}, "language": "english", "review": "At first glance, I suspected that this game was a clone of [i]Hakuoki[/i] (which I did [i]not[/i] enjoy), and after playing 75% of Goemon's route, I was sure of it.

I\u2019ll be doing the bad ending later for completion but I probably would just skip it real fast. Now this would probably be my very first long review and I think this game really deserves it. Please excuse this amateurish review of mine. \n\nPlot: \nNow I really enjoyed the overall plot. The game has two story development and it\u2019s pretty obvious once you notice the difference in the CG. The stories that have a similar feel are Hanzo, Goemon and Kuroyuki first, then Choujiro and Gekkamaru second. I personally enjoyed the story development on the first one because [spoiler] Toyotomi died for real and that piece of shit deserved it. I think I like Kuroyuki's the best because Enju's dad died. He totally deserves that. [/spoiler] For the second story, it's mora tragic, especially Choujiro's story. Prepare yourselves for some angst. \n\nChoujiro's story was the the most tragic and, in my personal opinion, the one that sucked the most because [spoiler] Toyotom was alive and I think so was Kando and I reeeeeeeeally think both should die in every end of the good ending. But they didn't and I felt so bad for the death of Ennosuke, Kyara, Kasumi and Gekkamaru. LIke I was so angry, I think I just rushed his story.[/spoiler] On the other hand, Gekkamaru's story was bitter sweet. A lot better than Choujiro due to the fact that [spoiler] Toyotomi died and Enju stood up against her dad. She even screamed shut up at him. I was clapping my hands so much during the entire time when she raged after fidning out what happened.[/spoiler] \n\n[b]I highly recommend playing the game in this order: \nChoujiro > Hanzo > Goemon > Kuroyuki > Gekkamaru[/b]\n- You can swap between Goemon and Hanzo but save the brothers for last to enjoy the story more. \n\nTo summary the stories: \nGoemon, Hanzo & Kuroyuki\n- [spoiler] Toyotomi did die and they had to hunt down the killer. Kando also dies all their routes which I fully support while all their friends are alive, which is very important[/spoiler]\n\nChoujiro & Gekkamaru: \n[spoiler] It's like Hunger Games/ Battle Royale. Toyotomi pretends to be murdered and uses Enju as some sort of pawn. All the Koga ninjas hunt her down for a game that Toyotomi made to feel \"young\" and Enju's son of a gun dad approves of it[/spoiler]\n\nArt: \nIT'S TEITA!!! 10/10!!\n\nMusic: \nI just had to purchase the tracklist. It's awesome. It's amazing. I can't stop listening to it and I can't even skip the opening song. It's just so catchy and it keeps my heart racing. I most especially love the opening song the most. \n\nCharacters: \nI love Enju. She's adorable and she did nothing wrong! Others may not agree with me on this because of certain parts of the game but for me that's what made her feel more human. She struggled with duty and her thoughts of being herself. I think the only issue I had was Choujiro. I couldn't do his story seriously because my mind just can't wrap around the idea of sleeping with your cousin. It was really hard to focus on romancing him when he kept on saying our relationship as cousins. It seriously bothered me to no end. The antagonists were hateful, as expected. Props to the dev team for the making the shittiest antagonists ever. \n\nTranslations and Editing: \nOkay, I think this one really needs work on. I noticed a lot of grammatical errors that could have been worked on with proof-reading. A lot of words used there had the appropriate vocabulary but they seemed off. What bothered me was the honorifics. I know they kept the honorifics on certain characters but translating \"Choujiro-dono\" to \"Brother Choujiro\" is definitely not the same. I wish they had kept the \"-dono\" instead. Even when Ishida called \"Yodo-dono\" it was translated as \"Yodo-sama.\" A few missing prepositions and typos but I guess they can work on that on their next localization\n\nOverall: \nI really did enjoy this game very much. It made me feel feelings. It made my heart beat. It's great. It's wonderful.

And then after playing all the good endings, I played Hanzo's route again because I'll never get tired of the slow burn of a romance, the positive character change that happened with Enju, as well as with Hanzo, the drama and the struggle at the near end, and the satisfying ending that came with it. And no, I don't care if he's actually [spoiler]the childhood of friend of Enju's mother and old enough to be her dad [/spoiler], because I'd still bang him nonetheless. If this VN will ever have an anime and they're going to use Hanzo's route....Gah, who am I kidding? Gekkamaru is considered to be the main guy here! But still, I'm going to throw my money at the screen just to see this happen.\n\nOverall, Nightshade is a pretty solid VN. The MC is not as flat and irritating as I expected in visual novel heroines, the LI's are all interesting (I'm biased towards Hanzo but Kuroyuki and Goemon's story are also good as well) and the side characters have their own quirks as well. I just wish there was an Ieyasu route in this game, something that focuses more on the political intrigue instead of all the routes become \"a runaway ninja\" story.\n\nGekkamaru and Kuroyuki's routes have the biggest twists in the story so better save them for later if you don't want to get spoiled (and possibly depressed throughout your playthrough). What I just don't like with Gekka is that he is just your ever faithful, Captain America-level of perfect, loyal protector from start to finish. [spoiler]His conflict of whether he wanted to be her servant or her lover doesn't really hold my interest because whatever he chooses, he's still latched to her[/spoiler]. Ultimately, Gekkamaru's and Chojiro's routes left a bad taste in my mouth [spoiler]not because of the Hunger Games-esque character deaths, mind you[/spoiler] but because of how the major plot twist turned out which actually deflated the whole conflict which made me say \"Wait, so that's it?\" instead of anticipating what's going to happen next upon the revelation of the surprise.\n\nKuroyuki's route is interesting because you'll see the other side of him. A bit of yandere-ish and stockholm syndrome-ish at the start, but trust me, the will get better further through the story as you see Enju and Kuroyuki's relationship develop into something healthier (with the help of their friends who made them come to their senses). [spoiler]And also, this is the only route where Enju will remain as a shinobi, so that's a plus, I guess?[/spoiler]\n\nChoujiro's route is a mixture of depressing and WTF?! and I haven't even played his bad ending yet (what's the worst thing that could happen in this route?). But I guess I'm not too interested in him because for me, Hanzo is the only perfect shinobi. <3\n\nGoemon's story is the most lighthearted among the five guys and should be done whenever you are feeling heavy after playing the other routes. You'll, of course, know the story behind the ninja-turned-thief but that's just the icing on the cake. The true gem comes from the character interactions in this route. Just a tad disappointed that there's no further \"action\" (if you know what I mean ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) from our friendly local libertine.\n\nThe art for this VN is great, although there are still CG's where it seems \"off.\" The action scenes are made more exciting by the sprites clashing or through forced perspective between the characters. It's also fun seeing that the MC's sprite also gets included with the other characters in the conversations. It makes the character to be immersed in the story as well.\n\nThe music may become a hit or miss depending on one's taste in music but there's nothing too jarring that it will distract you from reading. The OP and ED especially makes me want to wish that this VN will get an animation deal someday.\n\nSo TL;DR, [b]buy this game[/b]. It may look pricey but it's worth every cent and every minute you play this. It will lead you to a roller coaster of feelings and its variety of characters and side characters will get you hooked in this story.\n\n\nNow I must go and do another run with Hanzo's story..", "timestamp_created": 1492611195, "timestamp_updated": 1492611195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31234548": {"recommendationid": "31234548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039411720", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493761571}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished the first route and I'm absolutely in love with the game already.

The main character (I strongly recommend keeping the canon name Enju since the other characters will actually say her name) is a girl who is determined to give back to her shinobi village, and finds herself way in over her head in a conspiracy. \n\nThere are five routes the story can take, each involving a romance between Enju and a specific shinobi man. Each route is the perfect length IMO, not too long and not too short. In total, the game should probably take between 18 to 30 hours depending on the speed of your reading. There are a total of five routes--2 of which are angsty, 2 of which are hopeful, and a third in-between (slightly more on the hopeful side though).\n\n\nPros:\n-The historical Sengoku era and shinobi aesthetic is very cool even for someone who knows basically nothing about the historical figures (but was inspired to look them up more after finishing the game.). \n\n-Writing across the board is high quality, with each route taking their own spin on the game's overarching theme--what in the life of a shinobi is truly worth living/fighting/dying for. Suspense and tension are very nicely maintained. The stories know when to be serious and when to be playful, so this consistency in tone is reassuring. Some plot threads are picked up and then dropped, but that is pretty natural to any visual novel with multiple diverging routes and in this game it never occurs on a truly bothersome scale. Overall it's extremely easy to immerse yourself in the story IMO.\n\n-Character development can be absolutely superb in some routes. The side characters are great fun to have around and also ripe for drama of their own. I can say that in every route, the main characters change in a believably human way with consistent motivations and goals.\n\n-Voice acting is stellar. They shelled out for the VAs, and it shows. Every main character has a perfectly fitting voice. You can even choose which character's voice you want to hear when you're navigating the main menu! I do wish Enju herself was voiced, but oh well. \n\n-Visuals are generally beautiful. The portraits are gorgeous, the backgrounds are lush. Teita's art style fits this game perfectly. Even the fight scenes are somehow very captivating despite the typical visual novel limitations (can only be written with portraits blinking around, clashing noises, etc.)\n\n-Soundtrack is good overall. There was one screeching guitar track I disliked during action scenes, but that was the only one of its ilk, while there is a particular dramatic action track I absolutely loved. \n\n\nPossible cons? Your mileage will vary on whether these are negative or even positive. \n-Story only has a single very fundamental premise. Of note, there is one /giant/ branching point early in the story that divvies out the five routes into two branches. The plots and reveals of the two branches are fundamentally different. However, there are two routes in the same branch that have quite similar stories, so if you do one your suspense during the other will be significantly decreased. \n\n-Some routes get more closure in terms of the overarching story than others. However, I can say that every route does achieve closure. Often the routes that didn't get that \"overarching story closure\" often received far more satisfying \"individual journey closure,\" so it's not a strictly bad thing.\n\n-Just like every otome game (nay, every visual novel) in existence, some character archetypes will naturally appeal to you more than others. As a result, most people find themselves with one or two favorite routes that they want to reread over and over. Those one or two routes alone could justify the entire price of the game :P On the other hand, this means most people also find themselves with one or two routes that are unappealing. \n\n-UI can be a bit clunky, but it's tolerable and very much usable. It has the much appreciated industry standard options of Quick Save/Load, see the previous script, jump back to an earlier scene, etc. \n\nOther notes:\n\n-There were text readability issues for the first few days, but it has been fixed. I can safely say that right now the text is perfectly comfortable to read. \n\n\n\n\nOne last word, don't let looks deceive you--Hanzo is the cutest boy in the cast.", "timestamp_created": 1492495909, "timestamp_updated": 1492496018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31211618": {"recommendationid": "31211618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277147291", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492421407}, "language": "english", "review": "This game actually made me cry. 10/10 always recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1492486007, "timestamp_updated": 1492486007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31205402": {"recommendationid": "31205402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042104026", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495160357}, "language": "english", "review": "Played Goemon and Hanzo so far and all I have to say is....STOP C*CKBLOCKING ME!!!! why is there no CG for the first kiss!!!?\n\n\nAfter playing Kuroyuki my exact words were \"WHAT THE FLYING F***!!!!!?\" THERE IS NO KISS CG AT ALL!!!!!?????", "timestamp_created": 1492456062, "timestamp_updated": 1492483517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31201255": {"recommendationid": "31201255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077739683", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511429003}, "language": "english", "review": "I had been waiting for this game since I knew they would translate it into English!

One of the best thus far on Steam. Absolutely recommended!\n\nThe sprites and CGs are gorgeous. The soundtrack, which I usually mute in VNs, didn't bother me and fit each scene pretty well (I had also mistakenly bought the OST bundle instead of the game as standalone, so I felt almost obliged to give it a go orz). The voice acting was stellar and each voice fit the characters extremely well. I blushed several times, courtesy of Goemon and Kuroyuki dulcet tones. The fight scenes, despite the limitations that a VN format brings, were not dull thanks to perspective changes on sprites and a great use of transitions. I was so impressed I needed to praise them, this production value is a breath of fresh air.\nThe first 4 chapters form the common route, and there are 13 chapters in total. I'm a fast reader, in 20 hours I managed to read all the good ends, force skip to get the bad ends and get all memoirs (those were hellish to get orz) to get 100% completion.\n\nThere is no description of the love interests on the store page, so I'll write a line or two about each guy and his route:\n[list]\n[*]Goemon is a flirty and carefree guy, older than the MC, tho it isn't specified by how many years. I found his route extremely sweet and the most positive overall, with some angst only near the end. If you feel a bit overwhelmed by the angst of some routes, you can do him right after to take a break. Bonus points for his sultry voice.\n[*]Hanzo knew MC's mother as they were childhood friends. While this might creep you out (and big age differences are never really brought up cus [i]different timez[/i]), his route is honestly so healthy, so positive. Mutual and self respect are big key points in his route. There is angst near the end, but MC grows so much, I was proud of her in the end.\n[*]Kuroyuki is MC's age. His route has some supernatural elements. He's impish and, you'll notice soon enough, fixated with MC in a [i]very[/i] unhealthy manner. They will grow codependent from one another. BUT. Everyone else will warn MC. I was so elated when MC's friends helped her snap out of it herself. And if you make the right choices, their relationship will take a turn for the better. It's a pretty dark route nonetheless. Bonus points for his voice, I think I like his the best.\n[*]Gekkamaru, 3 years older than MC, shares with his brother the obsession for MC and light supernatural elements in his route. Your journey with him is an angstfest. His obsessive, protective attitude towards MC, despite being good natured, felt really creepy (was even worse than Kuroyuki's for me). If you're into Master/servant dynamics this will be your stuff.\n[*]Chojiro. Where to start. He's 6 years older than MC, he's her teacher and on top of that, her cousin (basically I kept him last because my face was :/ when I thought about romancing him). They downplay the incest [i]cuz different times[/i] and despite it being a squick of mine, they brought it up infrequently and so halfway through I had forgotten about it. He is serious and duty bound. He's also absent for almost half of his route, which focuses more on the support cast; when he's on screen, it's an angstfest. Bonus points for his design because I'm weak to long, silky hair.\n[/list]\n\nMy recommended order would be Goemon > Hanzo > Kuroyuki > Gekkamaru = Chojiro. Goemon's route is the most positive. In Hanzo's the angst becomes more serious. Kuroyuki's route serves as a grand finale of the three and the beginning of the true angst\u2122. Gekkamaru's and Chojiro's should definitely be last, with Chojiro's route being a big hit or miss due to the POV switching/his absence for a big portion of it. \n\nThe only pet peeve I had, call me petty because of it, was that kisses/hugs were as far as physical things went. I was expecting at least a little bit of intimacy to go with the mature themes. The lack of it becomes unbelievable [spoiler]in Goemon's route, Kuroyuki's and Gekkamaru's. Goemon's an experienced man. Should I really believe he asked MC to marry him after they shared just some kisses? Kuroyuki manipulated MC to make her dependent on him and... no sex? In Gekkamaru's route the description for emotional sex is used... for hugs??[/spoiler] Idk there were several moments when I felt that the intimacy was forced away from the plot (possibly because of rating?). Maybe I'm old, maybe I've been reading too many Dogenzaka smut mobage ports. Maybe I'm hoping for a 18+ fandisk.

You are able to put yourself in your character's shoes and directly feel what she feels. I love how this game can keep you in your seat and be entertained. The story seems pretty long but I don't dread spending more time to unlock other character routes. In fact, I'm looking forward to them!\n+ Relationship bar. It's a nice feature to see your romantic progress with each leading man. \n+ The heroine isn't annoying at all. I was initially expecting the typical and usual irritating, damsel-in-distress, no spine heroine you usually find in other visual novels but I was proven wrong. She can actually hold her own and has a mind of her own. The heroine is easily relatable.\n\nNeutral: \nThere are a very few typos and grammatical errors but you can easily brush them off (unless you easily get offended by grammatical errors and typos) since they don't affect the storyline in any way. No biggie.\n\nCons: \n- Sometimes the music doesn't really suit the current situation and the music can be quite repetetive.\n- Some parts of the storyline has a bit of a slow progression but it's totally bearable. \n- I just found it a tad annoying that my character kept on saying \"Kuroyuki\" almost every time she's speechless or while she's listening to Kuroyuki speak. If I had a dollar for every time she did that, I'd be sleeping on a huge futon of dollars by now. \n- No Tokugawa route. :(\n\nThis game is really difficult to put down because it's addictive to play.

Nightshade is a gripping story set in the Sengoku Era, very loosely based off of the years after Nobunaga Oda's death. You will come across original and fictionalized historical characters and, depending on who you choose, your heart will soar or be crushed\u2014or both! Besides the main character (MC), this visual novel is fully voiced and the art is a stunning interpretation of the period.\n\n(I will mostly be referring to Hanzo's route here) Sometimes I'd look at Enju in awe because of her love for her friends and her ability to adapt. While admirable, she was the typical naive, porcelain skin, young woman that is seen too often in Japanese VN's. I also wish she weren't so docile and self-deprecating (though I understand it is a result of her environment) but I love who she becomes. Another thing I am grateful to the writers for is that some of the love interests (LI) never blame her for horrific things that happen. For example, Gekkamaru and Hanzo understood that situations were out of her control and explicitly said it was the other party's fault. Oftentimes in VN's, the LI would get irrationally upset and blame the MC, saying it could have been avoided but that never happened. I loved it.\n\nAt the beginning, sometimes I wanted Kyara to be the protagonist or to have her own route (still do). Kyara is confident, down to earth, funny, vulnerable, non-apologetic, and there's just a lot to love about her. There were missed opportunities to open up for more political intrigue and action sequences. In addition to Kyara, the game would have also benefited with a route for Ieyasu, mostly because of what I found during my brief research of the Nobunaga Oda (yay, tangential learning!). Ieyasu was a historical figure who, as a child, was a hostage of Nobunaga's clan and eventually grew to be one of his strongest allies. Again, missed opportunity.\n\nThe overall story is intriguing but doesn't branch very far. Every route is linear, whether you choose dialogue for the good or bad ending. Besides the finale, the same thing will always happen each route but the MC's characterization and development may vary. If you were like me and wanted to go down Hanzo's route first, it is nearly impossible to get it without restarting multiple times or following a guide. Even if you chose neutral options for other characters, simply picking the wrong area to visit will ensure you don't unlock his route (or your desired path). I'm not expecting Bioware-level decision making but having to choose places to visit with no indication of which route it benefited dragged things out; it's an inconvenient storytelling mechanic if you want a specific path.\n\nThe voice acting is phenomenal. I don't mind that Enju doesn't have a voice. It allows the player to place themselves into her shoes more easily. I also suggest using the MC's name instead of customizing it because the characters actually say her name aloud. Plus, it's odd to have dialogue suddenly cut off, especially during heated moments. Another mechanic that was completely unknown to me until recently is, if you have a mousewheel, you can scroll up to review and rewind back to a dialogue you might have missed. Lastly, some of the audio was recycled which broke immersion because it'd make me laugh. It's funny hearing the same kissing clip multiple times. It can be easily overlooked though!\n\n[b]My recommended order of play (spoiler-free; Bad Endings not considered; [u]route[/u] ratings\u2014not just LI):[/b]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Name[/th]\n        [th]5-Phrase Traits, Route Rating[/th]\n        [th]Reasons For Placement and Review[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Hanzo[/td]\n        [td]mysterious, pragmatic, motivating, encourages Enju to be more independent, respectful of his enemies and peers (10/10)[/td]\n        [td]I usually recommend best for last but this route will give you a good understanding of the politics to start off. By the end, the route featured the most dramatic and best character development, the perfect balance between angst and hope, the best slow burn, unsurpassed fight sequences, and the fact that Enju has a very healthy relationship with everyone throughout the route\u2014especially with Hanzo. All of it = relationship goals. I've replayed multiple times and will always return to this.

The majority of the plot is spent on minor characters\u2014which gave me some relief until the route felt more like a Bad Ending plot from middle to end. The MC reveres him in extremely unhealthy ways, even when he did horrific things. I loved his design and I might have been more lenient if he weren't her cousin (so yeah, incest warning) but even then, his route was sleep-inducing. I like him in other routes and I feel like this would have been better if it were about his strengthened familial bond with Enju, with an emphasis on Chojiro's ties between Iga and Koga clan. Another missed opportunity.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gekkamaru[/td]\n        [td]impulsive, loyal to a fault, idealistic, hotheaded, dramatic (6/10)[/td]\n        [td]Provided a lot more backstory for Enju's and Gekkamaru's family history. There's also a bit of a slow burn and a lot more angst than I expected. Many of the unfortunate things that happened in Chojiro's route occur here as well. It's not as infuriating but it's one heartbreak after the other so brace yourself. Even though the relationship is a bit fragile and not as happy an ending as I'd hoped it would be, I liked Enju and Gekkamaru's dynamic all the way to the end.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Goemon[/td]\n        [td]cheerful, often makes a pass at Enju, cunning, manipulative, trickster (4/10)[/td]\n        [td]Goemon can be assertive to the point of aggression at times, but he almost always asks for Enju's permission (almost). The times he doesn't or needlessly scares Enju are his scariest moments. While his design is terrific, this interpretation of the historical figure was less than impressive. The plot was filled with unpleasant twists and the drama leading to the end dragged on for way too long.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Kuroyuki[/td]\n        [td]playful, cocky, emotional, brutal, overzealous (4/10)[/td]\n        [td]I and many others recommend reading this route last because many untouched parts of the story are revealed. This route was not fun and it wasn't supposed to be. Kuroyuki and Enju had a destructive codependency that reminded me of Chojiro's route, only it was so much worse. I thoroughly enjoyed the way minor characters were woven into the story and how the main arc was elaborated through this route. I also liked the ending with the minor characters more than Gekkamaru's. The humor, strength, and persistence in Enju's friends was the highlight of this route.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nThere were times when the narrative and characters fell into overused VN tropes but it can be endearing for the novelty. If you can power through that, I'd say this is a win just for the production quality alone. There are still some bugs but the developers are always patching and they've been very responsive to the community which is terrific. People may also appreciate a diagram of the keyboard/mouse mechanics; hopefully it will be added! From the historical revisionism (particularly Hanzo and Goemon), to the visuals, the soundtrack and acting\u2014you'll find yourself in love, in awe, in tears. Despite its shortcomings, you'll be entertained for hours on end and Nightshade may even re-ignite your love of shinobi legends like it did for me. TL;DR: Play for Hanzo only.\n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1492286173, "timestamp_updated": 1511388821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736369", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31162953": {"recommendationid": "31162953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041810417", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1513867211}, "language": "english", "review": "I really have no idea what to say about this game, but I will try my best. \n\n---I like everything medieval so the setting and atmosphere was appealing. I think it did a fair job conveying it. \n---The sound track throughout the game nicely coincides with the atmosphere. I did not tend to like the opening theme song, but, in hindsight, it works anyway despite it. \n---The artwork was well done and for once most/all the characters are dressed stylish instead of sad and pathetic (I am especially looking at you Amnesia memories). \n---Most of the time there is only one dialogue option in each chapter and I personally did not see how one option could change the flow of the story THAT much . The characters do not seem to act much differently and quickly continue on the story without \"seeming\" to have make much change in their behavior or the story (with the exception of the endings). If the floral symbol gains color this is how you know you said the right thing, but the other options are not necessarily bad either. \n\n---The MC is generally likeable, but I personally found her flat as a character. I am not sure whether this is because she is the only character unvoiced or (more likely) how most otome MC's tend to go with the flow of the story and just happen to lack character because of it. [spoiler] Enju is kind, caring, and gentle, which are likable traits, but she also a victim most of the time. In every route she depends on others to help her, protect her, and guide her and rarely does the reader see Enju display any other kind of passion outside her default emotion of sorrow. In other times she is simply complacent.  Even when she does decide to stand up and take action she is constantly filled with self-doubt, regret, or believes herself undeserving of any sort of praise. Enju IS the epitome of the victim complexity. I would have liked it if she surprised me with some inner strength and fire within rather than her find it through fluke or with the help of the other characters. It is not bad that the others helped her, but it would help to explain why she is especially special to the other characters other than she is \"kind.\" [/spoiler]\n\n---consistencies was fairly consistent between routes with some minor instances suggesting otherwise. Example: [spoiler] if Gekkamuru is the protector type character he tries to fulfill that role in EVERY route. But ONE flaw between the consistency of character, in my opinion, was Chijaro. His route raised the question of whether why or how these character really love the MC. For some characters it seems obvious. Gekkamuru had been the MC's protector since before she was born and they have been together for a long, long time. Chijaro, also, has been with the MC since she was born. The problem is his reaction towards the MC in his route in comparison to the other routes. Chijaro is a Shinobi that will follow orders no matter what they are. In many of the routes (and this is a big spoiler fyi) he will try to hunt the MC down and take her life. In his route he also attempts to hunt her down when he is given the order, but once he has her in his hands he hesitates, backs down, and realizes he can't do it. The only difference of this change is the fact the MC and Chijaro have a few more interactive conversations, the MC gifts him a handkerchief, and tugs on his sleeve. Would he have killed her in the other routes if the other characters did not attempt to stop him? And just how precarious are his  emotions towards the MC when things like that could sway him from his resolve, but not just simply seeing her again? I found this to be a major flaw and/or simply underdeveloped in his route. [/spoiler]\n\n---It was interesting to have the characters fight battles. Most of the time you just see flashes of what can only be called as sword slashes across the screen. It would have been cooler, though probably more expensive, to have a short video of the fights. I started thinking of watching anime fight scenes like those from SAO. \n\n---I think I generally made all the points I could to nick pick at this game. Just because I did, do not let it completely sway you from this game. I write the bad to give a complete and honest review as unbiased as possible. This being said, it is one of the better Otome games out there on Steam. I have played Amnesia Memories, Ozmafia, and the ones from Cheritz though I didn't like the Cheritz ones (sorry over there) and I feel I have more experience reviewing Otome games now. I suppose I should change my opinion on some of the others, but probably won't since that is how I felt at the time. \n\nNightshade is pretty good and you can tell there was some time and love spent on it. I love everything medieval and the atmosphere felt authentic and the romance (though I hated the sound effect of the kissing...ugh...no thanks, silence please) it was not over the top. (thank god.)\n\nYes I would recommend it to Otome lovers and I believe most will be generally pleased. I guess I should add I am very happy adding this game to my collection. I am not sure if it is my absolute favorite since there are a couple I really like, but I would put it up there. I am not sure which of my favorites is my favorite.", "timestamp_created": 1492283477, "timestamp_updated": 1492639775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31158697": {"recommendationid": "31158697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087259785", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492226567}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sorry I bought Nightshade because I like the characters and the art, but it's never going to make my 'favourite otome games' list because I did not like the *story* and there was too much sadness for my tastes even in the happy endings (I only played the happy endings for each character, btw...I haven't tried any sad/bad ones)...I like a bit more happiness.

This makes the game become rapidly stale by around the third or fourth playthrough. \n* Events that would once invoke surprise or shock became predictable due to the linear storyline. \n* The character routes are not fully disconnected from one another, and they all build from the same premise. \n* No true/canon ending. \n\n[b]CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT 4/5[/b]\n\nRecommended Route Order: Goemon \u2192 Hanzo \u2192 Kuroyuki \u2192 Gekkamaru \u2192 Chojiro (storyline makes the most logical sense and greater spoilers throughout the Koga ninja trio routes) \n\nPros: \n\n* Captivating cast with fun and interesting relationship dynamics with one another\n* 5 obtainable bachelors; each with different and unique personalities\n* Interesting character pasts and twists \n* Delves into the thematic concept of what it means to be a Shinobi, and sense of duty conflicted by morals and beliefs\n* Crafted stronger attachments to the characters, due to the multi-faceted dimensions of their personalities due to the tragedy of their pasts\n\nCons: \n\n* Ieyasu Tokugawa is not an obtainable character, which is a huge waste of his lovely seiyuu and character design.\n* Needed more diversity in the character roles \n* They're all ninja, whereas including Ieyasu Tokugawa would have created a significantly more refreshing and multi-dimensional storyline in comparison to the current cast.\n* Would have made a unique path with a different perspective to the current storyline rather than running as a fugitive in every route\n* Would have liked epilogue endings for the characters with bonus CG for a more wholesome conclusion for the character stories. \n\n[b]DESIGN 5/5[/b]\n\nPros: \n\n* Highlight of the game\n* Surprising number of character sprites in the game that are illustrated and voiced\n* Beautiful character designs (especially for Enju's outfit and colour motif). \n* Backgrounds especially well done, they look like a water colour painting. \n* Nice character sprite poses, especially their fighting stance, ninja outfits and unique weaponry\n* Teita is the same artist for Norn9 by Idea Factory\n\nCons: \n\n* Artist is a little inconsistent with hands/body poses in some CGs, but it's a negligible point that can easily be overlooked. \n* Side profiles were noticeably the most awkward in CGs\n* Small discrepancy in quality between character sprites and the CGs within the game\n\n[b] MUSIC AND VOICE ACTING 5/5 [/b]\n\nPros: \n\n* Lovely music and OST \n* Enjoyed the battle theme \n* Experienced and famous character cast, and emulated their personalities very well. \n* Similar voice actors to the Hakuoki series, will instantly recognise their characters and voices. \n* For example: Hattori Hanzo (VA: \u6d25\u7530 \u5065\u6b21\u90ce Tsuda Kenjiro | Yu Gi Oh as Seto Kaiba, Hakuouki series as Chikage Kazama)\n* Goemon Ishikawa (VA: \u7dd1\u5ddd \u5149 Midorikawa Hikaru | Fate/Zero as Lancer, Starry Sky series as Yoh Tomoe, Fire Emblem series as Marth and Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto as Sakamoto) \n* Chojiro Momochi (VA: \u9ce5\u6d77 \u6d69\u8f14 Toriumi K\u014dsuke | Naruto series as Inuzuka Kiba, Hakuouki series as Saito Hajime) \n\nCons:\n\n* None\n\n[b] SYSTEM 3/5 [/b] \n\nPros: \n\n* Includes all basic functions such as save slot, skip, quick load/save and CG Gallery. \n* Nicely designed UI \n* Nice extra effects such as leaves falling, sakura blossoms scattering and rain animation.\n* Character animations such as blinking and mouth moving when speaking were included.  \n* Flowers appear on screen hovering over the bachelor whom you earned affection points with. \n* Memories tab allows you to replay chapters of your character route, and unlocks bonus events upon completion of route.\n* Had very clean fighting animations, definitely made the game a pleasure to play as the action unfolded\n* Variety of bachelor voices to choose from for the system dialogue \n\nCons: \n\n* First day release had text spacing issues. The team did fix after a couple of hours, but for a delayed release of 4-5 months after the original release date, you do not expect for these issues to still occur. \n* Text font choice could have been much better and clearer to read. \n* Had trouble initially adjusting the text speed because it kept setting text speed to 99% rather than 100%. As a result, text did not appear all at once and took some fiddling around with to work. This is a problem I have never encountered before.\n* Ease of use of the UI is average, and is on the clunky side. \n* Would have liked to see scene recollection included, rather than only being able to play the specific chapters of the character routes. \n* Jump button would have been useful (for skipping to the next decision) especially during the common route. \n\n[b] CONCLUSION [/b]\n\n* Solid game \n* Heavily inspired by Hakuoki. Athough Nightshade has it\u2019s own fair share of suffering and tragedy, it overall was nowhere near as dark and painful.\n* Had more light-hearted moments and genuinely happy endings rather than the bittersweet ones in Hakuoki. \n* Main highlight: beautiful artwork, stellar voice acting and great music. \n* First playthrough = 8hrs, subsequent playthroughs were 3-5 hrs per character. Total Game Time: 20-30hrs, which is fairly short. \n* The linear storyline and lack of character role diversity really took away from the overall feel of the game. It definitely lost its momentum and surprise factor by around the third playthrough, as it essentially only followed one of two linear game branches that both revolved around the same concept\n* Enju's character development did not feel as fleshed out or as well-developed in the other routes in comparison to Hanzo's story. \n* Not having Ieyasu Tokugawa as a character was a huge waste of potential for both storyline and character development\n* Would have liked to see a true ending/canon ending route. \n* Captivating character cast\n* System could have been greatly improved\n* Nonetheless, it is very enjoyable and one of the better otome games on the market\n* Would recommend\n\nOVERALL RATING: 3.5/5", "timestamp_created": 1492117131, "timestamp_updated": 1493437207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758994", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31121079": {"recommendationid": "31121079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027627254", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513444184}, "language": "english", "review": "The concept of the story isn't new in any way but it is believable, the characters are believable and so are the surroundings (it helps that some people, events and places are historically correct).

The OST is great, I really loved listening to some of them and I even bought the OST. Even the sfx are well done in this game, thing that you can't see in every single game.\n\n\nAnother interesting thing about this game is the fact that you can change the voice that is used in the menus, maybe for some this is something useless but I find interesting being able to hear their voices. Then another important thing, in my opinion, is that they added a relationship chart. A lot of games lack this option and is pretty hard to know how you are doing with the boys.\n\nSome of the characters that appear in this story, were real, like Hanzo, Ieyasu, Mitsunari and Toyotomi. I think this is something that makes the story funnier.\n\nThe game is pretty good, but of course, not everything can be perfect. The fonts in game are different to the ones displayed in the store, the letters are too separate like they wrote it like  t h i s  instead of like this. For some people, it might be annoying but doesn't make the game unplayable.\n\nOverall the game is awesome, I have been waiting for this for a while so now is my time to enjoy a great story and characters.\n\nEdit: The problem with the space has been fixed so it is perfectly readable.", "timestamp_created": 1492007930, "timestamp_updated": 1492296208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606729", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31093061": {"recommendationid": "31093061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354866983", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498637111}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are at all bothered by poor typeset / spacing you might want to avoid it.

otome games on Steam, and definitely the best otome translated from Japanese that I have ever played. It's one of my favourite visual novels ever, (up there with Nameless and Dandelion, Danganronpa etc). I almost wish it had less romance content at the end of the 'good endings' so it was more accessible to non-otome players, because the story is so classical and fantastic, any lover of history and adventure stories could love it. Instead of the usual fangirl rambles, going to try and do rational bullet points:\n\nHighlights:\n- Incredible voice acting\n- Well rounded main cast, all of the love interests shined in their own way and each route brought a new key detail to the plot\n- Great main character, who's personal arc changes route to route. A lot of character growth, and she's a NINJA. Finally a capable MC in a Japanese otome whos decisions make SENSE <3\n- Fantastic supporting cast!\n- CHARACTERS WITH BELIEVABLE MOTIVATIONS and agendas of their own including [spoiler]a believable, multi-faced yandere who I shockingly didn't hate[/spoiler] \n- Historical fiction setting, please more of this <3\n- Ninjas! \n- Amazing music\n- Gorgeous art. So many CGs!\n- Great action scenes (never thought I'd say that about a visual novel)\n- Solid translation, the writing feels natural\n- Romance feels very natural and develops well\n\nDownsides:\n- That  being said, the end of each 'good ending' felt like the writing was cramming more romance in to make up for the lack of lovey-lovey the rest of the time. It didn't need that, but it's not much of a complaint\n- There are only two main variations to the overarching plot dependent on early choices (But each route has it's own variety, I doubt you'll get bored)\n- It takes a long time to skip through text to see the second ending of a route\n- Chojiro's route loses impact if you play Gekkamaru's first and vice versa unless you space them out. Kuroyuki's route is also best left for after Hanzo's and Goemon's. I got lucky, but other people have struggled with the order to play them in apparently.\n- There are pacing issues with the end of 2/5 routes, but that is a minor niggle\n- You'll probably cry\n- Chojiro's stupid sword\n\nIN SHORT: Otome/Visual novel fans, please play this game, it's great.

Nicht nur das Design und die Grafik sind hochwertig, auch die Charaktere sind besonders gut gelungen und haben eine starke Pers\u00f6hnlichkeit. Je nachdem welche Entscheidungen man im Prolog und in den ersten Chaptern getroffen hat startet die pers\u00f6hnliche Route einer der f\u00fcnf Love Interests. Was mich hier besonders begeistert hat ist die Individualit\u00e4t jeder der f\u00fcnf Routes. Obwohl einem gleichen roten Faden gefolgt wird, gibt es doch immer wieder kleine, wie auch gro\u00dfe Unterschiede. Im Grunde kann man schon fast von 5 verschiedenen Storys sprechen und das bedeutet mehr zu entdecken und weniger zu skippen. Das ist f\u00fcr mich ein gro\u00dfer Pluspunkt! Auch die Tatsache, dass die \"bad endings\", wenn auch traurig, dennoch absolut passen sind finde ich einfach nur toll. Au\u00dferdem sind sie, wenn auch auf tragische Weise, unglaublich romantisch und das hat mich dazu annimiert jedes Ende zu erleben, obwohl ich sonst eigentlich immer nur die \"good endings\" spiele, weil ich einfach ein Liebhaber von happy ends bin, besonders wenn es um Romanzen geht. ;)\n\nAlles in allem bin ich also mehr als zufrieden mit Nightshade und kann es nur jedem Otome- und Romanzen-Fan ans Herz legen.

Chojiro is mostly cold and Enju is helpless most of the time.\n\nGekkamaru\nLots of people get killed. Enju doesn't seem to do a thing to help. Gekka's personality is mostly awkward, towards Enju that is.\n\nKuroyuki\nKuroyuki steals Enju away but she's not helpless. Thank god. At least she tries to protect him too. Many people may not like this route because of what happens at the end, but I think this story made the most sense in terms of tying together the murder mystery and motivations of everyone. \n\nGoemon\nMost fun route to play. Easy banter with Goemon. Least people killed. Finishes with a bang :) Good story with a clever twist.\n\nHanzo\nThis is the only route where the protagonist (Enju) actually grows (stronger) together with her love interest. I would play this over and over again :) And Hanzo is like ice on a slow thaw, becoming a warm and steady fire. And the low timbre of his voice.\u2764\ufe0f. This route also ties up all the loose ends with Enju's mother.\n\nVoices\nThe voice actors are really great too.\nHanzo is actually Chikage Kazama from Hakuoki, lol, my favourite character in Hakuoki too. \nAnd Chojiro is Saito Hajime from the Hakuoki series.

Not only is it beautiful art and music-wise, but the story behind each of the different routes is unique and no two are the exact same. They are so full of emotion and drama, I had to stop for a moment before I could continue. The voice acting was also beautifully done too. English translation was well done, I think only a few spots that it was kinda of weird.\n\nBonus: the protag isn't a helpless female who needs the LI to protect her. That's my #1 pet peeve with otome games. So many of them make the protag this over emotional, helpless, bland girl who only exists for the sole purpose of the LI. Nightshade I think does a pretty good job with their protag. She's not perfect, occasionally she worries too much and is a bit too worried about everyone else, but hey I'll count that as a personality flaw. My favorite route has her become even more of a ninja, while retaining her good heart, so A+ for a three dimensional protag!\n\nNot a lot of negatives for me, save one that a lot of otome games have: there's always that one LI that is totally unhealthy and I always think the protag has Stockholm Syndrome or something because every red flag I have shoots up and can make me uncomfortable reading it, but the protag is \"so in love\" or otherwise oblivious because \"I'll make him better\" or \"He didn't mean to do it\"... No idea why that's a thing in these games since they are basically a textbook example of bad relationships that hardly end well. But anyway, that's my only major concern with this game.

I usually find myself skipping it in most VN because I'm a fast reader, however I couldn't get myself to do this because I was mesmerized by how much emotion is put into every line, it makes the characters feel alive. The voice cast is one of the strongest points of the game without doubt. Everything is voiced, excluding the MC and even the secondary characters have an outstanding voice cast. I personally liked Kuroyuki's voice the most.\n\n[h1] Art\t[/h1]\nThe CGs, sprites and the entire art overall is gorgeous. Contrary to some other VNs I played, where you often find some proportions that look ''off'' I haven't found anything like that in Nightshade. Something else to note is the amount of work that went into each facial expression and character. We also get to see (almost) all of them standing, from the back, fighting and so on.\n\n[h1] Gameplay\t[/h1]\nI haven't encountered any game breaking bugs while playing, the only one being that when looking at the log, I couldn't use the sidebar to scroll up as this would crash my game, I could just use the wheel on the mouse though so it didn't really bother me much.\n\nOn a side note, use the right click to get to the save/load/title screen options. It might seem obvious but I struggled finding this on my first playthrough so just in case it's helpful for anyone.\n\n[h1] Plot\t[/h1]\nNow, the plot is in my opinion, nowhere near bland or a clich\u00e9. Contrary to other otome games in which the MC is really... naive? this one has a reason to acting the way she does that is fully understandable.\n\nI don't really know how to talk about it without giving away too much of the plot itself, but just be aware that the plot is heavy and you will see bloodshed. I thought the age rating would be there because of some sort of sexual content and while really slight teasing is visible in certain routes, I think it's more because of some [spoiler] rather graphic CGs[/spoiler]. A lot of things that might not make sense at the start will do later on. It's really satisfying once you've played through all routes and see that it all makes sense when put together. There are some slight variations from route to route though the major plot is roughly the same.\n\nI found all the love interests really likeable and it's really hard to choose a favorite one out of all of them but what I must give this game is that every route is long and they all got the same amount of importance, which I feel like isn't always the case in some other titles.\n\n[h1] OST\t[/h1]\nThe OST is by far one of my favorites out there, it fits the game perfectly and the melodies range from being very soft to accompany the cheesier moments to some heavier ones to accompany the battles.\n\n\n[h1] TL;DR[/h1]\nThe game is a masterpiece and easily one of the best otome games you can find on steam.

Goemon's route was a mess.\n-Expensive for the amount of content you actually recieve.

I loved all of the romanceable males, even the ones who had sides to them I normally wouldn't tolerate in an otome game, much less real world.

You play as Ueno Enju (given name changeable), the village chief's daughter who's going on her first mission. This game is one of the kind of otome games where you end up on someone's route depending on which one's affection you gain more of, and the five characters are: Gekkamaru, Kuroyuki, Choujirou, Hanzou and Goemon.\n\nGekkamaru - Gekkamaru is Enju's...bodyguard. He's a super sweet guy who worries about her a lot, and always tries to protect her to the point where she has to sneak away from him to be able train herself as a ninja. Gekkamaru's route is more of the \"truth\" route, where you discover why Enju's in the situation that she's been entangled in, and should definitely be played last.\n\nKuroyuki - Kuroyuki is Gekkamaru's younger brother who's apparently always liked her. He was sent away on a mission a long time ago, and returns just in time to join in on Enju's first mission. Despite his playful appearance, throughout his route, he's revealed to also be quite deceitful, though also very protective of Enju and envious of his brother for being the one who was chosen to be her bodyguard. To me, after Gekkamaru, Kuroyuki's route was the darkest.\n\nChoujirou - Enju's cousin and a very skilled ninja, Choujirou is the one who trains Enju. In his route, he's in a constant battle between his feelings he's developed for Enju, and his duty as a ninja. After Gekkamaru's route, I'd say his route is the saddest.\n\nHanzou - Hanzou is a powerful ninja who's duty is to protect Tokugawa Ieyasu. In his route, he is sent on a mission to protect Enju for the time being, and simultaneously trains Enju and helps her grow as a ninja. Under his tutelage, Enju becomes a much stronger ninja and is able to confront a painful truth about her situation.\n\nGoemon - Goemon is a thief who steals valuables from the rich and noble a**holes, basically a Robin Hood. He's an easy-going guy who bumps into Enju from time to time and kind of distracts her from her goal of collecting more information for her mission.\n\nAfter playing through everything, the order I recommend you play is Goemon, Hanzou, Kuroyuki, Choujirou, then Gekkamaru, which I believe is going from lighter and slowly getting darker, as the closer the characters are to Enju overall, the darker the route seems to be. It's really up to you what order you're going to play, however, definitely play Gekkamaru's route LAST for the final big reveal kind of thing.\n\nOverall, I did find the game a little short, however, I would certainly recommend it if you like the darkish otome games, or ninja otome games.", "timestamp_created": 1520221500, "timestamp_updated": 1520221500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40517777": {"recommendationid": "40517777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034623954", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513987301}, "language": "english", "review": "This game needs so much more recognition than what it has now, it's absolutely a gem in the world of otome games... this is a game that is completely different from most otome games.\n\nPositives:\n*stunning artwork\n*The main character is not weak\n*The era and setting are gorgeous and perfectly portrayed.\n*Descriptions are well done.\n*The love interests all have their own unique positives and negatives, even the ones I thought were boring turned out to be much more indepth than I thought!\n*All characters in this have a full personality, loved the side characters and their personalities as much as the love interests!\n*All routes are VERY different.\n*The mixture of tragedy and hilarity are done so well as to not ruin the experience.\n*The routes are very long and worthwhile.\n*Takes a while to get into the romance but it feels all very realistic and gradual.\n\nNegatives:\n*The routes are very long and CAN drag depending on your taste.\n*Takes a while to get into the romancey parts. (This can be seen as positive also)\n*The main character at times can be a bit TOO submissive, however it's realistic considering what happens.\n\nOverall, just very unique, so much detail and effort was put into this, it'll be on my mind for a LONG time, and I have yet to find anything like this, except for perhaps the Hakuoki series (which i'm waiting for part 2 to come out... impatiently. )\n", "timestamp_created": 1520020944, "timestamp_updated": 1520020944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40486818": {"recommendationid": "40486818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340337298", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519910374}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely buy this game.

The 'bad' endings here are still romantic, and none of them are freakin' scary (like Amnesia's).\n\n\nSpoilers below~\n\nA lot of people choose Hanzo's route as their favourite, and indeed: with that low rumbling voice and unearthly power, how can he not top the list? He encourages the protagonist to do her best and to keep improving - and somehow manages to do so without sounding naggy or arrogant. \n\nAlso it seems like there are quite a few who bash Kuroyuki's route. I think it's important to note that while his approach to love is immature, it doesn't lose in intensity. Yes, he is possessive. He is selfish. How else is a young person with his experiences supposed to approach love? His route made me think a lot, especially the line \"Must I pick a person out normally, spend time with her normally, in order to call that love?\" Who amongst us can say what love is anyway? \n\nChoujirou's route just made me sad.

Also, the partner you choose is willing to risk their life for you if in danger or tries to stop from harming yourself.\n\n- I haven't played the bad endings yet because I don't know if I can handle it. I just like to keep the happy side for now. However, the storyline changes a bit depending on which partner you choose and does have some heartaches between your friends and your chosen partner. It can be quite saddening. \n\n- Also seeing the dark side, weakness, and roller coaster ride from the characters taught me again that we are all human beings and we learn from each other whether it's good or bad. Building relationship matters and if you get to know that person deep you become to accept their flaws and understand as it is. Simply you do not care because the person grows on you.\n\n- I really recommend this game if you like diverse characters, immersive voice acting, engaging music, beautiful design of otome games. Please don't hesitate to purchase this and support so we can have more quality otome games through Steam! Otome games are not just dating many options of male characters and it is deeper than that. For me, it is getting to know the people who have a different outlook on life and building strong bonding relationship in many different situations. You can be carefree exploring and also can adapt some things you learn in real life.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1519069275, "timestamp_updated": 1519095372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40203845": {"recommendationid": "40203845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065264496", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520131655}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "I loved it!\nThe voice actors are so good and the stories are wonderful too,\nworth it every cent\nIt's at the same level as Cinderella phenomenon\n", "timestamp_created": 1518984806, "timestamp_updated": 1518984806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40148072": {"recommendationid": "40148072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075542385", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520147440}, "language": "english", "review": "PERFECT OTOME GAME!!!!! 10/10 BIG BOY 5 STAR OTOME GAME MASTERPIECE BABY\nThe art style is so beautiful, the music is really good, the story is intriguing, the characters are all wonderful. it makes you blush so many times...lots of save spaces + u can go back on dialogue. the story was actually really consistent in all routes it just all pulled itself together once u did everyones route its so fun.\n\nmy reccomended order:\n1.

I just had to write a review about how much I enjoyed this gem. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to sit still. \n\nI've played a number of otome games now but this one left such a huge impact on me that I just had to review it. I'll start with the characters.\n\nGoemon:\nI played his route first after accidentally unlocking it while trying to solve the mystery of the thief. I expected his character to be the token player-like, flirtatious character with a roving eye and tons of female admirers, but was proven wrong. While he his playful and somewhat flirtatious, he's also deeply protective, kind and with a wicked sense of humour to boot. The things he said/did had me smiling widely. He also treated Enju like a princess And his happy ending was my favourite among the five shinobi. \n\nChojiro:\nNext up was Chojiro. His route was so sad and I struggled to keep my emotions in check during his route. Everything in his road was a tragedy and I'm a little mad because it's so unfair that only he had to have such terrible things happening around him. I would have liked to see him more relaxed and happier with Enju, but they were both in so much pain in his route... But he's still adorable and from what little I saw, I think he'd make a good husband to Enju. It's too bad that their happiness had to come at a price in both the good and bad endings of his route...\n\nGekkamaru:\nI do like Gekkamaru, but I couldn't shake off the bodyguard vibes I had coming from him. And thus, he's probably my least favourite character paired with Enju. But! I still love him as a character. And I thought he was a total sweetheart many times. ^^\n\nHanzo: \nI love, love, love Hanzo! He was so commanding at first, but slowly grew supportive of Enju's decisions and supported her throughout. I think Enju and Hanzo probably had the most intimate relationship out of all the Shinobi and I loved how both characters changed and grew from each other. Enju learned to have more confidence and not question herself so much and Hanzo discovered the importance of empathy (even if he might have been doing it for the sake of Enju -p). The way he dropped his guard and showed his vulnerability made my heart beat just a little bit faster. But he's Enju's not mine, so I won't steal him. -p\n\nKuroyuki:\nLastly there's Kuroyuki. I know a lot of people think Kuroyuki's love is unhealthy. But a love like that is always so painful and I couldn't help sympathising with him... Every step made was for Enju and while he can be rather childish at times, I'd put it down to age (with him being the youngest). And possibly because of the intense trauma he underwent. \n\nHis obsession, possessiveness and jealousy almost caused him everything, but they always do say that if you love someone that much, you must be willing to let them go if you think it's right. No matter how much it hurts and he did that. I also liked how he actually confronted Enju's evil father for all the pain he'd inflicted on Enju and her friends (including himself).\n\nI really wanted Enju to save him from all that pain. And was really glad she did at least make him reconcile and apologise to his friends and brother at the very end. ^^\n\nSummary:\nThe sound and music were nice to listen to. The VA were all top notch and brought the characters to live. And the art was simply gorgeous. \n\nTo anyone hesitating about getting this game, don't. It's worth every minute put into it. Highly recommended. And one of my favourites to date.

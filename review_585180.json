The strengths this game has are:\n\n- An excellent and engaging story: The people feel real, their problems feel real, and you will care enough about them to really want to help them. And you'll feel it if you can't. I cried at least once.\n- Cerebral game play: Though the game play is limited to pressing the right words you'll need to read carefully and use your head to solve your problems, sometimes while you're under pressure. Getting it right feels relieving.\n- Consequential choices:  This game doesn't hold your hand. You'll want to make the right choices, and if you don't people's health, sanity or even lives may be at stake. You might not be able to help everyone.\n- Great presentation: Though text is the major medium the game uses, it uses all the tricks possible to convey the story really convincingly and effectively. \n\nThis isn't a big budget story, it's a low budget, relatively short (~4 hours), brilliantly executed, minimalist, story of something trying to understand humans, protect humans and become human.\n\nI don't usually make reviews, this is my second steam review after over 200 games (Gunpoint being the other one).

This has is no way altered my review for this game.\n\nOpen Sorcery is a text-based RPG where you play as a Firewall program in a world where magic exists. Each day you're given the task to look at 4 different locations, and if there's a \"threat\" (aka elemental spirit) then you get to choose how you want to deal with it. Want to just kill it with fire (literally)? Have fun. Would you rather try reasoning with it instead? No problem.\n\nUsually attacking a spirit will make you stronger while trying an indirect approach (like reasoning with it) will allow you to learn more about it. There are different Matters (fire, water, dark, etc.) and Motives (chaos, order, love, etc.)  you can learn about while you play, which you can use in specific situations. You also have a relationship meter with each person you interact with, and in some situations you need a high enough number in order for something to happen. In most cases it's good to go out of your way to become better friends with someone.\n\nThe best part about Open Sorcery is its replay value. You won't be able to do or learn everything in one playthrough, so it's a nice way to encourage you to try different tactics each time you start a new game.

The game is broken into game days that involve visiting each of the four locations, solving whatever problems might be in that location on that day.  \n\nAt first, the game lays on the computer metaphor very heavily, however, it starts to crumble rather quickly, as you, as a supposed program supposedly being kept from showing any signs of emergent AI are given surprisingly free reign to respond to various problems straight out of the gate.  The very first (non-tutorial) spirit you meet, you have the option to destroy it on sight, call for backup, or bargain with it to answer riddles to get it to leave peacefully... and the guy overseeing your actions is more concerned about you learning about the concept of \"chaos\" than the fact that you just did something so clearly outside the parameters of your instruction to start with... \n\nGameplay consists entirely of clicking on text prompts.  Some are standard Visual Novel multiple choice, but a lot of them are in the text, itself, where clicking on text results in a different word being shown (as seen in the trailer).  There are no \"continue\" buttons, however, so most of the time, one of the lines of text is the \"continue\" text, and others are \"more information\" text, and sometimes, you're making a choice between which set of text you are functionally asking a question about, and which you are ignoring when you thought it was just going to be a line that changes to a different description when you clicked on it.  \n\nThe game features several puzzle-like elements, the primary one of which is that you need to guess the elemental affinity of whatever spirit is causing problems to deal with them.  There is a \"matter\", which is one of the four Classic Greek elements, plus \"light\" and \"dark\" thrown in, and a \"motive\", which is the primary emotion or purpose of the spirit, which includes \"order\", \"chaos\", \"love\", \"fear\", \"life\", and \"death\".  Oftentimes, it's telegraphed pretty clearly, but when it isn't, the game basically just stops until you retry over and over and eventually get it right.  There aren't any additional hints to help you along, outside of closing the game, going to the forums, and asking for help directly.  There was only one instance I had to resort to plugging in permutations until I was told I guessed right, though, but it was still rather annoying.  \n\nDifferent methods of dealing with problems result in different status changes.  You can \"learn\" new matters and motives for yourself, which basically amounts to a MegaMan-like ability to copy powers from other spirits you interact with.  You also have an affection meter with several important characters, which is tested near the end of the game to have more beneficial ways of dealing with various problems.  \n\nThere are in-game achievements (but they don't have any on Steam) to encourage playing through multiple times to try every possible path, although I don't really have the will to do so, myself. \n\nAs an odd side-note, this game may be the only accidentally \"homonormative\" game I've ever played.  The only characters actually displayed in relationships with other characters are all in homosexual relationships.  Even Janet (one of your character's creators, and a 16-year-old) lives with a single mother with no other parent ever mentioned.  Of course, I haven't talked to the creator, but I at least presume that's just an accidental quirk of someone wanting to add LGBT stuff in, but forgetting to actually show any other relationships.",

The concept of the game itself - an elemental firewall protecting her network, with the possibility to destroy or save the world - is utterly thrilling, and as my first step into this genre, I have to admit, it's got me hooked. Scouring the game for every option, every possiblity, makes it wonderfully replayable, and I have no shame in admitting that I've played this game almost all day doing just that. The puzzles within the game are simple when you understand them, but have a note of complexity to them that makes them brilliant and charming in their own way, and despite being such a short game, each character is personalised and developed in such a way that they've stuck with me and are quickly becoming some of my favourite characters going. \n\nThe features you get after the first completion of the game are fantastic - they definitely make replaying the game a lot easier - yet don't detract the joy of playing the game itself. And that's another thing, actually; the game is still wonderful and still charming to me, despite having played it over and over. \n\nThe achievements are likely part of this. I'm not an overly avid perfectionist or completionist, but for some reason, this game has me totally hooked on getting everything - to the point that I now only have to get Hellfire, Janet's Final Log, and Perfect Ending. I think my only criticism would be that I'm actually struggling more with understanding Hellfire's hint and what needs to be done than Extreme Nightmare Hunter Toby - yet Toby's is the one that had the extended hint/walkthrough attached. I wouldn't have thought Toby's achivement was complicated enough to warrant this, considering Hellfire requires you to be \"spiteful\" - and honestly I have no idea what of BEL/S responses sound spiteful enough to get this achivement - in contrast to Toby's achievement explicitly stating that you need to make Pyreworm and Toby meet. It seems like odd prioritising to me, but I think perhaps that's because I struggle with tone, especially through text, so this achievement had me bested before I even attempted it. \n\nEdit: almost right after posting this, I got the achievement. I still stand by the original point, since I actually stumbled on it by accident. I only realised what I'd chosen was spiteful as the very last option on the branch came up. I think the struggle made getting the achievement much more satisfying, though, so I have little negativity on that!\n\nEven with this struggle, I'm absolutely enjoying the game, and I most definitely would (and have) recommend it to people.

If you're hoping for a lot more shades of grey, introspection, or ambiguous characterization, then you'll not be so thrilled. What I mean by archetypes is there's a lot of \"I AM THE DOOR.

If that sends tingles up your spine (after an appropriate amount of buildup), you're in for a good time.\n\nThe setting is great: it's the real world, but with magic, and with advanced science that allows people to harness that magic.

Your decisions as a sentient firewall can make or break the lives of those you're sworn to protect.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nOpen Sorcery is a text-based game with no real graphics, but somehow the game isn't ugly. The developer has someone been able to incorporate a sense of beauty within the words. Key words are outlined in red which really helps you in your endeavors. There is only one instance of real art in the game which comes at the end of each playthrough. Every character in the game has their own colour during the moments of brief exposition. Compared to other text-based games, such as those during the 80s, Open Sorcery is no different.\n\n[h1]Audio & Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe audio and soundtrack in Open Sorcery is very minimal, much like the rest of the game. There are only a couple different sounds in the game; a computer starting up, scanning, and rain. The computer-related sounds really get you into the flow of the game. Although you are a futuristic firewall, the rest of the technology around you is very vintage. If you've ever played SUPERHOT, you know that the game, despite it's VR technology, has a computer based around really old DOS systems. Open Sorcery is no different. The computer boot up sound and scanning sound is a throwback to the olden days of computer technology.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nOpen Sorcery is an RPG puzzle game. Your goal is to protect humans and eliminate spirits. You are given brief exposition which gives you clues as to the nature of the malevolent spirits/viruses. You must find their matter and their motive. A spirits matter is what they are made out of. Your character, known as BEL/S, is made out of Fire. A spirits motive is what drives them to do whatever they're doing. BEL/S' motive is Order. A firewall made of fire set to bring order and justice to those it must defend. This style of gameplay is really challenging and makes you read and re-read the bits of exposition and try to deduce the Matter and Motive of the spirits. Sometimes it can be rather straightforward, but other times you could be stumped for many minutes trying to figure out just what is going on. I actually enjoyed the gameplay style of Open Sorcery quite a bit even though I'm not the fondest of puzzle-type games.\n\nThere is also a relationship mechanic built into the game. There are certain occasions where you can meet certain characters which can help you on your journey. You can anger those you know or grow closer to them. Every decision can make or break the rest of your playthrough. \n\nAnother mechanic which I quite like is the fact that you can \"learn\" certain things about certain elements to aid your future playthroughs. Occasionally there will be an event which will have multiple options. Choosing a certain dialogue option can unlock more knowledge about an element; for example Darkness. \n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nAs I mentioned before, you are BEL/S, an elemental firewall created by Decker and Janet. You are tasked with defending multiple locations from malicious spirits. After every day, you must scan every location and eliminate potential threats. There isn't much I can say about the storyline without ruining the whole game, because, depending on how fast you can deduce clues from the text, you can beat the game in under an hour. What I can say, however, is that the ending of the game is quite difficult and will really force you to take a step back and think. You really connect with BEL/S and her/it's emotions and thoughts. Everything you do will have an adverse affect on the others around you, and the game does tackle some serious topics such as depression and homosexuality.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nI really enjoyed my time in Open Sorcery. Although there are no \"real\" graphics in the game, the overall experience isn't negatively impacted by that.

Fuck those. I completed Super Meat Boy 100%(not the achievements) and none of the levels in that game made me rage as much as the cartridge levels. Rings can be very hard to see with bright backgrounds, I unintentionally hit \"NO\" in the continue screen so many times, they're not fun to look at, I didn't like the retro music, and it's frustatingly difficult.\n\nThankfully, cartridge levels are just a bonus and only give you extra tumors.

Think Meat Boy, but less bouncy: most areas have a colour palette of \"black + grey + (another colour.)\" The game isn't particularly nice to look at, to be quite honest, but it seems that this was intentional.\nThe soundtrack is from Ridiculon, the same person who made the music for Isaac: rebirth and its DLCs. It's decent enough overall; it fits the chaos of the \"end of the world\" theme well. With that said, some of the tracks, particularly those for the Hollows and Golgotha are just obnoxiously loud in pursuit of being \"intense.\"\n\nThe core gameplay mechanics are very different from those in Meat Boy, but they work to create a similar gameplay experience. Ash, the player character, can jump variable heights based on how you press the button, jump to and from ledges for increased distance, but he can't freely wall jump. This single change leads to more inventive and engaging level design. \nEach area also has its own fair share of unique enemies and stage objects, which make gameplay more advanced without alienating the player by changing the core mechanics. Overall, the level design is exceptionally good, giving each area its own unique feel.\nThe game has plentiful secret levels, most of which can be found through a secret exit to a main level. They aren't hard to find, but they don't need to be; they still feel satisfying to find.

I can safely say they have achieved that goal as there are times where I have just found myself looking at the screen thinking \"How the hell am I supposed to even begin to do this?\"\n\nThis is a good thing though. The game may be tough as nails at times and make you want to rip your hair out or throw the controller across the room but the game is always fair.

gives a sense of accomplishment.  The first 55-60% or so (judging from my completion %) gave me this feeling, but ultimately turned into more of a test of patience than I am willing to put up with. The game really isn\u2019t about learning patterns and overcoming obstacles, but rather precision jump after precision jump and just grinding through it until you finally get that perfect run.  There are plenty of levels and bonus content, but there honestly isn\u2019t much variety and all comes down to landing jumps with no margin of error, often in quick succession.\n\nI consider myself to be above average at this type of game, but am starting to lose interest as the final 40% seems more like a grind rather than a fun challenge to overcome.  If you enjoy grinding through levels and/or have top tier mechanics at games like this, then absolutely play this one.  There is a ton of content and plenty of secrets/different paths to discover.

Steam has too few of these types of games. \n\nAs a veteren of Super Meat Boy from back in the Xbox arcade days, this is right up my alley. The controls are tight, but a little sloppier than SMB. Ive tried steam controller (sucks) and Xbox 1 (better), but cant imagine playing on keyboard. Just seems like the horizontal speed and jump height are too touchy, unpredicably so.\nBut I suppose thats a part of the challenge, I just remember SMB being tighter. Maybe Im getting too old.\n\nAnyway, TEIN is a great game, although definately for adults only. Right from the intro video its fbombs, and the \"characters\" you meet along the way often alude to masturbation as being the reason they are where they are. Just thought I would throw that out there for other parents. Steam doesnt do a good job of rating content, not that it would have stopped me from buying. Just would have waited for the kids to be in bed before playing.\n\nDo make sure you have a monitor with a good black contrast, the whole game is basically shades of black or grey, at least the first two worlds Ive made it to.\n\nBut yeah, if youre into hardcore difficulty (why else would you be on this store page?) this is a must buy, I agree with the underrated status. Once it hits Xbox and PS4 I think we will see tshirts and backpacks just like SMB.\n\n9.5/10 - would get high blood pressure again", "timestamp_created": 1512271791, "timestamp_updated": 1512271791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580060", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38020364": {"recommendationid": "38020364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058817463", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507869854}, "language": "english", "review": "Like smb", "timestamp_created": 1512266659, "timestamp_updated": 1512266659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38020229": {"recommendationid": "38020229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124612601", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512265999}, "language": "english", "review": "how do you make someone rage quit in the eleventh level you piece of trash game", "timestamp_created": 1512266127, "timestamp_updated": 1514371551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.245780", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38018503": {"recommendationid": "38018503", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984467826", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512259243}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u044f\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0434\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0439\u043d - \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u043a\u0443\u0441\u043e\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f\u0445 - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0434, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b \u0441\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043b \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c, \u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u043a \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443. \u041d\u044b\u0442\u0438\u043a \u043c\u0430\u043a\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430\u043d \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \"\u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439\" \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443\u0449\u0438\u043c \u0432 \u043d\u0451\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044f\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0438. \u0412\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043a\u0441 \u0438 \u0448\u043b\u044e\u0445.", "timestamp_created": 1512259571, "timestamp_updated": 1512259571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38017407": {"recommendationid": "38017407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378858293", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512255812}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good game with good storyline, but this is a platformer that is for people who can hardcore parkour.", "timestamp_created": 1512255876, "timestamp_updated": 1512255876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38016282": {"recommendationid": "38016282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991266403", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512252115}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly boring.

Vous devrez ainsi parcourir un monde post-apocalyptique \u00e0 la recherche des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du parfait ami. Encore une fois, l'humour est tr\u00e8s noir et l'univers est bien tortur\u00e9, mais tr\u00e8s coh\u00e9rent avec le level design.\n\nOn pourrait r\u00e9sumer le gameplay \u00e0 une seule action : sauter. En vrai, il y a plusieurs subtilit\u00e9s. On peut d\u00e9j\u00e0 doser son saut, notion qui sera essentielle pour progresser. On pourra ensuite s'accrocher sur les rebords des plateformes ainsi que sur certains \"crochets\", ce qui permettra de prendre appui pour un saut plus haut ou bien de s'\u00e9lancer tel Nathan Drake \u00e0 l'oppos\u00e9 du rebord. Il y a enfin une sorte d'attaque rod\u00e9o utilis\u00e9e pour casser certains sols et pour plonger plus vite. Ah, et il y a aussi des passages sous l'eau. Tout est tr\u00e8s simple, mais diablement pr\u00e9cis et efficace. Entendez par l\u00e0 que si vous mourez, ce sera de votre faute :p.\n\nSi le d\u00e9but du jeu est relativement facile, \u00e7a se corse assez vite, mais progressivement. Il y a une bonne dizaines de mondes diff\u00e9rents, chacun apportant de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de level design (eau, nuages toxiques, tapis roulants, etc...). Puis il y a les tous derniers niveaux du jeu, assez durs mais pas insurmontables. Et puis il y a le contenu bonus, qui vous fera vous arracher les yeux si vous osez vous y attaquer. Il s'agit de niveaux reprenant les mondes de bases, mais avec un aspect retro 8-bits du plus bel effet. Mais ne vous y trompez pas, ces niveaux sont d'une difficult\u00e9 tr\u00e8s relev\u00e9e. Par contre, la satisfaction de les r\u00e9ussir est incomparable.\n\nBref, The End is Nigh est encore une grande r\u00e9ussite de McMillen, qui saura vous occuper entre 5h et 6h (et des heures assez intenses), et plus si vous tentez d'atteindre le 100%. En plus d'avoir un univers atypique, le gameplay et le level design sont en parfaite coh\u00e9sion et d'une rigueur remarquable.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511778690, "timestamp_updated": 1511778690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37735501": {"recommendationid": "37735501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357985874", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511743911}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Banda sonora maravillosa de las mejores que he escuchado, terminarlo y saber que aun quedaban muchas cosas aun mas imposibles por hacer fue horrible D:", "timestamp_created": 1511744032, "timestamp_updated": 1511744032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37721074": {"recommendationid": "37721074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045853938", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508786369}, "language": "english", "review": "I played a lot of Super Meat Boy and when I saw this I thought, it would be pretty much the same.

High number of secret areas (though they don't feel particularly rewarding except the Future sections). One of the later levels (The Machine) makes very good use of the different level structure compared to SMB. Decent aesthetics. Tight controls and good level design.\n\nGripes compared to SMB: You can't warp to any room, just the start of an area. The soundtrack is just a bunch of public domain remixes instead of SMB's great original tracks. The deliberate limited color pallette makes it VERY hard to see things that can kill you, or the borders between what counts as floor and what counts as wall (both VERY bad things in this genre, especially since it's still true in the sections with limited lives).

And while my first impression was that The End is nigh would offer a similiar experience, there's some aspects of the game that I'm not quite as fond of.\n\nMy biggest critique are the interconnected levels. I have no idea who thought that this would be a good idea in a game like this. It's not \"hard\", it's unnecessarily tedious, unfortunately. If you are a completionist, the game makes you replay the same (insanely hard and frustrating) levels over and over, and some tumours can only be accessed from one side of the map, meaning you have to start over at world-1 if you want to collect them all. This circumstance \nleads me to not wanting to 100% the game like I did with SMB, as it, unfortunately, feels more like a chore at times. I honestly believe being able to warp to certain areas would definitely make the game a lot more fun to complete. \n\nSecond is the lack of pure, unadultered platforming in some of the levels. Sure, there are the cartridge levels (which are great), but some levels involve hoping the AI of some stupid enemy is behaving the way you need it to. \n\nAll in all, The end is Nigh is another great platformer by Team meat, but isn't quite able to live up to its predecessor.

The controls are a lot tighter than it's cousin Super Meat Boy, in fact they're so good it makes SMB feel floaty and slippery after going back.

Whereas I would sometimes call into question a death in Super Meat Boy, I feel like the mistakes that I make in The End Is Nigh are 100% on me. Even with the slower platforming, that adrenaline rush that comes with clearing a group of stages in a row is as intact as ever, which makes subsequent replays of TEIN a delight rather than a chore. \n\nThe story that the game tells is grittier, more mature, and funnier. Ash's bizarre optimism in the face of desperation is charming and poignant. The level environments support the storytelling by feeling like a more connected universe than Super Meat Boy, in part because of the immediate flow from one chapter into the next. You feel like you're taking Ash on a little adventure in this game. \n\nAs a byproduct of this connected, adventurers-welcome world, TEIN offers really no semblance of downtime, which makes speedrunning the game a nightmarish thrill ride. I've spent a couple hundred hours beating this game over and over and I still feel like I'm just getting started. I can't recommend TEIN enough for people who love to push their platforming skills to the outer limits -- you will find that this game will reward you in spades if you stick with it through the bitter end.", "timestamp_created": 1509999635, "timestamp_updated": 1510000057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821131", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36306751": {"recommendationid": "36306751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102286996", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 5626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1515172447}, "language": "czech", "review": "Macek guh guh ugo dejf minium 420/420\nDeni\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1l", "timestamp_created": 1509910651, "timestamp_updated": 1511382019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36286019": {"recommendationid": "36286019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133712502", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1516030604}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, as said, is by Edmund McMillin and Tyler Glaiel. If you know Edmund's two most popular games, Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac, the best description is that this is a cross between the two.

In my opinion, this game is just as good as those two indie legends, and if you like them, BUY THIS GAME. The music is amazing, and the art and environment varies throughout to keep it exciting.

I bought the game on sale for $10)\n\nEdmund Mcmillen is easily one of my favorite game developers. Sure, he's had his slip-ups recently (I'm looking at you, Rebirth DLC) but he still makes some honestly good games. The main issue I believe the Rebith DLC had was just...how  unenthusiased he seemed for Binding of Isaac. I believe that had a huge detriment on the quality of those two DLCs.\nBut lord behold, we have a new IP from him! Unless this is a Time Fcuk sequel. I'm honestly not quite sure.\n\n[h1] THE END IS NIGH! [/h1]\n\nThe game I've been waiting for so so long. Or at least, was. The teasers on the Isaac devblog gave me absolute Meatboy blueball. I needed this game. It looked incredible. And only now am I buying it, a [i]BIT[/i] late to it's release. And let me tell you, these first two hours have been an experience.\n\nThe intro to the game caught me pleasantly off guard, a... lovely introduction to the odd world. Essentially, the premise of the game is that...well, it's The End. The world is in shambles. Oh, but who cares about that! You're on a quest to build a friend out of tumours, and to play video games! Both IRl and in-game.\n\nWhile the pallette could use a bit of work in some areas, I love the atmosphere of the game's world. It captures the gloomy, yet sort of non-serious mood. Edmund's classic artstyle is greatly shown off and modernized. It's simply beautiful to look at, with how smooth all the lines and little details are.\n\nI believe it is important to note that [u]this is not as much of a Meatboy clone as you might think it is.[/u] You can really tell Edmund put some elbow grease into making sure it wasn't too similar.\nIf you were a fan of the wall jumping, I have some bad news. It's dead. Kinda. So let's hope you like edge grabbing, similar to Spelunky's. One might think right off the bat that this removes the freedom of the game, and in some regards, yes, it does. It only allows you to walljump in certain areas, right? Whilst in Meatboy, if you wanted to scale a wall, the chips were yours. Well, with the way the levels are designed, I believe it fits this game perfectly. It makes secrets far more intricate to get to, and it really makes you think outside the box sometimes, with how you handle certain situations.\nAnd, don't worry. There's plenty of platforming variations. Water, and springs are a couple of examples. Don't get TOO mad.~\n\nLet's talk secrets for a second. Yeah, it's Edmund, what'dya expect? Of course it's gonna have tons of secrets. But, be warned. Getting to some of them can be a tad bit annoying. Sometimes requring you to do a series of overly-specific jumps and such, sometimes in a timed manner, to get to.\nIn terms of collectibles, say goodbye to Bandages, and say hello to Tumours. For almost every stage, there is a tumour to collect. Collect enough tumours, and you get access to challenge stages, which usually hold a catridge at the end, as well. The cartridges perform similarly to Meatboys; a series of levels that you must get through, only with a specific number of lives, or sometimes only one life! It sort of disappointed me to see multiple character unlocks not included, but I think this is a pretty okay solution to including in these challenge and retro levels. Rather than having to hunt down some absurdly hidden warpzone.\n\nNow, some may disagree with me, but in my opinion, the most unique part about the game are the stages. And I'm not talking design; I'm talking how they're pieced together. For you see, there is no world map here, with levels to choose from. You go along the game by walking from one stage to the next. This opens up SO many possibilities for secrets to be placed, as well as alternate ways to handle platforming. And it really just fits the game's pace perfectly. Once again, Edmund trying to differentiate the game from Meatboy. I like it.\n\nAnd if you're a sucker for kicking soundtracks, this is just the game. Each soundtrack fits almost perfectly with each scenario. I honestly don't see why Ridiculon gets so much shade thrown at them. They've made great music for both Isaac, and now this [url=https://ridiculon.bandcamp.com/track/ruin-in-the-hall-of-the-mountain-king-grieg-1875]work of art.[/url]\n\n[h1]All things aside, this game is honestly worth your time and money if you're a sucker for platformers, especially if you're a Meatboy fan. The graphics and aesthetics are gorgeous, it sports some brilliant platforming elements, and it has plenty of things to collect and do. Edmund wanted to avoid making Meatboy 2: Gush Edition\u2122, and he succeeded brilliantly. Haha, be warned though, it's kind of, uh.

I never minded the difficulty and actually enjoyed the sense of achievement that comes with it.\n\nThe difficulty here, though, is simply not enjoyable at all. For example, it wasn't until now that I fully appreciated the genius of how SMB would play back your cumulative deaths each time you died. That way, even in the midst of frustration, you could always either laugh at seeing that 90% of your deaths were a single jump at the beginning OR you could look at that other 10% and get a sense of progress. In this game, you will die, immediately respawn in an oddly jarring way and die again 2 seconds later. \n\nFinally, I should note that, for the most part, my complaints are most relevant for the far more difficult extra levels.

You play as Ash, a \"human-like blob thing\" who has managed to survive the end of the world. Set out on a quest to make a friend and collect video game cartridges. It's HARD.\n\nOnce again another good game from Mcmillen & Co, this time another platformer. One of the main gimmicks this time around is that instead of having a wall jump like you did in meat boy, you now instead grab onto any and all ledges and can then either jump upwards off of them or fling yourself off the wall to gain some horizontal velocity. I say gimmick because it doesn't always feel quite right and more often than not it felt like i wasn't grabbing onto ledges when i should have been. Not a huge problem, but quite a bit frustrating.\n\nThe game is pretty hard but there isn't a huge penalty for dying (except in the last 75% of the game) so no problemo. If you are decent at platformers i'd say there is around 8 hours of gameplay. (unless you're going for all the achievements and endings, then times that by like 4) Just be warned that if you end up getting the regular ending that there is a timed section that is a pain in the ass to complete. (but it's the final level so it's a good kind of pain in the ass)\n\nThe soundtrack is just remixed classical melodies and it sounds freaking badass. My favourite tracks are RUIN and ACCEPTANCE. Great work on the OST Ridiculon.\n\nOverall i would give it a 7.5 out of 10. I'm not sure if i like it more than Super Meat Boy as the speed that i loved in that game isn't really present here until the final stage and even then it's still pretty slow. I do recommend it though, especially if you loved previous McMillen games.\n\nGo on, and grab some tumors along the way.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508356576, "timestamp_updated": 1508356576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35811397": {"recommendationid": "35811397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084715636", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508304789}, "language": "english", "review": "LIVES AT THE END", "timestamp_created": 1508304799, "timestamp_updated": 1508304799, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.278977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35806938": {"recommendationid": "35806938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152158610", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1473, "last_played": 1516247105}, "language": "english", "review": ":(", "timestamp_created": 1508283964, "timestamp_updated": 1508283964, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.349268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35792726": {"recommendationid": "35792726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295770174", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515174553}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a fine line between hard and fun, and nearly impossible and frustrating.

They are definitely not worth the time. In the time I spent getting a mega tumour (worth 5 tumours) I could've beat the game five times over.\n\nTumours aside, the game is very fun, beating (most) levels gives a massive sense of acheivement. \n\n\nOn another note, the arcade games are even more punishing than anything else.

Quand l'un des deux coauteurs de ce chef-d'\u0153uvre historique sort un nouveau jeu de plateformes, c'est donc un \u00e9v\u00e9nement \u00e0 observer de pr\u00e8s.\n\nThe End Is Nigh met en sc\u00e8ne Ash, dernier survivant d'une apocalypse nucl\u00e9aire ayant ravag\u00e9 le globe. Difforme, \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 d\u00e9compos\u00e9 et peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 mort, Ash passe ce qu'il reste de son temps \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 son unique jeu vid\u00e9o, The End Is Nigh, qu'il diffuse en streaming sur Internet sans qu'il n'y ait plus personne pour le voir ou l'entendre. Mais un jour, sa cartouche grille sans r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration possible, et Ash, exc\u00e9d\u00e9, d\u00e9cide alors de sortir de son abri de fortune pour explorer un monde totalement d\u00e9labr\u00e9 dans l'espoir d'y d\u00e9nicher de nouveaux jeux vid\u00e9o - et peut-\u00eatre trouver suffisamment de bouts de bidoche \u00e9pars \u00e0 partir desquels il pourra se fabriquer un ami.\n\nLe jeu a de nombreux points communs avec Super Meat Boy: on reconna\u00eet la patte graphique de Edmund McMillen (ici plus \u00e9pur\u00e9e et \u00e9l\u00e9gante), son humour noir, les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences r\u00e9tro, l'id\u00e9e d'offrir des variantes plus dures de niveaux d\u00e9j\u00e0 visit\u00e9s, et le fameux principe ludique des mini-niveaux tr\u00e8s durs mais tr\u00e8s courts que l'on peut recommencer sans interruption encore et encore sans avoir \u00e0 s'enquiquiner avec un message de \"Game Over\" ou un compteur de vies.\n\nLa maniabilit\u00e9 et la structure ludique de The End Is Nigh le distinguent pourtant nettement de Super Meat Boy, du moins au d\u00e9but: le saut mural et le bouton d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration ont disparu et il y a donc moins d'inertie dans le [i]platforming,[/i] mais Ash peut en revanche s'agripper \u00e0 des crochets ou aux angles des blocs \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de Prince of Persia et s'en servir comme prise pour se propulser. Il peut aussi effectuer une charge au sol pour descendre plus vite ou briser certains blocs, et ramper pour glisser plus facilement sur les angles des blocs.\nPoint de vue structure, au lieu du menu de Super Meat Boy qui donnait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses mini-niveaux et permettait de comparer ses meilleurs temps dans un classement en ligne, on a ici une quinzaine de \"mondes\" comportant chacun entre quinze et vingt \u00e9crans faisant office de mini-niveaux, sans scrolling mais connect\u00e9s bout \u00e0 bout, avec une circulation libre \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d'un jeu de plateformes classique et une grosse emphase sur la collecte: il y a \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s une \"tumeur\" par \u00e9cran (la ramasser est [b][i]beaucoup[/i][/b] plus difficile que simplement atteindre l'\u00e9cran suivant), ainsi que des \"m\u00e9ga tumeurs\" et des cartouches de jeu vid\u00e9o \u00e0 d\u00e9nicher dans des \u00e9crans cach\u00e9s.\n\nCes \u00e9l\u00e9ments font de The End Is Nigh un jeu initialement beaucoup plus pos\u00e9, plus calme et plus m\u00e9thodique que Super Meat Boy, plus contemplatif aussi, chose renforc\u00e9e par sa bande-son compos\u00e9e de musiques classiques remix\u00e9es. Malgr\u00e9 une difficult\u00e9 \u00e9quivalente, l'absence de bouton d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration crispe moins les mains et l'absence de chronom\u00e8tre crispe moins les nerfs, et le [i]level design[/i] tire bien parti des diff\u00e9rences de mobilit\u00e9 entre Ash et Meat Boy. Par moments, on se croirait presque dans un [i]puzzle platformer[/i].\n\nCependant, la difficult\u00e9 grimpant exponentiellement finit par tout aplanir: plus le jeu devient dur, plus il ressemble \u00e0 Super Meat Boy, avec des dizaines d'essais successifs encha\u00een\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on hypnotique o\u00f9 l'on fonce d\u00e8s sa r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration pour tenter de se synchroniser avec un [i]level design[/i] hyper nerveux et ultra agressif, et cette proximit\u00e9 ne tourne pas \u00e0 l'avantage de The End Is Nigh: comme Ash est moins mobile que Meat Boy, le [i]level design[/i] devient plus lin\u00e9aire et plus pointilleux au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'il devient plus dur, jusqu'\u00e0 atteindre le niveau d'un [i]kaizo platformer[/i]. On ne retrouve pas ici l'\u00e9quilibre que Super Meat Boy avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 instaurer entre son exigence et son extr\u00eame maniabilit\u00e9, \u00e9quilibre qui lui permettait de toujours rester fair-play et stimulant m\u00eame dans ses niveaux les plus sadiques. Le plaisir de jeu de The End Is Nigh s'en ressent am\u00e8rement.\n\nEn plus de la quinzaine de \"mondes\" du jeu, on peut jouer \u00e0 la vingtaine de cartouches que l'on aura d\u00e9nich\u00e9es ici ou l\u00e0. Ces jeux r\u00e9tro se ressemblent tous et ne sont qu'une version pixelis\u00e9e du jeu principal, avec des r\u00e8gles qui varient: vies limit\u00e9es ou infinies, gameplay orient\u00e9 vers la survie ou la collecte, etc. Certains d'entre eux sont assez longs et ils offrent les d\u00e9fis les plus cors\u00e9s du jeu et la plupart de ses [i]achievements[/i].\n\nAu final, au moment d'\u00e9crire cette critique, j'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 The End Is Nigh une vingtaine d'heures, j'ai boucl\u00e9 \u00e0 100% toute la grosse premi\u00e8re partie du jeu (ses neuf premiers \"mondes\"), j'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques cartouches, et j'ai battu le d\u00e9but des \"remix\" infernaux de la seconde partie du jeu.

The retro levels have limited lives thus are much harder, but they were still fun to complete, though the later ones can get pretty frustrating. I would definitely not recommend this if you're inexperienced in the platforming genre.\n\nThe controls are simple but it feels like there's a good amount of mastery and improvement, now that I've finished the game I look forward to watching speedruns of it. There are also many collectibles to gather, some found in hidden areas (the map tells you how many hidden areas are in a world) I found these very satisfying to collect. (There's a good reason to collect them too, if you play the game I recommend getting a lot). \n\nOverall I really liked adventuring with Ash, it is well worth the full price for the amount of content and challenge found, this is probably one of the best platformers I've played in a long time. Right from the start, it hooked me in with the charm and satisfying gameplay and collectibles. \n\nIt is a very difficult game, but in the non-optional main levels, it never feels too punishing. \n\nI

It's an insanely difficult platformer just like Super Meat Boy, but it has one key difference: You can't wall jump! This defines the game, and is more fun than it sounds. Because the game centers around hanging on ledges and boost-jumping off of them.\n\nJust like Super Meat Boy, precise controls aid you in your efforts to overcome ridiculous platforming challenges. However, it never overwhelms you with this absurd challenge at first. The game, for the most part, starts at a \"moderate\" difficulty then very slowly ramps up. Introducing you to harder and harder challenges that are perfectly doable. Even the most absurd platforming problems require subtle button presses and nuanced use of movement, in order to beat them.\n\nThe End is Nigh has more value than it seems. Not only does it have a ton of collectible and \"adorable\" tumors, which are more important than you think, the game has tons of other secrets to find. You'll spend quite a few hours searching for them, and you'll eventually get good enough to traverse the levels to find them all. The game really DOES have over 600 levels in total!\n\nThis game doesn't progress like a normal platforming game, such as Super Meat Boy, where you have to SELECT your individual levels. Each world can be selected from a map, but the individual levels within these worlds behave like one big long path. With forks in the road leading to goodies and secrets. You traverse between these worlds via teleporters. In fact, the entire game is one giant path that... almost looks like a pitchfork, due to 3 branching ways you can go.\n\nVisually, the game looks quite good! The signature artstyle is here, with beautiful effects that look rather impressive despite the relatively primitive artstyle. In a way, this game is charming with its morbid atmosphere and sense of humor. There's something almost whimsical about the dark and bleak world of The End is Nigh. Technically, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong, and you have all the options you could want at your disposal, including solid video options.\n\nWhat makes The End is Nigh so brilliant is that sheer satisfaction you get from beating tough segments. Just like in Edmund McMillen's amazing Super Meat Boy, beating the toughest challenges and secrets will give you a serious amount of \"gamer cred\". Whatever such a thing is even worth.\n\nThe only thing truly hampering this game is the difficulty. If you hate \"rage platformers', please for the love of black blobs everywhere, just stay way. But if you're a masochist who gets sick pleasure out of being satisfied from beating tough platformers, this game is highly reccomended!", "timestamp_created": 1506145960, "timestamp_updated": 1506145996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35124562": {"recommendationid": "35124562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040338707", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506071480}, "language": "english", "review": "To appease the nit-pickers who'll complain about a review any more complex than a list of pros and cons, I'll keep this review short and simple.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n[b]-The game is definitely hard.[/b] \n[i]((LOOK HERE BEFORE SAYING I DON'T LIKE THE GAME FOR BEING TOO HARD))[/i]\n-Rich Evans is a good voice actor.\n-Jumping on enemies/projectiles is fun.\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n-The game has EXTREMELY basic physics; far less fun than what anyone would expect from a game made in 2017, let alone a game made by the same guy who made Super Meat Boy. Nothing makes it stand out aside from the fact that you can jump off of ledges, which isn't exactly anything worth writing home about.\n-The second half of the game has lives, and resets your progress once you run out. Lives in a game like this aren't fun, they're just a lazy, tedious way to pad out the game's length. It doesn't make the game any harder, it just makes it more annoying.\n-Said lives are based on the amount of tumors you've collected through the first half of the game, which is something you're never told, meaning that if you want more lives, you'll have to go back and play through any incomplete worlds all over again to collect them thanks to the lack of a level select system. Again, this doesn't add any difficulty, and merely pads out the game's length by forcing you to replay levels to reach the ones you missed.\n\n[i]Misc. Complaints[/i]\n-The game is ugly. Yes, I get it, the point is that the world is ugly because it's dead, but that doesn't really excuse the fact that every texture is just one solid color. It's boring to look at. Even Super Meat Boy's basic tile-based graphics were much, much better.\n-No proper bosses. I'm aware that it's more of a personal thing, and that some people don't like bosses in platformer games, but still, a variety in gameplay would be nice.\n-The soundtrack is just bland, generic remixes of public domain songs, with the rare inclusion of a unique song that still doesn't really manage to stand out from the drudge of generic remixes of In The Hall of the Mountain King and Flight of the Bumblebees.\n-No level editor. Not that it needed a level editor, I guess, but it's hard to not compare this game to Super Meat Boy and be disappointed by how much it's lacking.\n\nI can say without an ounce of hyperbole that this game feels like some quick flash game made for Newgrounds in the early 2000's. It just makes me wish I was playing Super Meat Boy; multiple characters, better level design, a level editor/in-game custom level prowser, actually fun gameplay, and so on.", "timestamp_created": 1506075628, "timestamp_updated": 1510448975, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626961", "comment_count": "20", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35100319": {"recommendationid": "35100319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058091175", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 918, "last_played": 1516341892}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, i played it a lot", "timestamp_created": 1505983943, "timestamp_updated": 1505983943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466761", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35089606": {"recommendationid": "35089606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120498133", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508785067}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si te gust\u00f3 SMB te gustar\u00e1 , si bien es un juego de plataformas y que no reinventa nada nuevo como tal , tiene identidad propia y se siente fresco , mundos interconectados con una calidad de niveles muy buena y tumores de por medio (colecionables).

The End is Nigh is easily one of the best platformer games on the market, and a spiritual successor to Super Meat Boy, which I also love. However, I wouldn't even compare this game to SMB at all except the fact that they're both platformers and are from Ed. With that said, in my opinion, TEiN combines a simpe video game with complicated cinematic style story telling. It of course has deeper meaning to be interpreted by us just as you can expect from Ed. The game features simple base mechanics, however, you can't sprint or wall jump, instead, you are highly mobile already, can hang on ledges, and have insane air control. This couples for a very interesting platforming experience, while it stays true to the base of the genre. The game isn't afraid of itself, by that I mean, it is very open about what kind of game it is, Ash, the main character, is a typical gamer guy who curses a lot. By the way, in case you didn't hear, this game takes place after the apocalypse, where Ash is the one survivor, so he doesn't have much of an audience on his livestreams, and his game cartridge crashes and he sets out to make a friend blah blah blah. Sounds pretty simple and innocent right? Nope. You will die time and time again, only to become get to the next level and repeat the same process, trust me, I have 40 hours and I'm still not done yet, so that means the game will last a while right? Anyway this game has an amazing soundtrack as well, which I can only urge you to hear for yourself to see what I mean. I give The End is Nigh a 9/10 in numbers or whatever.

The mechanics and controls are stiffer and the gameplay is great but more \"sacaded\". The level are usually longer than they were in SMB. There is more complex and obscure rule. Basically this game is shortening it's audiance and changing name to avoid making a \"vanilla\" Super meat boy for an ever bigger audience.\n\nWell now you know what you are getting into, it's for sure not for everybody.", "timestamp_created": 1503605084, "timestamp_updated": 1503606295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34460125": {"recommendationid": "34460125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402543839", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511520268}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2athe end is nigh \u662f\u770b\u6563\u6563\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4ef7\u683c\u5bf9\u6211\u800c\u8a00\u6709\u4e9b\u8d35\u4e86\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u72e0\u5fc3\u4e70\u4e0b\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5c5e\u4e8e\u90a3\u79cd\u9053\u7406\u6211\u90fd\u61c2\uff0c\u53ef\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u53bb\u2026\u2026emmmmmm\u2026\u2026\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u624b\u6b8b\u515a\u5f88\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6e38\u620f\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u52b1\u5fd7\u5168\u6536\u96c6\uff01\u987a\u4fbf\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u80fd\u73a9\u4e00\u5e74\u2026\u2026\u5927\u5bb6\u5982\u679c\u60f3\u627e\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u8bdd\u3002steam\u91cc\u6709\u4e2a\u6307\u5357\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u5168\u90e8\u9690\u85cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u56fe\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5404\u79cd\u6210\u5c31\u89e3\u8bf4\u7684\uff0c\u603b\u4e4b\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u597d\u5440\uff0c\u73a9\u7684\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6b7b\u4e86\u4e00\u5343\u591a\u6b21\u4f46\u8fd8\u8981\u7ee7\u7eed\u6b7b\u4e0b\u53bb\u52aa\u529b\u901a\u5173\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503582217, "timestamp_updated": 1503582217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34454727": {"recommendationid": "34454727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345423807", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509266425}, "language": "schinese", "review": "3300\u6b21\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u6211\u53d1\u4e2a\u8a00\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6015\u4e0d\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6296M\u8bad\u7ec3\u5668\uff0c\u539f\u672c\u6211\u5728\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e00\u5343\u6b21\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5e94\u8be5\u4f1a\u5931\u53bb\u8010\u5fc3\u7684\uff0c\u539f\u672c\u6211\u5728\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e24\u5343\u6b21\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5e94\u8be5\u5378\u8f7d\u6e38\u620f\u7684\uff0c\u539f\u672c\u6211\u5728\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e09\u5343\u6b21\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5e94\u8be5\u7838\u6389\u624b\u67c4\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u611f\u53d7\uff1a[spoiler] \u554a\uff0c\u6b7b\u7684\u597d\u723d[/spoiler]\u3002\n\n[spoiler] \u611f\u89c9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e86\u4e0d\u5f97\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1503560875, "timestamp_updated": 1503560875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34452419": {"recommendationid": "34452419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263359382", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507493932}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet another amazing game by Edmund McMillen!", "timestamp_created": 1503548885, "timestamp_updated": 1503548885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34447335": {"recommendationid": "34447335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127103210", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508176422}, "language": "french", "review": "The End is Nigh est le dernier jeu de Edmund Mc Millen, connu notamment pour The Binding of Isaac et Super Meat Boy.\n\nBeaucoup, et moi le premier, ont eu peur que ce soit une redite de cet illustre dernier. Il n'en est point question ici. Super Meat Boy est un jeu tr\u00e8s nerveux tandis que The end is Nigh est un jeu plus pos\u00e9, le gameplay ne proposant pas de super sauts comme dans SMB ou niveaux \u00e0 finir dans un temps donn\u00e9 (sauf...).\n\nLa premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 dire est que le jeu est tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s difficile, voire compl\u00e8tement dingo par moment. Le sadisme du level design est pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 un paroxisme qu'il m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rarement donn\u00e9 de voir. Cependant, ce jeu de plateforme est, malgr\u00e9 cette diffcult\u00e9 qui pourrait en rebuter certains,  un jeu tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s intelligent. En fait, aussi intelligent que sa difficult\u00e9.\n\nThe End is nigh se pr\u00e9sente de mani\u00e8re classique sous forme de tableaux \u00e0 traverser. Aller de la gauche vers la droite afin d'arriver au tableau suivant. L'intelligence ici se trouve dans les multiples zones cach\u00e9es, l'organicit\u00e9 de l'ensembla des tableaux (tout se suit de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s fluides, ont est assez loin de SMB et de ses tableau ind\u00e9pendants, quand bien m\u00eame dans le m\u00eame monde) et dans les \u00e9nigmes \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre. Oui, des \u00e9nigmes.\n\nEn effet, la difficult\u00e9 de certains tableaux posent question. Et c'est \u00e0 cette question qu'il faut r\u00e9pondre. Il faut traverser le niveau selon un certain ordre ou un autre. Chose remarquable, les \"\u00e9nigmes\" sont donc r\u00e9solvables avec diff\u00e9rentes solutions. Bien s\u00fbr, ce n'est pas vraiment un jeu \u00e0 \u00e9nigmes tel qu'on pourrait le penser. Nous ne sommes pas dans un point'n'click. N\u00e9anmoins l'analogie est pertinente, surtout lorsque nous avan\u00e7ons dans le jeu et que celui-ci devient particuli\u00e8rement ardu.\n\nAinsi, The End is Nigh se pose selon comme une pierre angulaire du genre, un chef d'oeuvre qu'il serait particuli\u00e8rement dommageable de zapper, vu l'amour que donne les d\u00e9v' \u00e0 travers le jeu. De multiples zones, de multiples fins, sans parler des jeux dans le jeu (et un paquet !!!) qu'on peu trouver \u00e7a et l\u00e0 sous forme de cartouche \u00e0 jouer dans la console au sein du jeu.\n\nThe End is Nigh est une la preuve, s'il en fallait une, que ce qu'entreprend Mc Millen devient tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s souvent une tuerie. Recommand\u00e9 plut\u00f4t mille fois qu'une.\n\nLes + :\n\n- Une dur\u00e9e de vie astronomique (surtout lorsqu'on est assez mauvais comme moi)\n- Des tableaux qui s'enchainent organiquement\n- Des tableaux cach\u00e9s \u00e0 foison\n- Plusieurs fins\n- De nombreux jeux \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du jeu\n- Un univers rigolo (Edmund semble aller tr\u00e8s bien, merci, il a pleion de tumeurs)\n- Le gameplay tr\u00e8s fluide, se d\u00e9marquant tr\u00e8s nettement de SMB\n- Lamusique g\u00e9nialissime, compos\u00e9e de plein de reprise de musique classique. Un must have. Vraiment.\n\nLes moins :\n\n- Une difficult\u00e9 retorses pour de nombreux joueurs.\n- Collecter des cancers, c'est le mal.\n\nEN d\u00e9finitive, une nouvelle tuerie de Mc Millen, un must have pour tous les fans de platformer \"hardcore\", qui aimer jouer \u00e0 des jeux qui suintent l'amour du jeu, la g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 et l'intelligence.

praise will not be effective, but I must warn you. Not adding to the other reviews here I have two HUGE problems with it.\n\n\nProblem 1: \nThe vast majority of levels are hard but well designed. Every main level is never too hard and you can 100% the main story quite easily. But there are some hidden levels that you can unlock known as \"Cart Levels\". While these are not essential (praise the lord) they are considerably harder than anything else in the game. Harder than most levels even in Super Meat Boy. \n\nI say this not because they require precision or reflexes. They are insanely long and unforgiving. Some people like grinding through time consuming levels over and over again until they learn not to stuff up, but fundamentally this difficulty doesn't challenge anything other than trial and error, and memory. I do not find this fun at all. If you want all of the achievements (like me) you will have to complete 10 or more stage levels in one life. Each stage may not be that hard, but doing them perfectly every time can be very stressful and dull. If you are trying to practice one life over and over again, you will have to quit the cart and enter again, which wastes a lot of time. \nDefend it however you want, I call this poor design.\n\nProblem 2:\nPeople seem to have a hard time explaining the difficulty of this game, comparing it to super meat boy a lot. Relative to other platformers, this is not that close to SMB. The difficulty may vary from player to player. But there are two things everyone agrees with in the end. The cart levels are what make this game extremely difficult (and the final stage, but the final stage is optional and really kind of fitting), and the difficulty spikes really fast. I consider this an underrated problem because a lot of other platformers will either : A, slowly introduce you to more and more obstacles and interactions, or B, will introduce you to the whole world at once, allowing you to explore and come back at your own pace. \n\nThis game is neither. It is linear and branches at only two points ever. The difficulty is immediately above what i consider new players to be comfortable with. There is still a progression of difficulty  throughout the game, but it is so small it is negligible (until you reach the last few worlds where it spikes again). Being used to these kinds of games i had no problem with it, but I can easily imagine someone who starts this game with no experience at all. I'm willing to bet it wouldn't be so fun.\n\nTL:DR \nGame = Solid\nBonus levels (cart levels) = not fun/boring\nDifficulty progression = starts hard doesn't change for most of the game\n", "timestamp_created": 1502951311, "timestamp_updated": 1502951311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34281500": {"recommendationid": "34281500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157936319", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513537979}, "language": "english", "review": "Did someone say tumors?

The game doesn't feel slippery or out of control like Super Meat boy did, yet it wasn't stiff either.  I'm glad Edmund opted out of wall-jump mechanics because I'm glad he didn't make this a Super Meat Boy two. The difficulty isn't that bad. It's not super hard, but it does put up a challenge if you're looking for something more in the genre. Once again, I'm happy that this wasn't a level-based game like Super Meat Boy. Some part of me is just biased towards the feel of metroidvanias and open world platformers that levelled games like SMB could never give. Finally, the soundtrack is incredible. Ridiculon manages to reinvigorate complex classical pieces with the much needed raw  instruments of the rock genre, creating something bigger than the sum of its parts.

The game is brutal, with thousands of deaths on the first campaign alone. The game relies on collecting tumors, 450 tumors specifically. As always, don't buy this game if you're easily offended because Golgotha (The hill where Jesus was crucified) and S.S. Exodus (A ship full of Jews which the Nazis bombed). The game controls like near flawlessly, even in the Betas. The game works as your average platformers except for how you can't wall jump and instead use hooks and ledges to scale walls. \n\nThe bonus game carts start off easy enough (even though very few people play them) but quickly turn into hell on earth. Encountering Steven and collecting enough Tumors grants you the ability to attempt collecting an Iron cartridge. Iron cartridges are supposed to symbolize the 5 stages of grief (Helps that they're named after them) during the 4 stages of cancer (Due to tumors) and lastly, accepting death. Glitched carts are encountered in the second campaign and are better versions of normal carts. Acceptance is the final Iron cart but you'll spend days trying to beat it as it has the other four Iron carts and THEN 10 new ones.\n\nThe story is simple, your only source of entertainment just broke, now its time to venture into the apocalypse and make a friend. Sounds simple but finding a Heart, Head, and body will lead to thousands of deaths. \n\nI do have some problems with the game though. Acceptance is a bland way to end the Iron saga. The Future stage to collect Depression is bad. The birds are just a tad bit too fast. The machine was boring. The game doesn't even tell you that you get bonuses for not dying at all in a cartridge!\n\nOverall I wouldn't say this game isn't perfect but I'd say this is a 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1502309183, "timestamp_updated": 1502815665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34131646": {"recommendationid": "34131646", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978131107", "num_games_owned": 1364, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502412334}, "language": "english", "review": "Ed, Isaac is good and End is Nigh is decent, but I'd really love it if you could pretty please kiss and make up with Tommy \"reefer madness\" Refenes and just make a proper game?

I haven't played much of Super Meat Boy, but I don't think it's a fair comparison because despite them both being platformers that Edmund helped to create, they offer very different playstyles to the player. Super Meat boy is fast and requires a lot more reflex than The End Is Nigh. Ash is less slippery than Meat Boy and doesn't have the wall jump. The few things that this game does have in common with Edmund's other platformer are Edmund's art style, high difficulty, Good controls, and a rocking soundtrack.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThis game takes place after an unexplained apocalypse that destroyed the world leaving only most of Ash and a few other survivors alive. Ash is first seen playing a game cartridge before it breaks which causes him to start screaming \"F\u2665CK\" until he calms down. He decides that now is the time to go and \"Make a friend\" which involves gathering three parts and putting them together. In order to get those parts Ash has to leave his home and go out and explore the world.\n\n[spoiler] Ash puts his friend together and has a great time with it. The semi-sentient corpse is implied to have drugged Ash and started a second apocalypse while Ash was asleep. When he wakes up, he has to confront his friend about this betrayal. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] When Ash finally arrives deep within the Earth he finds his friend attached to a giant glowing orb. He decides that it's time for them to split ways and then has to escape from the orb before it ends the world a third time. Unfortunately for Ash, even if he does manage to escape he is consumed by the explosion and is killed. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \n\n[b] Platforming [/b]\nAsh controls really well and feels nice to move around. At no point in this game did I ever feel like I didn't have full control of Ash's movement ([spoiler]not even during those last few stages in Ruin that had gravity pulling ash to the left[/spoiler]). Even in the water and in the air you can move Ash left and right or use the trigger to force him to fall faster. The control being good is important because in this game you are going to die [i] a lot [/i]. Most of the time your goal is just simply to get to the other side of the stage without dying. You could also go after tumors but even then the goal is still to get them and then leave the stage. The kind of obstacles that Ash will face are spikes, lava, projectiles, and enemies. All of these of course kill Ash on contact. Dying just places you back where you entered the level and the levels in this game aren't very long so you only lose a few seconds of progress every time you die which encourages you to try again and again until you can finish it. Sometimes you will have to look before you leap and take a moment to think about how you're going to go through the stage before you start running in because you don't want to be stuck avoiding projectiles while you think of the next place you have to jump to. It feels very methodical because there are lots of times where you can only barely make a jump and you have to know [i] how [/i] to pull it off before you actually pull it off. \n\n[b] Tumors [/b]\nTumors are the collectable of this game. There is one in just about every level in every world with a total of 450 collectable tumors. Tumors are usually placed in spots that are harder to get to and add a bit of an extra challenge to the stage if you decide to bother collecting them. Collecting a tumor doesn't add it to your total tumor count right away since it requires that you exit the stage without dying or have to get the tumor again. It's not until about 3/4s into the game that tumors actually benefit you in anyway. Once [spoiler] your friend betrays you [/spoiler] tumors will function as a life count and you will lose one life every time you die which will result in a game over that sends you back to the beginning of the world you lost your last life in. They are replenished as soon as you exit the worlds where this is active or when you use a warp point. If you collect a certain number of tumors you can find \"Steven\"s scattered throughout the game that allow you to see the future. There are four future levels and each one of them offers a special game cartridge when you finish it.\n\n[b] Cartridges [/b]\nThere is one hidden in every world. You can play these on Ash's TV and they're pretty much more of the main game but in low-bit and with challenges like collect all of the coins or complete it without using a continue. They offer bonus tumors if you finish them and you can get up to an additional 52 tumors which will push your save file completion over 100% if you already have the 450 tumors that are in the worlds.\n\n[b] World Design [/b]\nJust as the steam tags imply this is an adventure platformer which means that there will be to at least some degree some exploration and platforming. Worlds are seperated into 16-20 \"levels\" with a warp point at the start of each world allowing you to travel to any previously visited warp points. I call them levels but each level is connected to the last and in some worlds you can skip some levels or you might have to come back to a level but from a different entry point in order to reach someplace that you couldn't get to before. The worlds themselves are also conncted to each other and will eventually come to a split where you can branch off into three different world pathways. This is in my opinion the biggest factor that seperates The End Is Nigh from Super Meat Boy- the open world. Each world contains secret areas with mega tumors that are worth five tumors each and cartridges. You can usually find secret areas by looking for a falling block, a lone ledge stub, fake walls, or a seemingly bottomless pit that doesn't seem like it belongs there. Most worlds also have locked doors which you require you to get a key from somewhere else and then return to that world once you have a spare key. Besides gathering collectables the secret areas also allow you to interact with more NPCs which can offer funny dialogue or a small bit of insight into the world. \n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\nThe whole soundtrack is rock covers of classical music.

Like all of Edmunds games, it is blisteringly hard, but for the most part fair.  There are a few design choices I found questionable.  For example the Iron Cart Retro Levels (Denial, Anger, etc.) are a bit too unforgiving in their lack of lives.  And the obstacles in the bonus levels where you obtain those carts can be difficult to tell from the floor itself in some places.  And if you go for collecting everything, some of the jumps and manuevers you are expected to pull off can be downright infuriating, to the point where you don't feel any achievement in suceeding in those parts, just the hollowness that follows rage.  Still, those instances are few and far between, and the game more than makes up for it in atmosphere and music (seriously the music is amazing).\n\nOne final note: this is NOT Super Meat Boy 2.  While it shares some aspects, the core philosophy is entirely different.  SMB for the most part emphasized flying around the level, pulling off acrobatic stunts in order to obtain the fastest time.

Sure that sounds like a deal breaker but honestly for how hard it'll be to get the true ending anyway you probably will be happy enough getting the normal 1 first.\n\nI consider myself decent at platformers, despite my 12.7 hours (so far) I have died roughly 4K times and counting every time I boot it up. Will be nice to go for the under 200 deaths as I feel I have a good grasp of everything now and believe me there is plenty to keep you occupied if you wish.\n\nOverall this game is a bargain and having paid full price I don't have any regrets, sitting at 20 ish achievements and tons left to do I feel this was worth the price I paid.

I somewhat agree. It definitely has a similar aesthetic and certain elements are reminiscient of SMB. It's closer to Super Meat Boy than Edmund's other games, with its precision jumps and retro stages, certain obstacles and collectibles. It will certainly keep you busy for a few days, and far longer if you aim for some of the more ridiculous challenges or achievement hunting.\n\nSitting at 99% completion on my main save file, I think it goes without saying I've enjoyed the game quite a bit. I like the level design and hunting down secrets. I've both adored and loathed the retro stages and I don't think I can leave this game unfinished, even if some of the iron man challenges are sure to give me a hard time.\n\nWhile I recommend this game to any fans of SMB and difficult platformers, I think it's best to get some of the negative aspects out of the way early on. \n\nThe gameplay is quite self-explanatory. You jump, grab ledges and wall hooks and make your way from one screen to the next. While the controls are tight, grabbing some of the ledges feels like pixel hunting. If you miss, you hit a spike. Since most every jump has been \"optimized\" in a way that you can reach areas without too much hassle, this feels either like an oversight or artificially inflated difficulty.\n\nMost screens have tumors as collectibles, and some of them make you go an extra mile before finishing the level. However, some of them are locked out of your reach if you enter the next screen, forcing you to replay several levels again. Once again, this falls under artificial gameplay inflation. And while on the topic of collectibles, if you grab one and exit the screen, you've obtained it. This means you can pick up a tumor, backtrack to the previous screen and THEN beat the stage. This makes some of the levels slightly more tolerable, but I find it slightly off-putting.\n\nThat's the bad out of the way. A lot of people have posted complaints about certain enemies being unpredictable (see: Thistle Fish) and therefore unfair, but that's simply not true. As far as I'm aware, there's a pattern to everything and if you haven't figured it out, that's on you. That doesn't mean some enemies and areas aren't relentlessly difficult, but they all have a discernible attack pattern. Well, maybe aside from the birds.\n\nJust about everything else about this game I like. The controls are tight, there's no vsync delay, the soundtrack is a well-rendered heavy metal/8-bit mixture of classical pieces, the graphics look nice (and remind me of SMB on several occasions). Most rooms are enjoyable to play and hunting down secrets is mostly fun. The few abilities (such as dashing downwards) you have from the start are revealed as the game progresses, which means you'll probably miss out on something your first time through, but on subsequent playthroughs you know immediately how to utilize them. This is unlike metroidvania games where you hunt down abilities first and then return to previous areas. Personally I think it was a refreshing touch.\n\nI suppose difficulty needs to be discussed. At frst I thought The End was more difficult than SMB. Having beaten the core game (and then some) I'm not too sure about that anymore. Some areas are relentless. Certain retro carts are a bastard and a half. And some secrets took me way more tries than I'd like to admit. But not once did I find myself wanting to throw my controller at a wall. Therefore I wouldn't call this an unreasonable difficult \"masocore\" game. But unless you're well-versed in platformers and like more difficult than average games, this might not be the game for you.\n\nMy 5 cents above are written at 29 hours of gameplay and a 99% savefile. Whether this game stands the test of time remains to be seen, but at any rate, it's definitely kept me entertained so far and I'm looking forward to beating it again.", "timestamp_created": 1501320239, "timestamp_updated": 1501320239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737355", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33876514": {"recommendationid": "33876514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313351422", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507584485}, "language": "english", "review": "So, here we are. Super Meat Boy 2! Oh wait...nevermind. It is in no way a sequel to Meat Boy nor related to it in any way. But, that is one of the reasons why i like this game.\nOn a graphical standpoint, levels have a simple but pretty interesting design, as well as detail.\nControls are pretty light and straightforward. However, the difficulty progression in the game seems to know no boundaries. By the time you reach The Future set of levels, everything changes. Difficulty basically jumps up a bunch and it keeps on getting harder, especially in secret areas. If you're somewhat familiar with game's mechanics - you more than likely won't end up looking at Game Over screen, since for some reason, your lives will have a limit from then on. Same applies to cart games. At least though, you can afford to take your time, which i appreciate.\nAs for the story, let's just say that a game such as this doesn't really need one, but it has its moments nevertheless.

The difficulty in this game steadily ramps up throughout its many areas, past the point I thought it would stop. The mini collectables found in most levels are a fun challenge that rewards perceptive players. The larger collectables hidden behind secret walls or difficult platforming, are even more satisfying. The game's 1st half is hard, but accessible enough for most players to work their way through, though the 2nd half is brutal, challenging all players who dare proceed. If you succeed and beat the game, another \"ending\" area is available that is even more challenging. Finally, there are the game cartridges unlocked as collectables that comprise the \"end game\" of The End Is Nigh. Each chapter in the game contains a game cartridge that is much more difficult, and there are some other cartridges that, while slightly bullshit, are also challenges worth facing.\n\nAll in all this game ended up interesting me much more than I would've thought possible and I don't plan on quitting until I've done all there is.

The game had its fun, rewarding levels here and there, but it was brought down by being too fast to react to anything, too slippery in the air for reliable jumps, and too full of hard-to-manage enemies and obstacles which made many levels feel more like luck than a test of skill.  A few of the boss fights relied solely on memorization, some challenges were excessively long with no checkpoints, the jump button didn't even always register, and I could spend half an hour getting a successful run of a stage and still not have done it fast enough for an A+ rank, which destroyed any interest I had in 100%ing the game.\n\nThe End is Nigh fixes every issue I had with Super Meat Boy.\n\nThis game has a moderately more relaxed pace, with far tighter, less variable movement.  The jump button is responsive every time and feels exactly the way it should.  There are no timers, and hanging on ledges is a suitable replacement for wall-jumping because it allows you to sit still and analyze the area methodically.  And you start out with your full moveset, but you learn how in-depth it is throughout the game.\n\nEvery screen is a checkpoint, and depending on how you enter an area, you'll have a different respawn point, making certain collectables more convenient and fair to obtain while still posing a challenge.  Most (but certainly not all) of this game's difficulty comes from the optional parts, which I consider to be very good design.\n\nThis game has no boss fights; it doesn't need any, because the environment is harsh enough.  What it does have are some tricky enemies to avoid (or use to your advantage), which are not always easy to deal with, but their patterns are reliable enough to manage.  The mechanics in this game also never seem to fall into the wretchedly physics-oriented hive that Super Meat Boy's air currents or repelling magnets did.\n\nOn top of all that, I'd even say TEiN has the better artwork, music, story, and characters.\n\nThe backgrounds are often monochromatic, fairly saturated cityscapes or skies against the silhouetted terrain our charming protagonist Ash explores.  Everything is slick and smooth, as opposed to strangely polygonal like much of Meat Boy's art.  There is more depth to be found in Ash's simple post-apocalyptic tale of woe and the odd little messages from the dead than there is in rescuing Bandage Girl from a fetus in a jar.  The music is comprised almost entirely of hardcore rock covers of famous classical music, which is frankly just a recipe for success.  It's the kind of soundtrack I want to listen to while I'm working to increase my productivity.\n\nSo far, I've completed 80% of the game and intend to see it through to the end.  It might not be as nigh as it seems.\n\nNow, I've seen others say this game has no soul, and that it's somehow lazy.  But even in its world of skulls and corpses, there's a heartbeat.

The controller input is just as tight; however, the wall grab mechanic has been replaced by a corner grab.  The music, in my opinion, is very appropriate and defintely cool, as was Meat. The story is just as dark as Meat.\n\nThe one main con I had throughout the game was there were no main level bosses. That could have been really cool with the mechanics and level design at play.

If you like difficult platforming, [i]The End is Nigh[/i] will definitely give you that fix.\n\nFor more info watch the video above or read the whole review at: [url=https://vinrafel.blogspot.com/2017/\u2026/review-end-is-nigh.html]Vinrafel[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1500995693, "timestamp_updated": 1500995693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33786587": {"recommendationid": "33786587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042289129", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503592579}, "language": "english", "review": "45% Complete.\n2341 Deaths.", "timestamp_created": 1500989133, "timestamp_updated": 1500989133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33784121": {"recommendationid": "33784121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117555645", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509126939}, "language": "german", "review": "Was soll man sagen?\n\nFangen wir vielleicht erstmal damit an:\nNein, es ist kein Super Meatboy Nachfolger! Die einzigen \u00c4hnlichkeiten die das Spiel mit Super Meatboy hat sind der Artstyle, dass es ein 2D-Plattformer und extrem schwer ist. Mehr aber auch nicht. Wer sich hier also einen richtigen Nachfolger von Super Meatboy gew\u00fcnscht hat, der ist bei diesem Spiel leider falsch.\n\nDas hei\u00dft aber nicht, dass es schlecht ist! Ganz im gegenteil! \n\nDoch welche Unterschiede gibt es zu Super Meatboy?\nErstmal kann man weder sprinten noch richtig anj W\u00e4nden springen. Das geht n\u00e4mlich nur an Ecken und Haken. Das sprinten ist aber auch tats\u00e4chlich unn\u00f6tig, da man auch so schnell genug ist. Und seid mal ehrlich:\nHabt ihr jemals in Super Meatboy den Finger von dem rechtem Trigger genommen?\nDas mit den Wall Jumps ist tats\u00e4chlich gar nicht so schlimm und man gew\u00f6hnt sich ziemlich schnell dran, dass es keine gibt.\n\nAber kommen wir mal zu den Levels:\nSie sind alle sch\u00f6n kurz, so wie es in Super Meatboy, abgesehen von den Bosslevels, von denen es in The End is Nigh bis jetzt \u00fcbrigens bei mir noch keine gab, auch war. Sie sind allerdings allen nicht wirklich schwer. Die Schwierigkeit liegt n\u00e4mlich nicht direkt am Level, sondern wie man das Level l\u00f6st und gleichzeitig den Tumor (Tumore sind in diesem Spiel die Sammelobjekte, von denen es in so gut wie jedem Level einen gibt) einsammelt. Die Tumore direkt beim ersten Versuch das Level zu schaffen ist \u00fcbrigens nur zu empfehlen, da man die einzelnen Level sp\u00e4ter nicht wieder einzeln ausw\u00e4hlen kann, sonder direkt alle vorherigen Level erneut spielen muss. Es gibt n\u00e4mlich KEINE Level auswahl. Man kann sich nur zu den einzelnen Welten teleportieren. Das ist allerdings gar nicht schlimm, da die Level alle recht schaffbar sind, wenn man den Tumor schon hat.\n\nIch muss sagen, das Spiel ist super und f\u00fcr jeden, der Super Meatboy gespielt hat und nichts gegen diese \"\u00c4nderungen\" hat, ein Muss! Ich pers\u00f6nlich muss jedoch sagen, dass ich es eher gelegentlich spiele und nicht mit einem Mal durch. \u00c4ndert jedoch nichts an der Tatsache, dass das Spiel ein echt guter 2D-Plattformer ist! :)", "timestamp_created": 1500980163, "timestamp_updated": 1500980163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33783705": {"recommendationid": "33783705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097408886", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500782238}, "language": "english", "review": "Good successor to Super Meat Boy", "timestamp_created": 1500978422, "timestamp_updated": 1500978422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33775738": {"recommendationid": "33775738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383548615", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504395815}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "MUITO BOM", "timestamp_created": 1500939266, "timestamp_updated": 1500939266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33775252": {"recommendationid": "33775252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054307711", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500936256}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es como descubrir que eres sadomasoquista, siempre te apetece un poquito mas pero luego crees que deberias parar por tu salud e integridad mental.", "timestamp_created": 1500936662, "timestamp_updated": 1500936662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33774375": {"recommendationid": "33774375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062308726", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503886431}, "language": "english", "review": "You die a lot.

The comparisons to meat boy are inevitable so I'll address the elephant in the room.\n\n-This game's overall look is similar to that of meat boy's, but it's more polished.\n-Some of the enemies and hazards return in the form of something else.\n-The dark world and warp zones return to some extent.\n-The difficulty is up to par with meat boy\nHowever, this game is by no means a sequel to super meat boy, and that's not what we should expect going into it imo.\n\n[h1] Pros : [/h1]\n\n-Ash's controls are tight, fast, and responsive.\n-The areas are detailed and do a good job setting in the atmosphere.\n-The soundtrack is fantastic, and definitely adds to the environment.\n-Almost all collectibles are obtainable from the get go, which lessens the pain of backtracking.\n-The level design is great\n-This game favors exploration and keeping your eyes peeled for secrets, the room-to-room style of progression from most of ed's games is removed in favor of a gauntlet of levels.\n-This game can challenge people of pretty much any skill level, the difficulty can surpass meat boy at times.\n-this game does a good job of teaching you how it works.\n-despite an extreme amount of deaths, (I have 6000+ after beating the full main game, not including nevermore).

Pensaba que iba a ser como un Super Meat Boy (SMB) 2, pero es bastante diferente la jugabilidad. Un ejemplo claro es la dificultad: En SMB la dificultad sube poco a poco, pero en The End is Nigh se produce un corte entre lo f\u00e1cil y dif\u00edcil cuando pasas \"The Past\" y vas a \"The Future\". Otra cosa que me agrada mucho es que haya un coleccionable por sala y las salas secretas. Lo \u00fanico que no me gust\u00f3 del juego fue:\n-Que en algunas salas secretas, cuando te caes, como est\u00e1s encima de otra sala, en vez morir caes a otra sala como pasa con el primer secreto de \"The Machine\" que si te caes vuelves a \"Retrogade\".\n-En s\u00ed mismo el nivel \"The Machine\", es MUUUUUUUUUUY molesto ya que es un laberinto insoportable con salas muy molestas y tediosas.\n- (ALERTA DE SPOILER )Esto ya es cosa m\u00eda, pero seguro a alguien m\u00e1s le pas\u00f3... En \"Acceptance\" cuando te queda poco tiempo (1 minuto, 40 segundos exactamente), la pantalla empieza a vibrar de una manera exagerada y el  destello blanco de la bola gigante de energ\u00eda se intensifica y molesta demasiado.

Isso significa que mesmo os amantes mais experientes da plataforma t\u00eam muito trabalho pela frente, caso desejem chegar ao final do jogo e ver tudo o que The End is Nigh reserva. E para os que n\u00e3o possuem reflexos de plataforma t\u00e3o agu\u00e7ados, como a M\u00e3e, podem esperar dezenas de horas at\u00e9 conseguir chegar ao primeiro final.\n\n(...)\n\nPara al\u00e9m da jogabilidade, The End is Nigh \u00e9 um dos jogos mais bonitos lan\u00e7ados nos \u00faltimos meses. N\u00e3o porque possua gr\u00e1ficos brilhantes e reluzentes, mas porque todas suas caracter\u00edsticas est\u00e9ticas trabalham em harmonia para construir o panorama pretendido. O tra\u00e7o simples dos desenhos n\u00e3o atrapalha em nada na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de cen\u00e1rios variados, todos que demonstram o desespero de um mundo que chegou ao seu fim.

If you do not like challenging games, don't get The End is Nigh, even if you do maybe watch a couple videos and see what you think. In my case, I bought it almost as soon as it came out without even remembering the game was being released. A freind and I played it for about four hours straight that night taking turns and trying our best to figure out the mechanics, and I have to say in my case I felt it was totally worth the price point, yes its challenging but if you push through the frustration and stress it can be very rewarding depending on who you are.\n\nI will emphicize again that this game is not for those who want something easy, but then again most of Edmund's games don't necissarily fit the description of 'easy'. If you loved Super Meat Boy like I did when it came out, you will most likely enjoy this game, its not too similar to feel like a sequel but instead has its own ideas of challenging the player in a way that makes them want to do everything better. Everything from the mechanics to the soundtrack made me feel motivated to become better at the game's mechanics and intracacies, as simple as they may be.\n\nFor $15 I was expecting something I could master in 10 hours or so, but instead I got a game that I feel like I could play for a hundred hours and still feel like I could improve on certain things, and to me that makes this game one of the best platformers I've played in a very long time.\n\nOn a side note, I find this game much easier to play with a controller, I played through almost half of it without but as soon as I tried playing with a gamepad I can't even imagine playing it with a keyboard. That might just be me though, I know a lot of people prefer keyboard for games like this but I'm not one of them, jumping at specific angles is just much easier for me with a joystick.", "timestamp_created": 1500699804, "timestamp_updated": 1500699804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33712512": {"recommendationid": "33712512", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970094946", "num_games_owned": 1353, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500551676}, "language": "english", "review": "A diabolically difficult platformer with tight controls, The End is Nigh is a worthy spiritual successor to Super Meat Boy.

[/u]\n\n\nI played a LOT of Super Meat Boy (even if my Steam hours don't show that) and I absolutely [b] love [/b] platformer games!\n\nSMB was probably the game that got me really into them, whereas sure I'd gotten experience in a lot of the games from my childhood, Super Meat Boy really tested my skills and it showed my fingers & tendons what a game could ask of them!\n\nThis game though.... [i] damn. [/i]\nControls feels tremendously tight, even more so than Super Meat Boy and any of the other few platformers I know of with tight & responsive controls. The music- as always in Edmund's games, is brilliant. But what really gets me is how amazingly the levels I've come across so far are designed!\n\nSo as most other reviews have probably mentioned (and if not the one YouTube video I watched before buying this mentioned it) - This game has no loading screens between levels. All the levels you come across you can walk in and out of with ease. Now while this may not seem like a huge deal on it's own... With level design like this game has (which I assure you is bloody fantastic, just likely designed by the devil himself) it means there's an incredible amount of secrets that take advantage of this mechanic, and the game overall just feels a whole lot more connected within itself. With SMB you are taken out of the level when you finish it and you're plonked on the next level in the map select screen, and whilst I've nothing against that; after playing The End Is Nigh for a little over an hour and a half it's obvious to me how much I prefer it personally.\n\n[u] Quick recap / TL;DR: [/u]\n[list]\n[*]Amazingly responsive and tight controls (oh and I forgot to mention the spikes' hitboxes too, they're spot-on)\n[*]Great soundtrack.\n[*]No in & out gameplay with lots of loading screens.\n[*]Tough as NAILS platforming- there are some [b] EVIL [/b] level designs (especially to get collectables)\n[*]A [i] lot [/i] of secrets. Trust me. Also there's over 30 hidden achievements..\n[*]Lovely graphics style, if you liked Super Meat Boy / The Binding of Isaac / The Basement Collection for their style it's the same guy, you're in luck :)\n[/list]\n\nSo hey, overall my first impressions of this have been fantastic. And having a quick peak at the achievements has made me eager to try to catch them all.. But something tells me it's going to be a long and painful journey... \n\n...But still fun! I swear! I enjoy it..

It's not horrible, it's just not as good.\n\nFirst, the game just looks flat. McMillen's games always looked a bit simplistic but Super Meat Boy definitely had a wow-effect. The End is Nigh doesn't. It's just a monotonous gray&black palette and not a single spark of fun in the image. Remember how expressive and fun SMB or The Binding of Isaac look; that's what you won't find here.\n\nIt controls similarly to SMB but it's slower, and while SMB had an extremely fun core mechanic of sliding meat-physics, TEIN offers you... well, hanging on ledges. It even sounds boring. In addition to that there's also water, and water controls just feel clunky and off-putting.\n\nIn addition to that the game is just easy unless you're collecting tumors. Tumors are collectables, but not like patches in SMB, which were rare and exceedingly hard to get. Here tumors are on every screen (and every screen is basically a level) and unless you decide to get them you miss the whole point of the game. So basically instead of being a really hard game it forces you to go for additional objective so that you make it a hard game.\n\nAnd worst of all, TEIN commits a sin of being monotonous. Where in SMB each level was a sort of a chess party at a million miles per hour, TEIN feels like you're just moving from a small puzzle to a small puzzle. And it many ways it is true because each level is now 1 screen, and most of them are the same size.\n\nThe only great thing about it is music. But it's not enough for me to not refund it.

With that being said, I'm sure if you love platformers, this game will be really fun to you. \n\n7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1500623777, "timestamp_updated": 1500623777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33689806": {"recommendationid": "33689806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285075314", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511744151}, "language": "english", "review": "The End id Nigh is a great game with fun humor and extreme difficulty to all.

It can still can be played very quickly, and often the fastest path is the most efficient way to progress. \n\nEach world consists of 20 or so screens that serve as individual challenges (with many secrets), and if you die you will instantly respawn wherever you came in from. The difficulty curve is well paced, but this game gets very difficult in its second act, so it may not be for everyone. I'm currently at 98% and I'll probably leave it at that, however there are many hidden challenges/achievements that I can still attempt to do, if I feel up to the intense trials. \n\nThe soundtrack was created by Ridiculon (who composed the OST to BOI: Rebirth), and it consists of short remixes of classical pieces that range from \"Flight of the Bumblebee\", \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\". The soundtrack's repetition in each area will either drive you mad as you fail to make that one jump, or you may find yourself in tune with the game itself, pushing yourself forward just to hear the next song. I was in the latter camp, and I never found the music annoying enough to turn off, even after my hours of failed attempts in the later worlds.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with it; it never felt unfair and I never felt too frustrated outside of the cartridges, but I'm probably more patient/skilled than the average player. I may come back and try to beat the 4 cartridges I have left, but I'm satisfied with it at this point.

It's absolutely a blast to play, and it controls fantastically.  The only people I've heard complain about controls are people who play with the joystick ... don't do that ... it's a 2D platformers, use the d-pad ... that's what it's there for!\n\nThe music is a lot of fun, and the visuals are engaging, ranging from cutesy-macabre to hauntingly beautiful.  The levels are all deliberately made and offer appropriate challenge, and rewarding feelings for completing them.  And there are a LOT of them.  \n\nI think were the game falls flat is first, and least importantly, the writing.  The little blurbs the NPC's say are trite and cringingly \"edgey\" as if it's a collection of the worst quotes from a 15 year old on /r/atheism.  But I can get over that, since we all know Edmund has a hard-on for hating on/mocking Christianity.  But I think this goes hand-in-hand with my biggest complaint ... the game feels like it's got no heart.  At least in games like Super Meat Boy or 1001 Spikes it felt like there was a heart, or a certain joyfullness to them.  The End is Nigh is fun to play and I plan to chip away at it for as long as it takes to complete, but I don't look back on it with joy, and I don't anticipate playing it later the same way I do Super Meat Boy.  Games like Super Meat Boy and 1001 Spikes would always be in the back of my mind at work or whatever, when I was in the middle of them, but not so much The End is Nigh.  It just feels like a time-filler, kind of like a mobile game, in that I'll pick it up and play for an hour, then maybe forget about it for a few days and do it again.  \n\nDespite that it's a solid game, and definitely one for any platforming-junky.  I truly do like it, I just think it's missing a little something to send it over the edge and into greatness.

Come una matriosca, al suo interno si annidano molteplici significati e allusioni che restituiscono all\u2019ultima opera di Edmund McMillen e Tyler Glaiel uno spirito indubitabilmente moderno. Dai complessi industriali che esalano nubi tossiche fino ad arrivare alle spettrali rovine di un futuro pieno di sofferenza e dolore, The End Is Nigh comunica un profondo messaggio di critica sociale. Come se non bastasse il piccolo indie fa suo un gusto retro tipico delle melodie chiptune, mentre recupera il canone ludico di Super Meat Boy, espandendolo grazie ad una struttura che supera quella \u201ca stage\u201d del suo ideale predecessore, per farsi mondo continuo e interconnesso (alla Metroidvania). Se avete amato la poliedricit\u00e0 dei lavori di McMillen, non potete assolutamente perdervi questo titolo.\n\nTrovate la recensione completa su Everyeye.it: http://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-end-is-nigh-del-nuovo-gioco-edmund-mcmillen-34259.html", "timestamp_created": 1500482636, "timestamp_updated": 1500482636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33652390": {"recommendationid": "33652390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037349732", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500465172}, "language": "english", "review": "Clunky controls (sticking to walls sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't - especially with moving platforms), platforming gameplay consisting of dodging crap flying at you from all sides or jumping on the crumbling/sinking structures (which is just annoying), acceptable graphics and music - all of that creates a game that... I don't want to play anymore :P It feels like underdeveloped Super Meat Boy (one of the best platformers ever imo)\n\nBottom line - this game cured me from preordering games. I trusted Edmund McMillen, he served me rushed, underdeveloped junk.

In all of my time with the game I have never felt like the controls were the cause of any of my (over 8000) deaths. I have been using keyboard.\n\nMusic and sound effects:\nThe soundtrack is a host of remade classical pieces and as expected of Ridiculon, it is great. The sounds are also mostly very good, though some seem a bit too loud and others get annoying after a while.\n\nVisuals:\nLooks pretty good for a 2D platformer.\n\nStory:\nThe story is obviously not the focus of the game. It's rather simple but it's not boring.\n\nGameplay:\nNow for the big one.\nThe game is not easy. At times it is brutally difficult. However, the game is still a lot of fun and most of the time, the difficulty is fair. The main levels are generally not too frustrating. There are many little collectibles and secrets, a great amount of achievements and the number of levels the game has to offer is amazing. Beating hard challenges is satisfying and there are some optional insanely difficult ones for the hardcore players.\n\nThe game does have some flaws though:\n1. It makes you replay levels multiple times if you want to collect all the collectibles. Some people may dislike this. (I personally have no problem with it)\n2. A few levels contain obstacles that are unpredictable and unfair. This issue is only present in maybe about 1% of all levels though and it mostly doesn't have a high chance of killing you. But it sucks when it does.\n3. If you are bad at platformers or have a short temper, this game could be incredibly frustrating for you.\n\nBonus:\nThe End is Nigh is very easily moddable and there are already a bunch of cool mods that add extra levels (check out the official discord if you wanna play them). This gives the game quite a bit more longevity. I am modding it myself and I never expected to put so many hours into a singleplayer platformer.\n\nAll in all, the game is great and I wholeheartedly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500418940, "timestamp_updated": 1514395821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33639879": {"recommendationid": "33639879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040119240", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512155458}, "language": "english", "review": "Hard platformer from Edmund.\nPros:\n- Visuals are simple, yet stylish. Usual pallete for the level has like 4 colors and still looks complete.\n- Many short levels - also progress is saved if you exit the game.\n- Tumor placement is challenging but doable, if you're paintient enough. (got all myself, most at the first run)\n- Most levels seem to be optimized to be runnable quickly. I mean if you run just as you spawned - you are able to avoid most obstacles and race through the level.\n- Carthriges are fun alteration to the main game.\n- Awesome sound track, especially menu (glossience#1) and danse macabre,\n\nCons:\n- Controls are PRECISE. Sometimes too precise. You visually hit the hook, but don't grab it. Need an hour or to to get used to them.\n- Some secret levels are very difficult (the keyed ones for example) providing common rewards.\n- No way to go to specific level in zone. You have to run through whole zone to get to thal 13th level where is your last tumor.

I asked for a refund.\n \nThe game is way too easy. Even getting the tumors doesn't really represent much of a challenge. Having to go back to a level is annoying, though. Why can't you warp to a particular level once you completed a world? Why can you only warp to worlds? It makes no sense. The game saves every little progress you make but won't let you go to a specific level to retrieve a tumor you forgot? Frustration is not difficulty.

Love me some funnies.\n\nThere are more things i love about the game but i would start getting into spoiler territory so I'll just cut it off with a summary.\n\nIf ya like a good spankin' in the form of a hard platformer, look no further and good luck!", "timestamp_created": 1500398629, "timestamp_updated": 1500398629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33634101": {"recommendationid": "33634101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075587599", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502137121}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game. Extremely hard, and extremely challenging, but extremely fun. I actually don't get angry at all while playing this game, because each time I die I just see room for me to do it again. While I'm around 3.5k deaths already and am still early on the game, gotta say, it's a blast to play and a shit ton of fun.\n\nLooking for secrets is also very amusing, some of them are extremely well hidden, requiring you to backtrack in order to find the entrance to them.\n\nThe game pretty much forces you to die a bunch of times to learn and improve quickly, as each level is relatively small and easy to master (aside from a few special levels, which take a little more patience and skill to do). In other words: Stop Raging and Git Gud, the game.\n\nAs for how this game stands along other Edmund games, I'd say it's pretty equal. If you compare it to SMB, the game is almost a polar opposite of sorts, being more calculated, precise and time-taking, rather than a level where speed and skill is what matters most.\n\nThere are some really unfair levels for more unskilled players though. On a certain level, I probably died at least 1000 times in 2 screens. Granted I'm not amazing at platformers, it took me a while to be able to be able to do a small portion of it consistently, and a good while to finish said level.\n\nRegarding controls, I wish they were a little better for Mouse and Keyboard users. The game is very unforgiving to M&K, for the fact that it's hard to control your speed, since if you don't have a mechanical Keyboard you can't slightly tilt the key, and jumping turns into a bit of a nightmare, since this game has that one mechanic where the longer you hold the jump button, the farther you jump, which isn't necessarily easy to gauge when you're playing on a keyboard and pressing the jump key a lot. TL;DR, the game kind of has a big favoritism for controllers.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very fitting for the game. It just gives just the correct platformer vibe, taking the setting of the game in consideration.\n\nI definetely recommend this game, 100%.

Also theres no sprint button so you can actually play it with a keyboard which if you're like me was a huge dealbreaker in SMB.\n\nOverall this game is very good, easily my second favourite edmund game behind boi and ahead of smb. To go into what I like about it would take too long for a review so few people will probably read, but if you like either puzzle platformers or precision platformers this game is definitely for you. It also has phenomenal visual design and a killer soundtrack. I honestly cant think of any real criticisms I have aside from a few of the enemies being poorly designed mechanically (looking at you skullbirds) luckily the devs must have noticed this and restricted them each to a single area.

Enquanto [b]Super Meat Boy[/b] tem um gameplay bem r\u00e1pido, muito baseado em reflexo e em controle total do personagem, [b]The End Is Nigh[/b] tira um pouco dessa velocidade e traz um gameplay um pouco mais estrat\u00e9gico. \n\nVoc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem tem [i]walljump[/i] nem corrida, ao inv\u00e9s disso o personagem consegue se agarrar nas beiradas das plataformas e em \"ganchos\" espec\u00edficos.

E pra finalizar, aqui voc\u00ea tem ainda mais segredos (passagens secretas nas fases) e colet\u00e1veis, que tamb\u00e9m acabam sendo mais importantes mais pra frente do jogo, e n\u00e3o s\u00f3 pura satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal.\n\n[h1]O jogo \u00e9 dif\u00edcil mesmo?[/h1]\n\nMeu amigo, \u00e9 sim.

I spent a lot of time playing and completing everything in Super Meat Boy, so when I heard about a new platformer I got really excited, and I think a lot of people will be in the same situation.\n\nIt's important to understand that while they both are hardcore platformers, they are quite different. The End is Nigh is set in a semi-open world and each \"level\" is connected with another, compared to the \"world-by-world\" setup of Super Meat Boy. Sometimes you'll have to go back to another level to access a secret or another path, which make it really interesting.   \n\nAlso interesting that there isn't any bosses, which to me was both a pro and con. Meat Boy had some great bosses ideas, but most of them could be rendered trivial due to the limited options related to being a two-button platformer, so not having those kind of fights between worlds felt like a good idea to keep the rythme of the game.\n\nThe level-design is rich, and you never really get to grow tired of a specific mechanic as new ones are introduced regularly. Since you don't get any \"upgrade\", the level-design will dictate your possibilities, and I feel like you get a linear progression that is extremely rewarding.\n\nLots of different worlds will help with the basic story-telling of the game, but don't expect too much bare a couple cinematics and some hidden text. It's a gameplay-first kind of game. \nTalking about that, it's pleasing graphically and the animations are really fluid, which should be no surprise to those who played Super Meat Boy. They know how to make a platformer feel great.\n\nI personally finished the main-levels but still have a lot to discover, which again is kind of the trademark of McMillen's games. \nAll in all, get this game if you want a challenging but rewarding experience that feels good to play, and have the patience to accept thousands of deaths.

This game's leaps and bounds ahead of SMB, and I loved Meat Boy.\n\nThe fact that you run at a consistent speed is a positive and the fact that you cannot wall jump lets the levels be as creative with ledges and mechanics as possible.\n\nThis game is much more technical, mechanical, and pure as a platformer than Super Meat Boy which is simply a bad game compared to The End Is Nigh.\n\nPros\n- Simple yet complex, this game has fall control, ledge manipulation, multiple jump heights and 2+ ways to jump off ledges.\n- Certain levels like 'SS Exodus' feature objects with physics that are super fun to play around.\n- Secrets and collectibles that are way more satisfying and challenging than collecting stale bandages.\n- Non-linear open-world platforming which is far less boring than the stage-by-stage snoozefest that was Meat Boy.\n- Challenging learning curve and challenging \"retro\" levels that require practicing and learning to gain mastery of the level.\n- NPC's scattered around levels with interesting dialogue, behind a challenging way to reach some of them, of course.\n- Some of the most clever and challenging level design in a 2d game.\n- Many different enemy types to challenge you with their own strengths and weaknesses to learn and conquer.\n- Tyler Glaiel is the best programmer yet. Day one, this man was fixing bugs and patching the game, there's been almost 10 updates and this game has been out only for 4 days.\n- Edmund McMillen games are always extremely creative and interesting, lore-wise.\n- Best music in any Edmund McMillen game.\n\nCons\n- None I can think of at the moment...yeah, none.\n\nGet The End Is Nigh.

Im guessing each level is considered a screen so dont be fooled by the high amount of levels. That doesnt mean the game is short. I have 3 hours put into the game at the time of this review and Im about 30% through finding the maps to explore. So my guess is if you plan to 100% this game maybe about 15-20 hours. Which is good for the price. In the beginning it's pretty easy but once you reach the 30% mark of the game the difficulty ramps up as they introduce new game mechanics. The secrets always make you search each \"level\" tightly. The cartridge levels are hard and offer in game rewards which is nice. Tight controls, good music, different worlds, clever game design.

That's all that depends, because you will die a lot. Game offers a very nice and diversive level design - each of around 15 worlds have different traps, enemies and mechanics, like water, springs and gravity fields. On top of that, every collectibles fan will be very happy here, because you can find many secrets and bonus items on your way through the desolate world. However, it takes a lot of effort to collect all of them. The End is Nigh also has some flaws, like other games. For example, the different worlds consists mostly from 20 separate rooms/levels. If, by some chance, you left some collectible in the tenth level of this world, you can't just simply go to this level, collect it and then leave, because the warp points to each world are only at the beginning and the end, so collecting everything may become frustrating over the time. And one other thing I'd like to change, is make each world at least 10 levels longer, so all the traps and mechanics in the worlds, can be used in more ways and you can enjoy each of them a little bit longer, because most of them, are only one world exclusive. But I think this can be easily solved, by adding level editor and steam workshop in later updates. Overall great experience, good platformers like these are kinda rare these days, so if you are fan of this genre, don't wait for anything and buy this game.

While I am reviewing/considering Edmunds game dev history, [b]I am downvoting this game because I would not recommend it to friends[/b]. I tried a few times and I find it 'difficult for the sake of being difficult'. I think the levels are *simple* to get through, but brutally hard if you want to collect stuff. And the whole game is a collection game.\n\nI will likely be deleting all further comments because they are becoming abusive and toxic. My review is fairly glowing for a negative review. There is no more discussion to be had. If you don't find it useful, simply downvote and move on.\n\n---\n\n[b][i]The End is Nigh[/i] is a good game, but does not continue the legacy of innovation that we have come to expect from Edmund.[/b] It's like your favorite band's worst album; if your neighbor created it, you would be impressed - but not when it comes from those that push genres forward.\n\nYes, I'm comparing apples and oranges, but at some point we have to. McMillen games are in a league of their own.\n\n[b]Essentially, [i]The End is Nigh[/i] is a more 'puzzly' [i]Super Meat Boy[/i] set in a universe that reminds me of [i]World of Goo[/i].[/b] While some argue this title is different enough from [i]Super Meat Boy[/i], I feel they are missing the forest for the trees. What is important is that it is a 'hard-as-nails' platformer. Edmund already changed the platformer world with that mechanic. I don't really want him to revisit that same mechanic. I desperately want [i]innovation[/i] from Edmund - it's what he does best.\n\n[b]Of course I mean this all in the most flattering way possible.[/b] [i]The End is Nigh[/i] does have many superb aspects. I'll get into that at the end of the review.\n\nEdmund has historically made some really addicting and satisfying games. Creating a game with those traits is not easy, and is what a great majority of developers strive for. The formula has not been fully figured, and I think this is leading to some problems. Eddie knows that a game is very satisfying when you overcome something truly difficult - just play [i]Super Meat Boy[/i] to see what I mean. We know this. [i]Isaac[/i] gave us that satisfaction as we [i]learn[/i] the system enough to eventually be able to overcome and win. Great.\n\n[b]The problem is with the idea of difficulty.[/b] Contrary to what this game may try, you can't just keep ramping up the difficulty and expect to get a proportionally satisifying game. While experience will vary from player to player depending on skill, but eventually even the best get tired of repeating the same levels over and over [i]ad nauseum[/i].\n\nBecause I'm a huge Edmund fan, I'll definitely keep on grinding with [i]The End is Nigh[/i], but I doubt my recommendation will change. I also see the community lashing out at negative reviews with less than about 3 hours of playtime. The mechanics in this game don't change significantly over time. You have to look at things from the right scale. If you don't like frustratingly hard platforming, you certainly don't need to get 10 hours in to make a judgement call. Do you learn new nuances of the platforming mechanic over larger time? Absolutely. Does this ever change into something that is not a 'hard-as-nails' twitch platformer? Nope.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Beautiful artwork.\n+Music is nice. Ridiculon is hit or miss with me. I often wish Edmund could go back to Danny, but that isn't going to happen. This soundtrack is quite refreshing for this band, which is great.\n+Controls are super tight (what else would you expect!).\n+Tons of hours of quality gaming if you like super hard platformers.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Not innovative for Edmund. We love you bro, but you already changed the platforming world. Go rebuild another genre!\n-The color palettes are really neat, but too bland. Needs more color contrast to make things 'pop'.\n-Too difficult for my tastes. Again, as I discussed above, difficulty can be a vehicle for satisfaction - but there is an endpoint. Diminishing returns and all that.\n\n[b]This is a love letter to Edmund encouraging him to make riskier stuff.[/b] Your games change the world, but you gotta make new ones with new mechanics to push forward.\n\nPeace,", "timestamp_created": 1500143612, "timestamp_updated": 1500677474, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 200, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584971", "comment_count": "54", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33564795": {"recommendationid": "33564795", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975490238", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512336830}, "language": "english", "review": "To notch level design, it\u2019s one thing to work how to get the collectable its very much another to actually do it.

The story behind it, is gloriously macabre because the character you play as has nothing better to do since the apocalypse. You'll get a kick out of the cutscenes that play when you progress through the game because Ash is voiced by Rich Evans from Red Letter Media. The music is stellar thanks to Ridiculon, so no point in the game ever feels dull. The music matches the graphics, a grim world with our character going through a wide variety of settings and themes. All of the aesthetics of the game gets packed into this charming 2D HELL of a precision platformer.\n\nThe layout of the game is a open-world 2D platformer. The worlds interconnect, so there are many routes to take, nearly a hundred secrets and there's multiple endings. The game just won't stop coming at you just when you think you are done!\n\nThe worlds will challenge you, and you will die. The secrets in the worlds will challenge you further, and you will die more. The cartridges that can be found as secret collectibles you can play at home will definitely challenge you to your limit, you will never not die. 100%ing the entire game and getting all achievements is nearly impossible, but aiming to 100% a save file is doable. There's something that will get to you. One cartridge kept me from 100% for 6 hours. Doing that deathless is about double that practice.\n\nThe controls are smooth and tight at the same time. The mechanics can be quickly understood, but the true meat of the game lies with how advanced the movement can get. The option for speeding through the game dying as little as possible is on the table.\n\nI can't get enough of this game, if 2D platformers appeal to you at all, this is a must.

Every single piece of it is polished to a tee.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive. You are always in complete control and any mistake is your own. The jumps are smooth and the game quickly helps you understand how every jump feels. Even more responsive than Meat Boy, imo.\n\nThe visuals are fantastic. The platforms stand out well from the background, always making it clear where you have to go. The lines are smooth and the background design is lovely\n\nTHE MUSIC. I found Ridiculon's stuff in Isaac to be great, but nothing you would listen to out of the game. These tracks are straight up slamming and are definetely going onto my playlists.\n\nThe tumours and cartridges around the levels are a heap of fun to collect. They may takes hundreds of deaths sometimes. But that's OK, because the resets are quick and fluid, making sure you are right back into the action.\n\nUnlike Edmund's previous platformer, this game has a more fluid level progress, allowing you to just breeze through all the gameplay, with no menuing to break up the action. The map design of this game also allows for little secret areas, which allow you to get more cartridges and tumours\n\nIf I had to have a gripe with this game, it would have to be how much info it gives on the controls.

It's also not a Metroidvania, even if it sometimes seems like it wants to be one.\n\nAt its core, The End Is Nigh is a twitch platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy. In most levels, it's not too hard to figure out what you need to do in order to survive. The challenge is pressing and releasing the right controls with a split-second margin of error. Since I have the reflexes of a dying walrus, I was disappointed this isn't more of a puzzle platformer like Closure, but I appreciate that it doesn't try to trick you--if you can scout out a logical path through the level and are dextrous enough to execute it, you generally won't find yourself trapped or die in unfair ways.\n\nAdditional collectibles and story information can be found by searching out secret routes to hidden areas. This is where more puzzle aspects come into play, with some clever hiding places that rely on a precise understanding of the game's mechanics. However, this isn't really an \"open-world\" game, and most side paths will eventually return you to the linear progression of main levels. The limited amount of warp points also makes it something of a chore to go back for collectibles you missed the first time through the level.\n\nAt my current point in the game, I can't evaluate the story, but I find it striking that almost all of it so far is in hidden areas. Players who explore will get a very different impression of what's going on than players who stick to the main path. It reminds me of An Untitled Story, a Metroidvania with a similarly obscure approach to its world and characters.\n\nI'm tempted to say that The End Is Nigh isn't really my thing, but the fact that I'm still playing it means it's at least a good game.

Les tableaux sont plus court qu'un Super meat boy. Ici, quelques sauts suffisent pour en venir \u00e0 bout. Ash, le personnage \u00e9trange que vous dirigez n'est pas l'\u00e9gal de meat boy. Il est plus lourd \u00e0 diriger, prend plus de places et ne peut pas sauter de mur en mur comme le faisait son grand fr\u00e8re viandeu. Sa principale capacit\u00e9 est de s'accroch\u00e9 \u00e0 des rebords ou \u00e0 des crochets, ce qui vous obligera \u00e0 bien \u00e9valuer les distances et \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis dans vos sauts. Selon les mondes, les obstacles, et \u00e9nnemies varieront et feront evoluer le gameplay. Par exemple, la possibilit\u00e9 d'aller sous l'eau et de plonger ou de remonter \u00e0 toute vitesse. Ou encore la pr\u00e9sence de nuages toxiques vous tuant en quelques secondes, vous obligeant \u00e0 chercher des poches d'air tout en esquivant des pi\u00e8ges tordus. Des trouvailles comme \u00e7a, il y en a plein, et m\u00eame si je suis bien avanc\u00e9 dans le jeu, je sais que je n'en ai pas encore fait le tour.\n\nParlons un peu de la difficult\u00e9 du jeu. Elle est comme d'habitude, assez \u00e9lev\u00e9, tout en vous offrant des choix. En effet, vous pouvez aller du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin d'un niveau en ligne droite en prenant le moins de risque possible, ou bien vous pouvez au passage collecter les \"tumeurs\", objets vous permettant d'avoir acc\u00e9s \u00e0 des niveaux secrets et de plus de vies dans les niveaux les plus dur du jeu. A vous de choisir, si vous voulez traverser le jeu le plus rapidement possible, ou d'en faire le tour complet, vous facilitant au passage la fin du jeu. Il y aura toujours une r\u00e9compense \u00a0\u00e9quivalente \u00e0 votre prise de risque. Et c'est ce dosage si particulier de la difficult\u00e9 qui fait de The end is nigh un jeu plaisant \u00e0 parcourir. Certes, c'est dur. Certes, la frustration sera pr\u00e9sente. Mais vos reussites seront gratiffiantes, d\u00e9bloquant des niveaux secrets typ\u00e9s retro ou des niveaux hardcore.\n\nConcernant la partie musicale, passer apr\u00e9s Danny Baranowski parait compliqu\u00e9. Et le choix de remixer de la musique classique est vraiment particulier. Je trouve personnellement que \u00e7a ne colle pas n\u00e9cessairement bien avec l'esprit du jeu dans la plupart des niveaux. Et le souci de connaitre ces musiques est ce sentiment de lassitude face \u00e0 ces airs qui tournent tr\u00e9s vite en boucle et restent en t\u00eate. Il s'agit pour moi de la partie la moins r\u00e9ussi du jeu, mais je vous rassure, on est loin d'une plantade : \u00e7a reste dans l'ensemble agr\u00e9able \u00e0 l'oreille.\n\nQue dire de plus, si ce n'est que le contenu en levels est cons\u00e9quent et qu'en faire le tour vous prendra un certain temps. Comptez une vingtaine de niveaux par monde multipli\u00e9 par les 10 que j'ai pour l'instant d\u00e9couvert (et ce n'est pas fini), et je ne parle pas des niveaux du \"future\" et des niveaux r\u00e9tro.\n\nAlors, c'est mieux ou moins bien que Super meat boy ? Eh bien, c'est diff\u00e9rent. Le gameplay est quand m\u00eame assez diff\u00e9rent. Mais sachez que ce The end is nigh est excellent et vous fera pass\u00e9 un \u00e9t\u00e9 des plus sal\u00e9s.\n\nNOTE : 8/10\n\n+\nDe la plateforme difficile mais pas injuste\nUne direction artistique toujours aussi soign\u00e9\nUn contenu cons\u00e9quent\n\u00a0\n-\nLa musique pas toujours en ad\u00e9quation avec l'ambiance", "timestamp_created": 1500015960, "timestamp_updated": 1500015960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734513", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33529799": {"recommendationid": "33529799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109838339", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502854633}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey I finished the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno", "timestamp_created": 1500014247, "timestamp_updated": 1500014247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33529464": {"recommendationid": "33529464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001304794", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 9084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514244394}, "language": "english", "review": "I expected this to be Super Meat Boy part 2, but instead it took a different route making it more fun.\n\nAlot of the levels are tough and smartly designed that beating them just feels great\n\nThe controls are well done, graphics look lovely, retro levels are smooth and the screen detail is a nice touch.\n\nMusic is fantastic and fits the levels difficulty and atmosphere perfectly.\n\nAt moments you'll need to backtrack alot to get the Tumors you missed but i feel it's nice since it'll help you with the speed run achievements as you'll learn to ace the levels better than before.\n\nThe secrets parts in the game are very cleverly hidden and finding them is always a great feeling as sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's hard.\n\nLet's just say the game is so fun that i will enjoy 100%ing it.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1500012856, "timestamp_updated": 1500012856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795131", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33528925": {"recommendationid": "33528925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078475451", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500513188}, "language": "english", "review": "Original/ TLDR:\n\nWelcome to Super I Wanna Be the Meat Bros <3\n\nYes, to me it seems like a nice mix of Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be the Guy, and Super Mario bros 3.

It continues to add new elements, and challange the player throughout the chapters progressions. It really reminds me of Super Meat Boy in that design.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a wide variety of platforming puzzle rooms, tight controls, and the classic humor you know and love from Edmund. Also a few deaths. Can't forget about those...\n\nGoing back to try and find secrets, and more tumors, is in the end fun. That adds a great deal of replayability. The NES era nostalgia that many design elements brings up is heavy and very much welcome. Even the complaint that you have to restart a world from the beginning each time seems to be apart of the triubute to old school gaming that this is. Back then you didn't save your game. If you wanted to play SMB3 you started from the beginning each time.\n\nIt isn't perfect though. There are some bugs that are being worked on, although non that will jump out as an evening ruiner. The puzzles at times can feel too obtuse, but again, that just reminds me of old school games where some secrets were rarely found without searching for them.\n\nThe biggest complaint to be had with the game is the backtracking. Some rooms can only be 100% done if you make sure to try again from the other direction. Which ones? You won't know... A few times I thought a tumor had to be backtracked, only to find out that the room closes off when you go through it. That means the easy mistake to try a backtrack attempt means that I HAVE to try again later from the beginning of that map/floor.\n\nNot a crazy burden though with the ability to warp to any map/floor from the start menu.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------", "timestamp_created": 1500010074, "timestamp_updated": 1500196137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33528713": {"recommendationid": "33528713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111462415", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499916843}, "language": "english", "review": "Jump through tough level into the next then to realise you forgot that squishy little tumor that teases you because you cant get him so you go back to get him only to realise you can no longer get the tumor from the side your on so you have to start the whole stage and get through the other levels to get to that one only to die 400 times in order to get it...... may or may not have been from personal experiece .. ty Edmund you sadistic fk <3\n", "timestamp_created": 1500009023, "timestamp_updated": 1500009023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33528283": {"recommendationid": "33528283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047668085", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504472073}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is another Edmund McMillen masterpiece.

Think Super Meat Boy, n++, Fenix rage, Life of Pixel, Slime San. It's a difficult game, with trial and error. Extremely suitable for skilled players, speedrunners, average players WITH patience, and fans of 2d platformers. I struggle to objectively recommend this to Edmund fans if you do NOT like platformers. Although, mileage will vary. Edmund fans surely expect challenge, and seem to love being thrown into difficult and atmospheric worlds even in genres they do not typically enjoy. Just look at the number of SMB fans who hate other platformers. Amazing. \n \nLevel design... \nis varied and challenging. Individual static screens that helps player focus on where they are per screen, no jerky motion of scrolling background. This I cannot emphasise enough as a really important feature - it keeps screen still and allows player to do the movement. N++ does this of course. Player moves screen to screen (by exiting one side) horizontally for the most part, but sometimes downwards and upwards (DKC style). Secret areas are numerous, hidden away sometimes by environments that are queued to destruct based on players actions. Aforementioned destruction of environment is a novel level design feature which resets if player leaves the current screen and returns. This adds a new puzzle element to tricky precision platforming. Without spoiling too much - there is water to swim through, spikes, lots of monsters - sometimes with projectiles to avoid, all with varying AI. Threats can be in motion or staionary. There are more surprises that should really be discovered alone. It's very novel overall and I'd say has more level design surprises in precision platforming than I've ever seen. But do not worry, it's not a convoluted experience, each idea is fully fleshed out over hundreds and hunderds of screens. I'd describe the hazards as tightly packed. Far less width for running wildly. Less horizontality than Meat boy, but still with ample wide leaps that need to be calculated.  \n\nControl/mechanics -\nmove, jump, and the big new move - grabbing ledges. \nMovement on ground...\nis graceful, predictable. Not jerky - I suspect Ash's ground acceleration builds for a few split seconds before full speed. However it's subtle, not as pronounced as Meat Boy's heavier start, where ground acceleration provided quite a sticky and slower start, appropriate for the skinless boy. Ash has a slower full speed. Perfect for the dense level hazards.  \nMovement in air...\nfrom jumping is great. Very precise. Can stop air accelaration just like that, fall where you need to. Falls faster than meat boy I think. In air control is tuned well. Jump height variable to jump input time. Also jump distance is larger on the horizontal plane following a ledge grab. This takes a bit of time to adjust but its exciting. NO wall sliding NOR wall jumping. Overall the jumping feel has less of an overall horizontal pull (than meatboy) with more weight in vertical gravity. As mentioned above, falling is faster. Jump height is pretty decent and you can easily learn the limits in the early levels.\nLedge grabbing... \nis new, I believe Edmund is very proud of this mechanic. Grab onto either upper wall corners, or little thorn like looking spikes anywhere up a vertical wall side. It feels finicky at first but once you learn why you need it, its really fun. You may also ledge grab upper corners that have hazardous spikes on the top, merely a pixel way. This is extremely tight an execution, but its badass. I like to think of ledge grabbing in the same vein as hanging in the air or wall sliding in Super Meat Boy - both give you neceassry time to breath and adjust to plans in navigating the levels. Once you master it you can hang out on walls and enjoy a split second to then jump again. Its a welcome addition and produces a fluent stop start rhythm that makes sense within tightly woven hazards.  \n\nHitboxes...\nare really good for me personally. I tested the waters when i started my game and just walked up to monsters. There is slight and small overlap of pixels (thank goodness) between player and hazards and its makes for a more enjoyable experience. The levels require tight excution therefore a bit of freedom to brush into a hazard goes a long way. \n\nI love the game. I hope this review is helpful for some of you.\n\nPS - As much as I tried to discuss platfoming objectively - Edmund and his previous work was mentioned. This is retrospectively fairgame for me - Super Meat Boy, particularly, set precision platformers to be judged by new standards.

The platforming is spot-on, precise and fun. There`s hundreds of levels with countless collectibles to get which raises the challenge - like the dev said on twitter: \"This game is only as challenging as you want it to be.\" The graphics are pleasant to look at, though in some retro levels it's hard to tell what's what sometimes. Additionally there isn't that much variety in color, but in a game with worlds themed after certain elements, that's understandable. The music is incredible - remixes of classical music made to pump up the game's atmosphere. The retro versions even get their own separate song.\n\nAll in all, if you enjoy platformers and exploring within them - this game is a must-have. tenouttaten 5/7", "timestamp_created": 1499993362, "timestamp_updated": 1499993362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33525070": {"recommendationid": "33525070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999092994", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501047142}, "language": "english", "review": "good stuff", "timestamp_created": 1499992474, "timestamp_updated": 1499992474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33524934": {"recommendationid": "33524934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150127234", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504640423}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10 super adictivo.", "timestamp_created": 1499991824, "timestamp_updated": 1499991824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33524883": {"recommendationid": "33524883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062303701", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499959413}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell.

Everything you could want in a platformer is present.  The graphics are smooth and well drawn, the art style is a cool take on the well-treaded post-apocolyptic motif.  The animations are snappy and expressive amd lighting is used to create a cool atmosphere.   Musically the game is a winner too, with remixes on classical tunes.  Some hit more than others, but when they do nail it, they nail it.  Got to give a shout out to the chiptune music that plays during the cart levels, such a seamless transition you'd think it was done 30 years ago.  Funny voice acting, when it is utilized.  A well-written but ambigious lore is present, but you will have to work to access some of it.\n\nThe ironic thing about this game is that there are Nintendo references all over the place, but this game actually stands toe to toe with anything they have made in a 2-D plane(mainly referring to the DKC reboots).  I've seen nods to Super Metroid, Mario 3, Mario World and others.  If you enjoyed the game Catherine, you'll notice this game takes a couple of design and structural cues from that amazing game as well.\n\nThe mechanics and gameplay are just as exacting and devilish as before, this time using compact level screens to propel the game forward.  The worlds all have thier twist on the gameplay, and the way they are able to design challenges down to the pixel is still impressive after Meatboy, because no one else does platforming this precise and distilled.  There is a clear and distinct skill progression, so you will notice yourself breezing through worlds you thought were insurmontable a few hours earlier.  You also can choose the order to play certain areas, which is a nice touch.  The hidden goodies are actually more than just bashing the cracked wall, some of these secrets are actually, well secrets.  Shh, don't tell anyone.   And the mini-games are sweet, though I'm just starting to tackle them after beating the game.  I recommened doing the same, as the skill level you will gain will make them more bearable.  But the puns and old school CRT filter are just oozing with charm.  \n\nThe lack of bosses is a bold design choice in itself, it's good that they didn't shoehorn something in just to check of a box.  \n\n\nOverall this is an amazing value, and easily a game of the year canidate.  15 hours to beat a platformer, then add a ton more to get the achievements....buy this game full price and don't look back.", "timestamp_created": 1499980677, "timestamp_updated": 1500482146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33511936": {"recommendationid": "33511936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258958745", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502503052}, "language": "english", "review": "Great design; the 1 room = 1 level format fits really well with this game because you don't have to worry about staying alive for multiple rooms at a time.

The game takes after SMB as well as Gish and Time Fcuk.\n\nThe game handles pretty much like SMB with the exception of the dash button is now a drop button. As a result its very satisfying to just navigate through the world -- also the seemless respawn animation makes the game very easy to pick up and get right back into the grit of the level.\n\nThe stages are composed of levels, and should be treated more like a platforming puzzles as opposed to SMBs adrenaline pumped test of reactions. The game will spike quickly in difficulty in comparison to SMBs curve and you should get a feel of difficulty well within your 2 hour refund period.\n\nThe idea of the game is less getting from point A to point B, but exploring the world and discovering collectibles. If you want the fast paced platforming of SMB, you will not find it here.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you are looking for tight platforming and get a sense of achievement replaying levels to perfect them -- getting the collectible.\n\nThe music score is worth noting as it is comprised of all, if not mostly classical music tracks remixed.", "timestamp_created": 1499973923, "timestamp_updated": 1499974042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33509848": {"recommendationid": "33509848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075643618", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504031112}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f suicideboy'\u0435\u043c.", "timestamp_created": 1499973025, "timestamp_updated": 1499973025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33509532": {"recommendationid": "33509532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048422931", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503843821}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043d, \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u0438, \u0442\u044b \u043e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b! \u041e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c -__-", "timestamp_created": 1499971997, "timestamp_updated": 1499971997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33509313": {"recommendationid": "33509313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374994912", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500183035}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0c\u7838\u624b\u67c4\u53bb\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1499971314, "timestamp_updated": 1499971314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33508909": {"recommendationid": "33508909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007069128", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499969948}, "language": "english", "review": "I never felt like I knew where I was going wrong and therefore how to improve.

Seine letzte Videospiel-Kassette geht kaputt und nun macht er sich auf den Weg, Tumore und K\u00f6rperteile zu sammeln um sich einen Freund zu bauen.

Ihr habt hier einige unterschiedliche Spielmechaniken die das Spiel als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Spiel rechtfertigen. Zur Zeit dieser Review gibt es keine deutsche Sprachausgabe.

Probadlo, dadle un tiento y si no os mola para algo tenemos el servicio de devoluciones de Steam, yo desde luego pagu\u00e9 estos 15 euros bien a gusto.", "timestamp_created": 1499938400, "timestamp_updated": 1499938400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33499261": {"recommendationid": "33499261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047858346", "num_games_owned": 819, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505486626}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5148\u63a8\u8350\u7740\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u6df1\u5165\u5199\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5730\u56fe\u80fd\u6253\u7684\u90fd\u6253\u901a\u4e86\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u56de\u53bb\u6536\u9690\u85cf\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u73a9\u96be\u5ea6\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u51e0\u5173\u96be\u5ea6\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u6361\u7684\u5361\u5e26\u91cc\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5168\u6536\u96c6\u5012\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u96be\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u540e\u9762\u6e38\u73a9\u3002\u624b\u611f\u548cSMB\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u60ef\u6027\u638c\u63e1\u597d\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u8d85\u723d\u7684\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1499938100, "timestamp_updated": 1499938100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 188, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946103", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33499219": {"recommendationid": "33499219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054805959", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513935406}, "language": "english", "review": "That's more \"I Wanna Be The Guy\" then \"Super Meat Boy\".", "timestamp_created": 1499937988, "timestamp_updated": 1499937988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417476", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33499091": {"recommendationid": "33499091", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965951997", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501100652}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you honestly checked the reviews for that game ?

They're my favorite genre. Two and a half hours into The End is Nigh and I was just as much in love with it as I was with Super Meat Boy (which it most closely resembles, for obvious reasons). The controls are just as solid, the level design tight and the music utterly charming (so far, entirely classical music remixes. I grinned when I heard the Dvorak 9th symphony arrangement). And yes, it is HARD. I've died 628 times so far. The hidden areas in particular will test your skills (and patience).\n\nIf there's one major complaint I have, it's that the map system doesn't handle backtracking for collectables very well. It forces you to start at the beginning of the area whether you want to or not. This hasn't been a gigantic issue for the early areas but I imagine it'll get very frustrating in the harder later ones. Since there's a certain level of connectivity to the levels (although not as much as you might expect), I can understand why they went in this direction but I think the system could be tweaked a bit to cut down on needless padding. \n\nI know this game will keep me busy for hours to come.

I've read the negative comments about the game, and I'm here to tell you why they're wrong. The first point that I want to stress is that NONE of them have even played for two hours. Why are you gonna write a review before even playing most of the game. The first thing pointed out was that they hated precision platforming and that the speed was slow. This is a different seeries to meat boy. They are trying out new things and ideas with every new \"character series\" that they bring in. They have a different core mechanic in each game that they make. This one so happens to be precision platforming which is one of the things that I love most. (not every platformer they make has to be meat boy). They also don't like the collectibles, while I enjoy them a lot. I like the cartridges a ton because they are just really hard versions of the game. I also like the idea of the tumors being collectibles that you can get at any time, but you just need to know how to get them. I like how they are used in the game. Meat boy had characters, The End is Nigh has harder and cooler levels from the collectibles. The next thing is the color scheme. They say it's bland. I mean if you knew what the game was about you can see why they used the colors they used. It even tells you in the title THE END IS NIGH. For those of you that don't get it, it's a post-apocalyptic world, so the colors are meant to be in a darker mood. I think the colors compliment the game well. The next thing is move restriction and the \"speed\" of the game. For those that didn't play meat boy, there were mechanics that were in the game, such as wall clinging/sliding/jumping and the \"run button\". For those of you that did play meat boy, I want you to think to yourself if you ever really found yourself in a position where you weren't holding that \"run button\" and then tell me that it was completely useless because there was no reason walk. They made is so that you didn't have to constantly hold a button to go at the speed that was meant for the game. I think the character's speed is great for precision platforming. I like this new mechanic of hanging off of certain walls. I felt like the wall clinging in meat boy was a bit wonky, and I enjoy being able to completely control what I hang on to. The next point is that the game is \"if you're blind, screw you\" which I sort of agree with. There's obviously some stuff that you won't see coming and that you'll have to deal with on your next life. But, get this, you have UNLIMITED lives. They want you to die. Hell, they even have a death counter on your profile screen. They expect you to die thousands of times. Even saying all this, it is definitely possible to beat this deathless from a blind playthrough. It isn't likely, but the shit they throw at you doesn't come 80 mph. It's reactable. Frame drops are another thing people complain about even though there are settings to turn the shaders down. >:( The final thing I want to talk about is the complaint about no variety. Play for more than one world, and you'll encounter different things. I don't know what else to say. Some of the enemies in the game are amazing. My favorite is probably the better versions of the Oobs. When I first saw them, I thought of how amazing it was to see them correcting the mistakes they did in meat boy. The Oobs were probably one of my least favorite enemies in the game because of they're rapid and, somewhat, unpredictable movement. I'm happy to see that they are looking back at their designs and reworking them. It really gives me hope for their future games. Now you may ask, \"Why did you take time out of your day to write this? You dumbass.\" 1. I don't think the complaints for the game were warranted at all. 2. I have no life to waste. 3. I don't want people to turn their heads from this game because they read all of these bad things about the game and that it wasn't a \"continuation of meat boy.\" 4. I think this game deserves better than what it's getting. It truly is an amazing game that I can see myself playing for 100+ hours.\n\nIn all, if you enjoy a challenge (and I mean a REALLY hard challenge) then I advise you to definitely put this at the top of your list of games to play.

I actually don't like it. I've 100%-ed each game by Edmund so I've been a fan for a minute, but End is Nigh came out so quickly that I didn't have any expectations for it.

This is far more methodical and drawn out- not to mention a lot of forced trial and error. Collectables are pretty meh, with cartridges being a big ticket item. However, they're merely more stages in lo-fi graphics. Music is great. There's an odd charm to the fact that 30-50% of the soundrack is public domain music, but remixed with the gothic/rock stylings of Isaac. Animations and graphics are fantastic. Controls are perfect. It's a very self contained game- no map for each stage, no real cutscenes (so yes, you must backtrack through each world in its entirety to search for collectables. Your mileage may very on that one).

Its some of the best music I've heard in a game in a long time. It's all remixed classical music. Any fan of the genre will smile every time they hear the themes they're so used to hearing come from an orchestra instead come from an assortment of instruments that give the music new life.\n+Controls are tight. Most of the time when you die you know it's your fault for missing a button push or being a little slow (I'll touch more on the other part of the time in a minute).\n+The art is pretty. It's nothing mind blowingly pretty or anything, but if you've played any of the designers other games like The Binding of Isaac or Super Meat Boy then you know what to expect; high quality illustrations that make the envirornment of the game more enjoyable. \n+It's difficult. Every bit of progress you make is hard earned and it's very satisfying to reach a goal you've been working toward after suffering death after death. There's even added difficuly for completionists looking for the challenge in the form of collectibles called tumors that are placed in hard to reach locations.\n+The atmosphere is well constructed. The game is funny, but it delves into extremely dark subject matter such as death, an apocalypse, and even subtle notes of necrophelia. The art and music both help to promote this eeriness while not taking itself too seriously by using dark muted colors (primarily grays) and primarily upbeat music that can make you laugh at a death and keep everything lighthearted when you reach your 100th death on a single screen.\n+The story is compelling. The \"npcs\" you meet hint at a future betrayal and some deeper meaning to the death of everyone around you. That's all I can say about it without spoiling anything.\n+The game runs well. Programmed by Tyler Glaiel, the program makes excellent use of his own engine, and is able to run on haardware that isn't necessarily suited to gaming while still looking great and maintaining a high frame rate.\n\n\nCons:\n-It's difficult. I list this twice because there are moments when the challenge can become too much, and you can feel like you're dying for things that aren't really your fault. There is an enemy in the 4th or 5th area (depending on your choice of progression) that moves without much pattern and there's not a whole lot you can do to influence it in a specific direction except for continue to die and restart the level. On several occasions it didn't feel like I was playing a challenging platformer but rather that I was rolling the dice only to come up with snake eyes every time. I have yet to be able to reach that collectible due to the sporadic nature of these foes.\n-The music kind of loops a lot. The music is great, and because of my own love for classical music I didn't mind too much, but there were times when I thought to myself that if I hear Hungarian Dance No. 5 one more time I'm going to lose my mind. This is really the only piece I've felt this way with, but it doesn't change the fact that all the others loop a lot as well. \n\nAs you can see by the absolute domination of pros compared to cons on the list; I've clearly enjoyed my time with The End Is Nigh. There is plenty of content and it's extremely enjoyable while providing a formiddable challenge to the completionist in me. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who liked the previous king of soul crushing platformers: Super Meat Boy, or really to anyone who enjoys platformers in general.

The movement is so restricted that it takes most of the fun out of the game.  You'd think the ability to wall jump would be a small thing, but it really makes the gameplay trudge to a stop without it.  \n\nSince the rooms are so small and self-contained (failure means you respawn at the side of the room you entered), most of the challenge comes from things falling from the ceiling that looked like they were stable, or platforms moving that looked like they were stable.  It exchanges the relatively straightforward and fair difficulty of SMB for \"screw you for playing this blind\" difficulty, where the first few tries through a room are likely going to fail because of obstacles you couldn't see or account for.  This is compounded by the monochrome color pallete where spikes can sometimes be confusing to pick out from the background.\n\nThe addition of a loud, annoying voice for the main character adds nothing, thankfully it only seems to pop up in cutscenes and they're skippable on the first viewing.  Unfortunately, there's no way to turn them off completely.\n\nIn conclusion, don't buy this expecting a continuation of Super Meat Boy.

Unless you're some sort of platforming deity, two hours is not enough to get a good feel for the game.\n\nOkay, first off, this is a hard game, especially if you're going to be going for collectibles. The levels get quite unforgiving quite quickly, even in the first area, and the difference in timing between success and failure can sometimes be measured in tenths of seconds. Additionally, the controls are really precise, so when you screw up, you don't have anyone to blame except yourself. Therefore, it's not for everyone.\n\nSecond... I like this game. It has its charm, and it has the sort of charm that you'd expect a lovechild of Edmund M (Time Fcuk, Super Meat Boy, et al.) and Tyler Glaiel (Closure) to have. Invariably, there are going to be comparisons to Super Meat Boy, but this doesn't do either game justice. TEIN is a slower, more precise, and more methodical experience with bursts of intensity throughout. There isn't a timer that you're racing to get A+, there are no alternate characters that are better-suited to certain levels than others, and the obstacles that TEIN offers are different than those in SMB, but not inherently simpler. TEIN's levels are dynamic in a different way than SMB's as entire sections of the map can move and react to the player in a way that didn't happen in SMB. Additionally, TEIN has to be the one modern platformer that doesn't have homing missiles anywhere in the main game. If you're expecting another SMB, this is not it. This is barely even a spiritual successor, and that's okay.\n\nDeath is a frequently occuring event but one you recover from quickly. Ash controls very well in the air and doesn't keep his momentum upon releasing a movement key (which may or may not be your thing, but does make landings onto small platforms easier). The individual levels are for the most part short and focus on one idea at a time (though there are plenty of exceptions to both). The areas each have their own distinct styles and mechanics.\n\nThe game's tumors are a nice mechanic. They're collectibles that you have to enter a level, collect, and then leave the level by some means other than warping using the map to keep, and they're present in practically every level. For the most part they are gained by taking a harder route through an area, backtracking, or getting in and out of a hidden area (which gives you five at a time). If you lack the skill or patience to get one, you can always skip it any come back to it later. They're optional, although they unlock additional levels for you and become very important in late game (specifically, [spoiler]they act as revives later on, which, considering you can get over four hundred of them, gives you an idea of how much the game expects you to die[/spoiler]).\n\nThe game also has its retro levels, and quite a lot of them. Some give you ten lives (nine revives) and a continue to get ten more, some require you to beat the level sequence without dying, and some have progression similar to the main game. Accessing them requires you to get game cartridges, which are usually tucked away in hidden levels and don't require you to leave the level to keep them. As an added incentive to do the retro levels, completing them gives you bonus tumors. The better you do, the more bonus tumors you get.\n\nIn terms of performance, the game runs really well at full resolution, even with all the settings turned to max on mid-range current-gen hardware. However, as it is a vector graphics game, lower-end computers may still stuffer while running it (even with Glaiel's tricks).\n\nHowever, that's not to say the game is without its faults.\n\nWhile there is a warp system, the warp points only take you to the start of each area and not all of the levels are traversible in the opposite direction, meaning if there's a collectible closer to the end than the beginning, you may have to traverse all the way from the beginning of an area to get it anyway. This leads to a lot of retracing your steps. At least it's practice, right?\n\nIt doesn't always feel like the game explores its own mechanics to their potential fullest. I would have preferred if the areas were each 5-10 levels longer to better explore the possibilities that interactions between the different obstacles and mechanics could provide.\n\nThe challenge/reward balance is sorely lacking at times. Some individual tumors are obscenely hard to get, while others the game practically gives away for free. The worst offenders are the \"locked\" levels, which contain some of the most difficult challenges in the game in exchange for a mega tumor, which is the same reward as most other secret areas. There's only one locked level that gives something different/maybe better, and it's markedly easier. Additionally, unlocking those challenges consumes your key and you usually have to go partway through the challenge to get another one, meaning if you accidentally bump into one of the locks with a key (which can happen as several of them have to be jumped over to avoid), in the worst case you'll be barred from progression through the main game (as there is an area that makes heavy use of keys and locks) until you get the key back. Fortunately, there is no way to permanently lock yourself out of the locked areas.\n\nSome of the keyboard controls (none of which are directly gameplay related) are screwy. For instance, many interactions respond to the Up binding as well as Interact. Additionally, warping directly from a warp point allows you to use your Interact keybinding to confirm the warp, but warping from an arbitrary area in the game using the map requires you to use Space instead. Glaiel's twitter implies that the latter is a feature instead of a bug intended to reduce accidental warping, but there are plenty of games that require you to hold down the key to confirm a critical action, and the game is paused while the map is open, meaning I'm not buying this justification.\n\nFinally, Ridiculon's soundtrack hit and miss for me, even with the classical adaptation theme. It's more miss than hit in the beginning (anyone else notice this pattern?), as some of the pieces feel like they're far too upbeat and loud for the game they're in. There is one particularly grevious offender around midgame which I know was supposed to fit with the hectic nature of the area, but actually succeeded in putting me off from the area entirely until I turned the music off (for those curious, it was [spoiler]Retrograde[/spoiler]). They also missed a glorious opportunity to have an adaptation of Liszt's Totentanz, which doesn't appear anywhere in the game or the OST.\n\nAll in all, however, another good hard platformer from Edmund & friends. I know I spent a lot of time writing about the negative points, but I do still seriously enjoy this game. Buy it if you're into hard platformers that require incredibly accurate movements.", "timestamp_created": 1499889713, "timestamp_updated": 1500268617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny":

I've only reached the 3rd world but even so I feel as though I have accomplished so much. You play as Ash (voiced by Rich Evans) who has no way to pass the time after his video game cartridge breaks. Ash now looks to build a friend out of tumors, this is where the game begins. You go from level to level collecting these tumors that are placed around the entire worlds map. Some are easily obtainable, most just within reach, and others hidden for those who search each level carefully. The atmosphere is put into place nicely by Edmunds Super Meat Boy art style.

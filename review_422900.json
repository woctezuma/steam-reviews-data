So, if you liked Creeper World then you will probably want to buy this too.\n\nThis game expands on the Creeper World universe and mechanics by replacing Creep with Particulate, basically an object that flies around in space from an emitter rather than flowing along the ground. Instead of building up collectors and bases you construct ships which can be moved to assault the Particulate and eventually destroy the emitters, which is the same basic premise of the other games. Of course, there are other complications and layers to the game play.\n\nThe best part of this game is that the ships are modular and the player can edit or create ships of their own. It is easy to do and naturally balanced as bigger ships take exponentially longer to construct while smaller ships may not have the fire power necessary to do what is needed. Only truly massive ships can do all the jobs themselves so you\u2019ll create specialized designs for different purposes. The only problem with all this is that the game PUNISHES you for using your own ships. Yes, that\u2019s right, the game treats you trying to use your own fleet as other games treat \u2018cheat mode\u2019. If you beat a level with your own fleet the game will not put a time nor a checkmark next to the level, i.e. it pretends like you didn\u2019t beat it. It is even worse in the campaign where if you use your ships you can\u2019t move on to the next mission until you beat it with the default ships. It is utterly incomprehensible why the game would go to so much effort to make you able to build your own ships only to make it such that not only are never rewarded for doing so but punished for it. \n\nOn the bright side this game implemented a map generator nearly exactly as I described in my review of Creeper World 3, so I\u2019m glad I got exactly what I wanted.", "timestamp_created": 1515793730, "timestamp_updated": 1515798250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39186405": {"recommendationid": "39186405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129404433", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476263881}, "language": "english", "review": "The game system is quite different from previous Creeper World games but feels alike.

I had fun, but not nearly as much as with Creeper World.  In fact, it wasn't until several missions in that I actually started enjoying it.  Since I can't make a \"meh\" recommendation, I'm giving it a recommendation, just not a very strong one.  Here's some details:\n\nPros:\n+ Clearly a lot of effort went into this.\n+ Can design your own ships.\n+ Good mix of different default ships with definite roles.\n+ Flexible tech upgrades - not locked into what you spend and can redistribute between general tech and specific ship boosts.  Can reallocate without loss, there's just a delay for full effectiveness.  This tech reallocation is actually one of my favorite features.\n+ Most missions do require some strategy.\n+ The particulate looks interesting.\n+ Sacrificing ships isn't a permanent loss and can be extremely useful.\n\nCons:\n- Rather short.\n- First couple missions feel way too easy, as if you just need to move your fleet a few places and your ships do everything you need.\n- Did not really deliver on the \"Adaptive and Emergent\" claim made in the trailer - yeah the particulate did react a little bit, but never in a really surprising or interesting way, mainly just acting like it was magnetically attracted to ships or spawning a lot more when you get close to emitters.  Did not seem intelligent at all.\n\nThe above are pro/con considering the game on its own merits.  But this game is part of the Creeper World universe, which begs a comparison with Creeper World 3 (the last and by far the best of the trilogy and an outstanding game in its own right).\n\nSo Compared to CW3, Particle Fleet has the following Cons:\n- Music is not as good.\n- Interface feels less refined.  For example for some reason you can't view ship health in the normal lower box, where you can toggle all the ship features, there's a separate box for that.\n- Not as satisfying.\n- Not nearly as challenging.\n- Feels shorter.\n- Story isn't as compelling or interesting.\n\nSo with all that, why am I giving this a \"Yes\"?  Because its fairer than \"No.\"  I did enjoy it, I don't feel ripped off or anything, and I want to encourage the developer to do better next time.

However, the basic ships are incredibly weak and very inefficiently designed. I ended up giving up on level 12 because I needed to blow up a node spewing out red attack orbs, but the node spawned orbs so quickly that even with every ship I had available shooting at the node, the orbs still pushed through to destroy everything.\n\nI don't exactly regret buying it, but I think I would have given it a thumbs up at $10 instead of $15, even though I would have given up at the same point.", "timestamp_created": 1495233049, "timestamp_updated": 1495233049, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406522", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31831533": {"recommendationid": "31831533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043850855", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476684065}, "language": "english", "review": "Freaking great strategy game.\nNice balance of simplicity and strategy, very suited for a casual gamer like me.\n\nLOVE IT!!", "timestamp_created": 1495152427, "timestamp_updated": 1495152427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31782508": {"recommendationid": "31782508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005406191", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494908577}, "language": "english", "review": "Greetings!  At its core Particle Fleet: Emergence is a simple game; sort of like playing against a virus.  You slowly capture territory and build ships while the enemy spreads out in all direction with an endless supply of particles (duh).  You will spend a good deal of time overwhelmed and barely holding on but this is part of the charm of the game.\n\nDifficult but Fair:  I almost consider this game a \u2018souls-like\u2019 game, the difficulty can be high but it is far and you will need to repeat some levels to adapt and understand the best approach.  Some tactics that work wonders on one level will be useless at another.  You have to evaluate your location, land mass, energy mines and the way your opponent is coming at you.  This ends in a satisfying victory when you do finally accomplish it and doesn\u2019t take too long to pick up and put down.\n\nSimple and effective:  Every bit of this game is efficient and effective, no, the graphics aren\u2019t award winning but they accomplish the game\u2019s purpose and I\u2019d argue that better graphics could ruin the game.  The music is amazing and although it would be nice to have a bit more I love the score that is in this game.  Mechanics are solid and so are the controls; overall just no real complaints.\n\nSo, what\u2019s bad:  I can\u2019t really say that I have any part of this game I dislike?  Well, now that I think about it sometimes you get a point where the game is yours but it is going to take another 5-10 minutes to slowly make your way to victory.  This can be a bit boring at times but I don\u2019t really see a way around it.  Overall, I love this game, especially for its price.  The story could be better but wasn\u2019t really expecting anything on this front.\n\nAll in all, if you like tactical games, especially those that are easy to pick up and a decent difficulty to ensure a satisfactory victory (or defeat) get this game.  It is well worth the play through and if you are like me you will find yourself picking it up from time to time.

I bought this game because I spent a significant amount of time with Creeper World 3 and enjoyed the gameplay and story. It took me a while before I decided to, however; the game didn't look that great. The gameplay is similar to CW3, but with obvious significant differences, and that gave me pause.\nUltimately I tried it, and enjoyed the game, and then... it was done. There's very little game to this game. I blew through the 'campaign' very quickly, and the other whatever you want to call it that looks like a campaign but isn't, but while I'm still working through the hundreds of additional levels in CW3 I've completed this one in a day or two.\nSure, you can design your own block-by-block ships, but the campaign does a good job of giving you the ships you need when you get them, so unless you design similar ships, good luck to you.\nAnd that's the sad thing: there's no easy way to use your own ships in a game to test them out. Randomly generate a level and it gives you a selection menu to pick from the real ships only. Launch the game, and then you can set the game mode to sandbox and pick your own ships.... but only after clearing the default loadout and manually adding your ships one by one, and don't click the wrong place or you'll be dragging ships back in order constantly afterwards.\n\nThe game favors making your own ships and maps, and you -can- download maps to play made by other players, but I've had more crashes than completed games that way, and it's not like CW3 where exiting gives you an auto-save. Prepare to lose progress.\n\nUltimately I'm disappointed.

Each scenario defines what ships are available and each ship has a role (i.e. capturing spawn points, blocking/ramming, ranged fighting, killing ships, clearing plasma, speed, etc).  It makes for a very rewarding experience, slowly fighting back the particles and using your ships to the best of their abilities.  Very puzzle like and less RTS like.  It should also be mentioned you can build your own ships and use them in missions in sandbox mode or even make them the default ships in your own missions made with the editor.\n\nOverall I found this game easier than creeper world 3 (only creeper game I've played so far).  The story is also a bit on the short side but there are user made missions, hard missions and random missions which still gives a lot of content.

The enemy, despite being a mass of particles, is surprisingly relatable and seemingly intelligent (in the sense that you will rage at it because it destroyed your HQ while you were trying to hold it off elsewhere, or it managed to take out that mission-critical energy mine). There's also enemy ships with a rudimentry AI, but even those can be devasting opponents. Storyline is excellent and has ties with previous creeper world games, but you don't need those to enjoy this game.\n\nThe game also includes a full ship editor, where you can build out your hull block-by-block then litter it with guns, energy tanks and support modules. There's also an in-depth mission editor with a fully-scriptable 'PRPL' module for creating complex custom maps with original behavior. If you're not one for building a map, there's a mission generator capable of making just about anything you want, and they play like an actual story mode mission, with a (normally) balanced progression, minus a few novelties usually present in most custom maps.\n\n\nCombat is surprisingly in-depth: Ramming with heavily armored ships works just as well as missile spam, and the hull+modules-to-build-time ratio really helps balance it as well. There's not a huge variety in weapons, but the ways in which you can combine those weapons lead to specialized ships and rich strategies. You can design a huge mothership with twenty of each module, but you need to defend it for a considerable amount of time due to the steadily increasing time-per-hull-cost ratio. Or you can go the route of several smaller ships, or even several ships which combine into a larger ship.\n\nThe game isn't bad in terms of performance either: obviously, a massive particle simulation isn't exactly easy for your CPU but it runs fine on my mid-range gaming laptop. Graphics look great, although they're not as impressive as say, GSB2.\n\nAll I can say is that this would be EPIC as a game engine for realtime player vs player ship combat. There's already fully-featured enemy ships controllable via scripting, but what could beat real multiplayer where you have to build your fleet up, organize your particulate and proceed to the all-out in a war of epic proportions.\n\nMy only complain is that it would be nice if tankers would refuel ships within range of an energy mine if the mine was unable to provide them sufficient power.\n\nprotip: Omnis (especially with the cannon and reactor upgrade) work great as both area denial/defense, stealth missions and cannon fodder.", "timestamp_created": 1483935202, "timestamp_updated": 1483935202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29111080": {"recommendationid": "29111080", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993653828", "num_games_owned": 895, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492833070}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this after loving Creeper World 3.\n\nIts not nearly as fun, almost no difficulty, and the same strategy you use on level 1, will be basically what you use untill the end.

There is very little strategy involved, the story is forced (painfully so), and the level variety leaves a lot to be desired. Every mission its the same thing. Turtle up in the energy well, capture more energy wells, make a massive fleet, destroy particle nodes. Rinse and repeat. \n\n\nCreeper world, the games predeccessor, had much more variety in terms of obsatcles and weapons the player was up against, and in response the player had to adapt. In Particle fleet, there is no adapting, because you are only allowed the ships you are given, and even the particles themselves don't really seem that dangerous when your ships can take a truckload of them inside your own energy wells. You can create a custom fleet, sure, but for most, that won't make the game any harder. \n\nAs for the story, I don't mind so much its shorter than it's Creeper World counterparts. I do mind that it was poorly developed with an ending so forced only a \"first draft for sale on Amazon author\" would be proud of it. And before fan boys begin commenting \"well you only didn't like the ending because...\" No. That type of ending is fine so long as it is done right. This one isn't done right. It's pointless, senseless, and it practically gives a middle finger to the player. Perhaps I wouldn't have minded so much if the gameplay was interesting, but it wasn't.\n\nTLDR: In short it's Gun platforms vs. Particle effects, and that's it.

But 50 hours in, it's safe to say: this is good.\n\nMy initial reason for thumbing it down was that things were happening that I didn't understand. Not all concepts are explained equally clearly in the tutorial, and the player is expected to learn them in some way. For me, this took some time. But as soon as I knew how it all works together, this is all forgotten and the game's greatness starts to shine through.\n\nBut let's start with a minor gripe: sound. While generally OK, two particular sounds are very annoying: \"Lathe\" sounds like you have tinnitus, and if your HQ ship is hit, an alarm goes off that alerts all your roommates as well.\n\nBut, what makes it so great? In short: strategy and customization.\n\n-  Strategy\nWithout a fog of war, you can actually set out a plan and decide which parts of the map to tackle first. There's as much strategy as there's tactics. The way to win a map is: slowly but surely (or \"turtling\"), which is a refreshing change from many other RTS games.\n\n-  Customization\nAfter the campaign you can play user-made levels. With 300 - and counting - already there, there's plenty of fun to have. With the filtering options, you can pick out the best ones. Also, you can design your own ships, and use them in any level you like. The ship mechanics are pretty cool by the way - with every element costing energy to use and time to build, every addition is a trade-off. In short, designing ships is fun, because you can put in your creativity, but the designs have actual consequences in the game.\n\nBut in the end, it all comes down to just shooting down thousands of little simple buggers, moving like some kind of fluid.

Whether you are replaying old missions with a custom fleet or playing a community created mission with that creator's custom fleet, there are an infinite number of options after completing the main storyline.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic strategy game, and well worth the listed price.", "timestamp_created": 1477351847, "timestamp_updated": 1477351847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26190868": {"recommendationid": "26190868", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978671421", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511136918}, "language": "english", "review": "The \"Crack\" in \"Knuckle Cracker\" is the sound of this developer knocking it out of the park again.

It takes elements of a classic RTS and adds some constraints for match-like play that are very well balanced.\n\nYou begin with a set of ships, but none are built. By capturing and holding energy mines, you can use that energy to build ships. However, you've always got a set number of ships you can build. That means you don't \"build ships\", per se - you have a ship allotment of, say, 10 ships, and each ship can either be built (and in play) or not built (destroyed). There's no overwhelming force possible in this game - you've got a small number of pieces to move around.\n\nThat's hugely important to the gameplay, where the particals you battle swarm in patterns. You block those patterns by positioning ships where they can destroy the particle advance before it goes through your defensive lines.\n\nYou can speed run the maps (some players finish levels in 6-7 minutes), but a slow, long match is just as fun. You can gradually move your defensive lines up to the enemy and have a good long battle if you want. That 90 minute match might get tedious, but fortunately you can speed up the game 4x to skip by time if your ships are only slowly gaining ground.\n\nThere's a story campaign with 15 missions that help introduce the different game elements and ship designs. It's light fluff but walks you through a lot of great map designs. After that, there's a set of one-off maps (some user-submitted, from the looks of it) that aren't realistic (from the story/lore POV), but give fun scenarios to try to play in.\nTHEN there's the online map index where you can download and review maps submitted by other players.\nTHEN there's also the map editor, which is fully capable of building any map in the game (including the campaign maps). You can design any game map to your heart's content, and design specific ships to supply players with.\n\nThe overall AI is pretty good. The particle behaviour is interesting and challenging without being frustrating.\n\nThis was one of those risky buys where I wasn't sure I'd like the game, but it turned into my favourite in a long time. If you're a fan of slow RTS games like Supreme Commander, or if you like tower defense games, you'll probably find Partical Fleet: Emergence holds a lot of appeal for you. Fans of hardcore action games will probably not enjoy this as much - it's definitely more of a strategy game than an action game.", "timestamp_created": 1477162846, "timestamp_updated": 1477162846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26164043": {"recommendationid": "26164043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042669538", "num_games_owned": 1224, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477187506}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a 2D space strategy game where you have to conquer territory. You build your ships and then move them around the map to conquer new territory and defend existing territory. In the early levels there are no enemy ships. Instead, you are battling against swarms of red dots (Particulate) which are constantly attacking your ships and conquering territory against you. Later on the enemy ships start appearing and then you're really in trouble.\n\nEach level contains points on the map:\n\n[olist]\n[*]Energy sources which a) allow you to build new spaceships for your fleet and b) provide energy to your ships so they can self-repair when damaged. These energy sources represent the territory conquered so the idea is to try and grab them all and then wipe out the remaining enemy which is already depleted due to lack of energy.\n\n[*]Particulate sources. This is where the swarms of red dots emanate from. The objective of most of the missions I've played is to wipe out the Particulate, which means destroying these Particulate sources.\n\n[*]Ship plans. Collecting these increases the number and types of ships available for you to build in future levels. Usually a new ship type coincides with the arrival of a new enemy weapon in the next level which you can defend against with the new ship.\n\n[*]Land masses. Well, they can't be land since this is set in space, but they are areas where ships can travel across but not 'park'. You have things called 'omnis' which you place on the land masses to convert the colour to your own and provide extra energy.\n[/olist]\n\nThe action happens in real time but you can control the pace by speeding up, slowing down and pausing, giving you time to think when you need it and to skip ahead to save time when you want things to move along.\n\nThere is a generic RPG-like story (in the Story missions), with characters discussing what's happening in the game at the time eg. \"hey we just found so-and-so, this could be used for such-and-such\". You get the idea. It's not a bestselling novel but it's worth reading for the tips given. There's a skip button if you can't be bothered with it.\n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] This game is about beating situations and creating/sharing levels with other players. You cannot play directly against other human players.\n\n[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]\n\nIf you're looking for a slick, fancy space game with glitzy ship designs, this is not it. This is crisp, functional 2D pixel graphics whose primary purpose is to display the territory and items clearly. Think of it more as a chess board than eye candy.\n\nCheery, upbeat space adventure theme. Nice enough to leave on but not something you'd feel like adding to your music collection.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nThere are 3 main sections each with a set of levels. The first one you play contains the Story Missions. The first half of the Story missions take a couple of hours and they are very easy. You can just build all your ships and send them in a loose bunch to conquer every strategic point one by one, without knowing or caring about the differences between the ship types. I was starting to think there was no challenge in this game but then eventually it did get more difficult and became increasingly necessary to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the various ship types and deploy them accordingly.\n\nThere are other Steam reviews talking about the lack of challenge but I suspect these are people who have yet to play the later levels, and have certainly not graduated to the many user-contributed levels. Yes, there is an easy phase but if you want challenge there is plenty to be had here.\n\nThere are stats everywhere: timings, ratings, popularity of levels, you name it.\n\n[h1]Customisation[/h1]\n\nThis game is all about configuring levels and ships. Even during the main missions you have the option to either accept the default ships or build your own before starting the mission. Once you've completed all the main missions you can create your own levels using the in-game editor, share them and download levels from other players. There are currently 200+ player levels.\n\n[h1]Community[/h1]\n\nThe developer is building a strong reputation and loyal following by being very communicative with his users and implementing suggestions. This is a good sign, especially for a game that revolves around user-contributed customisation.\n\n[h1]Performance/Layout[/h1]\n\nI played on Linux with midrange graphics card and it was all smooth and perfect, no glitches found. It should run fine on low-end hardware due to the modest graphics. Menu and settings are all quite elegant and everything is fully configurable. No complaints at all.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nIt's one of those games where the in-game levels are only the start. These basic levels are more than enough to justify the price, but once you get involved in the community the content can be endless. So excellent value.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\nAchievements, Cloud, Stats, Level Editor but strangely no Cards. It's a new game so maybe they will come later.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nSpace games are usually geared towards fancy spaceship graphics and planets etc. The space theme here is only incidental, it would work equally well on land, sea or whatever. It's a pure strategy/puzzle game where you have to be aware of your ships' abilities and think about your moves.\n\nI found the early 'easy' levels to be a lot of fun while getting used to the game, then it declared \"right, that's enough of the nursery, time for big school!\"\n\nLove it, thoroughly recommended.\n\n[quote]Key generously provided by [url=http://pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]PC Games n News[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1477145492, "timestamp_updated": 1477145492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26152963": {"recommendationid": "26152963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080643429", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475430846}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a game about open ended design.

I haven't played any of the dev's previous games, but this one is fascinating.  You control a fleet of ships fighting against the \"particles\", a non-intelligent enemy seemingly governed by a physics or rule base.  In addition to the 16 mission campaign, there are an additional 9 missions from the dev, plus 100+ user-created ones on the user exchange, created using the built-in mission editor.  The game also includes a ship editor to create your own ships, and the \"simulator\", which is a very customizable random map creator.   The UI on the assorted editors and extras needs some improvements. butthe amount of stuff provided in the game is a tremendous value.  And that's not even considering the awesome soundtrack.  I'm not normally one to pay much attention to the music in a game. butthe music in Particle Fleet is great.  Even my son kept on commenting on how much he liked the music while I was playing the game.  I'd buy a stand alone soundtrack if they offered one.\n\nSo it's a good value, but what's the gameplay like?  I loved it, personally.  It's a bit hard to describe, but I'll try.  You build the ships in your fleet using energy from energy sources you control.  You use those ships to destroy enemy structures, such as particle emitters.   The enemy particles form hazards and threats you must overcome, but it's much more like puzzle-solving strategy than what you'd find in a RTS.

The game is played by defending from and conquering never ending emitters of 'stuff'. In creeper world it was basically water (grey goo) that you held back with various towers. In this game you're holding back \"space grey goo\" and instead of using towers, you're using space ships that are each retrofitted with various types of guns.\n\nMore formal review: Creative take on the tower defense genre. Instead of fighting waves of enemies, you're tasked with defeating a map that has a bunch of emitters that spawn unlimited enemies. The enemies in this game have a mostly fluid behavior similar to fighting a flow of water if that makes sense. Pacing through the story is good with incremental upgrades, and after a bit of progression the game opens up additional non-story maps and a community portal that can potentially offer an infinite number of maps to play.  Instead of building stationary towers you build space ships with retrofitted weapons that you can strategically place and move around the map at will.\n\nHighly recommended if you like tower defense game. If you have not played Knuckle Cracker's previous game creeper world 3 I highly recommend both, as the the games are very similar in many ways but different enough to offer a fresh experience.", "timestamp_created": 1476235920, "timestamp_updated": 1476235920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25990139": {"recommendationid": "25990139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039417136", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488720296}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've enjoyed the Creeper World games, you're basically guaranteed to enjoy Particle Fleet.

Simple, colorful art, cheesy storylines and well-designed enemies. As with Creeper World 3 before it, Particle Fleet forces the player to fight a war on many fronts at once, all while managing logistics with a simple, intuitive energy transfer system. \n\nYou have to be able to direct streams of particles, arrange land-capturing turrets for maximum effect, build walls, destroy enemy walls, destroy enemy plasma (slows you down if you try to drive through), repair your own plasma, take strategic energy points, attack structures (quite difficult since only one very short-ranged weapon can destroy enemy structures), manage a ragtag group of loose cannon particles who don't play by anyone's rules (emergent), construct and command a fleet of spaceships which you may have designed yourself, depending on your play preferences, and ultimately rid yourself of any particulate before moving to the next system to start the process again.\n\nAlong the way you'll have to pick up info crates and blueprints for new ships (you can't build as many of each ship type as you want, you have to have a separate license for each one), and may be assisted by some very powerful capturable gun turrets. Or those turrets may belong to the particulate, and you have to withstand their withering rapid-fire barrages while shooting them with a mining laser. But it's all worth it when it turns around and fights for you in the end.\n\nOne thing I particularly like is the Doppel. Doppels are adorable squishy conglomerations of jello cubes in the shape of spaceships that try to crash into you to do damage. They can also shoot particles at you. Despite the fact that the map editor lets you create friendly allied Doppel spawners, they don't feature in the campaign, which made me sad. You can't boss them around like normal ships, but their AI is usually enough to make them useful.\n\nEpic soundtrack makes you feel like you really are taking on the apocalypse itself and saving the universe. Thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nThere are exactly two reasons why I am giving this game a 9/10 instead of a full 10/10.\n\n1: As of this review's writing, the map editor is extremely buggy, prone to crashing upon creation of a new map or locking the save/finalize buttons so you can't apply changes you've made. This is really frustrating because I like making maps and if I put a lot of work in to find that I can't save it, it pisses me off.\n\n2: The game ships with a custom procedural scripting language called PRPL (Particulate Reverse Polish Language, if the CW3 naming convention is continued here.) It's awesome because you can build your own custom objects in the game to do virtually anything, including new ship parts and enemy types. The documentation is still lacking, which is why I sort of dislike trying to make things with it. Of course it doesn't help that the language itself is the bastard child of an object-oriented programming language and an assembly language, but hey it's not too difficult to learn so I won't give it too much crap.\n\n\n\nOther than that, good stuff.

I'll say right away, I'm very, very pleased with this one, just as I have been with the previous game in the series, Creeper World 3.  This is made by the same developer, which means this has the same incredible amount of sheer creativity that CW3 had.  This is similar to that in that it's something of an RTS / Tower Defense hybrid, though the RTS bit is alot stronger than in CW3.  But it sure as heck doesnt play even remotely like a traditional RTS, no sir.\n\nParticle Fleet hits you with a few major differences right from the start:  Firstly, you have no big base to build up... this is a major departure from CW3's \"network\", and an even bigger departure from traditional RTS games.  In each mission, you'll start by warping in your HQ ship, a huge thing that can set up your first Energy Mine, preparing the foundations of your economy.   One thing you'll notice immediately is that instead of tons of little units like in most RTS games, in Particle Fleet you have a small number of really HUGE units.  All of your ships are big.  Really big.  These arent the dinky yet numerous turrets from CW3, instead they're big structures covered in turrets of their own.   Also, these ships dont have health bars... they're destructible in a dynamic way, in that if something hits the hull in a specific spot, that specific bit of hull will be damaged/broken.  Damaging things essentially eat their way into your ships, popping turrets and eventually destroying the core if they reach it.  But the SHAPE of each ship can determine how easy or not it is for that to happen.  \n\nThese ships are constructed around any Energy Mines... which are the source of your resources in this game.  Unlike CW3's all-consuming Network, Energy Mines can only be constructed in specific locations, and have a certain range at which they can project energy.  You'll use this energy to build ships and other things, and to recharge ships as they continue to use their turrets.  You also have Omnis, which look like little turrets themselves, but can be used to capture land, or do anything that your HQ ship or Lathes could do (destroying/capturing structures, breaking up Struc and landmass, other things).   These are interesting in that unlike, say, reactors in CW3, these can be used in a variety of aggressive ways, since they can be flown around similar to how turrets moved in CW3.\n\nAnd that's one interesting thing about this game, is that your units tend to be very versatile in terms of how you can use them (with certain exceptions).  This means there are a ton of different possible approaches, and all sorts of playstyles that you could use, that are all totally viable.  What's more, these different ships are just real fun to use.  My favorite is the Hammer; a huge blocky thing with a massive frontal hull, and the core at the very back of the ship.  Having next to no ranged weapons, this thing is meant for blocking damage.... or ramming stuff.  I'll never tire of doing this, it's just hilarious fun.  Other units tend to be very creative and entertaining in their own way too, things like Grabbers for instance, which can direct blue Particulate around the map.  However, there are restrictions: unlike CW3 you cant just build as many things as you want.  For example, the default fleet allows you to have only two Lathes, only one Hammer, only two Grabbers, and so on.  And a max number of Omnis.  This may sound restrictive, but you'll soon find that you feel like you have TONS of units.... there's alot to keep track of.  And build order ends up being very important on tougher missions... you'll be making some tough choices here, which makes things extra interesting.  As always though, there are many approaches to build order depending on your playstyle and strategy.  Nothing is ever set in stone in this game.  I cant even tell you just how much I appreciate this fact.\n\nAbout the Particulate:  This serves as the enemy in each map (the red ones anyway, the blue ones are on your side).  As with CW3, this stuff isnt even remotely like a traditional enemy force in RTS games.  These are massive waves of individual particles that flow around the map in a variety of ways... different varieties of particles have different behavior, but individual particles are very weak; these are dangerous in the fact that they're in huge numbers, and they just... keep.... coming.  Like CW3 there are emitters around the map that never stop generating this stuff.   And what's more, these are used in tons of interesting ways in each map... you never know just what you're going to get from these until you start the map.   There are other threats, of course, such as Emergent (funky cubes that roam around awkwardly) or Doppels (big groupings of particles that look and act somewhat like your ships), among other stuff.  The creativity of the enemy units/behaviors constantly amazes me.\n\nAnd of course, there's alot of interesting mechanics here, such as Amp Gems (can be used to grab \"techs\" that can be switched out at any time, or can be attached to ships to power them up) and other fun stuff.   All these mechanics and things are just as versatile as your ships.   Oh, and did I mention you can make your own custom ships?  You can have a seperate fleet, choosing either your custom-made stuff, or the default fleet, and there are seperate scoreboards for both.\n\nThe campaign itself is pretty interesting, but it's also quite short:  This is very clearly a game where the vast majority of content is found AFTER that.   Like CW3 it's pretty much endless... you can get procedurally generated maps, or download maps that others have made via the extensive editor.  The campaign is mostly there to tell a story, slowly teach you about every aspect of the game, and generally prepare you for greater challenges ahead.   There's TONS to do here... one of those games you can get hundreds of hours out of.\n\nAnd that time is well spent.  This overall is just a very fun, deep, complex strategy game like no other, with so many possibilities.   If you're up for a strategy game that really does something NEW and different, something that's just darned fun while having the potential for great challenge.... this is the game to get.   Oh, and consider grabbing Creeper World, while you're at it, if you dont already have that.  It's a fantastic game too.\n\nDefinitely recommending this game very highly.", "timestamp_created": 1475818751, "timestamp_updated": 1475819479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665073", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25896524": {"recommendationid": "25896524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972363323", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476170660}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect sequel to the creeper world series.

Buy it.\n\nThere is no Farbor mission for the campaign so you can turtle as slowly as you wish. It will take you 6 to 9 minutes to get used to particles incread of creep if you are comming from CW3 (Creeper World 3). They also say \"redacted\" space a lot which triggers me because it seems like a misuse of the word redacted but hey whatever. They needed a word and they chose one. You can create your own ships and even play them in the campagin though I don't think you can progress the campagin unless you play their ships at least once. Campaign is good and has several references to Knuckle Cracker's earlier games. The campaign experience is enriching if you have played CW3 but you can still follow along if you have never played any of their earlier games. The game is playable, and I have not found any game breaking bugs but there are things I am not sure you would call bugs but might likely get patched. For example, In the ship editor, and under hul editing, you can remove the hull of your ship underneath a placed module. It will highlight the module in red when you apply but it just strikes me as something they will eventially change it so you are unable to remove the hull under a module. Who knows though. Another thing with the editor is you can name your ship in addition to naming your filename. When you create a new ship you are unable to change the filename with the ingame editor. You have to try playing a map with a sandbox fleet and select the file and save it as a new filename. Then you can exit out of this and go back into the editor and delete the one with the filename you don't like. I have gotten off into the weeds now. If you have read this far congradulations you are part of the solution when it comes to fighting illiteracy. Sadly many people in America and many western countries have never even read a book.

I absolutely loved Creeper World and Creeper World 3-- I bought the first game as a downloadable Flash game, and then jumped at CW3 when I saw it on Steam. If CW1 and CW2 were offered on Steam, I would buy them (CW1 again). The amount of content in CW3 was just amazing.\n\nThe ideas behind PFE are a variation on the innovative CW game mechanics-- a procedurally generated enemy; game play where enemy behavior is emergent from the way you play. The rules are exceedingly simple, but the resultant behavior of the creep or particulate is really interesting.\n\nUnlike the CW series though (and especially CW3) the amount of game systems/content here is far below what I've come to expect from Knuckle Cracker.\n\nOther reviews have inspired me to add: CW included a creep depth mechanic and weapons that took advantage of that depth (Morters), there is no such depth mechanic in PFE. CW included anti creep and multiple bases and power sources could expand substantially. There is no such depth in weaponry or power sources in PFE. CW offered Titans, which were game changing. PFE offers no equivalent.\n\nAs someone else noted, the tooltips and explanation of various ship modules is almost non-existant. The ship building could have been incorporated into the game play to add some really interesting gameplay opportunities-- the shipbuilding could have even been offered in the same way that map sharing is offered. The amount of additional content (a la extra missions in CW3) is virtually non-existant (by comparison.)\n\nAs a simple idea: Create a point limit on the ships used in the campaign for each slot, and certain module requirements-- then filter the online database for ships that meet the point limit and module requirement-- then display options to the players of pre-made ships that they can select from-- or build your own.\n\nAnd I'm sure there are still yet other ideas that would have made the game way more interesting and compelling.\n\nStory has never been Virgil's strong suit, and yet PFE falls down more so than either CW2 or CW3. [spoiler]Instead, 16 missions with a storyline that is a variation of the rest of the CW world mythos-- A storyline that makes me think of \"The Matrix\" in space (or the SyFy series, Battlestar Gallactica.) \"All of this has happened before, and all of it will happen again.\" Only the very existance of the particulate breaks the cycle, according to the story itself.[/spoiler]\n\nI'm not totally against Knuckle Cracker, and while I would be more cautious next time I would still likely buy the next game... but I think the developer needs to remember to give care and feeding to that which earned the initial glowing reviews of Creeper World and put in the same kind of effort that went into CW2 and CW3.\n\n[b]Final verdict[/b]: Wait until the game is on sale.

In addition, there are nine standalone scenarios, a robust skirmish game mode with tons of options, and the ability to make and share missions. The interface could have been more efficient; as an example, the use of the mouse wheel to both rotate ships and zoom out means ships must be deselected before getting a larger view. Energy collected from various sources and mined from asteroids is used to construct a large variety of ships (which can be custom designed in the editor) and replenish their weapons supplies; ships must be near an energy mine to sustain an attack, or refueled mid-battle using tankers. This restriction results in more nuanced strategy than simply selecting all the ships and sending them towards the enemy.

I've played every single creeper world game and can say without a doubt that the gameplay in Particle Fleet is every bit what I expected it to be. \n\nIt is very hard to compare it to a game like creeper world 3, which had layers and layers of content, while on release Particle Fleet seems slightly lacking in that department. Particle fleet does have extra missions outside of the main story the same as creeper world 3, but creeper world's bonus content was massive, for better or worse.\nNot to say this is a bad thing, but it touches on another point about the game I'd like to touch on.\n\nThe story in Particle fleet is, without spoiling the epxerience, pleasing to anyone who has played the previous creeper world games, but ultimately left me wanting more, and hoping for the possibility of additional content to answer the many questions the game raises but leaves open.\n\nThe gameplay is really where the game shines, even if a lot of other features add to it (like the ship builder or mission editor). Quite a departure from the play style of creeper world, the game is less about ground control and maintaining an all around front line, and more about directed front line pushes. The enemy is no longer fluid in nature, and is more actively aggressive. The creep would roll over you if allowed, and demanded an all around defense of your controled area while being offensive. Particle Fleet plays similarly in some ways, but the particulate are harder to predict and wont hesitate to rush a weakness if they come across it, and unlike creeper world, where you would just push your front line close enough to an emitter to take it out, the particulate are not fond of the player getting in range of the emiter and often demands a large ammount of available firepower be dedicated to defending the laithe ships.\n\nOver all I would say creeper world 3 had the potential to be much more punishingly dificult at times in the story (specifically farbor), but Particle fleet still manages to present a satisfying challenge. \n4.5/5, story feels incomplete in the end, gameplay is a fantastic change of pace from creeper world, and while the extra content is lacking compared the the last game by knucklecracker, it is more than enough to be satisfactory and give hours upon hours of entertainment.", "timestamp_created": 1475449883, "timestamp_updated": 1475449883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25829988": {"recommendationid": "25829988", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966538784", "num_games_owned": 1251, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476744201}, "language": "english", "review": "Really, really fun, emergent gameplay.

I am buying it again to gift to a friend.  \n\nThis is a great game by a great indie developer.  It's hard to believe one guy made this.  The graphics may not be Call of Duty level, but that is the charm and joy of it.  The screenshots may look complex or overwhelming, but it is actually pretty easy to keep straight everything that is going on so don't let the screenshots discourage you.  The simpler graphics actually aid in keeping things clear and drives home my longing for games that aren't so damn visually busy.\n\nIt is hard to pin a current game type to  this game.  The best I can come up with would be a cross between an RTS and tower defence, but even that isn't entirely giving PF proper justice.  Most levels start with you defending your location from a continous onslaught of particles that are encroaching on your territory.  Energy management and proper placement of your ships and assets is key.  Thankfully, there is essentially no time limit to any mission giving you the option to either make it somewhat of a zen-like experience or a frantic speed-run competition.  I tend to play somewhere in the middle.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this enjoyable game.  Even after you beat the game it comes with a powerful random level generator, ship editor, and custom map editor with the option to mod elements of the game to create your own unique enemies and rules.\n\nDefinitely buy if you like any kind of strategy, tower defence, or RTS games.

If not, go ahead and try it out!\n\nIn addition, like the Creeper World games, Particle Fleet features a substantial custom level creator, complete with its own scripting system, which allows for the creation of some fairly elaborate levels, alongside a customizable random level generator. As such, there's tons of replay value, and there will be even more as the community begins to make more levels.\n\nThe two weak points to me are really more nitpicking than anything. In the story mode, the grammar used by characters can be a little...off, sometimes. Nothing major, but it can be noticeable if you're the type to pick up on that. The other minor issue is that the music, while great and suitably epic feeling, tends to loop often enough to be noticeable.

What is so special about a simple game about some space ooze? It is more than that. This is the 4th installment of a series of games, each better than the last. One person putting out a game and not ignoring it after it's release. One guy refusing to take my money before it is in stores. No early access, no pay before you see what your getting.

You should buy those as well, but not needed to enjoy the game.\n\n- A fully working random map generator with user options enhancing the replay value indefinitely.\n\n- A ship editor, you can make a ship from scratch, or many and even share them within the game.\n\n- A map editor, also allowing you to share with others.\n\n- Did I mention a devoper that isn't just grabbing your money and leaving for Timbuktu?\n\n\n\nSo here are the cons-\n\n- The ship editor in general is pro, but also a con. It is clumbsy, it has no tool tips (what the heck does a port do vs a laser?) The deveoper has stated he plans to add that in a post release patch. Experimentaion will answer many of those questions. You can copy and paste from an old ship, but I still haven't figured out how to do that. I would say a complete rework of the ship editor is in order, but needless to say, it is adaquet for the game.\n\n-Although some have pointed out some bugs, I have yet to run into any that are game breaking. While I put that under the cons, it is really a pro.\n\n\n\nIn all fairness, this game is worth the full price, it is simple to learn, but difficult to master.

Got this one for free (press) because the dev is an amazing person that's very personal to his fans and this game. If you already loved CWIII then this is a no brainer to get. There's only improvements that I've seen so far. (Apart from one thing, which I might've not found yet, which is the massive gameplay mode where you collect things and you take back planets from the Creeper. I hope something like that is in here too.)\n\nFor those who have NEVER played Creeper World, I don't recommend playing this one before playing Creeper World III. CWIII is just so much fun so get them both. Play CWIII first so you don't go back in time with the game mechanics because a lot has changed since then. Both these games will keep you busy for HOURS if not DAYS.\n\nThis game has been a long time in the making and rightfully so, you can find dev log vids here from the dev himself about PFE's progress: https://www.youtube.com/user/knucracker\n\nPFE is for its type of game a step ahead of CWIII while CWIII was already a cult classic and named the best of its kind.\n\n\nThe setbacks are what I mentioned before, if I find any other things I will list them here.\n\nIf you had issues with CWIII because of its repetivity in music, PFE has better music and more variety.

If you're already a fan of Knuckle Cracker games, you'll feel right at home, without feeling like you're playing the same game again.  If you are new, it's time to get started!\n\n\nAdded Oct 3, 2016:\nSo I've been playing more.. I usually try to do a mission or two per day off, and I feel like that's a good pace to play at.\n\nI really love this game, and I think it has enough strategy and depth to keep me thinking, without being so complex that I lose track of things or find myself getting overwhelmed with features.\n\nThe main game features a campaign with a number of scenarios that you must play in order.  If you're interested in the story, it will be slowly revealed over the course of these missions.  As you progress, you'll obtain more ships, 'omni' which are used to claim land for energy production, and new abilities.. such as being able to assign your 'amp gems' to overall buffs that increase your movement speed, energy efficiency, or add cannons and 'struc' walls to your stationary energy mines for defense, plus a lot more.\n\nAlso, as you gain new abilities and expand your arsenal, the enemies will unveil new tricks of their sleeves.  It'd probably be best to leave much of this unspoiled, but I'll just say that simple floating red particles aren't your only concern, they're just kind of the main staple of the enemy forces later on.\n\nOne of the coolest features, in my opinion, is revealed just a short time into the campaign.. friendly particle emitters, and the means to direct them.  These friendly particles can help you 'mire' land (the term for claiming the land, turning it blue, so it produces energy for you) and unmire the enemy land, harm enemy 'struc' walls and particles, give enemy weapons something to shoot at other than your ships, or even just bolster up your fleet from behind with a constant stream of good particles to help your fighting ships in combat.\n\nAnother amazing feature is that the ships are made up of little grid-shaped pieces.  These pieces can be structural/defensive blocks, weapons, engines etc, and being hit by something will destroy these pieces.  Taking some structural damage will leave the vital parts functional, but vulnerable.. if the weapons or engines get hit directly, they'll be destroyed, and if the main 'core' of the ship gets hit, that ship will explode and need to reassemble it from scratch.  If your ship is within range of an energy source, however, it will simply use some of your energy to repair itself.\n\nBecause of the way these ships are designed, you can use the in-game editor to create your own.  I haven't tested this feature much, but I believe user-made ships are restricted to non-campaign modes, such as user-created levels, and the randomly generated maps in the combat simulator.  I believe you CAN use these custom ships on campaign missions, but it will be in a sandbox mode, and only works on missions you have already beaten previously with the ships that are provided in the standard campaign mode.\n\nAnyway, I think this is my favorite Knuckle Cracker game.  I liked Creeper World 3 a lot, but eventually certain aspects of that game became too difficult for me, and it wasn't 100% my jam because it's kind of tower defense.  Particle Fleet feels a lot more like an RTS, the difficulty curve feels fair, and.. I just like it.  It's fun.

At first the game looked pretty basic and simplistic, but I soon found out that was far from correct.  Fast forward a few more years to Creeper World 3 (CW3) and I was stunned not just by the game itself, but by the community of map builders.  Virgil (the developer of the games) had introduced a scripting language to allow players to create practically anything they could imagine within the world.\n\nSo, why do I even mention the past?  When Virgil announced the new game, Particle Fleet (PF), which is in the CW universe but with a different mechanic for playing I was quite excited.  I had discovered a developer who not only made highly enjoyable games (CW3 is one of my highest number of hours played), but was also incredibly connected to the community.  He is constantly listening to the fans of his games and does a great job of responding to bugs but also to new ideas.  Now, I'm just an average player who doesn't create maps for others to play (I tried once and I found out I sucked creating them), but I do play a lot of them and have been fairly active on the boards.  Thus I was surprised and more than a little excited to be given the opportunity to play a preview copy of the new game.  This is my review of what I've seen so far.\n\nMuch like CW3, the base game itself is quite fun.  There are a series of \"tutorial\" maps that ramp up in difficulty to introduce new game mechanics but are also fun in themselves.  The game mechanics are extremely fluid and intuitive.  It's very easy to pick up the basics of how to play the game.\n\nWhere PF truly shines is in the tactical area.  Once you get past the basic maps, there are a myriad of ways to proceed in each battle and your tactics will determine whether or not you succeed.  Sometimes you\u2019ll want to use an overwhelming force to attach an enemy.  Sometimes you\u2019ll want to divide your forces to distract the enemy AI.  Sometimes you\u2019ll want to set up a mobile strike force to get in and get out to advance the overall cause.  Sometimes you\u2019ll even want to send in a ship on a suicide run (all ships are robotic drones\u2026no humans killed) to clear out some of the enemy for other ships to have space to operate.  At any given time you\u2019ll need to evaluate the overall battle and determine the best tactics for the given situation. Sometimes, you\u2019ll be wrong and will have to try to regroup to save the day.\n\nAs far as the AI goes, this game is a big step up from the CW games.  The enemy in CW, while difficult to beat, is ultimately a mindless blob.  The enemy in PF has come quite a ways from that.  For every ship you have, the enemy can create the opposite to attack you with.  The enemy ships will also probe your defenses, running away if they can\u2019t get through.  Overall it seems like the enemy is much smarter in this game and that definitely makes for a more challenging test of your skill.\n\nHowever, as fun as the game is right now, I also know that it will get 100 times better in the months to come.  Much like in CW3, Virgil has added a scripting language to PF to allow the players to create amazing maps.  We are still in the early versions of what will come out, but already there are some new ideas from players.  It is the player created maps that extend the life of a game like PF to a huge number of hours.  If the only thing you got were the base game, it\u2019d be fun but over too quick.  With the map exchange there are literally countless possibilities for new maps.\n\nAnother addition in PF that is really neat is that there is not only a map editor like in CW3, but there is also a ship editor.  The map makers (or even just a regular player) can create their own ships to use in the base game or in maps that are created.\n\nAlso like CW, there is a procedurally generated map maker.  You can easily create a map to play on the fly and then share it with other players if it is fun.  With the number of variables that you can control, the possible number of maps is, practically speaking, limitless.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys playing a fun, tactical game.  The graphics are relatively simplistic, but don\u2019t let that turn you off.  You\u2019ll quickly forget about the graphics as you get sucked into yet another great KnuckleCracker game!\n\nAs a final note, I should mention that I was given the preview key.  However, I was going to buy the game regardless so just ended up buying a copy for my brother since I really like to support Indie developers like Virgil.  With as many hours as I put into CW3, and as many as I\u2019ve already put into PF, I\u2019m quite happy to say that it\u2019s well worth the money!", "timestamp_created": 1475190164, "timestamp_updated": 1480197690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25773121": {"recommendationid": "25773121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986044125", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503153697}, "language": "english", "review": "An awesome Game by an awesome developer.

A campaign which will introduce you to all the game concepts with a great difficulty curve and storyline which will take you 10-15 hours to complete. Some maps from alpha stages of the game, many featured on the regular videos posted during development, ranging from easy to hard which will give you another 10 hours of gameplay. Mission and ship editors for those who want to get into this and access to maps uploaded by other players, giving infinite possibilities to what you may find. The last game from Knuckle Cracker, Creeper World 3, currently features more than 30000 maps created by users which can be easily sorted using a variety of filters, including some which introduced completely new game modes and where I have spend more than 200 hours, at least half of these playing modes initially never intended by the developer! So far even pre release there are already over 50 user created maps available, and having played a couple of dozen I can say there are already at least a couple of gems in there. And if that is not enough a random mission generator, where you can tweak dozens of different variables to get a customized experience, or just hit \"random everything\" and go with a completely random map, which can be anything from a walk in the park to almost impossible to beat.\n\nDisclaimer: Since I\u00b4m a big fan of the other Knuckle Cracker games I have been eagerly anticipating the release of this game and following its development through the regularly posted videos and posts on their website.

A nice RTS, in the mold of previous games from the same developer, but different enough that you won't feel you've paid twice for the same product. \n\nIf you were a fan of Creeper World (any one of the 3), you may be disappointed. There is no Creeper in this game. \"Wot?\", I hear you say, \"A Knuckle Cracker game with no Creeper? That's an abomination!\"\n\nMaybe so. But remember there was not always Creeper, and maybe there will not be always Creeper - in the CW3 story, there were references to other, long-forgotten races, the Ticon and the Seloi. Maybe they too have stories. Maybe there was (or will be, or always has been) things that were not Creeper and that were hostile. Maybe they were not explicitly hostile - after all, if we need a canoe, are we explicitly hostile to the entities that occupied the ecosystem of that tree that we need for the canoe?\n\nOK, OK, you aren't reading this to get a lesson in philosophy or time-travel. You want to know about Particle Fleet. So let me see... what can I tell you? I've been play-testing Creeper World Particle Fleet: Emergence for more than 2 years now. Hence the reason I have a free copy. \n\nIt's definitely a Knuckle Cracker game, with all the elements of the previous games I love. Mort of a Tower Defense and Real-Time strategy game mixed in together. There's an enemy (the particulate, Duh!) with a few variants, such as Stunners, Struct, which is a static barrier, Emergent which is a mindless moving entity that is derived based on terrain dominance. Then there's an artificial Intelligence - and that, we'll have to wait and see where the game and the map makers take up. Don't be surprised if the Particles can build ships similar to yours and attack you in retaliation. \n\nNot player vs player, but definitely a more variable and mobile opponent than what Creeper were.\n\nGraphics? Well, you've never bought a KC game for it's graphics, unless you are a hard-core fan of retro graphics, in which case nothing has changed.\n\nIn Particle Fleet, you can, as in previous games, make your own maps, either using the menu-driven \"Simulacrum\" (now with 50,000 variables!*), or by hand-crafting them in the map editor. In both cases, if you finally have a mp you like, you can submit it to the community Exchange for other players to play and to tell you how brilliant a map maker you are. \n\nBut there's more! You can also make your own ships. If you don't like the weapons choices, simply chose Sandbox mode on any map, include a few ships of your own design, or one from a ship-maker you admire and play to your heart's content. Of course, if you play in Sandbox mode, your time is scored differently that if you play with the same fleet as everyone else. You can, of course upload a map with custom ships and have everyone play with your favorite ships. \n\n* I exaggerated a tad.", "timestamp_created": 1475183212, "timestamp_updated": 1475183212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25771994": {"recommendationid": "25771994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001413615", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510080347}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1475182687, "timestamp_updated": 1475182777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25771894": {"recommendationid": "25771894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067289916", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 34483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1052, "last_played": 1516058395}, "language": "english", "review": "As a long-term Knuckle Cracker fan, I couldn't wait for this game to be released.

For this review, despite this game being set in the mythos of the \"Creeper World\" universe, I will avoid all possible parallels or comparisons to \"Creeper World\".\n\nParticle Fleet: Emergence is a Top Down Real Time Strategy game, where the idea is you have a fleet of ships which fight a seemingly neverending enemy. Each story mission introduces a new ship or way for you to fight the Particulate, whilst at the same time adding a new threat for you to face.\n\nEvery mission starts with a bit of the story with the gameplay paused. This gives you time to digest the map, pick a spot to spawn your Command HQ ship (A requirement for you to recieve and produce energy) and then unpause to continue planning and strategising in real time. You have a small menu in the top left of Ships which you can deploy, which are then built by the amount of Energy you have or are producing. Often this means that you will start a mission deploying your Command HQ Ship along with a Cruiser to fight off a small number of the Particulate whilst the Command HQ captures Energy Points and other goodies in your chosen starting area.\n\nMaps come with both 'Space' and 'Land'. The space is for your ships and the Particulate to roam around, attacking each other. Land will be fought between you and the Particulate in a battle called 'Mire'. You will have \"Omni\" reactors, which when deployed will capture land and produce more Energy for you. Later in the game, these can be upgraded to become turrets and expand your strategic options.\n\nEverything nice about this game boils down to one thing, however; Difficulty. The game is not difficult. A new player like myself can blitz the campaign missions without even fearing losing. Every mission I started, I completed in the first go. Even in the climax stages where the Particulate have some pretty heavy weapons to fight back at you, and had the capacity to overwhelm at stages, I never felt like I was going to lose a level. Two of the main reasons for this, is as thus;\n1) If your Command HQ suffers damage, it will blink out of existence for 15 seconds until you spawn it again. All this does is stop your production of Energy. If you have an ample, fully powered fleet fighting, these 15 seconds are a mere inconvenience. \n2) The Particulate itself, whilst advertised and billed as a 'Neverending, Relentless, Overwhelming, Unstoppable' Enemy, are in fact Endable, Not Very Relentless, Underwhelming, and Stoppable. The moment you get any momentum going, the Particulate is no threat. You will just move from spawner to spawner and eliminate. Begging the question of why this enemy is billed as 'Neverending, Relentless, Overwhelming, Unstoppable' when the job at hand in each level is to wipe them out. \n\nIf there is a difficulty changer, then my apologies and I evidently needed to turn it up a little.\n\nThere is a story as you go through the missions, but it's uninteresting, unengaging. The plot twists mean nothing and elicite no emotional response. Though the biggest gripe with the story is the fact it slowly clicks onto your screen one character at a time, meaning often you feel more compelled to skip through out of the fact you will read faster than the speed the text appears.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed. It was fun. Gave a much needed break to the games I often play. If anything, I would want the threat of the enemy changed. Just so that you do feel as though you are against this enemy who will annihilate you if given half a chance.\n\n7/10.

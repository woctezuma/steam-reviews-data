Und sie ist, wie einige ihrer Vorfahren, psychisch nicht immer ganz stabil. Eines sch\u00f6nen Tages erscheint ihr der Familiengeist, der schon einige aus der Familie in den Wahnsinn getrieben hat und offenbart ihr, da\u00df sie ein Medium sei und ihn nun an den Hacken habe, denn es gilt, anderen Geistern, die in der Zwischenwelt h\u00e4ngengeblieben sind, zu helfen. Nicht gerade rosige Aussichten f\u00fcr Rosa.\n\nDas Gameplay ist ganz typisches Point-and-Click. Auf Screens begutachten wir Gegenst\u00e4nde, sammeln sie auf und packen sie in unser Inventar und reden vor allem mit allen m\u00f6glichen und unm\u00f6glichen NPCs. Dabei funktioniert das Game im Kern wie eine Detektivgeschichte. Hierf\u00fcr haben wir unser Notizbuch, in dem wir einzelne Hinweise miteinander kombinieren k\u00f6nnen und so zu neuen Schlu\u00dffolgerungen gelangen k\u00f6nnen. \n\nDie recht lineare Geschichte entfaltet sich dramaturgisch sinnvoll und gekonnt und bleibt durch liebenswerte oder nervige Charakterzeichnungen stets spannend. Erstaunlich, da\u00df das Spiel einen schmalen Grad zwischen Ironie und Ernst so zielsicher trifft. Mit Witz und Sarkasmus werden auch sehr ernste und bittere Themen behandelt, ohne, da\u00df sich das Spiel je l\u00e4cherlich \u00fcber diese Themen macht.  \n\nDie Grafik und Stilistik erinnert entfernt an alte LucasArts Titel. Alles ist bewu\u00dft pixelig, reduziert und retro. Dadurch entsteht ein nostalgischer Charme, der viel zum Spielspa\u00df beitr\u00e4gt, allerdings auch dazu f\u00fchrt, da\u00df man das Spiel am besten in einem kleinen Fenster zockt. Die (englische) Synchronisation ist gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils stark, die Charaktere sind teils durchaus patzig und \u00fcbelgelaunt und die Sprecher treffen die einzelnen Haltungen ad\u00e4quat. Unverst\u00e4ndlich allerdings, da\u00df die Aufnahmen technisch nicht gerade ausgefeilt daherkommen. Ein Pop-schutz w\u00e4re eine durchaus sinnvolle Investition gewesen. \n\nEin Kritikpunkt mag die L\u00e4nge des Spiels sein. In nur zwei Stunden kann man durch sein. Allerdings waren die Blackwell-Spiele stets als Spieleserie ausgelegt und so kann man die verschiedenen Blackwell-Titel auch insgesamt als ein gro\u00dfes Episoden-Adventure verstehen.\n\nEin wenig schade ist hingegen, da\u00df die Interaktionsm\u00f6glichkeiten und Adventure-Elemente geringer ausfallen als in den Vorg\u00e4ngern. Oft klickt man sich nur durch automatisch ablaufende Story-Parts, die zwar gut geschrieben sind, aber einen auch hin und wieder das Gef\u00fchl geben, eher in einer Visual Novel zu sein denn in einem Adventure.\n\nTolle Figuren, intelligente Geschichte, viel Witz, ohne albern zu sein. Ein ohne Frage empfehlenswertes kleines Spiel der alten Schule.\n\nTechnischer Tip: Wer beim Starten einen Blackscreen hat, einfach in den Startoptionen \"--setup\" eintragen und dann im Setup den Grafiktreiber \u00e4ndern.\n\n[h1]Wertung:[/h1]\n8/10 Atmosph\u00e4re\n8/10 Story\n7/10 Grafik\n7/10 Sound\n7/10 Spielmechanik\n7/10 Balancing\n7/10 Spielspass\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nAller guten Dinge sind drei.\n\n[h1][b]7/10 Gesamtwertung", "timestamp_created": 1512472851, "timestamp_updated": 1512472851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37972268": {"recommendationid": "37972268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052510862", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512120045}, "language": "italian", "review": "Ancora un'altra avventura della serie veramente interessante... anzi, forse per ora la pi\u00f9 interessante sebbene le meccaniche sono sempre le stesse.

Overall, if you liked the previous installments, you will probably like this one even more.\n\nProduction quality has improved a bit. The pixel art has noticeably stepped up its quality. It gives a greater sense of depth with better geometry and shading. Audio quality is still bad, getting to the point where it feels as though they may have actually recorded actors over the phone.  It gets worse though, now the background music has been over compressed.  White noise behind the music pops in and out as the volume of the music changes. Unless you are an audiophile, that particular point will not be a deal breaker.  Voice acting from the main two actors is still pretty strange.  Multiple occasions where Rosangela was supposed to sound awkward, come off as dryly read lines.  It really is unfortunate the actress could not put more into matching her voice to the dialogue.  Joey still sounds like he is talking into a tin can.\n\nThe story is speeding up now.  Storylines from the previous two games get tied up nicely while at the same time new plots are teased.  This is a marked improvement over the preceding games that only established the world, this time around the story tests what implications of being in such a world can mean. Moreover, there is now an establishing theme linking alcohol and cigarettes to death. Nothing over stated, this is not propaganda but a simple plot cues that setup for foreshadowing.  Characters that get drunk are marked for death while characters with a particular last name (related to alcohol) are doing the marking. I know its basic, but little things like that do make for a better story.\n\nBlackwell Convergence is a step up in a quality and story over its predecessors. While the audio is still lacking, the game still satisfies and justifies a recommendation.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503658043, "timestamp_updated": 1503658043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34331767": {"recommendationid": "34331767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034068809", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503072949}, "language": "spanish", "review": "If you like point & click adventures, you will like this series.", "timestamp_created": 1503072871, "timestamp_updated": 1503072871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34265860": {"recommendationid": "34265860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243246572", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502829337}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\"Joguei a s\u00e9rie Blackwell extasiado, para ser sincero.

highly recommended if you're looking for good quest games.\n\nAlthough being quest series, the Blackwell series isn't difficult comparing to other games in that genre as there aren't logic puzzles to solve. However, the games don't suffer from one flaw that exists in many quests, and that is excessive use of items. In some quest games you usually stack up a lot of items and end up trying every combination of item and something clickable on the screen until you find that absurd combination that makes you progress. The Blackwell series doesn't have that flaw as items aren't the main part of the game. Also, when places become irrelevant you can't access them anymore, which also prevents having to go back and try to find something useful in every place that you've been through at the endgame.\n\nThe progression in the game is made by combining the abilities of Rosa (or Lauren in Blackwell Unbound) and Joey, which complete each other. Joey can enter locked rooms but cannot interact with anything, and Rosa can do the opposite. Only by combining their abilities you will make progress. There's also a built in search engine inside a game in which you have to use in order to progress, which makes you feel that you're doing detective work and not just trying to figure out how to use your inventory.\n\nThe plot becomes \"bigger\" in each episode and ends with a grand finale in Blackwell Epiphany, so you don't feel like you're doing that same thing in each game.\n\nI really enjoyed the series and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500017077, "timestamp_updated": 1500017077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803",

Set in New York this retro-style point-and-click will haunt you for a bit.\n\nWith much more storylines and personas this is the best in the series yet. Voice acting is still on the very fine level that was a trademark of the two previous games.\n\nMature, at times witty, and well-balanced the game is another real gem for adventure game aficionados. Graphics and music are somewhat smoother and nicer than before; as always they enhance the overall gameplay atmosphere.

Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.\n\nYou play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.\nRosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.\n\nJoey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.\n\nA very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.\n\nThe Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:\n\n1. The Blackwell Legacy\n2. Blackwell Unbound\n3. Blackwell Convergence\n4. Blackwell Deception\n5. Blackwell Epiphany\n\nBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.", "timestamp_created": 1454844945, "timestamp_updated": 1454844945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20495343": {"recommendationid": "20495343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128239804", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428633528}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta tercera entrega de la saga Blackwell sigue en la l\u00ednea de sus antecesoras.

However, this remains just as satisfying visually as the prior two iterations; Wadjet Eye really knows how to pick 'em. As a midpoint for the Blackwell games, most of the plot feels like tying up loose ends more than casting out or dealing with many new ones, though there are a few new ghosts and their stories to be told.\n\nAlso in line with the prior Blackwell games, Convergence is a solid experience through and through.

In this third installment you get much of the same as Blackwell Unbound. Here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.\n\nPro's: The storyline is evolving into a rather interesting and mysterious one. Rosa and Joeys relationship is more defined, which allows for better interaction between the two characters, much like Lauren and Joey from the second game. The puzzles have become much more fun, even for someone like me that is used to the \"Use banana with three headed monkey\", I am really starting to get used to this puzzle style and believe that the puzzle style is the right one for this type of game. I also enjoyed the music and the length much more in this game from the previous two.\n\nCon's: I still hate the art. Sorry, I just don't like it. The consistancy between the games on a number of aspects is not good. On the one hand some of the changes are good, but some of them are not and you have to get used to a new style every time.\n\nI've since changed Blackwell Legacy from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. The first game still lacks in many aspects, but it sets everything up and the series as a whole up to this point is at least a 7.8/10 in my book (and that is saying something because this doesn't fit my conventional style). And as I have said before, if you love mystery and clue finding then this series is one of the best out there, making it a must buy.

Convergence drags us further into the legacy of Blackwell family, shedding some light on the nature of their responsibilities, raising many more questions that we will chase after in later installments. The more I play these games, the more I sink into Rosa's shoes, leaving me with a feeling of uneasiness and even suspicion for our age old companions.\n\nSeveral months after [i]the Blackwell Legacy[/i], we learn that Rosa did quit her small book review job and desperately tries to publish a \"fiction\" novel that tells of her experience about her first case: \"The Devil and the Deacon\". Frustrating enough, fiction novels are not exactly on great demand. While pursuing a career as a blossoming author, she keeps investigating several cases with Joey, following Lauren's footsteps. After a fairly basic case, she attends a gallery opening as she promised to her neighbor and only living friend, Nishanthi Sharma. The incidents to follow this fairly generic social event will complicate Rosa's life within only a five days period. She is to meet an old adversary, pursue a murderer, rub shoulders with her aunt's circles and encounter a mysterious madam who asks her help in turmoil.\n\nI'd like to define the first game as mystery that tips its hat to folklore, and the second was basically a noir movie with supernatural elements. This third one, however is surreal in tone, and philosophically inclined to dabble with notions as responsibility, family, trust, cause and consequence. Nearing the end of game, there is a whole part weaved with metaphors and symbolic apparitions only. I felt a great sense of respect towards Wadget Eye Games and their golden boy Dave Gilbert when they used Joseph Mitchell, legendary journalist and an expert on human soul in [i]Blackwell Unbound[/i]. In this game, they add Joe Gould, namely Professor Seagull to the equation and bring in the big term that shall dominate the storyline from now on: the collective unconscious! This installment was a downright early Christmas present for nerds like me, who are greatly interested in social sciences.\n\nWhen we take this second glance on Rosa, we are quick to realize that she is more experienced now. She stands her ground and tries her best to get the job done. She is still an odd duck, but more open to interaction and takes steps on either bonding with other people, or at least persisting on what is right. Her dynamic with Joey is becoming better in synchronicity as a gradual process. But it is safe to assume that she is not there yet. I couldn't believe my eyes when I realized that she was even trying to make actual jokes, different from her passive aggressive sarcasm that we encountered in the Legacy! Rosa is becoming a strong female character, just as Lauren was, with personal standing, a sense of justice and an in-depth personality as she grows up. With her cheesy grin, baggy clothes and nerdy glasses, she is a refreshing figure compared to the sexually exaggerated female protagonists that we encounter nowadays. This is a good example of character development.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, it is evident that everything is improved. Graphics are prettier, and the atmosphere is more carefully arranged to establish an eerie setting, strengthened with beautiful soundtrack. Adding clues sequence is completely removed from the game, yet we are encouraged to use technology more to progress during case investigation. We use Rosa's computer to find an address, get into people's mail, and gather information and so on. Joey hasn't been very effective in this game, but he is still a controllable character with the option of consultation.\n\nThis series is like a symphony; starting sleepy, speeding to raise suspense and dive into a crescendo. What next? Only the fourth game will tell. At this point, I insist. Please give this game a chance, if you enjoy adventure games. Everything will become personal so fast, you will wonder when that happened.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1439977898, "timestamp_updated": 1456868124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764580", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17361351": {"recommendationid": "17361351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104350086", "num_games_owned": 886, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499404389}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderfully put together point and click adventure that serves as a great sequel to Blackwell Legacy and follows up heavily on certain elements from Unbound", "timestamp_created": 1438576122, "timestamp_updated": 1438576353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17091791": {"recommendationid": "17091791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006541362", "num_games_owned": 2139, "num_reviews": 220, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437139555}, "language": "english", "review": "Blackwell Convergence is the third chapter of the titular series where you'll once again control Rosangela and Joey as they investigate several cases involving ghosts: you'll soon realize these cases are bigger than what they seem and are actually tied to events in the previous games.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n\n-the pixelated graphics are beautiful and detailed with lots of improvements over the previous games\n\n-fully voice acted, the voice actors do a really good job this time\n\n-lovely soundtrack\n\n-interesting story with important ties to the events of the series\n\n-Rosa and Joey still are really well crafted characters\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n-as most games of the series it's pretty short\n\n-puzzles are, for the most part, very straightforward and quite easy\n\n-having to continuously go back to the computer in your apartment to look up people/locations is awkward\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483136257\n\nBlackwell Convergence provides an enjoyable experience thanks to the great storyline, a staple of the series, and its strong characters while showing great improvements in its graphics and overall production values.

It also merges the plotlines of both games, serving as the first true sequel in the series.  Overall it's one of the stronger titles in the series, even if its enjoyment is more reliant on having played the previous titles.\n\nAs with the first two games, Blackwell Convergence brings the old Point-and-Click adventure genre into the modern era, retaining the same method of gameplay without bringing along all the pointless frustrations that so many early examples fell afoul of.  There are no completely counterintuitive things you need to do, no series of \"correct\" actions which could only ever make sense within the confines of an Adventure Game (the so-called \"Adventure Game Logic\").  By and large the puzzles within the game are all a matter of logical examination and critical thinking.\n\nThe game also brings along most of the improvements from the previous games, particularly the ability to control Joey or Rosa directly, along with the Notes screen, tracking clues in your current investigation path.  There's also the text-entry lookup feature from Unbound, this time on Rosa's computer instead of Lauren's phonebook.  It's an interesting mechanic with a lot of flexibility, one that makes you feel a bit more involved in the game. Sadly, one of the most innovative features of the Blackwell series is absent in this game: the ability to compare clues on the Notes screen to form new conclusions.  While its absence doesn't directly interfere with the game, there was an undeniable enjoyment factor from the mechanic in the previous games.\n\nIn terms of plot, Blackwell Convergence has a wonderfully put together one, combining themes from Blackwell Unbound with character development from Blackwell Legacy.  Rosa and Joey's relationship has clearly advanced, with Rosa maturing a bit, though not losing much of her general prickliness and social awkwardness.  She's also more comfortable with Joey, and in return Joey with her, even being supportive and protective of her.  This relationship helps hold together the plot, beginning as a rather conventional forlorn ghost story and ending as something far more complicated.  Complicated, and yet with a distinct (and satisfying) beginning, middle, and end.  By the end of the game the mysteries put forth are all answered in a fairly satisfying way; the implications of those things, not so much.  Much like the previous game, the plot here doesn't provide solid answers to a lot of the core questions that the previous games raised, but it does hint at what they are.  Perfectly fair in an episodic title like this, though I won't lie, it does leave me wanting more pretty bad.\n\nUltimately, I think that's not a bad way to describe Blackwell Convergence: a great entry in the series that still left me wanting more, in a good way.  It was wonderful to connect with Rosa and Joey again, see them interact on a much more comfortable level, and progress through a satisfying series of mysteries while they do it.

The combining of clues to form new conclusions mechanic is missing (and missed), but the interface is a hybrid of the past two games with clues appearing in the notebook and the search function (changed from the phonebook to the internet) prompting a typed word. Despite these rather large changes, the commentary is less robust than in the previous two games. No explanation is given for more than one recasting, but the removal of a key element of the series is touched upon.

Another solid title of ghost-helping, albeit with removed Notebook combination feature that was making it more unique.\n\nThe game still runs on quite old adventure engine, even if it's updated. It still means that you may encounter small glitches, though... I don't remember any, unlike Blackwell Legacy. The engine still has this anti-aliasing applied to scaled sprites, ruining pixel-art somewhat, but scaling is rarely used in this part. Pressing Shift+Tab, commonly used for Steam Overlay, will make the game to instaskip all the dialogues, you can fix it by just pressing Tab. No real support for widescreen, but at least image isn't stretched.\n\nThe game has quite a modern game design to it, as you can't die or get stuck in a dead end because you didn't pick some item hour ago. The game keeps ability to switch between Rosa and Joey (sidekick ghost who can only blow air). Ability to combine clues in notebook is gone completely this time around, which is shame, as it was unique part of it. Notebook is still there though. But it added investigative feature where you can search Internet (and mail), which means that you get to type things that you may figured out, great!\n\nPixel-art and animations are better than in Legacy, this time even backgrounds look top-notch. Animation for character portrait is missing though. The setting is taking on more of rainy and yellow color this time around and it keeps a bit of jazzy feel in music of Unbound but more modern, relaxing. Though, it feels more forgettable. I still think that soundtrack in Legacy was superior.\n\nAnd once again the game will start with quite a motion, this time with included short intro case, so you will have easier time starting playing than in Legacy. Then you are off to mostly wandering and chasing a mystery, maybe even saving some ghosts, getting your villian along the way, and a familiar one at that. The scope of a game feels larger and you will even get to explore moer unique locations and character. It does have one loose end that never got properly explained: why certain ghost babbles like another character sometimes. Yea, it's hinted how it got there, but never clearly explained. But yes, it's a little bit more on wandering side. The puzzles make sense by now fully and you getto type your clues in computer.\nAlso, Rosa trying to act more confidient and doing strange jokes is still cute.\n\nAnd yes, once again it comes with a commentary mode, great! Well, if forget that once again the focus is on voice acting. Also comes with extra voice acting bloober. Nothing as much of extra content as in Unbound.\n\nAnother solid adventure, another solid game which has it's own charm.

If you need a refresher, in the first game Rosa first meets her spirit guide Joey and begins her adventures as a medium. The second game steps back in time to Rosa's Aunt, and her encounters with the villain The Countess. As of the 3rd game, Rosa and Joey have been working together for some time and have become more accustomed to each other. You continue your adventure as a Medium/Detective, trying to help lost souls move on to the other side.\n\nBlackwell Convergence is a point and click adventure like the previous two games in the series. This game does take a bit of a departure from the notebook mechanic used during interrogations in the other games. While it is still present, it is used very sparingly. I would consider this a much more traditional point and click in that aspect. While I enjoyed the notebook feature as it was before, I wouldn't say that its absence took too much away from Blackwell Convergence. I think the main reason is because this is the tightest story of the three thusfar, with every event building on each other until the conclusion. I really enjoyed the story and dialog, and found myself taking my time more than usual just to hear everything.\n\nThe voice acting is on par with the second game, which is in what I would consider the good but not great category. Rosa's is much improved from the first game, and Joey's is on the same level it has been. The graphics have seen an improvement from game to game, and are now reminiscent of mid to late 90's 2D adventure games. The character portraits are very well done, but I would like to see a little more detail in the environments.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Blackwell Convergence for fans of point and click adventure games. It has the best story I have seen in the series so far. It is also probably the easiest, with no puzzles that are real head scratchers. The story leaves the door open for more games in the series, and I am looking forward to giving them a try.\n\nGrade: B+", "timestamp_created": 1410990661, "timestamp_updated": 1410990661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12093974": {"recommendationid": "12093974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012189101", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410677437}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Valoraci\u00f3n 5/10\n\n.- En menos de hora y media lo has acabado.", "timestamp_created": 1410677633, "timestamp_updated": 1410677633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12086171": {"recommendationid": "12086171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128259429", "num_games_owned": 691, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410706987}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Los juegos de esta saga son cortos y sencillos, pero con una historia muy currada y que se enlaza dentro de cada serie.

It puts the previous ones to shame in many aspects, including music, storyline and art -- especially the art. It's so lovely and expressive! The music is great and definitely affects the mood of the scenes. Heck, I spooked myself accidentally when one piece started playing.\n\nEven the puzzles/cases are more interesting, with every character playing some important part however tiny it is. (Everyone remember the first minor character in Blackwell Legacy and his not relevant part?) Granted, some of the solutions are harder to find within this point and click game. At least, for me they were. I had to look up a walkthrough for one, because it was hard to figure out what next step to take. This might deter certain people if they can't solve it in a fairly rapid manner, but I promise you, you'll be satisfied once you solve the puzzles/cases. I know I did, and that increased my enjoyment of this game. \n\nThe mechanics have also improved, and the animation as well. It's all very fluid. Kudos to the creators for being able to dish out a bit more money for the sake of the game, because it helped. A LOT! The voice-acting's improved too -- in the first game (and possibly the second one), you could literally hear mics crashing against the actors' breath or against something else. Here, there are no audio mistakes. It all sounds professionally done.\n\nI'd recommend to anyone interested in this series to just start with this game...BUT that's a bad move, because unfortunately this game also depends on many plot points that have been brought up in the previous two games. (Also easter eggs will feel juicier when you find them!) Part of the joy in this game is seeing all previously established details come to fruition in Blackwell Convergence. The story (if you care about this more) depends on having played the first two games, in my opinion. It makes it a stronger, and more fun, game to play.\n\nIf you just want to have fun and possibly seek out the first two after, then play this first.

What a charming point- & click game! Unlike Syberia, this game has very \"cool\" graphics as well as a story that's quite different. Essentially, you're in control of Rosa & joey; Rosa, who is a writer of the paranormal can see ghosts, and help them get out of their eternal limbo using Joey to properly communicate with them (you'll get more of the story when playing..), but essentially it's \"inspired\" the modern game \"Murdered: Soul Suspect\", so if you've played that, the concept's the same.\n\nVoice acting is stellar. Really good. It's sort of noticable at times that the voice actors knew that it was a video game, but emotions are in most cases very well expressed to the player, so I won't really make a big fuss out of it! This is a rather old game, so please keep in-mind that everything won't be perfect, but still.\n\nSome elements are really strange.. such as the menu system being crazy bad & unorganised. Perhaps there are ways to drop items, but I haven't found anything like that yet. But it's really a basic point- & click adventure game, and I can't really complain. It's just.. good! Fun and different. Tired of Call of Duty? Try this! It's definitely worth a go! But keep in-mind that the resolution seems to be 800x600 and there are no ways of actually controlling visual settings.

Also this is the first title where you may feel that it had an actual budget, though the improvements are seen mainly in the quality of the background graphics.\nFollowing the footsteps of Unbound, but yet again with the first game\u2019s protagonist, we partake in yet another set of ghost stories where the goal is to learn the spirits\u2019 woes and how to convince them to find peace with their deaths and move on to the afterlife.\nGameplay-wise Convergence is starting to veer back to the classic adventure genre, losing the clue-based puzzles and using item interaction instead. I have to admit, in my opinion it hurts the game\u2019s atmosphere and story, even though the creator was getting better and better in writing character stories for the ghost. This part was always the biggest selling point of the Blackwell series \u2013 the ghost and the life stories behind them, which were always more complex than anyone would think from a short indie game \u2013 and thankfully the game does not disappoint in this regard.\nAlso by this time the overall plot of the series is really starting to take form, which is really nice to make you feel you are playing a multi-part epic, but sadly hurts the individual cases somewhat as they all need to be tied into something instead of being completely separate from each other.\nOverall the game wasn\u2019t as a big step up from the previous title as Unbound, but it is still exciting enough to keep people interested in Blackwell.", "timestamp_created": 1405431670, "timestamp_updated": 1405431670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11140056": {"recommendationid": "11140056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109883351", "num_games_owned": 1543, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404850220}, "language": "english", "review": "Background: Played episodes 1&2 back to back with Convergence.

The characters are still retro but there's more colour and detail to everything. The 'Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)' formula continues to be a fun basis for an adventure but for the first time it felt like a pixel hunt and some sections are very wordy. Also it's hint heavy which drives the plot onwards but reduces the challenge.\n\nThe Good:\n* The upgraded visuals and interface over parts 1&2.\n* The plot is ideal and grows the overall story well.\n* Save interface is massively improved.\n* Voice acting is consistent and good throughout.\n* Charming twists and ideas early on but runs out of steam later on.\n\nThe Bad:\n* Feels a lot shorter and easier than the previous games.\n* The great notebook mechanic of 1&2 has been cut back.\n* Achievements give away plot points, don't read them.\n* Some locations only have plot items clickable.\n* Doesn't make use of Joey's ghost skills over the previous games. \n* Very few items to collect to further the plot.\n* Very heavy-handed hints drive the plot but make it too easy.\n* Long sections of speech that go nowhere useful.\n\nRecommended for: Fans of the first 2 games, you need to play them to understand the plot and characters in so sections.\n\nConclusion.\n6.5/10.

Again- the same antagonist does the exact same thing for the exact same reasons. *Sigh* We do learn a little bit more about her, but it is very little.

Also there is no use of the notepad gameplay, emulating deduction of facts and connection, which I really liked in the previous games.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nAdditional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first and second in the series (Blackwell Legacy and Blackwell Unbound), since this is an episodic sort of series.\n\nGameplay: We're back to Rosangela for this game. Honestly, this is the kind of improvement I was wanting to see. There weren't any \"puzzles\" in the traditional sense of adventure games, which made me more than happy. Rather, gameplay took more of a backseat approach in this game. The puzzles that were there didn't require any sort of intense abstraction of logic and generally made a great deal of sense. Definitely a great improvement over the previous two in the series. 8/10.\n\nStory: Oh man, things start getting real this game. With the last two games I felt like I could go for a week without playing the next in the series. This one... I dunno. Maybe a few days at most? Also, this is the game that finally got me to 100% go for Blackwell Epiphany, which is apparently the best. Nevertheless, this game really got the pacing of the story right, with plenty of tense, dramatic moments as well as some much needed comic relief. Things finally came together, and it's oh so good. 9/10.\n\nGraphics: Yet another art style change. Looking at the wikipedia page, I suppose this isn't all that surprising, but it's still kind of jarring seeing the art change so much. Apparently the last two games use the same artist (although yet another different artist), so at least for the review for Epiphany I won't have to bring it up again. Nevertheless, I really liked the comic-y style this iteration in the series presents. All of the art is clean and it just looks good. I just wish they would've kept with a consistant artist throughout the series. 4/5\n\nSound: At least they kept someone for most of the series in this department. Also, the music is enjoyable as ever, with the soundtrack leading a sort of fusion of the last two game's OSTs' styles. Also, much to my joy, the voice recordings didn't have any glaring errors like popping. Voice acting is still good and still believable, which is the best thing you can say about voice acting (at least as far as I can tell). If you make the character sound believable, you've done your job and done it well. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are 8/9/4/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10.

Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to \"the other side\" throughout the series. \n\nIn BLACKWELL CONVERGENCE, this installment takes place about six months after the events in Legacy. Rosa's neighbor, Nishanthi Sharma, convinces Rosa to visit an art gallery viewing. There, Rosa and Joey meet a film company director who later reveals that an actor in a recent film died. Murdered is a more accurate statement, they come to find. While working on the mystery, they stumble upon an old murder case whereby the victim's research work was stolen to benefit a rival company. Finally, on the art gallery's opening night, a familiar 'person' makes an appearance and murders the artist. In all three cases, Rosa and Joey learn that the same venture capitalist foundation funded the three separate companies. Rosa and Joey have their work cut out for them to solve the mysteries, help set the tormented ghosts free, and live to tell about it ... well, Rosa, anyway.\nNote: CONVERGENCE features two real people included in the cast of characters: writer Joseph Mitchell returns, as well as New York eccentric Joe Gould. \n\nTo enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.", "timestamp_created": 1376875997, "timestamp_updated": 1420773829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3505300": {"recommendationid": "3505300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023872094", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1375810877}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great Point and Click in the Blackwell series.

Perhaps a function that remembers what text has already been viewed because the skip button was inconsistent in my opinion. \n-Maybe some quality assurance issues. \n-Other than that not much in this category. \n\nPros: \n-I really enjoyed the point and click visual novel style.\n-Very cruel and shockingly realistic story, can become quite twisted depending on the way you play.\n-Lots of dialogue options!

The timed segments also add a lot to the tense moments. \n-Very relatable and realistic Main Character \n-Music adds a lot in terms of immersion and overall enjoyability. \n\nOverall one of my favorite psychological horror games to date. \nGreat Job CherryMochi I have a newfound respect for you guys.

If you like your video game stories to have some \"game\" in them, keep looking, the adventure elements attached to this visual novel barely qualify.

There are also little clues to look out for which keeps you interested in not just the story but exploring extra places or going back somewhere twice which could help you to find out an important part of the story. I will play this game again and again and definitely recommend it to anyone in doubt. \nAlso, in the reviews, there are many saying about bugs but i didn't experience any.

Unfortunately, it did not quite live up to my expectations, and I believe there are better Japanese thrillers to be played. \n\nPros:\n- The music! The music is fantastic. Like, truly fantastic. If the soundtrack becomes available, I might pick it up. It really does help build the atmosphere (because most of the rest of the game provides very little) in a way that really carries the narrative. The fast upbeat music is hypnotic, the slow intense music really provides a lot of tension.\n- The art is very good. I wish it was a bit more animated, but in general the character models are really solid. Reina in particular is a lot of fun to look at.\n\n\nCons:\n- The narrative branching and decision making is mainly saved for the last half hour of the game. There is very little in terms of decision making or puzzle solving in the hours before the end. \n- The entire story is told through dialogue, which is at times not particularly interesting.\n- There are lots of bugs. Things look clickable that aren't, other things are clickable but you can't see them.\n- It's a thriller, but there are very few thrills and very little tension. A few jump scares here or there, but overall very little in terms of suspense. In fact, it's almost too lighthearted at times. There are mechanics for your sanity and some other statistics, but they never once came into play for me, and it was like they never mattered at any point.\n\nNeutral:\n- The story is fairly generic for an interactive novel, but it is interesting enough to carry the game. I was at least interested in moving to the next section to figure out what was going on, and even though the resolution is somewhat bleh, the characters are engaging enough to carry the player along. \n\nOverall, unless you *really* like interactive novels where you have very little agency as the player, there are better games available. \n5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1514665039, "timestamp_updated": 1514665039, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38870769": {"recommendationid": "38870769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089136943", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "last_played": 1516517284}, "language": "english", "review": "6 hours long, with eleven endings.

It took me a few months to finally pick this up and I really regret not buying this sooner.\n\nI'm not going to beat around the bush. I love this game. The story is intense and interesting, the music is great, the animation fluid. Everything about this game just ticks all the right boxes for me. If you're into aesthetics and atmosphere, this game oozes with it.\n\nAs for the gameplay: It's your basic point-and-click adventure at heart. However this is mostly just a vehicle to carry the story itself. There's no pixel hunting, everything you can interact with is highlighted as soon as you near it. The \"puzzles\" really just amount to simple busy work or running back and forth talking to NPCs. Nothing special there.\n\nOne unique mechanic however is the introduction of the SPIN system. Depending on how you act to NPCs or treat the world around you, various stats of Ito's psyche can change postively or negatively and affect how NPCs react back to you. Paired along with this are the introduction of many choices throughout the game of how to interact with the plot. Choosing to drink at a bar, using your gun to skip some backtracking instead of looking for another solution to a puzzle, resorting to violence, all of these affect your stats in some way.\n\nOn your first playthough, the game autosaves constantly and only allows one save file, which can lead to some really intense situations. Coupled with the intense music, there were plenty of moments that really had me on edge.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Multiple Endings. There are quite a few different endings to get, and after your first clear of the game you unlock a New Game + mode which lets you save multiple files and skip some dialogue. (Still not all of the dialogue, and unfortunately there's still a lot to click through.)\n\n(Addendum after second playthrough: There are actually quite a few bonus scenes and even an extra ending in NG+ so the play time isn't *quite* this short but I'll leave my first paragraph here regardless.)\nNow for the one big negative I have against this: The length. At the time of writing this I have just gotten my first ending at 4.6 hours. If you care about ending hunting that's obviously not a big deal and can even be a positive but it needs to be said. Do I regret spending this much for so little? Not. At. All. I still feel this game was worth every penny, and there's still enough meat here to leave a satisfying experience.\n\nThere is so much attention to detail here and a lot of small things really add up to an awesome experience. From the animated cutscenes to the backgrounds to the story itself to the music (have I mentioned the music is great yet?), I'm going to remember this game for a long time and I REALLY hope Cherrymochi follow through with a sequel. I'll definitely be watching for it.\n\nIf you buy this, do yourself a favor.

Some scripted scenes were particularly enthralling and gave me goosebumps that few story-driven games can claim. The pacing of the story is good, and there's hardly any downtime before the next character-defining scene. The SPIN system is a cool addition and allows players to observe how their actions affect the narrative. The soundtrack is amazing and fits hauntingly well. There are plenty of endings, and some that require a New Game+, which is nice. The New Game+ also progresses the story, and isn't just another playthrough.\n\nHowever, as much as I would like to gush about the game there were some shortcomings. The game isn't particularly long, and there aren't many choices that really matter. For example, I thought that being in the favor of certain characters would play a role later on in the story, but you never interact with that character again. Also, the SPIN system feels underutilized, and your parameters don't alter the course of the story all too much. Whether you play as a morally good or corrupt cop, crazy or sane, the majority of the story plays the same. All that changes is dialogue. That's a shame, because the SPIN system was what sold me on the game.

Pleasant experience for the first time. Also, this game could have been just a VN.\n\nSetting is very nice. Being detective is kinda cool. Getting to know stuff related to the case kept me invested for about 5 hours. The attention to details is steady, little things that might catch your fancy very hard can be found occasionally. It's like this game itself is an embodiment of collective subconsiousness surrounding Japanese section of mass culture. Very, very nice, if you are into the stuff.\n\nOn the sidenote, this game could have been realized as just a simple VN. Really, it doesn't bring much to the table when we are talking about mixing western PaC and Japanese VNs. It is a VN. With PaC elements. It may look point-and-click, but it is still a VN at heart. Not a mix.\n\nArtwork is good! Music is OK! \n\nStory? Well, it is there. Especially the first 10-20 minutes are super rad (also the best atmosphere-inducing puzzles; if only it was true about the other parts of the game). Then it gets kinda blurry. Gameplay becomes an obligatory mess, although the setting and composition make it a worthwile experience.\n\nNow, about replaying. It feels unnaturally prolonged. That's it.\n\nMore dark, for the gods of dark. \n\nSpoilers:\n[spoiler]1) No save system during 1st playthrough is good. It makes your experience unique and matter that much.\n2) Her boyfriend wasn't involving. At first, it was like: \"Oh, her partner is missing! Thrilling! Oh, they were together. Fine, cool! Oh. Oh. He's dead. Oh. Welp, no backstory matters anymore. He's dead, that's it.\". So, getting yourself involved with one of the main themes of the game proved to be a challenge. Build up is necessary for that kind of thing. If you take the first part of the game as a sole experience - it is just brilliant. Everything is there. Perfect, and going out with a BANG! But then you have to play further.\n3) Did you notice the neighbour girl was gar for main heroine? It was conveyed subtly (or I just have yuri-glasses). First, she says how they were interesting neighbours, but then she keeps sweet talking main heroine, and is a little bit unresponsive on the boyfriend part.

Except such game is already exist and it is much better than Tokyo Dark (Search \"Everlasting Summer\" or \"Katawa Shoujo\").\n\nThe best part of the game is a main character art.\nOther characters looks horrible (imo). Especially men (reminding me of boys that forgot to shave).\nThe story is shallow, badly paced and not interesting.\nRepresentation of Japan is just wrong - once again, game world is something that can be concieved by a person, frequently visiting non-Japanese Japan-related Internet forums.

[/h1]\nTokyo Dark is a psychological thriller visual novel with supernatural themes and light point-and-click gameplay. The story follows detective Ito as she slowly discovers her connections to a mysterious young girl, a cursed mask and a door leading to the dark.\n\nAs the game's title suggests, Tokyo Dark is full of mature themes, including murder, corruption, suicide and abuse. This may intrugue some while putting others off.\n\nThe major highlight of Tokyo Dark is its unique \"SPIN\" system (Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, Neurosis), in which gameplay choices and actions affect Ito's mental state and how characters around her perceive her. Depending on your score for each SPIN attribute, certain choices are available to you, which can lead to one of many story endings. Through this SPIN system, Tokyo Dark claims having a true \"every choice matters\" gameplay experience (though feel free to read my thoughts on this system in the \"My Personal Opinion\" section).\n \n[h1] You Should [b]Buy[/b] This Game If: [/h1]\n[list][*]You're looking for a more mature, psychological story-driven experience with dark themes.\n[*]You're familiar with Japanese culture and are looking for an anime-style visual novel game.\n[*]You're willing to invest time towards replaying the story and unlocking each ending.[/list]\n\n[h1] You Should [b]Skip[/b] This Game If: [/h1]\n[list][*]You're looking for lots of gameplay (Tokyo Dark is mostly just reading text).\n[*]You're looking for more of a Point-and-Click experience rather than visual novel (P&C elements are minimal).\n[*]You want a more light-hearted story experience.[/list]\n\n[h1] My Personal Opinion (Recommendation Reflects This) [/h1]\nTokyo Dark is my second experience with the Square Enix Collective Project. I'm not very big on visual novels, though I really enjoyed the Danganronpa series and was looking for a similar thriller/mystery type game. And before I dive too deep, I'd like to say that I enjoyed Tokyo Dark as a whole, but it has it's flaws.\n\nFor having so many endings, Tokyo Dark is still extremely linear. Throughout the game, you'll come across numerous obstacles, like a locked door for example. There are almost always exactly two ways to deal with the obstacle: use brute force, or backtrack to find a specific item that avoids force. The end result, however, is really the same no matter which option you pick. The only difference is that using force or violence has a negative impact on your SPIN attributes.\n\nSo what happens if your SPIN attributes decrease? let's say you choose to shoot the lock off the door to progress, rather than find a key. This action gives Ito a sanity score of -10, which means that she becomes slightly more insane. Other than this leading to one of the potential endings, my exact sanity score seemed irrelevant to the game (and this felt true for every attribute).\n\nGetting to the point, the SPIN system didn't seem as impactful as I thought it would be, as it was specific individual actions that determined which choices (and subsequently, which endings) I could make later on. This invalidated the importance of many micro-decisions that revolved around influencing SPIN, decentivizing me to care about these decisions.\n\nDespite the weakness of the SPIN system, I still thoroughly enjoyed the game's linear main story and multiple branching endings. My first full playthrough took ~6 hours, with subsequent ending unlocking tacking on several more. I highly encourage players to spend time unlocking endings, as each builds upon the overall psychological theme of Tokyo Dark.\n\nFor a relatively short visual novel, I personally don't think this game is worth $18. However, if it's ever on sale, it's worth a playthrough for those interested in a short, mature, psychological visual novel.", "timestamp_created": 1512258516, "timestamp_updated": 1512258547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38007105": {"recommendationid": "38007105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204767717", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514112401}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96be\u5f97\u4e00\u89c1\u7684\u4f18\u79c0\u5267\u60c5\u6050\u89e3\uff0c\u53d9\u4e8b\u3001\u753b\u98ce\u3001\u58f0\u6548\u3001\u8fc7\u573a\u90fd\u5904\u7406\u5f97\u76f8\u5f53\u7ec6\u81f4\uff0c\u5f3a\u63a8\u3002\n3+1+1+1.5=6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1512229331, "timestamp_updated": 1514824741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38000564": {"recommendationid": "38000564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383090393", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512662313}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u7d50\u69cb\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3089\u3057\u304f\u3066\u5468\u56de\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u306e\u4f0a\u85e4\u5211\u4e8b\u306f\u6c17\u304c\u5f37\u304f\u5f37\u5f15\u306a\u6240\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u512a\u79c0\u3067\u76f8\u68d2\u306e\u7530\u4e2d\u5211\u4e8b\n\u4e00\u7b4b\u306a\u9762\u304c\u3042\u308a\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u3042\u307e\u308a\u898b\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u7121\u3044\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u597d\u307f\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\n\u8a71\u306f\u7d9a\u304d\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3042\u307e\u308a\u4e00\u6c17\u306b\u3084\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u4e00\u5468\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306b4\u6642\u9593\u4f4d\u3067\n\u8efd\u3081\u3067\u4e01\u5ea6\u3044\u3044\u611f\u3058\u3067\u3059\u3002\u305f\u3060\u5168\u3066\u304c\u4e38\u304f\u53ce\u307e\u308b\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u7121\u3055\u305d\u3046\n\u307e\u3041\u6d0b\u30b2\u30fc\u6163\u308c\u3066\u308b\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u4f55\u3068\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n\nUI\u306f\u4e0d\u6e80\u306a\u6240\u304c\u7d50\u69cb\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5168\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30d7\u51fa\u6765\u306a\u3044\u3002\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30ed\u30b0\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u4ee5\u964d\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u304c\u5fc5\u305a\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u9032\u3081\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3044\u305a\u308c\u304b\u3092\u5fc5\u305a\n\u4e0a\u66f8\u304d\u3059\u308b\u4e8b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002\u4e00\u90e8\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3066\u306a\u3044\u6240\u304c\u3042\u308b\u7b49\u3005\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\n\n\u8981\u671b\u3057\u305f\u3044\u4e8b\n\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u305f\u3089\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8CG\u304f\u3089\u3044\u898b\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3002\u304a\u7d04\u675f\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1512213548, "timestamp_updated": 1512213548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37986644": {"recommendationid": "37986644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145473205", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513906586}, "language": "english", "review": "Tokyo Dark is a supernatural mystery visual novel. I thought the game overall was pretty ok. The story was somewhat interesting, but doesn't really feel too new.

So it's pretty fun to later drive your character into complete insanity. The art looks pretty good too, and can get creepy at times. The soundtrack was nice to listen too as well.\n\nI'm not sure if I missed it, but sometimes when you reload the save, you have to go back to that one certain point the game lets you save it at. I wouldn't really mind this, but sometimes you can't even skip text, and I have to smash my left click in order to progress through the (very long) text and choose a different route I want.

The result is a noir detective story that frequently strays into psychological horror territory. \n\nIt will have you questioning reality \u2013 flashbacks, dream sequences, floating masks, and multiple endings - including an obligatory \u201cInsanity\u201d ending that is reminiscent of movies like Inception. At one point, while playing in a dark room, I looked away from the screen for a moment and thought I saw one of those creepy floating masks the game likes to use to mess with you. Probably more a case of bright screen + dark room = seeing weird stuff, but it fit in with the game\u2019s creepiness factor, so I mention it here.\n\nThe game uses a points-like system to track your decision making progress, with Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, and Neurosis meters. These can change the gameplay, from making your character respond negatively in stressful situations, to opening up new routes of investigation. Of course, the stats will also affect the game\u2019s ending, of which there are 11.\n\nWhen you finish the game for the first time, you gain access to save points and a New Game + mode that breaks the fourth wall more than a little. You also gain the option to skip large portions of dialogue, however, I\u2019ve found it interesting how certain conversations change when comparing them to the first playthrough. My only complaint is how tedious the game becomes when you\u2019re simply trying to click through to get to a new section or ending you hadn\u2019t yet seen. More skipping options would have been nice \u2013 but I also think more save slots (in ng+) could eliminate some of this frustration. \n\nAll summarized, the atmosphere of this game is fantastic \u2013 drawing you in and leaving you wondering what the hell just happened.

end. I loved it a lot, to be honest.\n\nThe story was nice and easy to digest. There are multiple endings, so it's not just one of those games where it keeps track of your attributes and decisions only to leave you with one ending where none of your decisions truly mattered. I have to admit, this one of the few games where I willingly sought out the bad ends.\n\nOne thing I want to stress is that this is more of a visual novel than a mystery. There was a grand total of one puzzle and it wasn't even all that difficult and it was honestly was kind of just tossed in there. It was just a matter of making decisions, reading, and backtracking. \n\nOverall, Tokyo Dark was a wonderfully written visual novel with gorgeous art and decisions that matter. I highly recommend it if you enjoyed Doki Doki Literature Club and/or VA-11 Hall-A.", "timestamp_created": 1510636169, "timestamp_updated": 1510636169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540573", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36502501": {"recommendationid": "36502501", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973261574", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510618463}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic mystery/point and click/visual novel game which takes it's title quite seriously.\n\nTokyo Dark has many twists and turns with an occasional jump scare all wrapped in a blanket of creepy.  You play as the protagonist, Detective Ayami ito, who is struggling to stay sane and figure out what the heck is going on with the case her partner was working.   It starts off with a bang and doesn't let go as you dive headfirst into creepy cults and ancient artifacts dealing with the supernatural.\n\nThe visual novel portion of the game is pretty well written with themes of lost loves, morality and how much control we may or may not have over our lives.  The player must often make choices which lead down varying paths depending on how Ito reacted which also ties into the game's very creative stats system called SPIN (Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, Neurosis).\n  \n- Sanity goes down as you experience horrible events and incidents but can be restored through making sure to enjoy the smaller things in life like playing with your cat.\n- Professionalism depends on your demeanor on the job and how you approach people and situations.  Shoot the lock off a door or find another way in, etc.\n- Investigation changes how focused Ito is during situations such as if she isn't focused enough she may not be able to notice a clue or ask a certain line of questioning.\n- Neurosis deals with how often you repeat things such as walking back and forth, talking to people repeatedly etc.  Higher neurosis stat may make Ito more paranoid...\n\nThe music is fitting for every area/situation.  Heavy somber tones as you explore the darker alleyways but lighter tunes while during the day and exploring the occasional happier places.\n\nWithout giving away too much, I would say that the multiple endings are worth finding and that loose ends are almost all tied up.

Its has more of mental effect, it will make you feel uneasy and tense.\n\nI said that this is point&click adventure, its not really true. You use pointing and clicking to move your character around and to initiate actions, but all interactions are done in VN fashion. This also means protagonist's character has very limited animations. By limited i mean it can walk ... and draw gun in few scripetd scenes ... and thats all. There are few different sprites for VN segments, with different facial expresions and stuff. \n\nGame hase attempt at voice acting, but its limited to things like \"konichiva\" or \"hajimemashite\" when starting conversation or \"kore wa\", \"are wa\" when examining things. Thats really shame i would love to have proper voice acting for this game.\n\nI am big fan of Innocent Grey's visual novels and while Tokyo Dark is not really close to awesomeness of Kara no Shoujo, it does pursue similiar impression and i certainly appriciete that.\n\nLike in Kara no Shoujo, you cant achive \"true ending\" on first playthru. After finishing game for first time, you will get option to start \"new game+\" which changes things a little. Protagonist is remotely aware that she went thru all of this before, most of game stays same but some key scenes turn out differently. Its nice touch, i like it.\n\nSo final verdict.

It's by no means a perfect game, but it's a unique and interesting take on classic point-and-click adventure titles.\n\nMany games take place in Tokyo, but few touch upon the seedier aspects of its familiar locales. You're basically exploring the bad parts of town in this game, while following a story steeped in the occult. It's less of a police procedural, and more of a personal story about one woman's struggle with grief. The writing is consistently good and entertaining (even though you might stumble across a spelling error here and there), with a creepy, unsettling atmosphere throughout. There are no jump scares, just an ominous sense of foreboding from beginning to end. \n\nOne thing to note is how much this game feels like a well-balanced fusion of Western and American elements. The story, the locations, the interactions, the history... all of it feels very true to the Japanese setting, draped over a framework of a game born from Western indie design sensibilities. I think the combination works very well. You get something that comes across as very authentic, yet it's darker and more uncomfortable than similar games developed solely in Japan. \n\nOne of my biggest complaints, is that it feels like there could have been more opportunities for meaningful choice. You do a lot of reading in this game, and that's fine, but when it comes time to make a choice, much of it boils down to managing your stats, which in turn influences future choices and the endings available to you. There are only a few points in the story where it feels like the choice you've made has radically altered an otherwise fairly linear narrative. \n\nSecondly, this game encourages multiple playthroughs, and there are many sections that you'll have to replay over and over again. Sometimes you're given the option to skip a long dialogue, but more often than not, you'll have to click through conversations one line at a time. More \"skip\" buttons would be appreciated, or a \"skip read\" option, like the one most visual novels employ. This is only a minor nitpick though.\n\nIt's evident that a lot of care and passion went into this game. There are a handful of impressively animated sequences (not bad, considering that I've seen bigger games with bigger budgets skimp in this department), as well as a beautiful and sorrowful soundtrack. Key characters are drawn very well, with a variety of expressions and poses, though many of the secondary characters (especially male ones) are drawn with a bit less polish. It can be a bit distracting at times, but it's not a dealbreaker. \n\nIf you're looking for an eerie story to play this Halloween, you could do much worse than a blind playthrough of Tokyo Dark. Definitely recommended. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507217883, "timestamp_updated": 1507217883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35487458": {"recommendationid": "35487458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041949046", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507171596}, "language": "english", "review": "A good story driven game.

Square has an eye for promising titles and their efforts in the publishing and promotion of such games, are commendable. Today, I\u2019m writing about the Steam debut of Cherrymochi, a developer which also ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for Tokyo Dark in 2015, but obviously preferred to release their project after two more years of development. Time well spent, since out of my entire collection of visual novels, none has captivated me as much as this one. By opting for a (supernatural or not) detective tale, Tokyo Dark falls within my very specific criteria for the noir subgenre. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThings couldn\u2019t get much worse for Detective Ayami Ito. Over the course of a week, she torpedoed her promising career, witnessed the murder of her beloved partner and became a laughing stock or cause for concern, depending on who you ask about her sanity. Once a rising star of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, she was suspended while pending enquiry into the tragic events which claimed the life of Detective Kazuki Tanaka. Right from the start, Tokyo Dark informs its players that any choice and action you take in-game is final and autosaved on the spot. There is no going back, for now. On active duty or not, Ayami sets on her own journey through Japan\u2019s capital in search of a mysterious female killer.\n\nI won\u2019t spoil the plot to you, but suffice to say that appearances can be even more deceiving in Tokyo Dark than in your run-of-the-mill visual novel. Love triangles concerning scantily clad and childish characters have nothing in common with this game. Supernatural elements are quite subtle, making players question what they see or the actions based on their perception, much like Ayami herself begins to doubt her efforts in getting to the bottom of the looming enigma connecting a murderer to a certain Kabuki Mask. That object makes a persistent appearance throughout the game, from the loading screen animations and down to its implied force which drives several characters to the point of obsession. \n\nA surpringly light-hearted element to this murder mystery, is the prevalence of felines within Tokyo Dark. Stray cats, Cat-themed Caf\u00e9s, Collectible maneki-neko figurines and even Ayami\u2019s own house cat, all represent a beacon of calmness and hope. The protagonist\u2019s few moments of relaxation come mostly from the interaction with her pet and several friendly faces that still believe in her crusade. The brass and powers that be, certainly won\u2019t help make the investigation any easier, so Ito is mostly on her own while searching for her suspect, incognito and with no back-up. It\u2019s not like the badge helped her much in the past. Perhaps it was only a hindrance.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nConstruct 2, a \u201cHTML5-based 2D game editor\u201d is powering Tokyo Dark but I admit that I am not acquainted to this particular graphics engine. The game looks great for its genre and no background or character is drawn in haste or showing any sign of asset reuse. It scaled perfectly on my monitor\u2019s native resolution, featured no frame rate drops (stable 60fps at all times) and I encountered no glitches, bugs or crashes to desktop. A textbook example of a visual novel that takes full advantage of OS and hardware variations on the PC platform. Both Ayami and the NPCs she interacts with are well animated, from simple motions to the classic anime-style emotional expressiveness. The text speed can be sped up or skipped via mouse click.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nTokyo Dark\u2019s soundtrack was composed by Mark Steed and I consider it beyond reproach. Most songs fit the current mood instilled by the on-screen action but I really miss voice acting when having to read so much dialogue which makes the story so gripping yet lifeless in the end. Apart from several Japanese words for \u201chello\u201d, \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d and character names, there are no spoken lines of dialogue. It\u2019s even more baffling since complete voice acting in Japanese, was one of the first Kickstarter goals mentioned and achieved. \n\nI can understand not having the budget for English dubs and despite possessing a Japanese vocabulary of less than 25 words, I would have appreciated hearing the actors and actresses regardless of my personal skill in that particular language. For the record, games, movies, TV series made in Japan or with their action in Japan, are far more authentic to me if they feature Japanese dubs and English subtitles. Same applies to any country of origin as far as authenticity is concerned.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nApart from interacting with various NPCs and furthering the investigation through careful exploration of the surroundings, Detective Ito must keep a close eye on her mental well-being and her professional conduct. Something rarely seen in visual novels, we have a strong RPG element in Tokyo Dark through the implementation of the SPIN system. It stands for Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation and Neurosis. As you\u2019d expect since we\u2019re dealing with cases of the supernatural and Ito\u2019s own emotional scars, some concessions shall be made in regards to her sanity, in pursuit of finding both the culprit and answers to her torment. Players will have to \u201cjuggle\u201d with choices that can both affect and assist the protagonist at the same time.\n\nThe pills she has to ingest in order to contain her \u201cdemons\u201d, reminded me of Detective Norman Jayden\u2019s addiction towards Triptocaine and ironically, the Heavy Rain (PlayStation exclusive, perhaps one day on PCs & Steam) similarities with Tokyo Dark, don\u2019t end there. Both the origami figures and Kabuki masks are inherently Japanese objects and they are integral to the plotlines from the aforementioned games. Noire themes are easy to spot, such as flawed detectives and passive law enforcement agencies which compel protagonists to take matters into their own hands, or a murder case that is far more elaborate than it appears at first glance. Sanity keeps Ayami on the right track and alive, Professionalism acts as a gauge which indicates how well she\u2019s being perceived by most NPCs while Investigation furthers the plot and offers puzzle section hints. \n\nNeurosis is harder to explain but far easier to maintain within bearable limits, since interacting with Ito\u2019s pet cat and\u2026indulging in certain activities such as pancake eating, seem to relax our heroine quite efficiently. No inventory is implemented, but a map system with locations to (re)visit and puzzle sections, do remind us that not only RPG elements are to be found in Tokyo Dark but also features of the adventure genre. The backtracking didn\u2019t bother me and I really appreciated the fact that you can\u2019t attain all the game\u2019s achievements in a single playthrough since most actions and choices lock you out of some circumstances. Having eleven endings, speaks volumes about the story\u2019s complexity and how players can shape its outcome.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIf you want a visual novel that can skillfully mix cute and creepy in a single formula, then Tokyo Dark is your next favorite within this genre. What truly prevents a great game from becoming perfect in this case, is the severe lack of voice acting that would have fitted like a glove on this captivating adventure. I hope Cherrymochi learned a lot from their debut and I eagerly await more projects from them.\n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Intriguing storyline.\n+ Beautiful graphics and soundtrack.\n+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards.\n+ Replay value through multiple endings and choices.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- Lacks voice acting.\n\n[b]Rating 85/100[/b]\n\n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews]Imperial Reviews[/url] and [url=https://www.ticgn.com] The Inner Circle Games Network[/url] through the generous contribution of Nick Edward.", "timestamp_created": 1506710402, "timestamp_updated": 1507202549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732245", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35249328": {"recommendationid": "35249328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988855416", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506620400}, "language": "english", "review": "For me a very good game, I would call it masterpiece and a new type of an VN.\nIt has a great horror crime story and the characters are very nice in that game and Detective Ito is still the best and the music and sound effects fit is quite to a horror game, I can feel, the developers made it with much love and the graphic is nice aswell.\nIn this game, you should be careful what decisions you are doing, even a little (maybe in your eyes useless) could have a big change for common actions or for the ending and always take care of your sanity and it made an auto-save or your decisions, that you have to think what you are doing and there is no way to return and it is not like in another VN\u00b4s. :P\nMaybe a bit more content in this game would be nice, but it is okay aswell.\nWhat is also nice here a lot of nice cutscene and pictures of your decisons and they are well made.\nI would say get this game and enjoy the story and the horror here, well it not a horror like in Outlast but the horror feel here is quite nice.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1145871604\n\n[b]Pro and Cons in short form:[/b]\n[spoiler][u]Pro:[/u]\n- Nice horror crime story\n- Contains a lot of cutscenes and pictures\n- Great characters\n- Nice soundtracks and fitting sound-effects\n- Much endings up to your decisions\n- The atmosphere in this game is really nice and its well drawned and well made\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n- It should have a bit more of content for this price (up to the buyer for me its okay at least)\n- The puzzles or decisions are sometimes to easy or you can see what is coming, when you choose for one\n- I guess, maybe its only me, the Spin system doesnt change much of decisions or I made wrong decisons\n- I know there wouldnt have always to have a happy end and yeah it doesnt fit it in that game aswell, but would be nice if would be there real happy end with a happy Ayami :D", "timestamp_created": 1506545794, "timestamp_updated": 1511606210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35233046": {"recommendationid": "35233046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139770642", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506473315}, "language": "english", "review": "Hesitated due to the price, but it was well worth it.

This makes you to have a regular look at your state of mind, as this has effect on the choices you can make or actions you can chose from. \n\nIf you are looking for an intense, interesting, point and click mystery adventure...this is a really good choice.

you feel the weight of your decisions.\n- Contains a couple of animated cutscenes and some idle animations\n- Memorable characters\n- Multiple endings, so lots of replayability\n- Good choice of sound effects and soundtrack\n- Auto-save locks your decision, so it forces you to think on your decisions\n- Story was very enticing with the concept of questioning reality  \n\nCONS: \n- Not enough content for the price point (opinion)\n- Random times for voice-acting\n- \"SPIN\" stats don't feel integrated well enough (opinion)\n- No manual save, so you're forced trial-and-error to find the

1505847797}, "language": "english", "review": "Tokyo Dark\u00a0by developer Cherrymochi\u00a0and publisher Square Enix Collective is a detective mystery game with a focus on horror and a great storyline to accompany it. It captures the old point-and-click genre and combines it very well with anime-style visuals.\n\nThe art style used in Tokyo Dark is similar to that of a visual novel, but with much more interaction provided. The art style adds to one of the things Tokyo Dark does well, which is the game\u2019s atmosphere. The atmosphere created through the setting throughout the game adds to its eeriness. In addition to this, the feeling of the game is enhanced by the audio and sound track during various scene changes. It captures the specific scenes perfectly and greatly adds to the overall experience while playing the game.\n\nOne of the interesting features added into Tokyo Dark is their SPIN system. SPIN stands for sanity, professionalism, investigation, and neurosis, and most decisions made in the game contribute towards one of these attributes. This system makes the player give more thought to their decisions since there are possible consequences to each decision. Morals also play a huge role in Tokyo Dark since they weigh heavily on your choices which have impact and consequences, whether that is to your SPIN stats or just your overall ending for the game. It also becomes a bit psychological when you\u2019re making choices since you begin to wonder how exactly a simple decision can change the course of the game.\n\nSince Tokyo Dark is a mystery and detective game, it only makes sense that it also contains puzzles. There are puzzle elements in the game that reward you or punish you depending on how well you can perform. In addition to this, some scenes have timers that require quick thinking to end up with a satisfying result.\n\nThroughout Tokyo Dark, you are confronted with various quests that reveal more about the main story, allowing you to piece together the mystery. And since you\u2019re in control of the character, rather than most visual novels where you are just a passenger to the story, the gameplay feels more immersive. The cut scenes in the game are also great because they add more to the scene than just a simple static image or a transition with dialogue.\n\nTokyo Dark does have some downsides though, such as when the game begins, you\u2019re suddenly launched into the main story with no explanation on how to play the game and what to look for. The only feature that is explained is the autosave feature which mentions that all decisions are final. The SPIN system is also introduced and the point-and-click system is implied during the brief introduction.\n\nOne of the cons I noticed while playing Tokyo Dark is their interaction system. On the surface, it seems like a good mechanic for having multiple options for one person or item. Where it goes wrong is when there are similar options for multiple interactions, but in different places. An example of this is when you\u2019re walking down a street and one interaction has \u2018Enter\u2019 on a door at the top of the menu, while the next one has it at the bottom or on the left. Another con about this system is that the menu is slow to appear at times, which sometimes leads to you running past them and then having to backtrack as they appear.\n\nAnother possible issue is that there is no ongoing quest screen, so you have to remember what your current goal is. This isn\u2019t much of a problem in this game, since it keeps you on the main storyline for the entirety, but it can be a bit of a negative feature for those who speed through the dialogue while playing this style of game.\n\nThe graphics options in the game are also very limited, allowing the player to only change whether the game is windowed or full screen, brightness and contrast options, text size, language, and dynamic lighting options.\n\nOne other feature I noticed is that since Tokyo Dark is a point-and-click game, the input is limited to the mouse. At times this feels a bit limiting to the player, especially towards those who prefer the WASD or arrow key controls to move around, though there is much more control compared to standard visual novel style games.\n\nOverall, Tokyo Dark captures a detective story fantastically, incorporating horror and anime-style themes just as well. If you\u2019re looking for a mechanic-heavy game, this game is not for you. But if you\u2019re looking for a mystery game with a rich storyline, puzzle elements, and a great atmosphere to accompany it, then Tokyo Dark is the game for you.\n\nRating: 8/10",

So we either have to suffer the choice of getting a bland, copy/paste, insert yourself as the protagonist story and choices you end up not caring about; or we get gripping story but you reach the end only to find out you might as well have played one with no choices at all, because all you got really was \"choose ending A, B, or C\" even though that doesn't fit the type of character you've been shaping for the last 40 hours (*cough* Bioware *cough*).\n\nTokyo Dark however whispers in your ear 2 hours in and says, \"hey, remember those few silly things you did the first ten minutes of gameplay that you thought didn't matter while you were getting used to the mechanics? Those will now be haunting you and remember there is only auto-save, you casual.\" For that alone, this casual thanks Tokyo Dark. And with it's fascinating blend of visual novel, point & click puzzle solving (which I usually don't go for), and horror mystery with mechanics bringing back fond memories of Eternal Darkness (you yungun's ask yer folks or nerdier older sibling) this game will suck you in quick. And the multitude of endings will have you coming back for more, so the short playthrough time is a blessing if you want to see it all and still have a life.

from many others. \n\nProbably the most noticeable feature is that your choices truly do matter in this game, and the way they do that is not only simple but rather ingeneous: After making a decision (like say shooting at a lock instead of finding a hairpin to pick at it), the game will autosave, meaning that if you want to redo that decision again, you'll need to start the entire game over from the beginning. \n\nThe story, while not very memorable in my opinion (though it's probably because I only stopped after getting one ending), does have a unique array of characters that help compliment the game, helping you unravel the seedy underbelly of the Tokyo nightlife. It'll keep you engaged if your a fan of crime and psychological horror stories. \n\nThe artistic style is not bad as well; it really captures the Tokyo nightlife: Showing the cheerful facade that we associate with the city, while exposing the nasty underbelly with very earthly colors and rushed paint strokes. And finally there is the music, which, personally, really does sell the game: It gives you the pinging sense of dread that something is off.\n\nUpdate: Nominated it for the Choices Matter Award", "timestamp_created": 1505459726, "timestamp_updated": 1511481008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34962557": {"recommendationid": "34962557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086061996", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515971158}, "language": "schinese", "review": "We need Chinese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1505443757, "timestamp_updated": 1505443757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34961182": {"recommendationid": "34961182", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975909732", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505241673}, "language": "french", "review": "Content d'avoir back le jeu sur kickstarter!", "timestamp_created": 1505437678, "timestamp_updated": 1505437678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34958825": {"recommendationid": "34958825", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973479914", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505260478}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 a good story with a lot of endings depending on what you do ingame only problem I had with it is framerate issues", "timestamp_created": 1505427331, "timestamp_updated": 1505427331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34957547": {"recommendationid": "34957547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039037839", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505421591}, "language": "english", "review": "A really nice short piece of art.

The game represents combination of story-driven visual novel style and choice-based element, setting in deep dark corners of Tokyo.\n\nYou play as detective Ayami Ito, searching for her missing partner, and uncover the truth of Tokyo urban legend. The story pacing is well done, intrigues player with clear goal, but tricks you with psychological elements. The dialogues are well-written and natural; some are related to philosophy and mythology as supporting elements.\n\nThe art style is totally optional; it is what I expect from Kickstarter. Each scene has own quality soundtrack that capture the feeling and atmosphere expect very few unpolished background. The game also includes few animated sequence from Graphinica (Production Company behind series such as Hellsing, Long Live!), which it might be reason of release price.\n\nIn term of gameplay, you progress the story by searching clues in area and asking various NPCs for information. Gathering information sometimes requires puzzle solving, but it is not particular hard and allows multiple approaches.\n\nIto\u2019s mental state represents in S.P.I.N features (Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, and Neurosis). Most of every decision does matter, it has own consequence that affect some of her S.P.I.N stats which can lead to her different perspective, choice, and endings. It reminds me old mechanics from various crime games and well implement into VN style.\n\nHowever, I feel like S.P.I.N system is easily manageable and doesn\u2019t emphasize player awareness due to less punishment. The game design introduces the importance of choice by disable save-load system on your first playthrough and enables broken memory features to let players experience different choices. It\u2019s quite smart design that supports repeatability although there are only six slots. The game also has startup issues and game-breaking bug on release which they are fixed in latest patch, but still remain some UI display issues.\n\nOverall, Tokyo Dark is quite short experience (4-6 hours for first playthrough), but fill with interesting gameplay, well-written psychological storyline, and strong dark atmosphere. If you interest in this kind of genre, Tokyo Dark is great choice to try.  \n\n\n---------------[\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22]---------------\n\nTokyo Dark

I guess that began my interest in Video Games, especially as a story telling media.\n\nSo when an email hit my inbox from SquareEnix Collective about a Western point-n-click adventure twist to the Japanese visual novel genre my interest was immediatly caught.\nThen, after fully reading the email, I was to learn it was going to be a narrative driven psycological thriller.\nWell that had me throwing my wallet at the screen yelling \"Take my MONEY!\", and once the opportunity to become a 'Backer' in the development of Tokyo Dark via Kickstarter, I jumped in with both feet.\n\nFollwing the development of the game has been quite a trip. Monthly updates from the development team. Coupled with Beta build downloads for backers (Along with demo's available at SquareEnix's booth at San Diego Comic Con 2016) the ability to get 'hands on' during some of the early stages was only whetting my appetite for what was shaping up to a be a Point-n-Click Psycological Thriller Game I'd longed for.\n\nWith other games media quoting games like 'Life Is Strange' for gameplay and story telling from psychological thriller movies like 'Se7en', who am I to argue, I totally agree. \n\nPlayers manage Detective Ito's Sanity, Professionalisim, Investigation, and Neurosis (SPIN) through your decisions, and interactions with the other characters and the environment.\nHowever, be forewarned, there is an Auto Save function meaning you have to 'Live' with the consequence of your actions. No going back to 'fix' a mistake, you're taking ownership of that choice. You either keep going, or start again from the beginning... and why would you go back to the beginning? You should keep going, see how deep that rabbit hole is, Alice.. Sorry Ito, and reach the conclusion.\n\nThere's 11 different endings in Tokyo Dark, and a lot of choices to be made getting there. So you're going to get plenty of re-playability in this title. I like that very much. There's a few too many AAA Titles out there that are far too singular with their story severly limiting the ability to 'go back' and try something different.\n\nDo I think I'm going to get my moneys worth from my pledge 2 years ago? Yes, no hesitation. Hell I'll buy it again if I need to (Also some people I know may get given copies by me because I want them to play it)\n\nIs it worth what they're asking (Price wise) here on Steam?

Tokyo Dark just appealed me out of nowhere, resulting me to give it a try even if I don't like the genre. But, it was so much more surprising that I would ever imagine.\n\nPros.\n\u25ba Graphism, artworks are pretty clean while some levels are really welldone. The promoted cutscence made by that one studio looks fine but no need to bet on in neither. UI is pretty clean too.\n\u25ba Audio, pretty great OST for an indie game and overall sound effects work great in installing the game's ambiance.\n\u25ba Storyline, I've really hooked the storyline. Despite all the psycological horror theme, I've really enjoyed every bit of it. From detective business, to police HQ moment, to help people out and everything after that. Well built stroy with a good amout of definitive choices and momentum changing choices. \n\u25ba Characters design, the main grills characters (It\u014d -you- and Reina), especially It\u014d-waifu, own a pretty unique and well-created design. However Tanaka (your partner) falls a bit into a perfect, caring and altruistic hasbundo clich\u00e9 \n\u25ba Deep ambiance, Tokyo Dark has no trouble to quickly create its own ambiance leading to insanity moments, crutial decision-making momentum and sometimes a more relaxed pace.\n\u25ba Optimisation, runs smoothly without any trouble.\n\u25ba SPIN system, nice touch to the game leading advanced character design.\n\u25ba Visual novel and point'n'click hybird, well it is an interesting hybrid to be honest, having the freedom of point'n'click and the story-telling of a visual novel.\n\u25ba Endings, this game own 11 different endings resulting of your choices plus 6 secondary endings linked to background characters which is pretty impressive tbh. About the ending I've chose (spoilers mah bois), [spoiler] after a rough start of doing everthing I could to help It\u014d leading to horribles consequences, after all the efforts of getting back on tracks thinking if I couldn't help myself I could help the others, during the final showdown between It\u014d and Reina, the game really gave the feels I've haven't done this much to help someone that ruined the character's life. The \"Alone Toghter\" ending, which is the first I chose was so powerful, well written, so satisfying and, oh boi, those feels. Those damn feels [/spoiler].\n\nNeutrals.\n\u25ba User Interface hitboxes, even if I have said the UI looks good, it unfortunately, sometimes, has bugged hitboxes, leading to pick the wrong button. Also, on some startup, the location info seems bugged leading to everyplace is called \"<LOCATION>\" or something like that.\n\u25ba Game design new trends, like placing a puzzle with lights in the middle of a chase or put longass but interesting stories when approching the end. It's not a bad point because it keeps us on track with the game, it's just a little underwhelming, which, I think, was the point.\n\nCons.\n\u25ba Unnecessary \"jumpscares\", it's not proper jumpscares hopefully but I got startled every single time from the beginning to the moment you have to pack things in your office (because I don't found any of them later) leading me to be really tense up to the end. Shoutout to the flashing mask in a deep dialogue in the sewer tho.\n\u25ba Resolutions settings, there is N O N E.\n\u25ba Dialogue interface that rarely mixes the person that speaks or rarely forget to add your interlocutor sprite.\n\u25ba Dialogue interface hiding UI and other gamebreaking bugs, while the previous cons doesn't really affect the game, those will make you restart a new game  because they lead to corrupted savegame files, as far from what I heard. For exemple,  [spoiler] the pills scence have the dialogue interface bugged, so you must try to click the doorknob in blurry mess if you want to got to another place which will creat a new clean savefile [/spoiler]. Hopefully the devs, that have acknowledged it, are working on it.\n\nTL;DR.\nIf you're startled at almost anything I still will recommend you Tokyo Dark with all my heart due to his great storyline, possibilities, great detective aspect, uniqueness and non horror clich\u00e9 game design. And because of It\u014d, of course. If devs read this, I want to say thanks a lot, I haven't felt anything in months (I know most of the others players wouldn't felt as much as I did playing this, but I have been personnaly hit by this game).\n\n94/100", "timestamp_created": 1505199087, "timestamp_updated": 1505206890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670700", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34894676": {"recommendationid": "34894676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184204411", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510249309}, "language": "german", "review": "This game is so worth to buy!

There's one very simple puzzle in the entire game and the rest of the gameplay consists of going back and forth talking to people, along with interacting with or picking up a few objects along the way. This doesn't necessarily make the game bad, but it doesn't require much thought to progress in the game, so if you buy the game don't put your thinking cap on cuz you likely won't need it.\n\nWith as much text this game has, you think it would appeal more to fans of visual novels, but I can't recommend it for that. The story and character interactions are ultimately dull and the quality is on par with just about any generic horror movie. I think it could've been more enjoyable if it had full voice acting, which I was surprised to find that it didn't have. There was a voice acting stretch goal for the Kickstarter which was met, plus $225k canadian dollars were pledged for the project in total, so they definitely should have had the funding for full voice acting. $225k for this game alone is overkill considering the lack of quality put into it, which leaves me wondering what most of that money went into. As the game is now, it barely has any voice overs, and they're all for Detective Ito. The lack of voice acting was a major disappointment for me, being a Kickstarter backer.\n\nThe \"Beautifully animated sequences produced by Graphinica\" are quite short and forgettable. I appreciate that there are animated scenes in the game, but it doesn't add much substance to it. It's kind of like a \"special feature\" added to lure people in, but when you try the product you hardly even notice it. The soundtrack is well made fitting the horror vibe well enough, and the art quality is decent. I would have preferred a better UI design. The settings menu is lazily designed, not letting you adjust voice/sound effects/music volumes individually is slightly annoying.\n\nThe S.P.I.N (Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, Neurosis) system seems like it would have more consequences in concept, but it ends up being more of a gimmick. It's required to manipulate your SPIN stats to get a few endings so there is some use to it, though I've gotten 6 endings (including the true ending) without paying much attention to the choices I've made. Despite what the store page says, I don't remember encountering any different character dialogue/reactions based on what my stats were. I can't speak for all of the endings, but the endings that I played through were uninteresting and predictable. Nothing shocked me, no twists or anything, just boring. The ending branches aren't sophisticated so you can probably get all of them in 2 or 3 complete playthroughs (a lot of them branch at 2 choices near the end of the game) using a guide without too much hassle. New Game+ is unlocked after your first playthrough which enables you to skip some previously read text (but not all) and unlocks save slots making endings more accessible.\n\nEach ending route will take about 6 hours to finish initially, with each additional route being much shorter once you skip text in NG+. At a total of 11 endings, there is a fair amount of replayability, but not much content. IMO the endings don't warrant multiple playthroughs, they weren't interesting enough to me and they artificially inflate the small amount of content available. I'd expect more quality at $18 than this, especially after the amount of funding they got from Kickstarter. If you're dead set on buying it I suggest waiting for it to go on sale for $5 or an eventual Humble bundle (which will likely happen since it's published by Square Enix).", "timestamp_created": 1505127996, "timestamp_updated": 1505131282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34878634": {"recommendationid": "34878634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027300731", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505031878}, "language": "english", "review": "It seems like some of what was hinted at in the Kickstarter fell by the wayside (it seemed like they had aimed for more interactivity, but maybe they couldn't quite figure out how to work it out well enough), but the game still holds up well because of the solid story, decent storyline choices, and the great atmosphere (which is why I backed it in the first place).

I have a lot of difficulty just launching the game. There have been several times where I have to boot the game, close the process in Task Manager and repeat until the game actually launches because even though Steam says the game is running it hasn't booted for me. If this happens to you and you have already started the game DON'T VERIFY YOUR GAME FILE INTEGRITY. I made this mistake after going on a walk with my dog.... The game wouldn't load so I tried to verify the files and LOST EVERYTHING. Once the game finally loaded my save was no longer there (I really wish this game supported cloud save). All in all I lost about 3 hours of my time but it was quickly regained since the bulk of it was dialogue and reading that I could skip since I already knew what it said.

The storyline is essentially just a mash-up of various Japanese horror tropes like they were trying to check as many boxes as they could, and it all comes together to form a plot that basically never manages to surprise you. It's advertised as a mix of point-and-click adventure and visual novel, but in reality it's basically just a visual novel that also lets you walk around. There's a grand total of a single puzzle that amounts to clicking on flickering lights in order, and occasionally you get the choice of either skipping a 'puzzle' by shooting something or taking a few steps to the left to click on something else to solve it a different way.\n\nThe game presents itself as being similar to Telltale's choice-based adventure games, and you have a 4-way stat system for Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, and Neurosis, but neither of these matter much in practice. Most of the time the game is too scared to punish you for any of the minor choices, and in my two playthroughs so far the stats haven't made any visible difference at all. The game has 11 endings, but the replay feature barely works so it's hard to justify trying to get all of them - you only get the ability to manually save after your first playthrough, but you're limited to 6 save slots and can only save at predetermined points in the story, and some of these spots are poorly placed so that you have to scroll through several minutes of text to get back to them. There is a skip function, but it's just as broken, and half the time it won't let you skip text you've already read while other times it [i]will[/i] let you skip text you [i]haven't[/i] read before. I only got what seems to be the two \"main\" endings, but I really don't care enough to go back and look for the other 9.\n\nIt isn't an awful game, but I think it's at least overpriced at $18. It's fairly buggy and the features that do work seem half-finished at best, and chances are the story is nothing you haven't seen before.

If there were a \"Neutral\" option, I'd probably choose it, as I can see it appealing to some people, but be aware that it's not really a Point and Click Adventure in the sense that most people would understand.\n\nYes, you do point and click to walk around the scenes and interact with people, but in 4.5 hours of gameplay, it only has one actual puzzle (where you have to push a series of buttons in the correct order), and one mini-game (an arcade machine). Mostly, the game leads you by the nose to the next bit of the story with very little freedom.\n\nThere is a karma type system, where the choices you make affect later conversation options and the ending, which seems quite well developed with lots of branching paths. The game also makes a big deal about your \"SPIN\" stats (Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, Neurosis), but in practice they don't seem to have much impact on gameplay and can largely be ignored.\n\nSo, as a Point and Click Adventure, it fails spectacularly due to the near-complete lack of puzzles, which is why I'm choosing to not recommend it. If however you can accept it as a supernatural thriller \"visual novel\", then I guess you would probably enjoy it and moving around the gameworld does in fairness add a lot to feeling immersed in the story.\n\n(Parently advisory: The story and themes are dark and mature, this is not a game for kids).", "timestamp_created": 1505070247, "timestamp_updated": 1505215531, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34866948": {"recommendationid": "34866948", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970942692", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505679659}, "language": "italian", "review": "Buon tentativo di fondere VN con avventura grafica.\n\nIl risultato finale tende pi\u00f9 verso le prime che le seconde  ma ci sono elementi di entrambe.

character from losing her sanity and a gripping plot make this game an intense and captivating experience. My only complaint is the lack of inventory puzzles usual to a point-and-click adventure. There are some items to collect and utilize but it's always very clear how to use them.  Instead, the gameplay is more focused on making various decisions around different situations. Each decision affects the character's stats.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOriginally, I bought the normal edition of the game, but after I played it for a couple of hours, I decided to upgrade to the Collector's Edition - to support the developer (maybe I will even listen to the music some day - it is that good). After the brief update (the game actually re-downloaded fully after the update), I ran into a very annoying technical problem - the game would become stuck on the splash/loading screen for a very long time, slowly running counter from 0% to 100%. Every time. This never happened before the update.\n\nI went out to look for a solution and found a suggestion on the forums from the game creators themselves - it involved using the compatibility mode on the executable. After doing this (and I actually had to kill the game process a couple of time, just as the post suggested), I finally managed to get the game to launch fast again. Feeling excited, I entered the game to find my save game gone. Forever. Money nicely spent on the game upgrade, I thought :(", "timestamp_created": 1505041760, "timestamp_updated": 1505116092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Despite a few bugs (e.g. Detective Ito teleporting to the centre of the screen when she takes her pills for the first time in her apartment, first save file with 2 hours of progress disappeared), the overall atmosphere was amazing. The chilling background music coupled with the stunning art style really made the air heavy when it needed to  be.\n\nStory-wise, the game was pretty good.

It's unique to get a 2D side-scroller that features large HQ modern anime-sprites instead of small retro garbage visuals. This is extra rare on Steam, there are even less of them here. If you think this is not a rare combo, and that it is mundane......well, then you know jack about the game industry. So, kudos to the dev for that.\n\nBUT! The game has a gimmick wich also is the biggest flaw in the game in my opinion.\nA side-scroller where you move the player by clicking and dragging the mouse is horrible and a disgusting feeling that gets tiresome and eventually causes pain in the hand, especially when the rest of the game must be progressed through by the mouse. This mouse-walking also makes movements inaccurate. It is extremely easy to run past your intended destination. It seems that the director was so desperate in making a point-and-click game that he forgot \nergonomics and......well, common sense. It would have been better to move with the WASD and then do the interactions with the mouse. It can thus still qualify as a point-and-click, so calm down. No need to panic. As it is now, this is a flaw wich is not just a flaw, but it is bad game-design.\n\nThe other flaw is a flaw wich is so typical to Asian games that it almost becomes cultural. Chronic if you will. An overload of (uninteresting) dialogue. Tons of text. Text that is not really important for the story. That's not good. And that too, makes the hand hurt from all the clicking. \nStop it, get some help.\n\nThe good parts are the visuals as said. As well as the atmosphere combined with the soundtrack.\nThe soundtrack is ambient, but it is more sound-design than actual music. Grand textures, drones and SFXs forms \"music\" that sounds like something coming from the mastermind Diego Stocco.\nTop that with choices & consequence system and fully animated cutscenes, and this game is truly\na rare gem of a kind we don't have many of\n\nSCORE: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1505011231, "timestamp_updated": 1505069225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34850943": {"recommendationid": "34850943", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995116102", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505005887}, "language": "english", "review": "A point and click adventure I enjoyed quite a bit.

I know this is more of a point and click compared to a true visual novel, but there is no option to use the spacebar or enter key to get through the dialogue. You have to use the mouse to click through it which can get a bit tedious. \n\nI expected more from this game to be honest. The story isn't bad but it is too predictable. I've unlocked each ending listed in the achievements and experimented with majority (if not all) of the dialogue, hoping to find something that would have more of that \"wow that's an unexpected plot twist\"/\"-shocked-\" factor but it lacked in that department.

Like Telltale games, TD is primarily driven by its narration: the story will unfold with several possible outcomes, depending on the choices you\u00b4ll make during your playthrough. Storywise, you\u00b4ll play as Det. It\u00f4, trying to solve your partner\u00b4s muder by an theoretically impossible culprit, while struggling to retain your sanity and not succumbing to neurosis. The atmosphere reminds me of certain Story Arcs of the Anime \"Ghost Hunt\" \n\nPros:\n- 11 non-linear Endings\n- incredible, unsettling atmosphere through the whole game\n- the atmospheric, sometimes utterly disturbing soundtrack\n- compared to Telltale, your decisions will actually influence your sanity as well as the ending you\u00b4ll archieve\n- very well done anime-sequences\n- very high replayability\n\n\nCons:\n- each playthrough will only take about 4-6 hours, depending on your reading speed\n- some of the character graphics and portraits can\u00b4t keep the high quality of the others\n- most jump scares don\u00b4t really work and feel somehow unecessary\n\nOveral\n\nAs one of the backers I wasn\u00b4t dissappointed, I\u00b4d recommend it to everyone into mystery and urban-horror stories.\nI tip my hat to the developers and hope, we\u00b4ll see more from you guys in the future", "timestamp_created": 1504892408, "timestamp_updated": 1504892408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34817353": {"recommendationid": "34817353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999851894", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509309013}, "language": "english", "review": "The indie game made with soul.", "timestamp_created": 1504885771, "timestamp_updated": 1504885771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34817282": {"recommendationid": "34817282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088880248", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504983346}, "language": "english", "review": "I very love this game but i need Chinese please.", "timestamp_created": 1504885571, "timestamp_updated": 1504885571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478736", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34816486": {"recommendationid": "34816486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401086560", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504843656}, "language": "english", "review": "We reviewed this. Here are some select quotes from the review:\n\n\"[...] Tokyo Dark places you in the role of Detective Ayami It\u014d, a police officer in the Violent Crimes division that is constantly looked down on because she\u2019s a woman. At the beginning of the game, her partner is missing and she\u2019s following up on the first lead that they\u2019ve had since his disappearance. In the process of following up on said lead, she learns that his disappearance is tied to a case from six months earlier, the resolution of which caused her to fall into a state of some disrepute. After that night, she falls into even more disrepute and her life begins to fall apart. Nevertheless, she continues to investigate her partner\u2019s disappearance.\n\n[...]\n\nTo my surprise, the SPIN system made the entire experience much more nerve-wracking than it otherwise would have been. Choices that affect gameplay aren\u2019t new. Stat systems and stat checks in adventure games, and choose your own adventure games, in particular, aren\u2019t new either. However, the exact manner in which the SPIN system was designed and the exact manner in which it affects gameplay complemented the game\u2019s story incredibly well. It made me truly feel as if I was making decisions as the character would, torn between a sense of duty and the grief-driven need to keep searching. The struggle between doing things the easy way and doing them the right way\u2014and, consequently, simply hoping that \u201cthe right way\u201d would lead anywhere\u2014was prevalent throughout the game, largely because the SPIN system made it so that I had to carefully calculate the effects my actions would have on later endeavors.\n\n[...]\n\nTokyo Dark is a storytelling masterpiece. It managed to not only get me to evaluate the decisions that I was making, but also who I was and why I was making those decisions. It managed to truly cause me to be torn between two selves that I was painfully aware that it was trying to create. Even as I made one of the game\u2019s final major decisions, I knew that I was making the wrong choice, but I simply had to know what awaited me; I had to see it through. I\u2019ve dreaded my decisions in many a game, but I can\u2019t say that any game has had quite that effect on me before. It is one of the best of its kind and, as such, I have no choice but to recommend it.\"\n\nYou can find the full review, the score we gave it, and some cool screenshots from our time playing here: http://twocredits.co/review/tokyo-dark/", "timestamp_created": 1504883282, "timestamp_updated": 1504883282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34815323": {"recommendationid": "34815323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004138387", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504962855}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely breathtaking! 10/10\n\nA very rich story, countless choices and consequences. \nA very atmospheric game, accompanied by a stunning soundtrack, Tokyo Dark is a very good horror/mystery investigation game.\n\nIf you enjoy a good story, highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1504879821, "timestamp_updated": 1504879821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34815009": {"recommendationid": "34815009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027296440", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504875683}, "language": "english", "review": "Im used to play quite often Visual Novel games and this one isn't bad but isn't great either.\n\nSOUNDTRACK : really nice, give overall the right mood for every kind of situtation, even if isn't memorable 7.5/10\n\nSTORY : It start ok, maybe a bit too slow , i ll finish it before give a full review about it tryng to avoid spoilers. right now 7/10\n\nART: Well... my profession is actually being a developer artist... and... well... is bad, i mean, i love anime/manga style , but this one is really bad, ugly expressions, the chara design of the men is awful, the protagonist too much similar to motoko kusanagi (is overall too much generic) , really ugly animation ruining the overall mood of the game....\nThe problem of the enviroment art is about the setting itself: if u call a game Tokyo dark, i want in the start recognize some place of it , not just show overall japanese cliches (i lived in japan for one year, in Tokyo).

Such as walking vs running (can hold the mouse button near the edge of a screen and Ito will keep running but you can't do similar for walking).\nAnd the box selection  for conversation/actions can be a little wonky (as in having to be right on top of it or past the item you want to look/pickup.\n\nOther then that, I'm very pleased.", "timestamp_created": 1504876642, "timestamp_updated": 1504876642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34814064": {"recommendationid": "34814064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012281042", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505116270}, "language": "english", "review": "I've learned all of life's problems can be solved by punching it in the face, or shooting it.", "timestamp_created": 1504875564, "timestamp_updated": 1504876819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34812945": {"recommendationid": "34812945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089002864", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507592991}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing atmosphere, really draws you in!

Definitely worth checking out if you even have a passing interest (and you do have one because you've read this review up to now).\n\n\n\nPros:\n - Decisions DO matter, and are sometimes very subtle. There are often multiple solutions to puzzles. I'm sure I made some choices without even realizing there was other options.\n - Point and click gameplay that ties into the above\n - Good story with 11 endings that diverts well according to your choices. The ending I got felt very natural I couldn't tell you where the fork in the story happened.\n - Good audio design (sound, music); very fitting\n - Horror done right; no jumpscares\n - Ito is a great character.\n\nMeh:\n - Graphics, they are passable but nothing amazing.\n - Kinda short? There are lots of endings yes but I feel that perhaps a few less endings but longer plot would've been better\n\nCon:\n - Lacking technically; resolution options missing, no controller support, full motion video cutscenes are very compressed.", "timestamp_created": 1504871820, "timestamp_updated": 1505025678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34810504": {"recommendationid": "34810504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244062282", "num_games_owned": 816, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504851076}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u600e\u4e48\u63a8\u8350\u7ed9\u522b\u4eba\n\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e2d\u6587\nWe need Chinese\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u8a9e\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\nNous avons besoin de chinois\nWir brauchen chinesisch\nNecesitamos chino\npotrzebujemy chin\nPrecisamos de chin\u00eas\n\u041d\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \n\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19\n\u03a7\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03b6\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ad\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\n", "timestamp_created": 1504861499, "timestamp_updated": 1504872758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431569", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34808999": {"recommendationid": "34808999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080316088", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504908657}, "language": "english", "review": "This is great.", "timestamp_created": 1504852392, "timestamp_updated": 1504852392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400569", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34808759": {"recommendationid": "34808759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079082874", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506215634}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este ha sido unas las mejores experiencias que he tenido en un juego.

I would of prefered having controller support - like in the Alpha given to backers last year - but its not a deal breaker for me.\n\nAlso there is NO NUDITY or SEXUAL CONTENT in this game. So please flag those user defined tags as inappropriate so people can stop asking about it on the forums.  Sexual themes applies to certain dialogue that describes another NPC in the game during a question in an investigation.\n\nI highly recommend this game, if you want a story rich point and click experience.  \nHowever, if you are looking for an eroge with tons of nudity and H content, look elsewhere.\n------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: Having completed the game 100% I chose to leave my original review intact, however I would like to update some things.\n\nController support will be added back in a future update, which is good. However I've 100% the game so won't need to worry about it. I just used big picture to assign esc, left mouse and joystick mouse to a controller.\n\nMy first playthrough I ran into a glitch and had to start over.

Some endings branch depending in choices so I'd recommend going an insanity playthrough and a professional to speed it up.  \n\nThe cat ending is what took me the longest, I started over 2 more times from the beginning of New Game+ just to find that happy medium, that led me to it and not one of the other endings I wasn't going for.\n\nIn retrospect, I'd put this game at around the 12 hour mark for full completion.

Una serie de recompensas que han dotado al juego de un gran contenido y lo convirtieron en una experiencia totalmente original, con un profundo sistema de cordura y una diversidad \u00fanica al momento de recorrer su retorcido mundo. \nNo hay pr\u00e1cticamente nada malo para reprocharle, todo lo que hace, lo hace realmente bien. Adem\u00e1s presenta una historia admirable que utiliza como marco principal los cl\u00e1sicos relatos de terror oriental para desencadenar eventos paranormales.

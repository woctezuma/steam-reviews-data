Some of the music is simply amazing, the sound effects on the other end sound quite silly, but you grow attached to some of them. This story seemlessly go though many genres (mystery, romance, fantasy and horror) without feeling weak on any front. It offers a few interesting thought challenges later on when the riddles become increasingly more difficult to solve. There is a great cast of characters all of which are well written and interesting. One of the think I like the most about it is the hype management. The opposition and threats felt by the main character are very real and the struggle is really hard which makes it all the more satisfying when a come back occurs except maybe in the beginning in the second and third episodes where the main character appear to be incompetent, which is part of is journey and is growth.

Thank you so much to Witch Hunt and Ryukishi07 for years of patience and pushing to get the Umineko games an official release for your English speaking fans.\n\nUmineko is a VN in the truest sense -- you don't have any control over the story, you're just watching it all play out. But the storytelling is phenomenal, giving you just enough hints to make your own theories without giving everything away. And the use of sound is absolutely masterful. The sound effects are really great at evoking just the right amount of creepy, and the gore isn't explicit but the sounds that accompany it will still make you cringe. And the music is some of the best video game music out there.\n\nIf you're a fan of Higurashi, one of the original bar-setters for the horror VN genre, Umineko definitely keeps up the horror levels and the theme of blurring the lines between reality and illusion, but the romantic undertones really push it over into Favorite VN Of All Time territory for me.\n\nIf you're a fan of other horror VN series like Zero Escape and Danganronpa, definitely check out one of if not the greatest precursor in the genre.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for a really fantastic horror mystery visual novel, Umineko is one of the best.", "timestamp_created": 1513532853, "timestamp_updated": 1513532853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38306927": {"recommendationid": "38306927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053807143", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513583713}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like visual novels and/or the mystery genre, then buy this game. I can't say anything beyond that it is utterly fantastic. The mystery is great, the characters are some of the best I have seen in a game (certainly the best I've seen in a visual novel), and a great part of the storytelling itself is wonderfully unique, original and engaging. I don't think it is a thoroughly perfect visual novel, but none of the games I think are 10/10s are.\n\nIf there is something specific I can say about this game, it is its use of meta-storytelling. I have played and seen a lot of games that employ this, like Undertale's save and load mechanics, the entirety of pony island, the recently popular Doki Doki Literature Club, and not to mention the sleuth of 4th wall breaking characters, lines and plot threads in a lot of contemporary media. I mention all of this because none of what I have seen of meta-storytelling has, I feel, actually added anything of substance to the story that it is present in, it has merely been an interesting and sometimes clever gimmick which can be fun for the audience (me included). Umineko, a game around 10 years old actually did something with its meta-storytelling. It actually made me reflect on how I as the reader relate to and interact with the mystery genre. This was by no means something only I experienced by chance, the writer of Umineko, Ryukishi07, obviously intended for his game to have this effect on the reader.\n\nOf course, this is just one theme in this long visual novel, however the fact remains that, in my limited experience at least, it is the only game I've played to use meta-narrative in such a meaningful way to evoke thoughts from me that only meta-narrative specifically could with such effectiveness.\n\nI just remembered that The Beginners Guide and [spoiler] Danganronpa V3 [/spoiler] also used their meta-narrative in a meaningful way, but my point still stands, only with less force. Far less force. However in those games the meta-narrative only became meaningful to the story near the end, while in Umineko it is a pervasive theme throughout and integral to the game's very nature. What I'm saying is that Umineko actually managed to change my attitude towards the mystery genre, and any game that can actually change my views and/or attitudes is pretty sweet in my books.\n\nWow that was a long-winded way to say a simple thing.\n\nTL;DR You like VN's?

(You don't actually need to read Higu first tho; they're completely different)\n\nFirst things first, Umineko is a kinetic visual novel with no choices to be made, so let's be real here: it's more of a lot more of an e-book with sound and graphics than it is a \"game.\" \n\nThe \"question arcs\" package featured here is only the first half of the story (episodes 1-4) and focuses on establishing the mysteries, world, and providing hints; it took me about 50~ hours to complete. The story is concluded and \"answered\" through Umineko Chiru (episodes 5-8), also referred to as the \"answer arcs\" (recently released on Steam). \n\nUmineko has a great soundtrack, and the crimes and mysteries aren't straightforward even if you know who the culprit is. It's extremely well thought out; there's always hints and foreshadowing that you might not even notice until it's pointed out later. The characters are also very colourful and varied, and I didn't really find myself disliking any by the end.\n\nUmineko admittedly starts off slow; as the start of the first episode focuses on introducing the world, it's honestly kind of bland up until the debut of one of my favourite OST tracks, [url=https://youtu.be/raxEmANPTVc]Golden Slaughterer[/url]. This is also a problem with most question arcs (each episode was originally released seperately), but once you get into the later arcs you're expected to know how things go so these intros become shorter and less necessary.

The nature of the mysteries are so unique. (SPOILERS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE MAIN PLOT) This review is meant for people who have watched or read higurashi.\n\nWhat is so unique about these mysteries is that sometimes (more times to the later chapters) you see how the event clearly played out, but even when you do, there is still a mystery. The event you see is what happens with magic, but the mystery has to explain the scene with human logic. Battler, the main protaganist, is trying to escape a loop similiar to higurashi's. But there are a few different perameters for it. The most important one is that, unlike higurashi with Rika, Battler 'doesn't remember his memories' from loop to loop. Instead, he is given a connected alternate existence while the events happen. In order to defeat the which, he has to proove that whiches aren't real by going through the mysteries with human logic.\nUnlike games like danganronpa where you have a lot of evidence and scheduled time to find it, in umineko, there is barely any evidence. So Battler really has to twist logic and reason into his evidence, while Beetrice narrows down his reasoning with the absolute truth. So unlike murder mysteries, in umineko, Battler's goal isn't really to find the culprit, but to find out how the murder was even possible in the first place.\nUmineko has the best story I have ever seen in my life. The characters are very fleshed out, and you can really feel their pain. Umineko has the best romance and one of the only couples that are realistic. I didn't like Higurashi's romance, and I didn't like clannad's romance either. But in Umineko, you can really see the picture and you can really understand it. I've cried so many times for the romance in this.\nUmineko also has so many logical twists too. *AHEM CHAPTER 3*. And it is just so logical yet it does such a good job of letting the readers understand. Umineko has easy vocabulary so you don't have to worry about stupid words that you can't even understand. I love Umineko, it presents it's plot in an easy to understand way, but it is also very complex at the same time. It's so much better than reading a book that just had a simple plot but bogus vocabulary that gets in your way of understanding what's happening. \nUmineko is one of those stories that you can't judge on first impressions, and it always can find a way to surprise you, but there are no times where it tries to surprise you just for the sake of it. It surprises you while still making sense with the story.\nThere are no edgy characters too. And the characters that get spotlights are great. It's pretty hard for me to choose a favorite because they are all great. You can't really determain the character on first impressions, some characters are actually very different than how they act on the outside, and you're predictions will problably be wrong most of the time with them.\n\nThe one problem I have with this game, is that the first character that gets a spotlight never gets a spotlight again. And that was pretty annoying for me. Most likely that character will probably get a spotlight again in chiru. \n\n10/10 You might hate it if you don't like it, but for those who like it, it is the best thing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511212163, "timestamp_updated": 1511212163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36476618": {"recommendationid": "36476618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089529858", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508702985}, "language": "english", "review": "Umineko is not for everyone. For me it is the best story I read in my whole life but for someone the twist at the EP 5 can be really annoying. Umineko is not a pure mystery. It's real genre is much more different and for me much more satisfying. If you can accept it for what it is and try to understand it, it will reward you by giving you a really important life lesson. I still believe that Ryukishi07 is a really good guy who tries to show people something rather than writing a \"heartless\" mystery. Umineko will not going to give you all answers. But you can still find them all by just thinking about it. If you can't find some pieces, there is a manga which gives every answer and even shows new things. If you want to read a life changing story with some mystery sauce, buy it and play it. The first EP starts a little bit slow but when you finish it you will understand that even those slow scanes were actually very important and not just some fillers to make the story longer.

I do mean that. There is zero player interaction, this may as well just be a picture book. It isn't a game by any definition. But if you're into that: cool. It still sucks. The game features an interesting cast of characters with many complex relationships. But they don't matter. You might care at first. The game made me care for the first 12 hours or so. I wanted to know where the story was going. 36 hours in, and it hasn't gone anywhere. The game just keeps looping the same events, making them slightly more disturbing each time around. I really can't explain the full depths of the problems of this game without spoiling it, but since my main goal here is to stop you from playing it by any means I will go ahead and not even bother hiding spoilers. This is your warning. If you are really really really dumb and want to play this really really awful game, stop reading this review.\n\nEverything from here on is dedicated to helping you make peace with your incredibly intelligent choice to turn your nose up at this game and never touch it. So it starts with a premise of a fairly straight forward family gathering, it seems like it is going to be a murder mystery over dear old grandpa's inheritance. A bit cliche but whatever. I wanted to give it a chance. A cliche plot can still be well executed. This game is anything but well executed. You're just stuck in this same two-ish day loop watching the same people die over and over and over and over again. They just kept dying and by the time that half the cast had died for the third time you don't even care about them dying anymore. Also the plot goes from believable period mystery to bizzarre magic supernatural plot in the blink of an eye. It is nonsense. You're told to resist this witch, to not believe in her no matter what, despite having magic done right in front of your face. Despite the fact that's she summoning demons and dragging you through pocket dimensions, and teleporting and who knows what else. The sound track doesn't exist. I don't know why the game has it labeled as having a good one, the majority of the game is silent which just makes you aware of how much time you're waisting. The only sound effects is this one really really gross noise they play when gory stuff happens. Also: there's just random descriptions of really gory things for the sake of gory things. Just because. It got disgusting by the end. \n\nIt is terrible. It is slow. Death is meaningless. Life is meaningless. It is all meaningless and stupid in the world of Umineko. Screw this game and everything about it. The game does one thing right: accurately depicts what it is like to be held captive and tortured by an annoying pretentious old woman. Who you're told doesn't exist. \n\nI hate this game as I hate hell, all Montagues, and whoever gave it such misleading good reviews in the first place. \n\nThe buyer's remorse is so strong I haven't bought a VN since for fear of it being like Umineko.", "timestamp_created": 1509408242, "timestamp_updated": 1509408242, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.162933", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36081508": {"recommendationid": "36081508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001239809", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511074506}, "language": "english", "review": "Glad I got into this finally. The fame this game has received is not misplaced. The overall premise of the game is you are shown a murder mystery involving people stuck on an island, and it is narrated to you in what appears to be complete fantasy. Don't make the same mistake I did and rush through the game thinking this is a fantasy game though. Everything is solvable without the absurd theories that are presented to you throughout the game. If you want to take part in trying to solve the mysteries given as you read through, I recommend looking through Knox's commandments on detective fiction so that you have a real shot at thinking about the murders. Note that the visual novel does not actually ever give you the explicit answers to many of the murders, instead choosing to give increasingly obvious hints to the answers as you progress through the chapters, and you'll have to go through wikis and forums for the \"answer key.\"\n\nThere's a lot here besides just mystery fiction though. This game has some great world building and a ridiculously good soundtrack. The characters all have believable backstories and motivations for their actions, and some of them are so smart and deceptive that you'll be thrown for a loop at least a few times throughout the read. Admittedly, the first chapter was somewhat dull on the first read, since the setting and characters feel very generic. If you keep reading though, you'll be as addicted as me and ruin your life for a few weeks by the ridiculous story that this game has to offer. You don't have to be a mystery fan to enjoy this experience. Umineko spans many different genres.\n\nDefinitely install the PS3 version art patch and voice patch as well.

I'm a mystery fan, and the story is set up to be a perfect mystery: a cast of interesting, mostly-likable characters with extensive interpersonal drama and interesting reasons to hate each other, all trapped on an island when bodies start dropping. It's set 99 years after the first Sherlock Holmes mystery, and the author has a keen appreciation for mystery tropes. Like a lot of the classic mysteries, there's a tension between natural and supernatural explanations, but clearly the natural will - inevitably, as per the genre - win out.\n\nNope! No explanations, no natural solution. The second arc happens, instaed, and the genre changes completely. Now it's supernatural horror with a deliberately meta edge. Now the plot consists of the likable characters being tortured forever by a vicious and omnipotent witch, a GM with limitless powers whose goal is 'make the cast suffer before they die', and the possibility of a happy ending is absurd as that of a solution inside the mystery genre.\n\nI like dark stories - up to a point. This point: when all hope is extinguished. When the second arc got into full swing, I stopped caring what happened to anyone. Sure, there's some variation in what could happen - how they're doomed - but they're all doomed. The only question is how, and given villainous omnipotence, I don't care about how.\n\nIt's absolutely a \"love it or hate it\" game. Most people love it. I don't. I really don't.

There even go out of their way to change some of the text, to match the ps3 if the content is superior then the pc versions. including spilling currishness that mange gamer missed. \n\nnow it is time for the review of the oviler story and major spillers of exsompes chapter 2 of umineko? \n\nUmineko when they cry. in the nutshell was about that the battler left his father. To be with his maternal grandparents for six years. He does sometimes came back to see ange his sister on her birthday dispatch his bad teems with his father. \nThe fact is he lived with his grand parites, rising him until they died from old age.  he comes up to the family conference  to catch up with his cosines. as  latter as he and his siblings knows the Ushiromiya family will be killed by Beatrice as the greedy family gets a meeting determining they inhaseses. of the uncles Kinzo near dearth money. that does not pin out when Beatrice. the legal adviser, will do any means to keep her power and influence like returning her 1 billion dillers worth of assets including dearth of Family to pay back the loan that kinzo contracted with Beatrice the witch that made the Ushiromiya family rich over night. who in fact might not be the witch sense it is unclear in the novel.\n\nsadly this story flase apart quickly with insistences and confusions. that battler is trying to proof that britrace is one big phony. and this watch story was in place to scaere the greedy family. on October 4th at midnight 6 people will die at once. tune on October 5th, a coppy will die, after that 2 hours 1 will die with hand, arm, leg and chest. (than the great powerful britrace witch will be re-vive on October 7th). so if the game is surpassed to prove that people is casing this deaths. how in the world in October 4th that all 6 people who are servants- meads. got killed with perfectly lock doors from the inside. with are 6 having keys with the packets. on top of that there are no copies or spire keys unless you go inside Kinzo Ushiromiya chambers, which is no passable way of going inside without kinzo's own key. on type of that he is died. so battler explains, for this is that one of the servants being in traps on all the 6 rooms. that can only work when kinzo is the mastermind. the thing is hife a hour later reading the novel you found that kenzo himself cannot live his chambers without his head servant named Genji Ronoue both keys mast be inside before his door can open. so next you can assume that genji is the mastermind of the murder. that fells also. when he was the first person who got killed. than the player thanks that the Ushiromiya family must've accidently found a securest door inside kinzo chambers  and killed him for inashsers. again the 4th time does not work out, Beatrice the surpaonaglly witch will turn who words  white to red from the screen when Beatrice including battler are telling the truth. Beatrice sies in red that there is no secret rooms. so basely battler is trapped in this chess gameborld for over 1000 years like in higurashi with Furude Rika . then you as the player mast thank it is the work from a witch, 5th time fells apart like I sied above than the great powerful Beatrice which will be re-vive on October 7th, meaning the witch is a ghost. so if witches or humans are not responsible how can you beat the game you can't, this is one of the reasons why this novel why make you thank and question of what is going on awand you.\n\nI will make this clear Furude Rika, from the higurashi when they cry might be Frederica Bernkastel  in unineko when they cry. this novel has a very complicating nature for new comers for this reason.\nThat for this reason. I strongly advised reading higruashi chapter 7 Minagoroshi-hen not yet avoidable on steam but can be found here http://erogedownload.com/downloads/higurashi-when-they-cry-kai-minagoroshi/ . explained , you see Rika always dies on may 31st. at the age of 13. so every time; she dies she is reborn. in the same island of Hinamizawa is august 21 1972 her 1st birthday. now in most cases when this happens the soil has no say which or when she is burned although. her spart guide Hany\u016b from unineko when they cry uses her influence to being her back to this touchiest chess game bored that Rika is fighting this unknown entitle for over 1000 years.\n\nnow here's The problem with this, it is unclear that bernkastel and Rika are the same person?\n\n The only way for this to work out is when Rokkenjima and Hinamizawa are in the same time frame in 1986. even if that was the case how can Rika who is alive in higurashi, be in spirit on umineko. this does not make any sense. on lose every time she dies on may 31 times x years, she helps out battler. that again cannot be the case when August 21, times x years, Rika is born and always dies at may 31st except in Meakashi-hen and Watanagashi-hen that Rika killed herself with a knife on may 28th. so Bernkastel or Furude Rika , how are you helping him on October 4th and 5th 1986. unloose Bernkaseal was a supported being? even that's been proven false? because in the anime version of higurashi no naku koro ni episode 24 Festival Accompanying Chapter Eleven \u2013 End, Frederica Bernkastel appears in higurashi when they cry. so most people like me thick there are the same person.\n\nnow back to umineko. \n\ndispect it's very compacted nature I do really love the characters expertly  Maria Ushiromiya, and the soundtrack is lovely excpaplly the 11a_worldend, worldenddominator, hope(ver1.00), apathy, and 08_deadangle  from inside the bgm folder. it smooth and relaxing with the fare of unknown. with the right amount of tension to the series. I also like the fact the book is a puzzle that the player needs thick of their point of view in the game. The fact that battler challenges the witch, of his crazy immigration, trying to outwit her is sometimes funnier. I'll even go so far to say that id a fun of higurashi. this sequel or same series is even stronger. of its writing \nhowever dispatch of this if you are a comer I cannot stress from above that reading Da Capo 3 R,\nor CLANNAD, sense there are more western style. but if you want to give this a go you can just be way this might be frustration. or leading you to a lot of questions.\nif you are not sere ill even advised to watch the anime of it on kissanime. even the 90% of people including.

The plot was a perfect set-up for murder mysteries so when I heard Umineko involves a lot of witches and magic I wasn't sure if I'm gonna like it, in a sense it was like how Battler was trying to deny the witch using human logic. I was so sure that putting magical elements in the story would just complicate and mess up the setting, and it did but surprisingly not in a bad way. Infact Umineko's story thrives on these themes. \n\nThis is what makes Umineko great! by adding these elements it forces you to keep thinking (\"Turn the chessboard around\") to understand it further. It never felt repetitive even if the events themselves keeps repeating, and its all thanks to the addition of magic. never have I thought that magic would really add to the mystery side of the story, to help you better understand what I mean I'll give you a minor background [strike]spoiler[/strike] of the story.\n\nIt starts of with a annual family conference about the inheritance of the familiy's wealth on an isolated island called rokkenjima, when a typhoon passes through isolating the island. The basic premise of the story is  [spoiler] a battle between Battler a resident of the island and BEATRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICHE the rumored golden witch who supposedly gave the head of the family 10 tons of gold which became the foundation of the familiys wealth, and in the center of it all an epitapth containing the location the hidden gold promising to give both gold and headship to the person who solves the riddle. The battle of Inheritance turns into a massacre said to be a ritual to ressurect the witch. The tragedy would then sparked a game with both trying to explain how the massacre occured, with no one truly understanding what really happened to the island it created the illusion of the massacres being done by a witch. where magic and reality can simultaneously exist until the truth is revealed. the fight continues with Battler using [strike]twisted[/strike] Human logic to explain that the mysteries can be done by humans while Beatrice explaining the existences of witches and magic as the culprit. Putting them into an Endless battle to understand their own existence and to reveal what really happend in the island.[/spoiler]\n\nFrom there an epic story about mystery and fantasy is set. Honestly the story is so crazy and confusing that it makes it look like it doesn't make sense, yet the way Umineko explains it makes it sensible, Kinda like a paradox. The writing is really brilliant from references to its underlying themes and use of logical concepts such as Devils proof, Hempels raven and Schrodingers cat, the game perfectly encorporated them to further enhance the story. The soundtrack on the other hand is outstanding it really adds to the experience from the cheerful organ pieces that plays on tense situations to its haunting orchestrals and calm piano pieces, its such a pleasure listening to. I can go on about the things I love about this game but I'll stop it at that. \n\n[h1]Truly this game is an ENDLESS! masterpiece![/h1] if I can say it in red but I'll settle it with blue since this is my own opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1505394829, "timestamp_updated": 1505459130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663783", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34873905": {"recommendationid": "34873905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019995899", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513196953}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game.

The setting may first appear familiar, even after reading the first episode, but when you get to the meat of it, you'll understand how very unique this whole thing is. The writing of Ryukishi07 improved compared to his previous works and can range from super whacky screaming to intelligent conversation.\n\n[u]\"So, is it better than the anime?\"[/u]\nThe story is very long and very densely written. There are people who might find that off-putting, on the other hand you get to know the characters a lot better and might find different sides about them. Also, you get the whole story with all the clues to the core mysteries, because nothing was cut out. So, if you care for the story, the characters, their thoughts, the world and the mysteries (which honestly you should), then yes, this is better than the anime.\n\n[u]\"I know about Higurashi, how are they related?\"[/u]\n[b]Short answer:[/b] They are about as connected as the Command & Conquer Tiberium universe and the Red Alert universe.\n[b]Long answer:[/b] The setting, characters (most of them), the story etc. are unrelated to each other. Umineko tends to reference Higurashi here and there, but it's in no way important to understand the plot. The way the chaperts are seperated from each other is similar to the way Higurashi did it.\n\n[u]\"Even though you love it, are there things you don't like about it?\"[/u]\nThere are indeed: In the first episodes are about two or three scenes with stupid sexual jokes that are completely unncecessary and I don't like that. Fortunately, things like these don't ever appear again so I can pretty much ignore them.\n\n[u]tl;dr lol[/u]\nBuy it if...\nyou like visual novels or want to try them out,\nyou like whacky and crazy stories,\nyou like murder mystery stories", "timestamp_created": 1502753547, "timestamp_updated": 1502753954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33919430": {"recommendationid": "33919430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027345625", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512686963}, "language": "english", "review": "A true masterpiece. I orignally completed Umineko from its original release, but oh boy, this remaster does not disappoint at all. It's hard to tell from looking at the promotion material, but this game - more technically a visual novel - is far, far more than what it seems. \n\nThe story is fantastic; a stimulating murder mystery (or fantasy, that's up to you), one of the only few where you'll try to guess the outcome, to be only so very, very wrong, but for all the right reasons. This is a story where you must pay attention to all the small things, skimming over paragraphs of text will ruin the experence, but i promise you that if you follow patiently, you'll be well rewarded.\n\nVisually, it's had a serious makeover and it does wonders. Backgrounds are vibrant and portray the story perfectly and the new character sprites are a wonderful addition.  There is the option to play with the original sprites but i won't blame you for using the remastered sprites. \n\nAudio design and soundtrack is fantastic, you MUST play with music on, 100% recommend using headphones.

Come back, I need you!  \n\nThe story is fun.  A little maddening, but it has a lot to say about your perceptions and how you react to especially the horrible things that happen in your life (more than just the murders).  The first arc is pretty straight forward, but after that it weaves in magic, with, especially at the end, the knowledge that all the deaths could happen without magic and that most of what you're seeing is twisted to make it look like it was done by magic.  That said, Battler is a bit of an idiot.  I kept wanting to yell at him to ask certain questions that he didn't get around to sometimes until arcs after the fact and then they were proven incorrect.  He also gives in, a lot, so all his proclaimations that he'll take it seriously this time, tend to fall a little flat.  \n\nAlso, Ange's story in the fourth arc was a little maddening and a little too depressing.  I liked the stuff about Maria, that was wonderful, but it took me a long time get into Ange.  \n\nAnd then I was left hanging.  \n\nThis is a purely reading experience.  It has some pretty pictures, though they're repetitive and often don't show what the character is seeing and are just mood setting backdrops for the most part, though obviously some rooms are there.  The characters are nice to look at, though again, have limited poses they take to show their emotions.  And the characters they choose not to update in the last arc are really distracting, and I wish they'd done everybody, even if they were only for that arc because it was really weird.\n\nThe music is spot on, and the text is translated beautifully with hardly any mistakes that I could see and is a lot better than a lot fo heavy reading material I've picked up from Japan in a while. \n\nThough, as I said, this is a text reading story. You're not in control of what Battler says, all you can do is click and make the next line of text appear.

This is a novel that is so vast in scope and so culturally influential, that it has an entire field of academic study dedicated to it, called Redology. Chinese literature scholars dedicate their entire careers to the critical analysis of this novel.\n\nUmineko is the Red Chamber of our generation. \n\nAs a work of art, Umineko has a certain quality that all literary masterpieces share: it tells a very specific story, but uses its specificity to express universal themes that all of us can relate to. If not for the mainstream bias against genre fiction and the visual novel medium, Umineko would be studied in postmodern literature classes, alongside the likes of One Hundred Years of Solitude. For me, Umineko has an even greater impact than many of the postmodern works I've experienced, because instead of focusing on experimental narrative techniques solely for experimental purposes, Umineko's unorthodox storytelling style exists for an important reason - to enable its exploration of underrepresented issues that resonate strongly with people like me, in a way that validates our perspectives. Ryukishi07's background as a social worker absolutely shows in his writing. \n\nYes, for those of you who love mysteries, Umineko is a love letter to the genre; it will torture you with a mental challenge that you will never forget. For those of you who love gore and despair, Umineko serves up a delectable feast of horrors, with a roulette of delights that will never leave your palate bored or overwhelmed. For those of you who love witches and magic, you will fall in love with the golden witch and her fantastical feats, whose legends and stories will live on endlessly. \n\nBut above all else - for those of you who have ever struggled with the terminal condition known as being human, this game is for you. \n\nUmineko is a brutally honest take on humanity and the role of storytelling in our lives, exploring its diverse cast of characters with love and clear-eyed objectivity in equal measure. And for some of us, Umineko resonates even more strongly, to the point that reading it may be excruciating. I will say nothing else on the matter - those of you who understand, will understand when you read it. \n\nAll that said, there is one thing you should know. Umineko is designed with one rather thrilling peculiarity. And that is: you get out of Umineko exactly what you put into it. \n\nIf you're not emotionally ready for it, or blast through it without much thought, Umineko may end up being just another story to you. But if you really take the time, pay attention, and above all, never stop thinking - then the witch will bestow countless gifts upon you, and welcome you to the Golden Land. This isn't the kind of lazy postmodern story that gives you nothing but a blank canvas full of random noise, that puts all the responsibility on the reader to create a meaningful story. This is an equal partnership of love. Umineko respects you and wants to meet you halfway - if you respect it in return and put in the effort to truly understand it. \n\nThis is a question with an answer, a truth that you can reach. But it's a truth that's complex and multifaceted enough that you will be thinking about it for a thousand years to come. I know I certainly am. \n\nMy understanding of Umineko is different from when I first read it, and I have no doubt that my understanding will continue to change in the years to come. I cried when I finished the final episode of the Answer Arc, even though I understood nothing. My actual journey began after that, when I started digesting the story and reading discussions about it online. I turned it over and over in my mind, licking and tasting and sucking on all its myriad flavours. And as I did, Umineko changed me - and is still continuing to change me. It was one of the major catalysts that helped me grow as a person, to be more mature, to have more empathy for the people around me. \n\nThis is a story that I can see myself returning to in a year, in a decade, in a century, and coming away with different nuances and perspectives every single time. In that sense, I will forever be trapped in the catbox known as Rokkenjima. \n\nWon't you join me? \n\nThis story is best paired with good friends, hot tea, and most crucially, the original sprites drawn by the author himself. Take your time with it. Savour it.

It has shown me the world from a new perspective.\n2. I don't think I'll ever experience anything like Umineko again in my remaining lifetime.\n\nIt's extremely surreal, unique and stylish. You don't \"read\" it; you \"experience\" it, as it violently devours you, chews you up and spits you back out into its dark, magical and absurd world filled with batshit insane but impeccably executed murder mysteries, battles of wits and character drama. Umineko's sprawling story contains an unbelievable number of twists and turns that never stops giving, never relents, and never compromises. It always manages to top your expectations, to outdo itself in ways that are nigh impossible to predict..It's writing is rapturous, jubilant, energetic, profound, defiant, heartwarming, hearless, relentless, cruel, sadistic, romantic, psychotic, and edgy as fuck.\n\nIt's out of control. \n\nBut you know what, it's edgy, but not depraved. It perfectly understands what it means to be \"human,\" to love, to show compassion and kindness. Each and every single one of its characters are three-dimensional humans, and by the end of this sprawling story, you'll feel like you understand them even better than they understand themselves - such is the magic of Umineko's writing. The human heart lies at the very core of Umineko's story, and some mysteries are simply unsolvable unless one considers the \"whydunnit,\" or the '\"motive\" side of the equation. Umineko constantly reminds the reader of this fact through it's most important mantra:\n\n\"Without love, it cannot be seen.\"\n\nAs for the more technical murder mystery side of things,\nUmineko is a passionate love letter to the entire mystery genre.\nIt's a tribute to the great classical authors and thinkers who founded and nurtured the \"mystery\" label. \nIt's a tribute to Agatha Christie and her impossible closed room mysteries \nit's a tribute to Knox, S.S Van Dine, and many many other great thinkers who crafted and perfected the rules for writing mysteries. \nIt is an extremely compelling mystery that makes you think for yourself. It goes to extreme lengths to give you all the puzzle pieces, then explicitly tells you to connect the dots by yourself. \nAnd when all the answers [b]do[/b] fall into place, the only thing you can do is gasp. And that, my friend. is the mark of a good mystery.\n\nYou gotta read it to believe it. Really.\n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\nAs for the soundtrack, what can I say that hasn't already been said before? I've played hundreds of games in my life, many of them with terrific soundtracks, but few has come close to Umineko's unreal soundtrack. From classy piano pieces to blood-pumping trance tracks, everything is here, and everything is amazing. During somber scenes, I  choke on my own tears. During climactic scenes, I want to grab a baseball bat, smash all the windows in my house, light the curtains on fire, and break my laptop in half. It doesn't get any more effective than that. Look up WorldendDominator, Miragecoordinator, or GoldenSlaughterer on Youtube. \n\n\nTLDR: \nNothing I write can truly do this visual novel justice. Umineko is an experience of a lifetime, a feast for the senses, a banquet for the mind. It's shocking, oftentimes moving. It's surreal; it's stylish;  it's mind-bending, and it pushes the very boundaries of what [b]plain good[/b] writing can accomplish.", "timestamp_created": 1496643672, "timestamp_updated": 1498795302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763257", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32186294": {"recommendationid": "32186294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067586521", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510974736}, "language": "english", "review": "The question arc in Umineko is one of the few series I would give a 10/10 for.

They can do things books can't, of course neither is better than the other but give equally enjoyable experiences. With Visiual novels you find yourself, not working with the main character, but at your own pace to find your own answer to the closed room murders.\n\nNow, more about the actual plot:\n\nUmineko is a murder mystery about 18 rich people stuck on an island while murders are occuring. The main plot is between the main character, battler, trying to prove that the murders were done by humans, and not a witch with any supernatural abilities.\n\nMost of the characters are as equally loveable and sympathetic as they are detestable.\n\nAbout the author:\nfor someone who hasn't read anything by Ryukishi07 umineko might be a little confusing by episode 2. They way this series is written is each 'episode' gives a different view of the events. While things start out similar on the next episodes they're totally different, or give a totally different viewpoint of the murders. They're not like a sequel to each other more as they're a parallel telling of the story\n\nOverall rating: \nI have already read the entire series. There's 8 'episodes' in total.

It's a tale of friendship and worlds that everyone is capable of creating for themselves.

(Once the Core Arcs are on Steam, that definitely adds more layers of worlds to this tale, and helps with understanding it all.) It is a tale that is meant to be enjoyed slowly, thought over for endless nights, and read over again simply to be welcomed back to the inviting and spectacular cast we've all come to know and love.\n\nIf you try anything new, please make in Umineko.

With each episode the game got better - and i love it. Umineko has no interactive scenes though, that means it only consists of reading text (like a novel). Be prepared for that if you`ll buy it.

For those familiar with the Higurashi When They Cry series, question arcs present a mystery scenario where the same event occurs but with little differences, such as different persepectives and different minor events.  It is up to the reader to figure out how to solve those mysteries although the question arcs don't give the reader the answer right away.  The answers are reserved for the answer or core arcs.  Thus, Umineko has only the question arcs for now although hopefully, the core arcs will come on Steam sometime in the future.\n\nIn Umineko, the reader mostly takes on various roles (the first arc is from Battler Ushiromiya's perspective, the second is a more third person perspective, the third has Eva Ushiromiya's and Beatrice's perspectives, and the fourth has Ange Ushiromiya's and Battler's perspectives) and we're introduced to the island of Rokkenjima.  The first question arc sets up the scenario nicely where we're introduced to Battler and his family members who plan to go to the island for the annual family conference that takes place on October 4, 1986.  The siblings, including Battler's dad, plan to argue over their father's inheritance, as it is reported that he doesn't have much time to live.  However, after the family members arrive on the island and get settled in, a series of horrific murders take place and these murders are so bizarre that there is the question of whether magic exists.  I won't say anything more than that, for spoiler purposes, but that's basically how most of the question arcs proceed.  Starting from the second to fourth arcs, they're played as a game between Battler and the golden, endless witch Beatrice in the \"meta-world\" where Battler argues that the murders can happen because of humans while Beatrice argues that witches and magic exist.  So that's how the stories in the Umineko question arcs proceed.\n\nAs to my opinion, I really enjoyed Umineko.  As much as I like the Higurashi When They Cry series, I'm having difficulty deciding whether I like Higurashi or Umineko more.  It's just that good.  The writing is excellent and I love the whole premise of treating things as a game.  Also, I am a fan of mysteries so I got invested in trying to figure out how certain events could have happened.  Especially, I like the fourth arc because we get to see Ange's perspective, as she was not on Rokkenjima at the time, so she investigates as to what happened.  Also, I like Ange's personal story, as I could relate to it a lot.  Of course, the end of the fourth arc leaves off on a cliffhanger and I really want the core arcs to come on Steam so I can continue the Umineko story.  In addition, I like the additional features that get unlocked after you finish an episode, like the tea parties, ???, and tips that give additional information to help solve the mysteries.  I wish that there would have been additional features unlocked, like getting to replay certain chapters.  That feature is present in the Higurashi series but not in Umineko.\n\nOverall, I highly enjoyed Umineko and although it did take me a while to finish it, it was definitely time worth spent.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes visual novels and doesn't mind reading through a kinetic novel.  Even though there aren't any choices, just reading it got me engrossed and I want to find out what happens next.  I want to find out how the next game board will be set up.  Of course, Higurashi fans will enjoy Umineko as well although it isn't necessary to have played any of the Higurashi games.  There are a couple of Higurashi references and you will probably figure out who one of the Umineko characters is tied to in Higurashi but other than that, you can entirely skip over playing Higurashi.  So if you're wanting to read an enjoyable mystery that'll leave you guessing (and if you don't mind the horror aspects, as I should warn that there are some), I'd highly recommend picking up Umineko.  ^^", "timestamp_created": 1493301075, "timestamp_updated": 1493301075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632631", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31354168": {"recommendationid": "31354168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025927627", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502322560}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really life-changing game!

it introduced a wide variety of fleshed-out characters that all have unique contributions to the story, created a strong narrative with these characters in between all the mysteries, taught me new points of view in life, made me audibly laugh on a few occasions, spooked me without jumpscares, made me cry, and had an incredible soundtrack to boot. Again, the soundtrack is something to be admired and is the enhancing agent for this whole story, Turning a happy scene into a brief respite from the story's horrors, a turning-point into a heart-throbbing catharsis, a debate into a tantalizing final struggle between rivals, the list goes on. \n\nUmineko does have its shortcomings however so i'll stop praising it for just a moment to address these. Despite the strength of the soundtrack, the novel\u2019s sound effects are average at best, with some of them becoming quite overused due to their lack of variety. The pacing of the story is a little wonky. So if you aren't the type of person who is fine with 6 hours of character back-stories and conversations that allude to the themes of the story, Umineko will be aggravating for you. \n\nThis product's main weakness however, is the Steam version of this game being mostly inferior to the PS3 version, this is due to a lack of voice acting and the Steam version's lower quality sprites and backgrounds. Though, this problem can be remedied with a 3GB download after a quick google search \"Umineko PS3 Patch\".\n\n\n[b] A quick review of the strong/weak points [/b]\n+Great story with many facets\n+One of the greatest soundtracks ever made\n+Relatable and round characters \n+The mystery is both enthralling and exciting to try and solve\n+This story departs from many visual novel tropes \n\n-The sound effects could be improved \n-The slow pacing may dissuade people from reading it\n-A 3rd party download is needed to get an optimal experience\n-Battler says some creepy shit sometimes\n\nI will end this by saying if you had the patience to read this review in full and have even a slight interest in the mystery genre, get this novel. Also I recommend getting a set colored pens and a notebook.\n\nA side note: Umineko Question Arc is the first 4 episodes of an 8 episode series.

Umineko isn't a game in the traditional sense, but a sound novel, which means it's mostly not interactive and should be viewed as a book with art, voice acting* and a soundtrack.\n\nthe premise of the novel resembles that of a classic murder mystery, but without going into more detail, it evolves into a story that involves so much more - even if you're put off by the initial premise, i'd still recommend giving the book a go. it made a huge impression on me and is an experience i'm likely to never forget.\n\nthe list of positives about the novel is too huge for me to write up, but the biggest thing I fell in love with was the depth - it's a story that you can easily dive into if you have the time, and it's truly immersive and well written from the intricate plot to the fleshed out character cast. the soundtrack is also insanely good and I still find myself listening to many of the tracks. \n\nas for what might put some readers off - this game/book requires your full attention when progressing through the story, and really urges the reader to think. it works on \"show, don't tell\" principles, so some readers might be left thinking \"wait what?\" at some parts of the story. it's extremely hard to ever predict what happens next, and some parts might be hard to understand without further research.\n\nUmineko as a whole is a very compelling read and deserves a 10/10 rating from me - it might be a bit slow at the start for some, but the payoff that comes with finishing the series feels extremely rewarding. it's been a month or two since I finished my initial readthrough, and I still find myself thinking about the universe and its characters. for me, that's what really makes a great book/game/whatever you want to call it - lasting appeal and impact.\n\n*voice acting isn't included in the steam patch, but the ps3 patch of the game includes (arguably) better sprites and voice acting. the voice acting is actually really good and adds a lot to the personalities of the characters, so I'd highly recommend getting it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485796654, "timestamp_updated": 1485796654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29577401": {"recommendationid": "29577401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030748605", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485735680}, "language": "english", "review": "The first four chapters of an eight chapter series.\nI enjoyed it.

In fact, I felt the intro sequence was quite stiff and difficult to adjust to. However, what followed was a mind-bending, unsettling, yet moving tale that left my jaw wide open. Umineko goes beyond the normal definition of \"mystery.\" It challenges the reader to consider a wide range of perspectives. It breathes life into the characters, making it difficult for one not to sympathize with those who may be considered evil or antagonistic. The soundtrack is lovely and fitting, contributing greatly to the overall atmosphere of the novel. I would reccomend reading Umineko after reading Higurashi. It's not required, but it grants one a unique perspective to approach Umineko initially. Also, Umineko contains many references to characters and events from Higurashi.\n\nOverall, Umineko is a fantastic novel and I reccomend it to anyone who's willing to invest their time into it.", "timestamp_created": 1484571880, "timestamp_updated": 1489479123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29130281": {"recommendationid": "29130281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007865106", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512023227}, "language": "english", "review": "(Ignore my (EDIT: relatively) low playtime here. I own a non-Steam version from a few years back, and have poured countless hours into that.)\n\nUmineko, out of all the stories I've read, is probably my single favourite work of fiction. I don't think anything's moved me quite as much as Umineko has, before or since I first read it. It's changed the way I think and approach others, definitely for the better.\n\nThe basic premise isn't the most original thing in the world - it's very apparent that it was inspired by And Then There Were None, and it doesn't shy away from other references to its inspirations - but the attention to detail put into how it's done is superb.\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal - while I wouldn't go listening to some of the songs from it on my own, I wouldn't skip through any of them if they were to start playing. The game's use of the soundtrack is also masterful - Ryukishi07 is very skilled at building an atmosphere, through writing and use of music together.\n\nThe cast of characters is quite sizeable (starting at 18, and it only grows from there!), but all of the key characters are wonderfully fleshed out, and most of them are explored in-depth. Some of them aren't explored as much, which is unfortunate, but it's still clear that a lot of thought and love went into every single character. They all feel like real human beings, with their own strengths and flaws, their own shining, heroic qualities, and their own base, selfish, sometimes even cruel ones.\n\nUmineko is definitely not for everyone - it's quite long and very dense, and it can get difficult to follow exactly what's important and what isn't later on. Having said that, I would very highly recommend it - it's a masterfully written work. While it's got its flaws (the writing is slightly clumsy at times, and the pacing can be quite messy), the amount of thought, love, and care that went into writing it shines through brightly. $30 might sound a bit steep (for those of us in Canada at least, hooray exchange rates!), but it's more than a fair price for the amount of content you get.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to the arrival of Chiru and Golden Fantasia.\n\nEDIT Jan 27th: I kinda wish I'd remembered this earlier - the PS3 version patch. Opinions on the Steam sprites aside, the PS3 patch also includes redrawn backgrounds and voice-overs. Personally, I'd consider the voicework essential to the experience - Sayaka Ohara's performance as Beatrice is phenomenal, and there are some important details in the dialogue that simply don't translate to English at all.

Thing is, Umineko is an odd beast, and even assigning it a genre would be grossly misleading. At its heart, however, it is a Deconstruction, of the Mystery genre, the Fantasy genre and of half a dozen other things whenever it feels like it.\n\nThe plot starts slow and simple: A family reunion on an isolated island, hints of magic and the occult and a perfect setup for a Murder Mystery that directly references Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. I will admit, a huge chunk of the first Episode is painfully slow, but it also perfectly sets up the pieces and crafted a perfect stage for confusion and uncertainty in both characters and readers. It is a prologue around 10 hours long and at times it feels a bit excessive, but once it gets going the air of paranoia and distrust seeps into the cast perfectly. Once the setup is out of the way however, Umineko descends to bizarre and wonderful places with multiple stories going at once and characters openly questioning the genre of the work they are in. It is at times a real cluster and way too obtuse for its own good, but these are, in my opinion, small sacrifices for a visual novel that is perhaps unmatched in how strange and ambitious it is. Also, note that this is only the first half of Umineko so not every question will be answered. But do no wait for the solution to be revealed because the cat box can only stay close for so long. Enjoy dissecting the story and characters and come to your own answer before the box is opened.\n\nThe cast is also a highlight. If you are familiar with visual novels, you can tell right away that Umineko is not a typical one. The cast is comprised of mostly adults and avoids any typical archetype of the genre. Many characters start off nice and simple but when the chips are down they show a side to them that is both surprising and understandable in retrospect. Some episodes focus on a few specific characters, giving strong insight into their psychology and making them increasingly morally questionable and yet undeniably sympathetic. It is a testament to the writing that not one character can be singled out as the one who is there to be the moral compass or the villain. They are people first and foremost and their actions and personality are always understandable given the hand they were dealt.\n\nAs for the visuals, you know what you are getting into. The game comes with new sprites (and a few CGs) as well as the original ones. The Steam graphics are somewhat grittier and more realistic (occasionally absurd breasts aside) while the originals have a unique charm to them and are also amazingly expressive. Unfortunately the PS3 sprites, which is the cleanest and also most anime-y of the lot, isn't included in the package. I personally find the new sprites to be a good alternative to the original, but as someone who really prefers the PS3 sprites, they are both rather wanting. You can form your opinion by looking at the screenshots, but I will say that I liked them a lot more than I thought I would once I'm in the actual game. It is also a real shame that the voice acting, which was exclusive to the PS3 version, was removed because the actors really brought their A game. I do not want to talk about things that are not in this release but I will wholeheartedly recommend grabbing the patch that brings back the voice acting and the PS3 sprites because the voices are wonderful. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is as perfect as ever, and that is all that needs to be said.\n\nIf you have not played Umineko, chances are you are here because you played/watched Higurashi or, worse, watched the anime adaptation. If this is the case I urge you to discard any presumption on what this visual novel is. There are similarities to Higurashi here, and the anime technically follows the same plot line as Episode 1-4, but neither of them are indicative of what Umineko is. I do realize that this review did very little to illuminate on what Umineko is actually about, but trust me when I say that explaining that would be as counterproductive as it would be impossible. If you like the format of Visual Novels, if you like Murder Mystery, if you like character study and if you like something that is just plain strange, give Umineko a shot. I cannot say you won't regret it, but you'll certainly see something you haven't seen before.\n\nNote: Do note that I finished the game once already, but not the steam version. Do know that my playtime is not at all indicative of the actual playtime of the game. 10 hours will probably get you half way through Episode 1 and all four Episodes will likely take you over 50 hours, so if you are worried about value in term of playtime, put that thought to rest.

The two do not share a plot and can be experienced separately, but rarely some characters from Umineko mention minor plot points or concepts from Higurashi. It is inspired by Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None and S. S. Van Dine's The Greene Murder Case, sharing themes such as members of a same family being under threat, and people being stuck on an island with a murderer on the loose.\nUnlike most visual novels that get to the West, there is little to no interactivity to Umineko in general and none at all in  Episodes 1 through 4 here, which make up the first half of the complete novel. There is no gameplay, no choice-making, no dating system. Just reading and listening to the soundtrack (which, by the way, is awesome). It is, effectively, no more than a novel with music, background art and character sprites. But what a novel it is.\n\nUmineko's plot starts out kinda normal: you're being asked to solve murders, as in any other piece of detective fiction. But as you keep reading (= Episode 2 and on), stranger things start to come up. If you aren't deterred by these oddities and keep on reasoning instead of going \"screw that\", Umineko rewards you greatly.\nIf you are expecting a traditional murder mystery, this is not it. If you are intrigued by having to fight tooth and claw for your clues against unreliable narrators and Jedi truths which are technically true, but ambiguous and potentially misleading, Umineko is for you. While it isn't straightforward by any means, I feel it is never unfair. Its storytelling has hidden rules and it follows them closely, even if it's not immediately apparent: once you do understand the rules, you start regaining ground and fighting on equal footing. It never insults your intelligence by going \"if you didn't figure it out yourself here it is\".\n\nDon't be misled by the relatively low hour count and achievement count I have for Umineko on Steam. I've already read through all eight Episodes on the original PC version, but I simply had to pick up this one for the updated translation and... Well, general love I have for Umineko.

There are thousands of reasons why Umineko is the most unparalleled masterpiece in the history of visual novels. Umineko No Naku Koro Ni (When the Seagulls Cry) is a eight episode visual novel written by the author of the Higurashi When They Cry series, but the overall game is on a whole new scale when likened to its spiritual predecessor.\nIt all begins during the time frame of october 4 and 5, on a small, secluded island named Rokkenjima:\nThe plot begins with a flat slice of life-ish premise that could lead the readers to regard the VN as a simple-minded story: enter the entire Ushiromiya household, one of the wealthiest families in the world which struck it rich thanks to the head of the household, Kinzo, whose means of achieving his vast fortune remains shrouded in mystery. In view of the death of his aged grandparents, Battler Ushiromiya, the missing member of the household who has been living away from his parents for six years, decides to attend the gathering. Subsequently, upon coming together for the presumed last family meeting, each member is introduced, however, the situation takes a turn for the worse when a fierce typhoon preys upon Rokkenjima, the phenomenon marks the death sentence of the whole household, as one by one each member becomes the victim of a bizarre and brutal chain of murders attributed to a mysterious serial killer which later is revealed to be the Golden Witch Beatrice, Kinzo's secret lover and owner of the gold stack of the island. Battler refuses to believe in magic in spite of the given evidence, and concludes that the culprit of the accident is merely the 19th and hidden human on Rokkenjima, until the ultimate proof is shown to his eyes: The Golden Witch in flesh and blood. This insane happening paves the road for a magnum opus in which occult, braintwisters, love, action, tenderness and sympathy intermingle with each other to give life to a true work of art that remains unsurpassed even a decade after its initial release. Pretty much everything in the VN is executed flawlessly, ranging from the ample assortment of nearly one hundred BGMs to the writing, the art, and the multiple narratives throughout the game. The author succeeds in providing an accurate portrayal of the psychological situation of every character in the game, as such, providing remarkable backstories for the entire cast. The writing is one of a kind and absolutely phenomenal, likewise the author manages to strike right into the hearth of the readers, making it one of the most stunning works of the century.\nThe first half may sound slightly slow-paced, but I can assure the readers are in for one hell of a ride, Umineko No Naku Koro Ni is the ultimate life-changing experience that simply cannot be missed if you're into visual novels or complex, intriguing and thoughtful stories. I have gone through the 100 hours of the game twice, and not once have I been unsatisfied; Umineko is a VN that can easily be replayed over and over at any age. The game is best played with the PS3 sprites patch and the voice acting which makes for a whole new experience;\nat the end of the day, I wholeheartedly am willing to replay it once again when Manga Gamer will release the Answer Arcs. Umineko simply cannot be explained with words alone, moreover it's incredibly hard to spoil to someone because of its sophisticated depth, no other VN can be compared to Umineko because no VN is as unique and breathtaking as Ryukishi's.", "timestamp_created": 1479998271, "timestamp_updated": 1491371303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

that)\n\nUmineko is a visual novel released between 2007 and late 2010 (with these episodes, the Question Arcs, being released in 2007 and 2008). It is a murder mystey/fantasy novel packed with tons of content to keep you on your toes at all times... for the most part.\n\nThe story itself is probably one of the best things I've ever read, including all visual novels, regular novels, fiction/non-fiction, etc.. In short, it involves a family going to an island that is only inhabited by the family head and a some other family members. They go there, and they recieve a letter from a mysterious entity calling themselves \"Beatrice\", saying they must find the gold hidden on the island, or she will be forced to recieve \"interest\" from them. From then on, strange things happen, and people start questioning their trust for each other, yada yada other murder mystery things.\n\nWhile the story is amazing, it DOES drag for a bit for the first 4-6 hours, basically the entire first in game day in the first episode. After that though, the story hooks you in and refuses to let go until you've ended up binging the entire episode, and it only leaves you craving more.\n\nOne thing I especially love about Umineko is how, even though it has LOTS of them (There are at least 18[!] of them introduced just in the first day of the first episode alone, and there are MANY more introduced later), it uses all its characters efficiently. You're never left feeling some characters are under utilized or under developed. Even though some characters definitely get more development than others (but really, in a cast of so many characters, can you blame them?), even the most under developed character still feels complete.\n\nAll in all, Umineko is probably one of the most visual novels, let alone novels, in the past decade. I would 100% recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1479934263, "timestamp_updated": 1479934263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26825573": {"recommendationid": "26825573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055743313", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481068642}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego (junto a su secuela) es en mi opini\u00f3n de lo mejor que puedes comprar si quieres leer una buena historia, con personajes  incre\u00edbles y la que es, sin duda alguna, la mejor banda sonora que he escuchado en mi vida.

He is a man in the midst of his final moments. He has lived a long life and in that time has amassed an incredible fortune but he is not without his regrets. Kinzo cries out to the Golden Witch, Beatrice, the witch who lent him the vast Ushiromiya fortune, and proclaims that he will return everything she has given him if he is able to see her once more before he dies. Kinzo\u2019s maddening desire sets into motion a bizarre string of serial murders on the island of Rokkenjima. In the main hall of the Ushiromiya mansion rests a portrait of the Golden Witch, Beatrice, and next to it, an epitaph detailing the location of the key to the Golden Land. The epitaph goes on, detailing a gruesome sacrificial ceremony for resurrecting the witch, and the treasures that will be acquired when the Golden Land is reached. Kinzo\u2019s children believe the one who is able to solve the riddle of the epitaph will inherit not only the witch\u2019s gold but also the headship. \n\nWithout giving too much away, the story is gripping and mysterious and will leave you awake at night, thinking about the riddle of the epitaph and the various closed-room murders. Ryukishi07, the author and artist, is a fantastic writer and he breathes life into the story\u2019s characters. An argument could be made for nearly everyone if someone were to say so-and-so was their favorite character in Umineko.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nMost people not familiar with Ryukishi07 and his work on Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni and later titles will look at the screenshots on the store and be put off right away. For those people, there\u2019s good news. A team of dedicated fans and programmers, 07th Mod, have taken the time to port the PS3 sprites, backgrounds, and voice work from the PS3 release of the game for use with the Steam release. It\u2019s not quite perfect yet but given a little more time, it will be the definitive way to experience Umineko.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a little more open-minded I\u2019d recommend sticking to the original sprites. I love both sets of sprites but I love the original just a little more. Ryukishi07\u2019s facial expressions for his characters are second-to-none and can\u2019t be so easily emulated, despite the improved body proportions of the PS3 sprites. \n\nLastly, I want to touch on the \u201cnew\u201d sprites MangaGamer included in this release of the game. They\u2019re taken from a pachinko game titled Pachi-Slot Umineko no Naku Koro Ni. I\u2019d recommend steering clear of these sprites as they have a low-quality look to them and a few characters in the 4th Episode don\u2019t even have a pachinko equivalent. In these instances, you have the Ryukishi07 sprites onscreen with the pachinko sprites and it looks terribly inconsistent. Characters also lack many of the expressions present in the original and PS3 sprites, making them feel more like cardboard cutouts than characters. \n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\nUmineko is (or was at the time of its original Japanese release) considered a sound novel rather than a visual novel due to the minimalistic graphics and the importance of sound in setting atmosphere for scenes. More than the story, more than the riddles, more than the goofy and sometimes horrifying facial expressions, what I love most about Umineko is the music. From its sound effects to the battle themes that play right before a big stand-off, the sound sets the mood for what\u2019s to come.\n\n[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly two and a half months since I read through the entirety of Umineko. From the time I completed the first Episode, I had every intention of writing a review for this game. I\u2019m the sort of person that loves the idea of visual novels more than actually reading them. Because of this, I\u2019ve amassed quite the collection over the past few years over various platforms. I assumed I\u2019d play Umineko for a few hours at most and then throw it onto my growing pile of incomplete visual novels. That wasn\u2019t the case, as you can see from my total hours played. Every hour was spent engaged in the game in some way, whether it was listening to the music, revisiting favorite scenes, or rereading parts of episodes in an attempt to better understand and attempt to solve mysteries. My final time clocked in at around 90 hours but if you\u2019re just interested in the story alone I\u2019d estimate 70-75 hours for most readers. If you\u2019re a fan of mysteries or just visual novels in general, you owe it to yourself to read through Umineko. It\u2019s as important as any Clannad, Fate/stay night, Muv-Luv, or Steins;Gate.

Although the gameplay is minimal (there are no choices) the story and characters more than make up for it. If you enjoy murder mysteries which constantly keep you guessing and force you to wrack your brain for the answers, you'll want to play Umineko. If you enjoy horror games which send chills up your spine while playing at night, you'll want to play Umineko. If you enjoy fantasy stories about battles between magical beings, you'll want to read Umineko. The story is so intricate and full of depth, you're bound to like it, and you'll keep coming back to it again and again. The only drawback, which you may notice at first, is that the story has kind of a slow beginning -- but if you just give it some time to get started, you will be in for one wild ride.\n\nI first played the game years ago when it first came out, but I'm really happy with the changes made for the Steam re-release. Personally, I liked the old sprites, but the ability to switch to the new sprites is a good alternative. I also really like the fact that you can switch between English and Japanese text instantly.\n\nLastly but certainly not least, Umineko's soundtrack is pretty amazing. Every song is memorable and properly conveys the mood of each scene. Even the lack of music, replaced by the sounds of wind or rain, does a fantastic job of immersing the reader into the story. \n\nSo in summary, if you're into those kinds of stories and visual novel kind of games, Umineko is an extremely worthwhile (and sometimes life-changing) experience, and I would recommend it to anybody who is willing to give it a read.", "timestamp_created": 1476845256, "timestamp_updated": 1476845256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646954", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26081701": {"recommendationid": "26081701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068522964", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493788480}, "language": "english", "review": "YOU FOOL!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1476676481, "timestamp_updated": 1476676481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440761", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26001700": {"recommendationid": "26001700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043087117", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473665943}, "language": "english", "review": "To be fair, I'll start this review by listing what I percieve this novel's flaws to be. It suffers from a few factors caused by its low initial budget, namely some weak sound effects and low resolution backgrounds. And, this coming from a major fan of the author, there is definitely some hammy writing in places, although some of this may be intentional. The new character sprites are good for the most part, but most of the women are unnaturally well-endowed and several characters' lines are a bit too sharp, but this will eventually be moddable to use the PS3 port's sprites in addition to the original and newest sets. Finally, there are a few moments that suffer from absolutely crippling pacing issues, especially in chapter 4. \n\nAnd yet, I wholeheartedly recommend this novel/game to anyone who thinks they can stand Ryukishi's occasional weirdness. Why? Because when the game is on and things are moving along, it's one of the most engrossing works of fiction I've ever experienced. Battles of twisted logic and brutal murder, supernatural closed room mysteries, some seriously powerful emotional scenes, and the moments when a random background detail reveals an incredible amount of depth to a character all make Umineko such a great ride at its high moments. Topping this off is the soundtrack, which is absolutely superb. The tracks have a good amount of variety considering how long this novel is, and they are a huge factor in why it's so capable of creating atmospheres of mystery, tension, horror, and whimsy so effectively.

Don't worry little fella' Uineko in deed qualifies as a game. Though not in the traditional sense of a video game. Umineko is a so-called \"Sound Novel\" by developer \"ryukishi07\". Their work (In the english realm known as the \"When They Cry\" series) focuses on mystery/\"fantasy\" novels with fitting and emotional BGS/BGM. Their games(novels) thereby have overarcing plots, though in a rather unconditonally way that the scenery and main plot more or less stays the same but the course of actions throughout the plot change from game to game.\n\nWith this rather unique way of telling a story, the games are definitely not for everyone, though I'd recommend buying the first Chapter of \"Higurashi\" to get a insight about the writing style. Up to date I think it's a perfect start to the series though it has a tough start.\nSame goes for Umineko. A lot of the intriguing plot point and turn of events come from episode 2 ongoing though nothing will be understand if the first chapter isn't played. Even then this series isn't solved in this game. This collection contains the first 4 out of 8 novels in the Umineko-Series (Also shown by the Tag \"Question Arc\" in the title). Therefore the mystery is shown and tried to explained at some points though this half is the mere start into the mystery rather than giving any real proof to substain any evidence.\nBut! even if this migt sound to some as a negative point, it definitely isn't. The emotions portrait in the stories of each arc are one of the kind to me. I might have a soft spot for neglection and brutal acts in books and stories but in my opinion Umineko tops it all, sourrounded by a perfect mystery that let's you guess through the whole 60-80 hours one might need to read through the four chapters.\n\nI probably rambled quite a bit without giving any real information if someone might buy this or not. So\n\n[b]Tl;dr:[/b] If you want a superb story with extremly well-written characters built around a unconventional mystery-story buy Umineko. It seriously is worth it. Though if you search something where you need to act on the game board rather than being forced to think outside of the games bounds than this shouldn't be your first pick.\nThs story is interesting to read but still, it won't help you when you hate reading.\n\nStill I personally love the soundtrack to this game and even when you hate Visual Novels/ Sound Novels, the soundtrack can be enjoyed even when the game isn't played", "timestamp_created": 1474801631, "timestamp_updated": 1511571002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25639885": {"recommendationid": "25639885", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999493869", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506197920}, "language": "english", "review": "You have to put a bit of time into this one, and it won't be complete or pay off till the answer arc comes out, but damn is it a hell of a ride.", "timestamp_created": 1474571254, "timestamp_updated": 1474571254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25585532": {"recommendationid": "25585532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058847855", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511272957}, "language": "english", "review": "Best books", "timestamp_created": 1474282469, "timestamp_updated": 1474282469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25574762": {"recommendationid": "25574762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083199715", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491155966}, "language": "english", "review": "i have so many questions, sweet sweet questions", "timestamp_created": 1474221642, "timestamp_updated": 1474221642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25569861": {"recommendationid": "25569861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330529875", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476627825}, "language": "english", "review": "I had played an older (non-Steam) version of this game a couple years ago, with the original art, and am so glad that this release includes the revised sprites/art - it looks SO much better!

Una leggenda narra che l\u2019isola un tempo era maledetta e che il suo nome fosse ai tempi Azukijima, e sembrerebbe che quest\u2019ultima fosse infestata da degli spiriti maligni che provocavano sventura a tutti coloro che ci si avvicinavano. Fortunatamente quest\u2019isola fu purificata da un Monaco e da allora, divent\u00f2 Rokkenjima. Avviato il gioco, scopriremo i giorni nei quali si svolger\u00e0 l\u2019intera vicenda e in seguito, avremo modo di vedere Kinzo Ushiromiya, il capofamiglia, che sar\u00e0 uno dei fulcri della narrazione della Novel. In questo dialogo introduttivo, scopriremo che Kinzo \u00e8 malato, e gli resta poco da vivere. L\u2019ormai anziano capo famiglia ha un ultimo desiderio, rivedere per l\u2019ultima volta una strega chiamata Beatrice, nonostante questa l\u2019abbia portato alla rovina non donandogli un vero erede degno della sua casata, n\u00e9 tra i nipoti n\u00e9 tra i figli. Finita la breve introduzione con Kinzo, avremo il piacere di conoscere il protagonista della storia, Battler Ushiromiya, figlio di Rudolf Ushiromiya nonch\u00e9 uno degli eredi dell\u2019anziano signore di cui abbiamo discusso poc\u2019anzi. Durante questa fase della storia avremo la possibilit\u00e0 di conoscere tutti i membri della famiglia Ushiromiya.\n\nPrima di arrivare nell\u2019isola, assisteremo al viaggio nella sua interezza, scoprendo che Battler ha la fobia dei mezzi di trasporto, rimanendo abbastanza instabile quando si trova all\u2019interno di essi. Tra un dialogo e l\u2019altro, giungeremo al porto che ci permetter\u00e0 di raggiungere l\u2019isola, introducendo una prima impiegata della villa degli Ushiromiya. Come si pu\u00f2 ben notare, tutti coloro che hanno un legame di sangue con la famiglia Ushiromiya portano negli abiti un simbolo con una aquila mono-ala, nonch\u00e9 stemma della famiglia. A portare questo simbolo vi sono pure alcuni servitori, ma questi sono molto fedeli e degni della fiducia di Kinzo, appunto per questo gli \u00e8 stato permesso di indossare tale onere. Giunti alla villa, scopriremo che Kinzo \u00e8 chiuso come al solito nel suo studio, e nessuno ha modo di accedere alla sua stanza, eccetto il suo fidato servitore, nonch\u00e9 suo amico. Questa riunione di famiglia ha come scopo la spartizione dell\u2019eredit\u00e0 di Kinzo, poich\u00e9 non ha ancora deciso come distribuire questa grossa somma di averi \u2013 anche perch\u00e9 come si vedr\u00e0 nel prologo pre-inizio del gioco, lui \u00e8 molto restivo a lasciare ai figli i suoi averi -.\n\n[h1]QUANDO I GABBIANI PIANGONO\u2026[/h1]\n\nI membri della famiglia non possono neanche lasciare l\u2019isola, proprio perch\u00e9 in quest\u2019ultima si \u00e8 abbattuta una tremenda tempesta con la possibilit\u00e0 di un tifone. Ben presto, dopo diverse introduzioni di alcuni personaggi chiave e informazioni che vengono ricavati dai dialoghi, la storia si trasformer\u00e0 in un enorme massacro di emozioni, mettendo alle strette il giocatore in un lungo e sofferente giallo. Una delle doti dello scrittore di questa Novel, \u00e8 sicuramente quello di far credere in pi\u00f9 fasi al giocatore di aver capito e compreso l\u2019andamento e la soluzione di questo incubo, portandolo per\u00f2 a essere smentito poco dopo, ritornando di nuovo in un lungo tunnel di disperazione e confusione. E\u2019 da lodare come lo scrittore riesca in qualunque situazione a sorprendere il giocatore, creando un opera alquanto priva di click\u00e8 inutili. E se giocando questo titolo vi troverete spaesati e confusi, tranquilli, vi baster\u00e0 prendervi del tempo, perch\u00e9 si tratta di una storia assai complessa, che ha bisogno di alcune dovute pause, anche perch\u00e9 tra un arco narrativo e l\u2019altro c\u2019\u00e8 un crescendo di situazioni tragiche e complesse, che mettono a dura prova l\u2019intelletto umano.\n\nLa caratterizzazione di ogni singolo personaggio, e di ogni singola situazione enigmistica della storia, \u00e8 curata in tutte le sue sfumature. E\u2019 difficile credere quanto un opera cos\u00ec complessa sia quasi priva di difetti. A dare manforte alla situazione c\u2019\u00e8 un comparto audio eccellente, con una colonna sonora che mette i brividi, e che riesce a creare quel pathos nelle giuste situazioni. Come abbiamo detto nell\u2019introduzione, MangaGamer ha messo dei nuovi Sprite \u2013 ma vi \u00e8 anche la possibilit\u00e0 di giocare con i tanti discussi sprite originali -, ben curati e molto pertinenti allo stile della narrazione. Ci\u00f2 che stona di pi\u00f9 sono sicuramente gli sfondi, visto che si tratta di background con effetti simili a quelli disponibili in maniera predefinita su Photoshop, di luoghi reali in un vedo e non vedo. Altra nota negativa \u00e8 la mancanza del doppiaggio originale, che era disponibile nell\u2019opera Giapponese, che per\u00f2, \u00e8 possibile introdurre tramite una patch amatoriale, ma che resta comunque un difetto per il titolo, visto che originalmente non sono previste in questa versione di MangaGamer.\n\n[h1]In conclusione[/h1]\n\nPer concludere possiamo dire che, Umineko: When The Cry (Question Arc) \u00e8 a tutt\u2019oggi un ottimo prodotto, un opera che non ha eguali tra le Visual Novel. Chiunque voglia una storia pazzesca e che riesca a intrattenere per tutta la sua durata, beh, Umineko \u00e8 la risposta e la soluzione. Questo arco narrativo \u00e8 soltanto l\u2019antipasto di quel che aspetta il giocatore con il secondo arco, ma che d\u00e0 gi\u00e0 al giocatore un idea ben chiara di quanto sia magnifica l\u2019opera di Ryukishi. Per noi l\u2019opera \u00e8 promossa, seppure quei piccoli difetti dovuti al porting nostrano, ma che comunque sono facilmente ovviabili con metodi \u201cartigianali\u201d.", "timestamp_created": 1473624663, "timestamp_updated": 1473624692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511093", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25461365": {"recommendationid": "25461365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120348301", "num_games_owned": 872, "num_reviews": 389, "playtime_forever": 5146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473557475}, "language": "english", "review": "Umineko is a kinetic visual novel (meaning that there are no choices, you only read) or a \u201csound novel\u201d, like the developers said (more focused on the soundtrack and BGS), brilliantly written, and with a soundtrack so good that it will literally make you lose your time sense and just keep reading.

En y pensant, vous vous perdez dans un univers immense et sans limite ; mais lorsque vous en parler, les mots que vous prononcez sont ridiculement petits, et ne refl\u00e8tent pas les sensations que vous avez ressenties par rapport \u00e0 cette exp\u00e9rience, peu importe \u00e0 quel point vous essayez. \nUmineko fait partie de ces choses. \n\nTout d'abord, qu'est-ce que \"Umineko no Naku Koro ni\", ou \"Le Sanglot des Go\u00e9lands\", si on voulait se baser sur la traduction fran\u00e7aise de son oeuvre soeur, \"Le Sanglot des Cigales\" ? Il s'agit d'un Sound Novel, particuli\u00e8rement long, d'une dur\u00e9e de huit tomes. Enti\u00e8rement lin\u00e9aire, c'est-\u00e0-dire sans aucun choix sc\u00e9naristique laiss\u00e9 au lecteur, ce jeu contient les quatre premiers tomes de la s\u00e9rie. \n\nEn ce qui concerne les d\u00e9fauts du jeu, il n'existe tout d'abord pas de traduction fran\u00e7aise. Il faut un certain niveau pour pouvoir le lire ; la traduction a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e par la team Witch-Hunt, qui m\u00e9riterait sans doute une m\u00e9daille pour avoir eu le courage de traduire un VN aussi long (plus de 150 heures si on compte les huit tomes). Mais si on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 un certain niveau en anglais, cela ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un r\u00e9el d\u00e9faut. \nEnsuite, les dessins : la version Steam contient de nouveaux sprites, qui sont loins d'avoir le m\u00e9rite des originaux (souvent jug\u00e9s \"laids\", mais qui ont l'avantage de formidablement montrer le ressenti des personnages) ou des sprites PS3, bien plus soign\u00e9s. \nEt \u00e7a s'arr\u00eate l\u00e0. Il n'y a, \u00e0 partir d'ici, plus aucun d\u00e9faut que l'on pourrait mentionner. \n(EDIT : Au final, les sprites originaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s au VN, en plus de nouveaux ! Ils sont donc disponibles pour les nostalgiques et les curieux.) \n\nCe Visual Novel -ou plut\u00f4t, Sound Novel- est un chef-d'oeuvre d'\u00e9criture. Clairement inspir\u00e9 des \"Dix Petits N\u00e8gres\" d'Agatha Christie, le lecteur est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre la noble et riche famille des Ushiromiya sur l'\u00eele de Rokkenjima, \u00eele priv\u00e9e qui fut achet\u00e9e par l'a\u00een\u00e9 de la famille, un vieillard du nom de Kinzo. Celui-ci n'a plus beaucoup de temps \u00e0 vivre. Pendant que les adultes discutent de l'h\u00e9ritage, les plus jeunes s'amusent entre eux. Mais de nombreuses l\u00e9gendes planent sur l'\u00eele : la sorci\u00e8re B\u00e9atrice, dont le portrait repose dans l'entr\u00e9e du manoir, aurait jadis donn\u00e9 dix tonnes d'or \u00e0 l'a\u00een\u00e9 de la famille. L'\u00e9pitaphe, construite sous le portrait, serait l'objet d'une \u00e9nigme pouvant mener \u00e0 cette richesse. Ces dix tonnes d'or sont-elles r\u00e9elles ? B\u00e9atrice est-elle une simple l\u00e9gende, ou existe-t-elle vraiment ? Quelle est la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'\u00e9nigme de l'\u00e9pitaphe ? Mais, bient\u00f4t, ce ne sont plus ni les d\u00e9bats concernant l'h\u00e9ritage, ni les questions concernant les l\u00e9gendes de l'\u00eele qui sont au centre de l'attention ; alors que la temp\u00eate arrive et coince nos dix-huit protagonistes sur Rokkenjima, le malheur semble arriver en m\u00eame temps que la pluie cinglante...\n\nOn pourrait croire \u00e0 un simple roman policier, \u00e0 un simple remake des \"Dix Petits N\u00e8gres\" ; mais Umineko offre bien plus que \u00e7a. Umineko est un roman policier et un roman merveilleux \u00e0 la fois, impliquant des \u00eatres qui d\u00e9passent l'entendement humain ; pourtant, le myst\u00e8re policier en temps que tel reste intact. Qu'est-ce que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ? Qu'est-ce qu'une illusion ? Plusieurs v\u00e9rit\u00e9s peuvent-elles coexister ? Sans jamais se s\u00e9parer du myst\u00e8re de Rokkenjima, l'auteur illustre des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 de nombreuses questions, sur la nature m\u00eame de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et d'une illusion, mais aussi sur la nature humaine, cherchant ainsi \u00e0 peindre des personnages auxquels l'humanit\u00e9 enti\u00e8re peut s'identifier. \n\nC'est aussi une histoire qui questionne la mani\u00e8re avec laquelle les r\u00e9cits doivent \u00eatre racont\u00e9s. J'ai beau chercher, je ne connais aucune histoire similaire \u00e0 celle d'Umineko dans sa forme d'\u00e9criture extraordinaire : l'auteur parvient \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser chaque facette du sc\u00e9nario comme un chef d'orchestre parviendrait \u00e0 diriger une centaine de musiciens \u00e0 la fois, n'en laissant pas un seul s'\u00e9garer. La complexit\u00e9 de la forme d'\u00e9criture en elle-m\u00eame est suffisante pour parler de chef-d'oeuvre. \n\nEnfin, les musiques ; comme il s'agit d'un Sound Novel plus que d'un Visual Novel, on trouve un grand nombre d'OSTs \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du jeu, toutes plus r\u00e9ussies les unes que les autres, refl\u00e9tant parfaitement telle sensation que le lecteur doit \u00e9prouver avec telle sc\u00e8ne. \n\nEn somme : si vous \u00eates capable de lire en anglais et que vous aimez les Visual Novels, jetez-vous sur cette oeuvre de ma\u00eetre. En fait, m\u00eame si vous n'aimez pas les Visual Novels en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, peut-\u00eatre que Umineko pourra vous faire changer d'avis ; car, avant m\u00eame d'\u00eatre un chef-d'oeuvre d'\u00e9criture, Umineko est une r\u00e9flexion universelle sur la nature humaine et la perception du monde qui nous entoure, qui pourra toucher quiconque le lira, pour peu qu'il soit humain.", "timestamp_created": 1472677763, "timestamp_updated": 1480026306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25152257": {"recommendationid": "25152257", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975703239", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506392573}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm tempted to gush endlessly (or until the Steam review character limit) about how much I love Umineko, and extrapolate on why its my favorite piece of fiction, or how its changed my life. But this is not the outlet for a review that in depth. Instead I'll just say these opinionated blurbs:\n\nUmineko has in it the scope and depth of a novel who is familiar with literary critical theory.\n\nI first started read Umineko over six years ago. Before and after Umineko I've read and watched hundreds of different stories, but none have stayed with me like this one. I still think fondly about it, and reread various parts to get my creative gears running. As an aspiring author this is the story that has arguably inspired me most of all. For reference some of my other favorite authors are Alexandre Dumas. Stephen King, Joe Hill, Neil Gaiman, George RR Martin, Robert Rankin, and David Gordon. While this story is not like any of those authors stories, in my mind Umineko stands right next to them, or in some cases above them.\n\nIt has an anime aesthetic (and unfortunately some tropes early in), but please, if you're like me, and you can't take things as seriously just give this a real shot. It goes well beyond what the medium of anime or Japanese authors (from what I've read) normally delve into. \n\nUmineko will surprise you. It's a surprising story, with many many layers. And it has the replayability and forshadowing of that of a masterwork. Considering it released serially this is doubly impressive.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome. Look it up if you'd like.\n\nOkay so there was a bit of gushing here, and I'm trying to control myself. Basically if you get anything from this random review on the internet, just give Umineko a shot. This is only half the story (Episodes 1-4) but it will still take upwards of 50-100 hours to complete.

It's some of the best music I've heard in video games, and I still frequently listen to it. I still know exactly what song plays at what moment, and can still experience the same tension/emotions I experienced first time reading through.\n\nIf you've ever watched the anime and found it lackluster, believe me, the source material is much better. These four \"Episodes\" span the entire anime, but everything is much less rushed. The anime also butchered the story to the point where the mystery was left unsolvable, so there's that.\n\nAs for the specifics of this release, a couple of notes: \n- The sprites have been reworked, and in my opinion the PS3 sprites are superior.\n- No voice acting\n- Only the Question arcs for now\n\nHowever, there is a patch in the works by fans that aims to fix the former two. Per writing of this review however, only the voice acting has been modded in and it hasn't officially been released yet, so expect bugs if you do end up using it (like me).\n\nTranslation is an updated version of Witch Hunter's fan translation.\n\nYou'll get the Question arc episodes all in one, so that's Episode 1-4 (ending with Alliance of The Golden Witch). But make no mistake. That is still plenty of reading to do. You could count each \"episode\" as seperate novels if you will, you'll be getting plenty of content for you money's worth.\n\nI really hope that Umineko Chiru (the Answer arc) will be released too at some point.

I'm somehow still thinking about this f****** game a month later, and desperately want more. TL;DR version, if you already have a good idea of what Umineko is and are familiar with both the genre and the loosely related, not-super-necessary-but-pretty-good-anyway prequel Higurashi, get it, it's great. For everyone else, read on.\n\nFirst things first, there are two points of immediate interest that need to be covered so that you can understand what you're getting into: Umineko is only a game by the loosest definition (yet is very much a game), and that this release is the first half of the full story, the question arc. Umineko is known by nerds on the internet as a \"sound novel\", but for everyone else you should think of it like a book. And no, this isn't a choose your own adventure novel, or one with random minigames, for 99% of the game you read, you listen to the amazing music, and you watch static sprites change between expressions on a weird distorted photo background thing. That's it. And then you hope we get the second half.\n\nStill with me? Good. Because despite not being a game you can interact with, Umineko is definitely a game, with a compelling, complex set of rules and developments throughout.\n\nThe premise of the game is initially fairly simple. 18 people gather together on an island in the middle of nowhere (as you do), broadly speaking to discuss that matter of who inherits said island and a bunch of money. When the grandfather guy they want the stuff from isn't actually dead yet. Kind of rude, honestly. But a chunk of the 18 people spend the first day on the island arguing about this, whilst the uh, staff of the house (close enough anyway) do their thing and the children/teenagers talk about stuff no one really cares about. I think they mention a riddle of some sort that might be loosely related to the plot, but I'm sure it's not important. Then around dinnertime, they get a letter from a mysterious person who calls themselves Beatrice, who claims that she's the gal who lent grandfather guy money for his island and business ventures, and wants her money back or something. Naturally, the group ignores it, since they want the money for themselves and they have no reason to believe the letter.\n\nThe next day, some people are dead.\n\nI won't go into details because that's what playing the game is for, but broadly speaking, the circumstances of the deaths are highly suspect. There are supposed to be only 18 people on the island, and communication with the outside world has been cut off. The murders seem difficult to pull off without a hitch. Some suggest possible theories as to what happened.\n\n\"A witch did it\", some say.\n\nA while later, more people are dead. This time, it seems impossible for anything other than a witch to have been involved. Some argue against it anyway. And then more people die. And then more. You, the player, begin to run out of suspects as to who could have done all this. Eventually, things come to a head, a witch was CLEARLY involved, there's no other way around it.\n\nOr was there a trick to it?\n\nThis is the true mystery of Umineko. Are you playing a traditional murder mystery? Is the culprit one of the 18, who through the use of particularly clever tricks managed to fool the entire cast into believing in magic, killed them in an increasingly ridiculous fashion, and got away with it? Or was it really the result of magic, and you're in fact playing a fantastical tragedy surrounding very untrustworthy characters? The answer may seem obvious before playing, but believe me when I say that Umineko puts up a pretty convincing argument for both.\n\n*Brushes away sweat* wow, that was a long plot introduction. It's important though, it's all the game has. To point to my favourite aspect of Umineko right off the bat, it would have to be the inclusion of one particular plot wrinkle that makes itself known around chapter 2, and that's that everything spoken in red is absolutely, 100% the truth. Normally in a murder mystery you look towards evidence for what exactly happened in a crime, yet in umineko you are often given information that evidence just won't provide. For example, in a traditional mystery, you might hypotheise that it would be possible for a spare key to exist for a door somewhere. In umineko, if a character brings that up they may be contradicted. Umineko is very happy to quickly deny MANY possibilites for how a crime took place, to the point that the question isn't \"how did this happen\", but rather \"how COULD this happen\", which I find super interesting. In fact, super interesting could be applied to the mystery as a whole, because holy cow it is mysterious and stuff. (I know, vague, but it's a mystery, what do you want me to say)\n\nThe cast is also pretty strong, although I do have my issues with a few aspects surrounding them. The writer of Umineko quite frankly has a pacing problem, and is quite happy to spend several hours at the beginning of each chapter developing characters before moving on to whatever the main event is. Now I have no issue with this in theory, but as with most plots involving murder, the characters are at their most interesting when they're, you know, being involved with murders. And whilst I overall love the writing in Umineko, when murder isn't happening the plot can get very anime, and not in an endearing way. Also, maybe this gets corrected in the second half, but the game quickly establishes Kyrie as best girl, but then rarely gives her the spotlight she deserves.\n\nAlso also, YES, I GET IT, INSERT CHARACTER HERE LOVES INSERT CHARACTER HERE, DO THEY HAVE MUCH TO THEIR PERSONALITY ASIDE FROM THIS IN A NORMAL SETTING? NO? OK THEN, CAN WE GET BACK TO THE  MURDERS PLEASE.\n\n*Ahem* moving on, as I mentioned earlier the music is great.  Not all of the tracks are winners, but they keep introducing new tracks at a consistent enough pace, with enough different styles, that you'll probably find something you'll enjoy. Also, I have no idea what the rest of the internet is talking about, I actually rather enjoy the so called \"pachinko sprites\", aka the new sprites that are part of the advertising. The old sprites are also there, and they're charming enough in their own terrible way that I always switched over briefly whenever a new sprite appeared (which by the way you can do and I greatly appreciate that), but there is nothing wrong with the new sprites. Forgive me internet I have sinned.\n\nI'm a fast reader, and it overall took me about 40+ hours to finish the question arc, so plenty of bang for your buck in that regard. The ending naturally has plenty of sequel hooks for the second half, but it's also not a terrible ending in its own way, so it's not so bad that it makes waiting for the second half a nightmare. (APPARENTLY it's possible to solve most of the mysteries independently of the second half anyway, just stupidly hard to do so. I have not, although I may replay some of the game with a fresh mindset)\n\nSo yeah, play it. It's good.\n\n(...And skip the anime adaptation, it covers this half of uminekmo but TERRIBLY. It's really not worth it, even if you want to see some scenes animated.

As I'm sure most of you will notice, many people simply write \"Just buy it!\" and I'm tempted to do the same. This game has withstood the test of time and still remains unparalleled by any other games that have came after. TL;DR - This game was around $25 and I got 111 hours out of it. A fantastic mystery VN.\n\nFYI: This was my first time playing. I did not play the original Umineko. Several of my friends told me of how life changing it could be and I was tempted to watch the playthrough on YouTube but never did. I'm glad I waited to experience the game for myself. \n\nAs you can imagine...writing a review for such a long game can be a bit challenging. If you have played Higurashi, you will definitely like this game. If you enjoy mysteries, fantasy, kinetic VNs...you'll like this game. I can't think of a target audience who would not enjoy Umineko unless perhaps one lacks patience. The thing is, I lack patience. I haven't made it to every ending of CLANNAD, or Tsukihime...after so many hours I usually give up and say I will return to a VN.\n\nI played this through to the end, every day until I was finished. The character development was gripping, really there was never a dull moment. As soon as I thought I had one piece of the puzzle figured out, ten minutes later my grip on reality was ripped to shreds.\n\nMy humble recommendation is that ANY VN fan would enjoy this game and that it is absolutely worth its full price.\n\nAn added note: For those on the fence, please purchase this game and support 07th Expansion. Also if you want a taste of what this game is slightly like, look for the Higurashi titles (released before Umineko by the same author). All gold in my opinion.

proportioning of the VN and my feeling about this piece of work) myself. Like most of the reviewers below, I read the game years ago and now I got it on steam in order to support it. A few years back if someone told me that Umineko would be on steam I would laugh at them but here it is.\n\nObviously my play time on steam doesn't count and as most of the reviewers here, I have been a huge fan of the series in the previous years. So perhaps my view on it may not be what would someone call objective but I don't think it is easy to be objective with a series like this. It's important to note that I am on a different phase of my life now and probably re-reading the VN is not something I will have the courage to do nor will I enjoy it the way I did back then. All things considered, it is very long and I have never been a book reader, quite on the contrary (Umineko has been a big exception in that regard). Even so, seeing Umineko Steam, brought me some deep excitement because new people can get a chance to ready this masterpiece by just getting it from steam.\n\nLet me start by making a disclaimer that this series is not for everyone. It is not meant to be a big hit enjoyed by the masses. You have to like the genre and style of the game and also you have to be a bit crazy I think to enjoy this. Having said that for those that meet the criteria this series is absolutely amazing. I understand that those who haven't played the VN before and see all those reviews praising it that much, they will think that they are just overexagerating. Surely, as I said there is no warranty that you will like the series. But many people that liked the series loved it deeply because it is so well made.\n\nSo after the long disclaimers above, let's go to the main topic: What is this series about and whether you should get it. This series is a love story and also two genres intertwined: Fantasy and Mystery. It's also a story about desire and impossible wishes. I don't want to spoil the story but let's just say that the main setting is in a private island owned by a powerful family. They gather to discuss about inheritance issues (well the grownups really) and then things starting getting bad, with murders, witches and more. \n\nThe theme of fantasy vs mystery (meaning that whether what you see is something that can be explained rationally or whether magic has to be employed to explain what happens) is very strongly explored. If you have been questioning this in your real life, from a philosophical or religious point of view, this will probably interest you and keep you thinking a lot. Seriously, this VN demonstrates how magical thinking works in a brilliant way.\n\nAnother part of the story that is very strong and perhaps more important is the main characters themselves and their love story behind the main story. I can't really such much about this without spoiling anything, you have to read it yourself and make your own conclusions. \n\nThe style of the game is great but this is highly subjective. The figures are of anime style and also there are many tropes taken from anime. So if you hate anime you probably won't enjoy this. If you also like lolita fashion like dressed characters (which correspond to some of the witches), which is kind of similar to the style you see in anime like Rozen Maiden or games like Touhou you will like it even further. Something I also liked was the gracefulness shown by the speech and behaviour of some of the characters, after all this is about a powerful family and some very powerful witches. At the same time though it is notable that very often the series have moments with a more casual/realistic atmosphere. Ryukishi07 (the creator of the series) likes to make a great contrast between the calm scenes where things progress in a normal manner and some scenes where madness emerges. \n\nAnother part that is very important is the music of the series. Again highly subjective but I personally have loved the music and have listened to it countless times. Sometimes it is the typical calm music used for similar series but also it has some very strong tracks for the more heated scenes. Some say that some themes have been changed for the Steam version, but I suspect that on the most part it should be the same as the original. I like the combination of baroque church organ/harpsichord genre with modern beat music.  If you are into this kind of music you will love it. In fact I think that music plays a huge role into creating the mood of the scenes, from happiness and excitement to dread and horror. \n\nWell since I did mention what the series is, let me mentioned what the series is not. First of all, despite some mild fanservice shown here and there (mainly in the form of the style of the clothing and the way some characters behave), this series is not for those who want any serious ecchi moments and doesn't use any cheap tricks to turn the story into lovey dovey heart-warming moments that makes you feel so \"moe\" etc. If you want a charming lovely story to relax and feel warm inside, this series will greatly disappoint you. In fact the series is one of the saddest and most cruel stories I have ever read/seen. This of course also depend by how emotionally engaged you will get by the series, but at least for me it was like that the first time I read it: it very emotionally engaging. Seriously, if you suffer from depression don't get this. Don't get me wrong it certainly has various comical/casual moments but the overall tone of the series is not on the bright side.\n\nFinally, just so you know this is a long series, it consists of 8 arcs (currently the first 4 are released) and it takes some time to read. If you want a bit of a shorter version you can read the manga but please, do not waste your time with the anime, it was too short to show all the details needed and to allow you to think of the various matters and most importantly it didn't really capture what the series was about.\n\nThere is no point of me rating the series as it is obvious by now that I liked it quite lot. I didn't read many visual novels but I did watch many anime in the past and there are only two series I have considered to be a true masterpiece: Neon Genesis Evangelion and then it was this. The reason is simple: I didn't find much I didn't like about the series or that I thought it was badly made. Everything is executed with much care and masterfully. Well you could argue that the original artwork is bad, but in the end this series is about some abstract concepts and the not so great graphics help in a way to create some distance so that the suspension of disbelief can work well, without the uncanny valley effect sometimes realism produces.\n\nSo I totally recommend the series for those that find its concepts appealing. You may not necessary like it (and perhaps you may hate it) but if you are into this kind of stories and concepts I would greatly recommend to at least try it.", "timestamp_created": 1468191697, "timestamp_updated": 1468191697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598597", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24241318": {"recommendationid": "24241318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005507216", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468188420}, "language": "english", "review": "Umineko is the pinnacle of visual/kinetic novels for me. Many, myself included, consider this the best piece of writing by its author, ryukishi07, who also wrote Higurashi. \n\nA kinetic novel is slightly different than a visual novel. A visual novel is akin to a \"choose your own adventure\" story book, where choices pop up here and there to allow you to explore certain \"routes\" of the story. A kinetic novel contains no choices, and is essentially just a novel but with background music, drawn characters and background, and voice acting (though currently this Steam version doesn't have voice acting). \n \nEven by visual kinetic novels, Umineko is LONG. Similar to Higurashi, Umineko spans over 8 chapters (the first 4 chapters are part of this sale and the latter 4 will be released at a later date), with the first four setting up the mystery while the latter 4 giving more clues to help you solve the mystery.  \n\nThis is certainly one of the best pieces of mystery I've read, and I'm an avid reader of authors such as Doyle and Christie. The synopsis is as follows: \n\nThe protagonist, after being estranged from his family for a few years, joins his father and step-mother for a family reunion on an island that his grandfather and his oldest uncle resides on. He sees his aunts, uncles, and cousins, as well as maids and butlers employed by his family for the first time in many years. While he is reacquainted with his cousins, the rest of the family squabble over inheritance that will be left by his aging grandfather. As a storm isolates the island from the rest of the world, and with rumors of a witch that lives on the island, all these elements blend together for a close circle mystery that blur the line between dective-mystery and fantasy. \n\nDoes the witch actually exist? Was it magic that caused the events on the island? Read through the first 4 chapters of Umineko to formulate your own thoughts on the events on the island, and remember, without love, it cannot be seen.", "timestamp_created": 1468188434, "timestamp_updated": 1468188434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24240477": {"recommendationid": "24240477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031558986", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509336414}, "language": "english", "review": "Greetings, you have been invited to a family reunion and a tea party on Rokkenjima Island. Please endure the planes shaking and watch your step after the landing. After that, we hope that you enjoy the boat ride to the island. A servant will lead the way to the Western-style guest house, don't get lost! Take a stroll through the beautiful rose garden and enjoy it's splendor. Chat with your relatives while having a picnic on the beach. Five servants are there to fulfil your requests and wishes anytime. You can always take a walk on this island but don't go in the vast and empty forest or the witch Beatrice will get you. Maybe you'll even solve the riddle and find the 10 tons of gold hidden somewhere, but be careful strange things and accidents might happen.\nHope you enjoy your stay on Rokkenjima Island.\n\nAnd that was my first impression of Umineko, but what is Umineko exactly? Well if I could describe Umineko with one sentence it would be like this: Various characters, a Detective Conan setting on an island and mix everything together with the atmosphere of Higurashi.\nTaken advantage of the Korean War, Kinzo Ushiromiya became extremely rich and now he has been the head of the family for decades. Each year he invites his family on Rokkenjima Island to discuss financial profits and losses. How much did they borrow from him? How much did they earn? Can they pay back the borrowed money or do they need more? First by plane, taxi and then by boat they finally reach Rokkenjima Island. Everyone is cheerful and nice to each other, you could say that they look like average rich people enjoying themselves. But soon after they arrive on the island their personalities start to change drastic one by one. Where those happy and cheerful feeling only an act? Did they only pretend to be a happy family and were they only motivated by greed or was it the witch Beatrice who changed them one by one? Is the killer one of them and does he want to get rid of the competiton so that he can the inherit the vast amount of money or is it all the witch Beatrice and her curse?\nUmineko is a kinetic visual novel without voice acting. But don't fred, with the vast lenght of it (50+ hours according to VNDB), the story and characters, I would say it's a steal compared to your average kinetic novels lenght and price that are available on steam.\nYou can choose between 2 art styles. The original character art or new the ''prettied up'' character art. It's nice that you have more than one option to choose from, it's better than having none options at all, that's a big plus for me. But if you dislike both character art styles and want to have at least voice acting then you can use (if it's out already) a fan patch which uses the PS3 versions voice acting and character art. You will need a few moments to get used to the background art, it has that strange painted like blurry filter all over it. Either you like it or not but it helps the visual novels atmosphere with that hazy, surreal style.\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, there are so many tracks and each track hits perfectly the mood of the characters and helps set the atmosphere of the visual novel. The ones that stood out for me were:  ''Worldend Dominator'', ''Mirage Coordinator'', ''System0'' and ''Tsurupeta-128''. I recommend that you at least listen to the soundtrack.\nThe translation is done by The Witch Hunt. I have to say it's a very good translation,The Witch Hunt even consulted the developer while working on the translations which can be seen on the quality of it.\nThe visual novel runs at a native resolution of 1280 x 960 and the box with the text occupies all or most of the screen (same as Higurashi).\nThe only bad thing that I found about Umineko is that the story sometimes can be told really slow and sluggish, some of the readers might get bored by the pacing.\nNote that these are the first four episodes (Question Arcs), there are four more episodes (Core Arcs) which is a sequel.\n\nIn the end there is no way I could not recommend Umineko. The story, characters, atmosphere, lenght and price, put them together and it's a must buy for anyone who likes a clever, insane mystery visual novel.\n", "timestamp_created": 1468185164, "timestamp_updated": 1468185164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24234472": {"recommendationid": "24234472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126400932", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471266122}, "language": "thai", "review": "mehhhh", "timestamp_created": 1468166818, "timestamp_updated": 1468166818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24234301": {"recommendationid": "24234301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284410798", "num_games_owned": 715, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485608281}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6709\u70b9\u5c11 \u90a3\u6211\u4e5f\u6765\u8bf4\u8bf4\u5427 \n \u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u521a\u4e70 \u8fd8\u6ca1\u600e\u4e48\u73a9\u8fc7  \u8fdb\u53bb\u770b\u4e86\u4e0b \u82f1\u6587\u5e76\u4e0d\u96be \u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u770b\u61c2  \u97f3\u4e50\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519 \n\u5bd2\u8749\u548c\u6d77\u732b\u662f\u6211\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u7ed9\u6211\u611f\u89e6\u6bd4\u8f83\u6df1\u7684\u52a8\u6f2b \u81f3\u4eca\u5267\u60c5\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97\u5927\u6982 \u8fd9\u4e24\u90e8\u52a8\u6f2b\u90fd\u6df1\u6df1\u9707\u64bc\u4e86\u6211 \u5728\u90a3\u65f6 \u8fd9\u4e48\u70e7\u8111\u7684\u52a8\u6f2b\u5728\u6211\u5370\u8c61\u4e2d\u662f\u5f88\u5c11\u7684 \u867d\u8bf4\u6709\u70b9\u6050\u6016 \u770b\u7684\u6211\u5934\u76ae\u53d1\u9ebb \u770b\u5b8c\u52a8\u6f2b\u4e5f\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4e0d\u61c2  \u8fd8\u662f\u9760\u767e\u5ea6\u624d\u6162\u6162\u5f04\u61c2\u7684 \u6211\u4e70\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48 \u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u90e8\u52a8\u6f2b\u5728\u6211\u5fc3\u4e2d\u662f\u795e\u4f5c \u6211\u7b49\u4e86\u6d77\u732b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63\u7b49\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e45  \u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u6b21\u53ea\u6709\u524d\u56db\u7ae0 \u6211\u4e5f\u8981\u4e70", "timestamp_created": 1468166329, "timestamp_updated": 1468166329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622403", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24232167": {"recommendationid": "24232167", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995140839", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505210043}, "language": "english", "review": "I might not be able to give an objective opinion, but for me, Umineko is one of those stories that only comes around once in a decade. The kind of story that changes the way you think, that challenges your perceptions of reality in all sorts of ways. What is real, what is truth? Are our perceptions and beliefs reliable? And what is the importance of the human heart in the pursuit of truth? You'll come out after reading it a different person that you were before, and I wish so much that I could just erase my memory of Umineko so I could experience it for the first time all over again. But that won't stop me from replaying it 2, or 5 times, because with the amount of depth hidden behind every line, there's something new to uncover, so you'll never really be done with it.\n\nUmineko presents itself first and foremost as a traditional murder mystery inspired by the likes of Agatha Chritie's 'And Then There Were None'. And as a murder mystery, it's already successful. It's full of very memorable characters that the story will give you adequate time to get to know, again and again. You'll have your first impressions of the 18 original cast, then those impressions will be overturned once you see their ugly sides, and they'll be turned over again a couple more times as the story continues to present you with different perspectives and interpretations, leaving it up to the reader to decide who to empathise with and who to pass judgement upon. Being a visual novel, the story itself is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack; one of the best soundtracks in the history of gaming, filled with an eclectic array of compositions to match all the differing atmospheres the story presents, but I'll let the OST speak for itself. Because there's more to Umineko than just a cool mystery novel. The real majesty of Umineko starts showing it's face around Episode 2, after the initial premise has had time to sink in.\n\nSuddenly, the story ends up taking a unique turn, diving into the realm of metafiction as the philosophical undertones take center stage as you're suddenly tossed into a battle of twisted logic to determine the truth behind the murder mysteries on the island. It's hard to explain without spoiling too much, but the story provides a very unique tool to both challenge readers and assist them in uncovering the truth behind the events. This particular 'red' device is a huge hook for the series for me, and something which always keeps me coming back, turning debates of logic into something really exciting to watch (and participate in).\n\nMake no mistake; this is a game, a game that you the reader are invited to participate in. There may be no interactivity and no choices, but it would be a mistake to assume that this is the kind of media you just consume and let go. When you read Umineko, bring a notepad, make Battler's mission your own. And don't forget to share your thoughts and theories with others as you read, it's a lot more fun to bounce speculations off others as you read. On [url=rokkenjima.org]Rokkenjima[/url] we have an entire forum dedicated to discussing this; joining a community to discuss the story is a great way to enhance your enjoyment.\n\nSeeing Umineko released on Steam after all these years is a miracle come true. Umineko is a cult classic for a reason. It may be slow to start and it may have some writing or art that might be considered a bit rough for some people, but give it a chance. If it impacts you even half as much as it did me, it's the kind of story you'll be thinking about for years, and will be raving about to all your friends that they HAVE to take the time to read. If you don't believe me, just look at all the other reviews.\n\nAlso, to all those complaining about the new art, give it a shot! You might end up loving it more than any of the alternatives.", "timestamp_created": 1468159882, "timestamp_updated": 1468160130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24230300": {"recommendationid": "24230300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164604310", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483277916}, "language": "english", "review": "This is neither a murder mystery, nor a fantasy series - yet it is both.\nThis is not an interactive novel, but a kinetic one - yet it will play with your mind and challenge you like no other.\n\nWelcome to Umineko - When they cry, a series that not only deconstructs the mystery genre, but starts questioning the very way stories have been told so far. Throughout your journey, you will be trolled, mindfucked, amazed, challenged, determined to get out of your comfort zone. You will cry with the characters, you will scream with the characters, you will have an intellectual and philosophical debate regarding the objective vs. subjective nature of truth, you will deny magic while drinking tea with a witch and, most important of all, you will be changed.\n\nUmineko is a sound novel. It does not have any choices per se, however its interactive nature stems from the fact that is is a game between you - the reader - and the author. It is the best medium in which to experience this series, as the manga unfortunately cuts down on the interactivity part by giving you the answers one by one and [url=http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=31972]the anime was so disappointing, that most fans pretend it never existed[/url]. However, the sound novel has two major advantages.\n\nThe first is the atmosphere, created on one hand by the most amazing soundtrack I've ever listened to in a game (combined with the leitmotif sounds of rain, seagulls and the sea) and on the other hand, by the setting itself - the isolated island, the rich mansion, the rose garden - all beautifully illustrated by the realistic photo backgrounds. The second is the fact that it is, first and foremost, a novel - therefore certain aspects are left ambiguous through writing, enabling you to fill in the gaps either with personal projections of your own mind or personal theories regarding what happened.\n\nThe new art, featuring the sprites licensed from the pachinko Umineko game, is definitely an improvement to the original one (despite the fact that the original one - which I've played with in the past, before the Steam release - had its own undeniable charm). However, the new sprites make the characters pop out of the backgrounds better and is more consistent. Some characters may look a bit odd (mostly Battler, who desperately needs a haircut, and some of the female cast, who have beach balls instead of breasts). But most of the older characters look surprisingly better - they show their experiences on their faces. \n\nIt should be mentioned that Umineko had been ported to PS3 in the past with new sprites, backgrounds and voices - which Mangagamer couldn't license. However, an unofficial mod will mostly definitely come out for this version soon. Personally, I am not a big fan of it, due to the stiffness of the characters, the weird perspectives and cartoonish aspects of the backgrounds and the fact that voices take away some of my own imagination and make the read-through last much longer. So, for now, I definitely recommend the Steam version more - since it is closer to the original intent. There are some hidden CGIs too, but for some reason they aren't official and need to be modded.\n\nRegarding the content itself, this game only features the first 4 Question arcs, each requiring a reading time between 10 and 15 hours. The translation is an improved version of the fan patch, done by the wonderful team Witch Hunt. Each arc shows an alternative story of what happened on the 4th and 5th of October 1986 on the island belonging to the Ushiromiya family, Rokkenjima. Some arcs (for example the first and second one) start a bit slower, insisting on the relationship between characters and on a bit of backstory before setting the stage. However, some of these introductory parts contain very important hints to the overall mystery, hidden between layers and layers of deception. This makes Umineko have an amazing replay value, because you always notice things that escaped you on the first or second read.\n\nWithout getting into spoiler territory, the question arcs start as a classic mystery with allusions to magic... only to make you realize that the overall story takes place outside of the mystery itself, in a fantasy setting. Confusing, huh? Umineko manages to blend in various genres and bring forth themes such as the nature of truth, the possibility of multiverses, love, the cycle of abuse, accepting one's death, creating your own fantasy world in order to cope with the harshness of life, the importance of storytelling, the futility of miracles... and many more. Because of its very nature, it is a story which can be (re)interpreted according to each reader's vision within certain limits, which is probably why even now, 9 years after the release of the first Question arc, fans are still writing huge emotional blocks of texts debating theories on various forums, on youtube, or on any platform where Umineko pops up.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game wholeheartedly - especially if you are a fan of mystery and suspense, of Higurashi, or just want a story that breaks the confines of classic storytelling. Sit back, take a pen and paper and write notes and try figuring out the truth yourself while reading. You'll most definitely fail, but the fun itself comes from theorizing and exchanging ideas with others. And hey, helping you figure out the truth with certainty is what the Core arcs will be for when they will be released on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1468153943, "timestamp_updated": 1511388232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24225635": {"recommendationid": "24225635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070811922", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509491556}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gave me a desire.\nTry it out if you're a fan of mystery, the occult or just want to cry your eyes out.\nBest story I've ever read, fucked with my mind and my feelings.\nJust beware, this is NOT a visual novel.

Umineko is an incredibly deep and thought provoking novel that for some people (like myself), can influence their life.\n\nThis novel takes place in a world of magic versus logic. As you dive into the story I encourage you to put yourself into the world and decide whether or not you believe in the beautifully fantastic world of magic. Or decide to be a detective who believes that magic is nonsense! And use logic and reasoning to explain the unexplainable. No matter what you believe in be prepared as the series puts you through various emotions. It may be a taxing read if you are a somewhat slow reader, but it's definitely worth it as you can get a lot out of it.\n\nMusic is neat, art is ok.

"spanish", "review": "Bienvenido a Rokkenjima.\n\nNo leas ning\u00fan an\u00e1lisis, no mires ning\u00fan v\u00eddeo, no mires capturas ni fanarts, no dejes que te spoileen. Simplemente compra el juego y disfr\u00fatalo sin saber nada, pues probablemente est\u00e9s ante una de las mejores novelas que vas a leer en toda tu vida.\nSi todav\u00eda no la has le\u00eddo, deja de leer este an\u00e1lisis ahora y compra el juego.\nPero si todav\u00eda sigues indeciso... Puedes seguir leyendo, pues este an\u00e1lisis intenta no tener spoiler alguno sobre la historia.\n\nUmineko es una novela visual con una constante lucha entre misterio y fantas\u00eda creada por el c\u00edrculo doujin 07th Expansion. Pertenece a la saga \"When They Cry\", siendo este la segunda novela, y siendo Higurashi la primera. Sin embargo no hace falta leer Higurashi para poder disfrutar al m\u00e1ximo de Umineko. Cabe decir que esta es la primera parte de Umineko, los arcos de preguntas. Mangagamer todav\u00eda tiene que sacar los arcos centrales a la venta.\n\nNo te dejes enga\u00f1ar porque sea una novela visual, pues Umineko no se centra en el fanservice ni en chicas con pechos enormes para atrapar al lector.\nCuando empieces, es probable que sigas leyendo debido a la curiosidad por todas las preguntas sin responder, o por el misterio. Pero antes de que te des cuenta, motivos tales como la profundidad y complejidad de la historia, el apego emocional a los personajes y la genial banda sonora de la que Umineko dispone ser\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n motivos para seguir leyendo.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 puedo decir de Umineko? Yo, como muchos, empec\u00e9 viendo el (HORRIBLE Y MAL ADAPTADO) anime. Lo cierto es que me gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo, y empec\u00e9 a leer la novela visual. Debo decir que no soy una persona que haya le\u00eddo demasiadas novelas visuales, y honestamente pens\u00e9 que la dejar\u00eda a la mitad, pero no fue as\u00ed. Antes de darme cuenta, abrir Umineko se convirti\u00f3 en un gesto autom\u00e1tico cada vez que encend\u00eda el ordenador. Nunca una historia me hab\u00eda cautivado de una manera parecida.\n\nUmineko es una novela que tienes que interpretar t\u00fa mismo para poder encontrarle el sentido. Se usa much\u00edsimo simbolismo durante toda la historia y varios paralelismos que se vuelven obvios cuando lees la novela por segunda vez. O la tercera. O la cuarta. Da igual que ya sepas todo sobre la historia y la verdad, cada vez que vuelves a leer Umineko te encuentras con algo a lo que antes no le hab\u00edas dado demasiada importancia, o algo de lo cual no te hab\u00edas percatado. Es una novela hecha para ser le\u00edda varias veces.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 puedo decir de los personajes? A lo largo de la historia el desarrollo de los personajes principales es evidente, adem\u00e1s de que cada uno de ellos es especial de alguna manera u otra, y muchos de ellos tienen una gran complejidad. Todos tienen sus objetivos, todos tienen sus motivos y todos tienen su pasado. Por muy cruel que sea un personaje en Umineko, es imposible llegar a odiarle, pues tras descubrir los motivos y sentimientos de ese personaje todo el odio desaparece.\n\nCuando Beatrice no est\u00e1 matando piezas o torturando a Battler, se tratan diversos temas tales como el amor, el amor no correspondido, el gato de Schr\u00f6dinger, ese sentimiento que tienen las personas de sentirse diferentes a los dem\u00e1s y destacar de cierta manera, o incluso ciertos dilemas causados por el g\u00e9nero. Todo esto tiene su papel fundamental dentro de la historia de una manera u otra, y probablemente tenga sentido para ti tras descubrir la verdad.\n\n\u00bfSobre los misterios? Simplemente fant\u00e1sticos, \u00fanicos. Cada misterio de esta historia tiene su soluci\u00f3n, es posible resolverlos antes de llegar a los arcos centrales. Siguen las normas de Knox siempre y suelen ser justos. Sin embargo, no esperes poder confiar de la narraci\u00f3n, pues si el \"detective\" no lo est\u00e1 viendo... No puedes estar seguro de ello.\n\nY para finalizar... Mi puntuaci\u00f3n: 10 / 10. Umineko es, sin duda alguna, una obra maestra de la cual cualquiera puede disfrutar, sin importar g\u00e9nero, edad... Es una novela que todos deber\u00edan leer por lo menos una vez en su vida, y que probablemente te cambie por completo tras leerla.", "timestamp_created": 1468069483, "timestamp_updated": 1468118854,

Since now this got finally an official release I hope it will recieve more attention in the west outside of the fandom because it deserves every single publicity it can get.\nIt starts off relatively slow and tedious but one will realize sooner or later that every detail is very important to fully grasp the scale of the novels story. What makes this especially great is that it really forces you to think together with the characters to figure out the so many and cleverly written mysteries and its a blast to do so. \nThere is a huge amount of characters but every single one of them is written with such detail and care, not a single one feels unnecessary or like a placeholder just to progress the plot. The chemistry between the family is natural, realistic and feels just like you are there with them experiencing everything that happens be it good or bad.\nAnother incredibly strong point is the atmosphere further into story as the combination of the amazing soundtrack and the clever usage of soundeffects throughout the scene transitions and dialouge makes it an unforgettable experience.\nAnd then of course there is the story, something so unique I have never seen anything like it up to this date.\nAmong all other visual novels and fictional stories in general, umineko no naku koro ni proudly holds a position as one of the absolute best with its great mix of characters, atmosphere and plot completely unique to its own kind.", "timestamp_created": 1468046815, "timestamp_updated": 1468046815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590933", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24198459": {"recommendationid": "24198459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001991770", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505310933}, "language": "english", "review": "What is Umineko?\n\nUmineko is difficult but incredibly rewarding.

Episode 4 is an absolute slog - it's the longest episode in the series by a fair way, and it's a tough read, so it's smart to have a bit of a break before reading it. Generally just allow yourself breathing room and time to think. The fun exists in between the happenings onscreen, the thinking that happens when you're away from your computer and can't stop thinking about it.\n\nAbsolutely give this series a go.

I can't recommend it enough, this series of novels is truly amazing, and imo surpasses Higurashi in terms of characters and plot. It's mystery aspect is quite interesting, and if you like and Then There Were None, you'll enjoy this since Umineko is heavily inspired by Agatha Christie's novel. Fantasy elements are also an interesting addition to the general mystery format, and Battler's battle to disprove Beatrice's existance is great to read (especially in the later episodes). If you want to experience it the best way, I'd recommend waiting for the inevitable PS3 patch, since the art is more consitant, but overall it's worth the money. Hopefully the other 4 novel's get their release as well, after replaying the question arcs my itch to finish the story has increased, and the new art style has also grown on me quite a bit.

The art is also not as good as the PS3 version.\n\nTwo major criticisms: It drags on quite long (the visual novel is over 30 hours), and that includes parts that may bore you. Worry not however, it will be all worth it.

This game stole the entire summer of 2013 from me; I never expected to lose 150 hours to a visual novel, but I did.  Umineko kept me on the edge of my seat for a solid three months.  An engrossing narrative, an unforgettable cast of characters, and a flawless original score firmly established it as my personal gold standard of video game storytelling.  No other game has even come close to eliciting the feelings that Umineko did.\n\nIt's so hard to explain without spoiling!  What starts as a murder mystery slowly unravels into a complex network of interesting story threads.  Alternate timelines, debates on the existence and nature of magic, a tragic family history, and the self-deconstruction of the mystery genre; they all come together in a drama that constantly forces you to re-examine everything you think you know about what's going on.\n\nIt's a Kinetic Novel, which means you have no actual interaction with the story.  Umineko never asks you to make a choice, or save-scum your way past dozens of BAD ENDS.  There's no actual game-play in the game, because it's all going on in your head.  You'll be trying to solve all of the mysteries right next to the characters in the game.  Hell, I had to write down actual notes to keep tabs on certain key plot points.\n\nI literally have a folder of everything I would need to re-install and re-patch the game on three separate USB hard drives, because I want to be able to play through this game one last time on my death bed.\n\nOh, let me tell you about the install process.  You want to know what I had to do just to run this game three years ago?  First, I had to download and install the original game.  Then I had to patch it with the fan translation.  Then I had to install the patch that replaces the original character and background art with the art made for the PS3 release.\n\nOh, and because Umineko is two games, I had to do this twice.\n\nBut no!  Here comes MangaGamer, offering you and I the chance to easily download and install the game through Steam!  Now you have no excuse not to play it!\n\nAnd good on MangaGamer for using The Witch Hunt's translation.  These guys deserve a Nobel Prize for putting out a fan translation with over a million lines.\n\nThere are some... unfortunate removals.\n\nFirst, you're stuck with the the original background art.  It's a minor thing, but it really clashes with the new sprite work.\n\nSecondly, one of the most chilling moments from episode one was the first time I heard 'system0'.  It plays during a pivotal scene, and it's made much more terrifying by opening with a voice clip from 'Star Trek: First Contact'.

If you don't like visual novels and think they're just clogging up Steam's new releases, this game probably won't do much to change your mind.  If you've even a little patience for or interest in the medium, however, you're in store for something special.\n\nUmineko is a murder mystery, one the reader is actually expected to solve, or rather is capable of solving should they put their mind to it.  In this sense, it is much more a game than one might initially give it credit for.  Many authors during the Golden Age of Detective Fiction considered their works to be \"Games,\" long-form logic puzzles in prose form complete with rules and regulations governing what was and wasn't fair to expect from the average reader.  Umineko takes this sentiment to heart, earnestly wearing its inspiration on its sleeves.  The murder mystery provided in Umineko is not an easy one \u2013 and you\u2019re not yet able to check your answers in the back with this release alone \u2013 but the experience of trying to crack it is still worthwhile.  If possible, I'd recommend playing though it alongside a friend to compare notes and observations.  I'd also advise keeping a notebook and pencil handy, but that's just me.\n\nEven if you've no mind for mysteries, however, the core story and characters are still quite compelling.  Some will find the game to be a slow starter, but hey: you bought a visual novel.  Them's the breaks.   There's a lot more to say here but I'll let the game keep some secrets.\n\nInstead I'll comment on the music, the glue that holds Umineko together.  As I mentioned at the start of this review, Umineko's more of a \"Sound\" novel than it is a \"Visual\" novel, and was even marketed as such in Japan.  I'll not mince words: Umineko's OST is fantastic.  The tracks themselves are excellent and memorable on their own merits, but when paired up with the game they really elevate the experience.  Umineko's writing is fairly on-point in terms of telling the story it wants to tell, but the exact wording and phrasing of things is sometimes a little clunky.  It is then the music which compensates, adjusting the tone and shaping the reader's mood.  It is absolutely my favorite video game soundtrack, and anyone who turns it off or down or replaces it or tries to play with broken speakers is doing themselves a huge disservice.\n\nOn the artsy end of things, this release comes packed with Ryukishi07's own original art alongside some updated character portraits stripped from a pachinko machine.  The new art is uneven and not nearly as good as the PS3 release's - there'll probably be a fan patch for that at some point.  The old art is, putting it politely, \"Crude,\" but full of personality and its own homespun charm.  It's certainly how I'll be replaying the game.\n\nFinally, it should probably be be noted that this is only the first half of Umineko, but it still constitutes a full-bodied game well worth the price of admission.", "timestamp_created": 1468021593, "timestamp_updated": 1479926079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24194380": {"recommendationid": "24194380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104658972", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513734088}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been a big Umineko fan for awhile now and it's great to finally have an official release! The story of Umineko is the best I've seen from a visual novel and is a story that has stayed with me to this day.

I defintiely recommend it for any long time 07th Expansion fans or newcomers. -Come join us on Rokkenjima-", "timestamp_created": 1468021524, "timestamp_updated": 1468021771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24194103": {"recommendationid": "24194103", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999323072", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502594851}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let my play time fool you, I bought this game and used the fan-translated patch years ago and have periodically reread it ever since.  I've looked at the game, the manga, and the dreaded anime (don't watch the anime just don't).  I've probably spent over 300 hours invested in this franchise AT LEAST.\n\nUmineko is absolutely my favorite story in all existence, and I think it's definitely something everyone should read.  It changed my life, and has had the same effect on many other fans as well.  I know it sounds clich\u00e9 when I say that something changed my life, but regarding Umineko, it is absolutely true.\n\nUmineko no Naku Koro Ni (or When the Seagulls Cry) is a kinetic visual novel, meaning that there are no choices.  It will take around 50-60 hours to reach completion of a single read-through of these first four episodes.  The first four episodes are the \"Question Arcs\" and I assume that the Answer Arcs (episodes 5-8) will come to steam at a later time.  The music in this game is fabulous, and it contains several tracks that I find myself going back to, just to listen.  The visuals have been optionally updated by mangagamer, using sprites from the pachinko machines in Japan.  I personally do like the new art, but the old art has a charm that I love, so I will probably play using the old sprites the most.  The old sprites aren't quite \"professional\" though, but I love them nonetheless.  They might not be to your taste though, and if so, the updated sprites are a good alternative.\n\nThe characters and the story are fantastic and I don't really want to spoil anything.  Just know that there are time loops, mysteries, and fantastical scenes.

A MUST-BUY.[/h1]\n\nLike Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion before it, reading Umineko no Naku Koro ni quite literally changed my life and perspective. You might think that sounds like ridiculous hyperbole--it's 'just' a Visual Novel, are you [i]truly[/i] comparing it to one of the greatest high fantasy epics of all time? Yes, yes I am. Umineko touched something inside me that is difficult to explain in words alone, something that has to be experienced for yourself to be understood.\n\nEven if you are not normally one to read Visual Novels, I would highly recommend Umineko (and have, many times before, to anyone that would listen to me--or would not listen to me. Occasionally I'd clamp on to random passers-by on the street), because it is anything but your average VN. Apart from one at the very end of the series (as in the Answer Arc, which will no doubt be released on Steam in time as well), there are no choices to be made, only a pure rollercoaster-ride of a novel to savour.\n\nThe only negative point I could possibly say is that, as I mentioned before, as of now only the Question Arc has been released on Steam, so when you have inevitably consumed the first four Episodes in 1-2 days filled with nothing but feverish reading, you'll have to look elsewhere for the Answer Arc--at least for the moment.\n\nIn short:\n\nDo you revel in unraveling mysteries that actually challenge you instead of spoon-feeding you all the answers?\n\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni is for you.\n\nDo you enjoy a large cast of multi-layered, fascinating characters with complex motivations and an intricate plot?\n\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni is for you.\n\nDo you enjoy heart-wrenching [url=https://youtu.be/WL5BYyHdFKc]piano pieces[/url] and/or some of the most upsweeping, flat-out badass [url=https://youtu.be/raxEmANPTVc]electronic music[/url] you've ever come across; an OST so gripping to the point where Umineko was actually marketed as a Sound instead of a Visual Novel in Japan?\n\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni is for you.\n\nDid you watch the anime and come out disappointed, thinking the concept of it sounded infinitely better than its execution, which was marred by one-dimensional characters, more holes in its plot than a piece of cheddar, and nonsensical writing that was so inconsistent to the point it became actually impossible to solve the mystery?\n\nUmineko no Naku Koro ni is for you.\n\n[i][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU_vECs4i10]Welcome to Rokkenjima.[/url] The Golden Witch extends her heartfelt greetings.

Go get it [url=https://github.com/07th-mod/umineko-question]here[/url]\n\n\nDon\u2019t let my play time fool you, I\u2019ve already read the entire thing through the old fan patch, apparently the translation on the steam release greatly improves on that already excellent translation, so I\u2019m looking forward to rereading it all. In this review I will be covering mostly the technical aspects of Umineko, so I\u2019ll avoid talking about the story \u2013 it is best to go in without knowing what you\u2019re getting into.\n\n\n[b][u]Sound:[/u][/b]\n\nOriginally this work was a sound novel and not a visual novel, so you can guess the sound has an extra layer of attention given to it, and it shows.\n\nThere are almost 200 songs in the entire soundtrack composed by 5+ different artists. The genres spam all the way from instrumental piano to psychedelic trance. The range is amazing and somehow it manages to deliver the most fitting song for each scene, regardless of the musical genre. \nNotable songs on the question arc include [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDPJuAxZaOo]Dreamenddischarger[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTAcJ0ZcUkI]Hope[/url].\n\nIt\u2019s a shame the steam version did not include voice acting, presumably because of licensing issues, as it is one of the best in the entire visual novel medium. The patch I linked will restore the voices along with the PS3 sprites and backgrounds which in my opinion look way better than the steam version.\n\n\n[b][u]Characters:[/u][/b]\n\nThe cast is absolutely huge, by the end of the eight episode there were over 50 characters in total, but never at any point did it feel like there were more than it could handle, all of the characters had their own goals and motivations driving them forward and almost all of them had a significant impact on the story.\nThe characters are also well developed and become people you actually care about, each with their flaws and distinct personalities. This novel is exceptionally good on characterization, out of the 18 main characters there is not a single one that is bland, generic or reliant on character tropes and that in itself is an achievement.\n\n\n[b][u]Content:[/u][/b]\n\nThis is the first four episodes of a series of eight episodes. It takes roughly 50 hours to read through the first four episodes (question arc), and another 50 hours to go through the final four (answer arc), one of the longest visual novels out there.  It is very acclaimed by the western visual novel community as a whole, ranking up top 5 in rating on [url=https://vndb.org/v/all?s=rating;o=d]vndb[/url]. There is no sexual content on Umineko and nothing on the steam version was cut out or censored, making it the definitive version of one of the greatest visual novels to date.\n\n\n[b][u]Final thoughts:[/u][/b]\n\nThis novel is a finely crafted masterpiece and a truly unforgettable experience. I urge everyone to give it a try, especially if you are a fan of visual novels, this is one you absolutely can\u2019t miss.\nThere are reasons Umineko no Naku Koro ni is ranked #5 on vndb, and while I wrote a couple of them here, the rest is for you to enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1468015910, "timestamp_updated": 1474244894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24192787": {"recommendationid": "24192787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006346964", "num_games_owned": 740, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511620934}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: Played entire series (1-8) before Steam release.\n\nUmineko is, and always will be, the perfect mystery story to me.

It's an undeniably thrilling magical murder mystery that, like its predecessor Higurashi, poses several questions over 4 arcs and then explains them in 4 answer arcs (known as Umineko Chiru).

Ahora dir\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 me gust\u00f3 tanto.\nUmineko no es solo una visual novel de misterio. Quiz\u00e1 empiece como tal, pero a medida que vas avanzando en la historia, una realmente compleja, te vas dando cuenta de que logra distanciarse del resto de visual novel de ese tipo, en el buen sentido, gracias a sus constantes cambios de gui\u00f3n y objetivo. Es un juego que fluye, no se estanca.\n\nLo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 de esta VN es que todos, absolutamente todos los personajes son importantes, no hay ninguno irrelevante y todos tienen su peso en la trama. Un personaje que te puede caer mal al principio, lo puedes terminar queriendo e incluso llorando por su historia.\n\nSoy una persona a la que le presta much\u00edsima importancia a las bandas sonoras, y sin duda Umineko tiene una de las mejores que he escuchado. La m\u00fasica que tiene las dos partes de esta visual novel te hacen llorar, emocionarte, sumergirte en la historia con una determinada soundtrack en X situaci\u00f3n... 12/10.\n\nLos \"gr\u00e1ficos\", que tiene este juego en su versi\u00f3n de Steam a mi opini\u00f3n son bastante feos y no tienen CG's ni voces, pero lo bueno es que se le pueden a\u00f1adir gr\u00e1ficos del juego de ps3 y voces con mods, lo que para m\u00ed mejora la experiencia a la hora de leer.\n\nResumiendo, es una visual novel que merece ser jugada.

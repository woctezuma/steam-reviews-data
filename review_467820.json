(you should buy it whilst it's on discount though)\n-Great to play with friends.\n-Servers: This game needs a lot more people because it's so unpopular, though it's so fun. \n-The game is only in early access but is still the funniest early access game i've ever played.\n-Sometimes there can be bugs, like getting stuck into a wall (during pvp that's horrible) but that's rare to happen.\n-Customizing your own character: you can choose amongst colours and helmets to make your own Zero G arena suit! You get the different helmets by completing different achievements!\n-Guns: there are 6 different guns, a railgun, a missile launcher, a machine gun, a homing missile gun, a ball launcher and shotgun!\n-Gamemodes: Team deathmatch, King of the hill, Free for all.\n-Controls: Don't worry, you can change them on the menu. They are very important for the game.\n-Maps: there are about 6 different maps i think.\nSummary: I love it, the funniest FPS you can find, you are someone on a space suit with no control over body parts, you have a hook and gravity boots to help you maneuver through the arena, you can choose wheter to stay on ground with more accuracy but less defence, or to fly like a ragdoll, with less accuracy and more agility. You have to defend yourself with guns you find thoughout the map.\nThe only problem really is the number of people!

Some magnetic surfaces have issues activating correctly too , usually when there are many in close proximity. Besides that the skeleton for a very fun arena shooter is here but like i said, noone plays this for whatever reason. At this point I would even reccomend making it free for a period of time or giving out copies to popular youtubers etc to see if there will be a spike in the playerbase. Also some added customizable items that you gain from playing/ challenges for your character (cosmetics) would probably help in holding more players for the long run giving them something to aim for.

This is a very creative shooter and it's done very well. I think that the transition from zero g to grounded could use a small bit of work (It's weird seeing the characters go from ragdoll to stiff instantly) but I know that can be difficult. Something else that would could be a good change is that when you're in zero g, there should be no limit on how far up or down you can look, as there is no up or down in zero gravity. One more thing that would improve the game slightly would be a grabbing mechanic. Something such as pressing E for right hand and Q for left hand when in zero gravity and you can grab onto corners and edges and things such as that. The one level called \"Chamber\" has that area with no magnetic surfaces and I think it'd be cool to be able to grab onto the objects in there. I'm still very exited to see where this game goes in the future. Plenty of potential!

If a game is good, I will enjoy it no matter how it may look.\n\nThis game has a free demo on the internet, but it was so good that I decided to buy the full game. Simply put, this game has some of the most innovative and fun gameplay mechanics in a third-person shooter that I've seen in a long time. The controls are easy to pick up, and the movement capabilities of the in-game avatar seem limitless. The ability to toggle the gravity boots on and off allow for grounded gameplay or zero gravity mayhem. This, coupled with the beam that allows the player to grapple around the map, allows for immensely satisfying and exciting gameplay. I've only played for a short while in the full game, but it is so incredibly amazing how much fun I've gotten out of the gameplay.\n\nNow of course this title is still in Early Access, and as such there are a few issues. The problem that sticks out the most is the lack of a stable player base at the moment. If you have friends or are on during peak hours, finding a game is simple, but the lack of AI in the current build of the game means that you're out of luck playing solo unless you're content practicing your movement, which I must say is still a ton of fun to do even by yourself. \n\nThe graphics are pretty decent, but the graphical interface needs some work. I fully expect the graphical interface to be ironed out, and the game definitely looks good for what it is. The particle effects are nice and the lighting is definitely good-looking. Just look at the screenshots and videos above for an idea of what to expect. Overall, the game has a distinct lack of visual polish, but that is to be expected of a game in the early stages of development. \n\nI have not experienced any major glitches or hang-ups at this point in time with this game, so that should not be a major issue. However, I have not experienced the full depth of this game at this point so that remains to be seen in its entirety.\n\nAs a last note, I must say that I consider this game to be amazing.

No witty, sarcastic comments.\n\n(there's a tl;dr version at the bottom of the review.)\n\nFirst off.\nI love this game.\nAlbeit I suck at it, I love it.\n\n\n\nHere's my pros and cons list.\n\n\nPros:\n*Very fun, fast-paced, competitive gameplay.\n*Tutorial tells you everything you need to know. Everything.\n*It runs on the Unreal Engine (the same game engine Goat Simulator uses). Happy derpyass ragdolling time!\n*Great with friends over LAN.\n*7 maps to choose from.\n*4 different gamemodes.\n*5 different weapons that spawn in each map.\n*The guy who made this is one of the most friendly devs I've ever seen. He responds to alot (if not all) of his comments and suggestions.\n*This game updates SOOOOOOO frequently. Seriously. Just wow. I absolutely hope that this dev doesn't stop updating.\n*This game truly has some potential in the long run.\n*The dev is currently working on a Steam Workshop feature, which would allow people to make and upload new maps. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.\n\nCons:\n*The biggest con is that it's hard to find open servers sometimes. This makes sense, as it's a relatively unknown early-access game. This can (and definitely will) be a real buzzkill though.\n*All of the weapons spawn in the same place in each map. For instance, on the Pipe map, the rocket launcher always spawns in one room. This might sound nice to some people, but when you have some dipshit puppyguarding the sniper rifle, it's really annoying. This also gives more experienced players an advantage, as they probably know from the get-go where all of the weapons are in one map. You get swarmed by a guy with a rocket launcher before you even know how half of the map is laid out. I don't think they can fix this, but if you COULD randomize weapons spawn points, it would make the game just a tiny bit better.\n*No singleplayer bots yet. (it's only multiplayer)\n\n\n\n\nDid I mention the game is only 3 bucks? \nThat is one of the best deals I've ever seen. (other than like when gmod is on sale and it's only like $2)\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr version:\n\nTerrific game at a reasonable price. The game itself has so much potential. A couple problems here and there, but amazing in the grand scheme of things. I absolutely can't wait to see how it progresses.

CtS is like Capture the flag gamemodes in other games, but this time it's a sphere and you have to pull it with your gun to the goal. I like it, but it has balancing issues. Can be fixed by maybe adding a respawn timer and make the sphere move faster.\nThe game only has 6 maps and 5 guns right now, but they all vary.\n\nCan't go wrong with this game, it still has a lot of room for improvement and it will be updated frequently.\nIf you want to try the game, see how gravity works in this game and whatnot, go for it!

There really isn\u00b4t much more to explain, mate.\n\nWhat do you do in this game?\nYou kill other players in a small arena with no gravity.\n\nHow?\nYou have a few weapons to choose from to morph your enemies into compost. A SMG (the first gun you get), an auto-shotgun, a snipars, a rocket launcher with homing missiles (don\u00b4t worry it\u00b4s not OP) and a \"Megarail\" rail gun.\n\nWait, no gravity? How can I move then?\nBecause we are in the futor, everyone has magnet boots you can switch on and off and a grappling hook in case you want to believe you can fly or the magnet boots stopped working. You can also use the grappling hook to hook on other players. \n\nHow can people recognize me as PewDiePie?\nYou can paint your suit I guess.\nIdfk how you want to look like poods in a space suit but okay.\n\nWhat game can I compare this to?\nIf you really want to know, imagine a weird ass hybrid of Quake 3 and Space Engineers.\nYou get the zero G from Space Engineers (duh!) and the insane and fast paced gameplay straight outta Quake, and bam you get this.\n\nuuuuu, any downsides?\nDepends on how you look at it.\nThe graphics are.... fairly mediocre. I don\u00b4t know how but the dev managed to make an Unreal Engine game look like Unity, at least on my mid-high settings. But the performance and optimization is pretty good.\nAnd overall is the game really basic. I don\u00b4t mean generic, I mean basic like a lack of content.\nBut especially the latter is not worth getting butthurt over. The dev himself wrote in his Early Access thing for this game that he first wants to look, if people like the core gameplay and give constructive feedback.

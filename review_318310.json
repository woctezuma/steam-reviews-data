But this game isn't as good as others in the genre. Choice of Robots, for example, is a much better game. \n\nThis game lacks a few things: \n\n1) consequences for actions- many of the \"paths\" lead to the same destination. There are plenty of fake choices in this game, and the stats have seemingly no bearing on your character's ability to succeed in this game. In fact, as I write this review, I'm realizing that the stats are virtually meaningless in this game. The author doesn't seem to know how to integrate the \"Choice of\" mechanics very well.\n\n2) Clarity- I've played through this game 3 times as of my writing this, and I still don't understand what's going on in a few scenes. It's not because I'm too stupid to get it, either (I know when something goes over my head, and I'm not too proud to admit it :-P ). The mechanics of \"the Craft\" and how its analogous to being a lawyer seems tenuous at best. In some scenes, there are so many different versions of reality (e.g., nightmates, demonic planes, god/goddess realms, etc.) that it's really difficult to understand what's going on. There are a few other egregious examples of this, but in the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll just say that the overall arc that binds the story is needlessly complicated and ends in a very confusing way. Mr. Gladstone (the author) must have never heard of the old adage K.I.S.S. : keep it simple, stupid.\n\n3) Interesting characters- This might seem like a trite complaint, but none of these characters have any life in them. Character tropes can be a good thing, especially in these \"Choice of\" games, but none of these characters fall into familiar archetypes in a way that enhances the storytelling. I can think of a few off the top of my head: a rich and pretentious scion, three superficially different intimidating bosses, a family man, a horrific monster who turns out to be harmless. It was just lacking\n\n4) Satisfying puzzles- The best Choice of Games are the ones where there is a particular situation in which your character will most likely fail in any given playthrough, but there is one narrow path in which your character will succeed in that situation. This happens arguably once in this game at the casino night, but there are no consequences, and it's not at all satisfying. In Choice of Robots, for example, it feels sooo good to earn the grant from the National Science Foundation toward the beginning of the game; there's nothing similar to that in this game.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game isn't very good; but honestly, for the price...... what the heck. Buy it, play it, and see what I'm talking about. \n\nAlso, what the heck kind of writing is going on during the sex scenes. Really? It's all about the lack of plural second person pronouns in the English language. It's bad.

The novel I've found to both be my favorite and the most interactive, diverse, funny, witty, and entertaining is Tin Star. But behind that, I think I might say Choice of the Deathless.\n\nThis novel is just as interactive as others from CG, and very, very creative. You play a lawyer of sorts, working for a firm with a name I can't spell that settles disputes and writes contracts and otherwise for and between humans, demons, goddesses/gods (those of which aren't dead from this big war that happened before your characters time) and other things, though you mostly deal with the demons. I like the novel because it's fun and interesting - the author made an entire world both relateable and completely different from our own, using modern things like bars and apartments and student loan debt mixed with things like dragons that act as planes and demons made of glass and spencers with blood holes for eye sockets and too many mouths. It is really, really interesting in the world it's set it. \n\nBut it's also very confusing. There's various languages that are never explained and just mentioned in passing, which makes me wonder about what their real-world equivilent might be, but you never get anything close to an explanation. You do figure out your own language is called Kathic - that's the thing about this game, there's a lot of figuring out. I love connecting pieces of story together, but sometimes it could just be confusing. It'll throw words and phrases that I have nothing to attach to to make sense of and then just expect me to know it. It isn't a giant hinderance on gameplay/reading, but it can sometimes make things confusing and just had me lost now and then.\n\nGood thing is, though, that the characters are pretty fun. They're interesting, if not because of their characteristics then because they're all weird, physically and mentally. There's a few romantic oppourtunities and a lot of possibly funny scenes, and the dialouge is the most relateable I've seen in a CG game - but I really say that in a \"it breaks the fourth wall\" kind of way.\n\nAgain, sometimes confusing but with interesting characters and world, and various avaliable avenues and funny dialouge. It's cheap and has huge replay value, so if you're a fan of interactive novels I'd go ahead and buy it. 7/10 I personally found the sequal Deathless: The City's Water less confusing and maybe more enjoyable because of that, so you could start with that one or get the bundle of both games for 6 bucks (it's maybe 2 dollers more than just getting Deathless: The City's Water). The demos are also reasonably long so if you're really unsure you can try that.

You build relationships with others that could help you later - or make you fall. \n\nThere are three love interests: the male workaholic who steals credit to your job, the female soap box idealistic, and the rich haughty aristocrat (male or female depending on your preferences). A bit disappointing, and virtually no impact on the story. Another negative points is that a lot of stats are pointless. You have limited sleep and soulstuff (your \"magical energy\"), yet I've spent nights to work and used craft every single time I could, without ever running out of any of these.

Substantively, it's enjoyable and that's rather an achievement for Spellcasting Lawyers: The Game. At first, you kind of suspect that none of the choices you make in this game will have any effect, because honestly a lot of games with dialog choices these days just do effect A, regardless of whether you selected option A, B, or C (hello Bioware). There are a few of those, but just like one or two. Everything else will have an effect, even if it's subtle or you aren't sure what's happening at the time and there's a few different major ways things can change without those.

I first discovered \"Choice of Games\" on my Android phone, and was delighted to see the adventures continue on Steam. The writing is great, with enough intrigue and drama to satisfy any interactive novel fans, while having enough RPG-like elements to draw in some new players. \n\nAs a brand new necromancer, your job is to rise in the ranks of a corporation by using your skills and your wit to overcome adversity. You will go head-to-head against coworkers, rival necromancers and demons, and possibly even find love. \n\nThe story is well planned and flows smoothly, although there are a few bland bits scattered here or there. The choices you are faced with are as realistic as a game about raising the dead and summoning demons can be, with your character showing real human weakness and fears along with the courage and bravado expected from an RPG hero. Gameplay is easy, because there are no controls to learn: just read a bit, then click on the response you think fits your hero's personality. One of the great things about this type of game is that you can be anything you want to be.\n\nIf you don't enjoy reading, then this game probably isn't for you. But if you enjoy reading a good story and wonder what it would be like to be a part of that story and dictate the protagonist's every move, then look no further. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

I purchased it through the most recent Steam sale. Entering the game, I had quite a few apprehensions and definitely saw it amongst the lower echelons of games that I had purchased during the sale. I am now happy to say that this could not be farther from the truth. I am only 45 minutes in, but [i]Choice of the Deathless[/i] is one of the most enjoyable experiences that I have had on Steam!\n\nMy past experiences with \u201cchoice of\u201d books is that the decisions don\u2019t really have that much weight to them. Oftentimes, I find myself growing bored of them too quickly, frantically flicking through the pages in an attempt to find the quickest and easiest path to end the novel. However, in [i]Choice of the Deathless[/i], I find myself constantly weighing up the potential pros and cons of my choices, assessing which characters it will affect and which ones will want to engage physically as quickly as possible with me (I\u2019m looking at you, Chen and Ashleigh). Through these choices, a richly-developed and thoroughly enjoyable story is developed, with constant twists and turns and unexpected relationships being forged.\n\nThat\u2019s enough of the choices aspect of the game. I think the author, Max Gladstone, deserves some praise for how beautifully written the novel is. The writing is rich and ambitious, without deterring the reader. It's descriptive in its detail of even the most minor parts of the book. Because of this, readers are treated to a wonderfully imagined world, in which they can feel a genuine tie to their character (even more so if you name it after yourself). In regards to the world, it is a very interesting fantasy world that readers are transported to. One that feels expansive and immersive, yet not too overwhelming. \n\n[b] EDIT [/b]: I am 90 minutes in and I have had some very enjoyable developments in my personal story within the game.

This is an excellent adventure in of itself.\n\n\nI am not much of an avid reader at all, but I do enjoy a good story, and this one was more than just a good story. The narration is amazing; Gladstone truly made a compelling world that I just dove into. My imagination is pretty dull in some ways, and I did my best to visualize the context of this game, but the writing did enough legwork to surprise even myself with the imagery that came to my mind.\n\nI've only done one playthrough so far, but I hunger for more lore and choices! I will definitely invest into games like these in the future from now on, especially with \"Choice of Games\" [The Publisher/Developer] products. \n\nI invite others to do the same! If you've never tried a text adventure type of game, or love this type of genre, then PLEASE give this a shot when you can!\n\nCheers and happy holidays!  ~Beeps", "timestamp_created": 1419450322, "timestamp_updated": 1419450322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13568099": {"recommendationid": "13568099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093440395", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419428352}, "language": "english", "review": "Strange, immersing at rather humorous at times, I'd seriously reccomend it, and for such a low price, it's amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1419428495, "timestamp_updated": 1419428495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13560564": {"recommendationid": "13560564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049734003", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419198573}, "language": "english", "review": "Choice of the Deathless has one of the most interesting names for a game I have seen on Steam. Admittedly, that was what first drew me to the game (as well as a recommendation from a Steam friend), as well as another friend taking note of the title. There's not much to say for the game visually; you are presented with words and the occaisional pop up saying you've completed an achievement. What it lacks visually it makes up for with writing because this is some of the wittiest writing I've seen on Steam, and its title seems fitting of its content.\n\nGiven that this is a straight Choose Your Own Adventure game, the choices you choose will matter a lot in determining what happens down the line. The writing itself is very good at giving you a taste of the world, and yet not holding your hand through ever single aspect of it. This can be a little daunting to new readers, because you can quickly become lost with all the facets of this universe. Luckily, this story is set in the same universe as the author's published \"Craft Sequence\" series, which may be of interest to anybody who thoroughly enjoyed this game.\n\nThe characters you encounter (as well as the dialogue options for yourself) feel fresh and amusing, and the choices allow for a broad range of answers. As I mentioned earlier, it's incredibly witty and so if you love writing like that this will be perfect for you. The kinds of scenarios written also feel very interesting, though the one thing that may be a downside to some readers is how some of the events/scenarios don't seem to connect to each other much, aside from a brief mention by a character or so (this is, however, wholly dependent on the choices you make I believe - I am currently going through each possible route). Overall, however, there is a story that does weave its way through your adventure, and while the ending itself may feel like a cliffhanger, it was still an enjoyable read. If you're unfazed by the text only visuals, then I highly recommend giving this a go.

The Gods have been slain, and demons are bound by magic to serve mortals, but they are always looking for ways to threaten the physical realm. There is a lot of awesome bits of lore like these that hint at a greater world. Your character is a member of a law firm that deals with demon contracts, so you are an interesting mix between lawyer and wizard.\n\nYou start off by just getting out of school and getting a junior position in the firm, shackled by crippling debt. Your goal is to earn money and power, while also dealing with interpersonal dilemmas. Each chapter ends in a personal conflict related to your case, which can be resolved in multiple ways. I chose to employ powerful magic and political backstabbing, but there are also options to deal with these by means of charm and friendship, sheer force of will, or trickery. The game keeps track of your stats depending on how you handle a situation, and you also develop reputation with certain characters. \n\nThere is a lot of great descriptions of the other lawyers, especially the more powerful ones, and ideas about magic that can only be expressed in text. I don't know how well the game will hold up on a second playthrough, but I suspect the scenarios will be the same, but with different side stories and reactions. I think there is more in depth characterization, even romances, if you specialize in charm, but I was a pretty ruthless guy who only had time for work. The ending was a satisfying conclusion. My bosses loved me.\n\nIt's cool to see Steam branch out into interactive fiction. It's a pretty underrated genre of video games.

The story was entertaining and fun. However, it felt like the many choices you make in the game didn't actually have any impact on the story. Many of the choices resulted in another just saying \"Perhaps.\" The choices you have in the beginning about being gay, lesbian, or straight, rich, poor, or middle class, save money, or live expensively don't seem to have any consequence either. I tried playing as both a man and woman as well as gay or straight but some of the characters genders kept switching so I couldn't even pursue who I wanted. There is an achievement for paying off your debt but I don't believe its possible to, even if you choose to be rich and then live frugally. There were plenty of choices which resulted in the same result but slightly different dialogue. The ending was good but also a bit disappointing in the resolution. No matter what you do the ending is the same for you. At the very end you get a choice to stay with your company or someone else offers you a job or you decided change careers, regardless you don't hear what happens after your choice. Making the decision is really pointless then. It seemed like a lame attempt to create multiple endings but that is not how it works. For the cheap price (it's already low, but I caught it on a sale!) the game is worth trying. You can finish it in an afternoon and I think its a good way to take a break from norm. I guess if you hate reading don't bother.\n\nI'd give this game a 3 out of 5 stars overall.\n2 out of 5 for the lack of real choice.\n4 out of 5 for the story.\n5 out of 5 for the theme. I felt like there were a lot of interesting details about how the world worked such as interaction with demons, post-God Wars backdrop, magic that actually requires skill, blood, liches walking around like its normal, etc. I think that was the best part of the game. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel with the same theme but also having real choice resulting in multiple story pathways and endings. Also, the character creation in the beginning actually impacting the story and how other characters react to you.\n\nI wish they had a save feature or at least a back button so you can change your answer without having to start the entire game over.", "timestamp_created": 1411754353, "timestamp_updated": 1411754353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12246662": {"recommendationid": "12246662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062326904", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409793647}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to be addicted to CYOA books when I was younger, and this is a good old-school taste of it.

As the store page mentions, you can choose your gender and sexuality without this affecting anything in the storyline, and thus you start your journey working at a \u201claw firm\u201d dealing with demons and other beings that exist in this world.\n\nQuickly you have to get used to your new work environment, and choose how you budget your expenses (Live downtown but pay high rent? Give yourself less pocket money?) These choices don\u2019t affect the story at all as far as I can tell, maybe unless you either go broke or completely pay off your student loans, none of which I\u2019ve done yet (I went for a neutral path moneywise).\n\nYou get to meet a variety of characters, some colleagues, some superiors, some clients, human, demon, and others. What you choose to say and how much time you choose to hang out with them affects your friendships and possible romance with them, which is pretty interesting - socializing matters! And if you\u2019re an ass people remember\u2026 So I\u2019d say this aspect is pretty interesting and where the game actually branches.\n\nScenario wise, I think you usually get the same most major scenarios to progress the story, and the choices you make in between aren\u2019t able to cancel a future major event happening. It will just affect what options you can choose to do in the scenarios. For example if the major scenario in year 3 is happening and you have some allies by spending time/ helping them in the first few years they may help you out. Or if you became enemies they might mess you up.\n\nStorywise I found it quite entertaining, the writing style is alright, I\u2019d say 7/10 in terms of smoothness and clearness. Would have liked some more details in how their world with humans and demons and other forms of life work, but how the author paints is it interesting and vivid enough on a small scale. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the 1.5 hours it took to finish this story, and there are way more paths I could choose. As mentioned though major scenarios are mostly the same, what makes variety is your relationships with other characters. Just like a real life workplace!

But, there are some heavy critic points.\nFirst, this game is completely soundless and pictureless. That there are no pictures is actually a good point since the picture in your head is mostlikely way better, but I still would have wished for music. But I can understnad that it's pretty hard to put music in this kind of game. How do you put music in, when you don't want to influence the players view on the happenings in the text?\n\nSecond, the game is short. In about two hours you can play it though, if you don't skip the textes. This is way too short. Even the point that there is no calm moment is not improving it, maybe even working against it. When I play a game in which I have so much controll over a actuall storyline, I want to experience the consequences more and heavely, not so subtly. For example: You begin an afair with a workmate and now you have a drama at your workplace. Maybe even a forced payless vacation, because this had influence on boths productivity. Or if you find a partner, why can't you two just enjoy your time with idle talk? That would be an additional chance to see a character in a new light and you could like them more.\n\nEverything else is just small stuff, like the game never told you it would save itself. I myself felt at first forced to play it though in one go.\n\nBut, if you want to read, no, to play a fantastic story, then this game is still perfect for you.

And here I am, having bought it [i]again[/i]. Quite simply, Choice of the Deathless is one of the finest games from developer 'Choice of Games' and it's all thanks to the creative, imaginative world so beautifully crafted by Max Gladstone. \n\nNow, I understand that the prospect of a text only, choose your own adventure game on Steam sounds mad, especially considering the current age of gaming, where titles are often harshly, and mostly unfairly, judged by how they look and how impressive their visuals are. I also understand that this game simply isn't for everyone. But I think this game is worth a shot. \n\nSet in a universe where lawyers use magic known as craft to negotiate contracts, aid demonic clients and even fight for their life, the concept of Max Gladstone's world itself is very interesting, although you could claim it's nothing entirely new. With masterful worldbuilding, witty dialogue and exceptional imagery, the world of 'Choice of the Deathless' comes alive and lures you in. As your character is flung from choice to choice, you'll definitely find a few favorite characters along the way as they are all packed with personality and life.\n\nAnd of course, while the game doesn't offer you much physical character customisation, the way the story is written pretty much allows you to simply just imagine your character in the story. That is the key to enjoying this game, imagination. \n\nIf I had any complaints, it would have to be that the game is largely linear. The main story path never deviates that much on repeat playthroughs with the exception of one or two minor details. But the choices you are given lead to a surprising amount of flexibility. By the end of each playthrough you'll have crafted a  mostly unique story each and every time.\n\nSo while the idea of a text only, choose your own adventure game being released on steam seems a bit mad, at the end of the day you'd be hardpressed to find a better example of the choose your own adventure genre out there and for an exceptionally low price, it really is hard to say no to 'Choice of the Deathless'.", "timestamp_created": 1409482342, "timestamp_updated": 1409482342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586357", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11931283": {"recommendationid": "11931283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031153452", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409513179}, "language": "english", "review": "Short game, but quite worth the low cost.", "timestamp_created": 1409468443, "timestamp_updated": 1409468443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11930984": {"recommendationid": "11930984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051450916", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497216923}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 wouldn't die again.", "timestamp_created": 1409465972, "timestamp_updated": 1409465972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11930162": {"recommendationid": "11930162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995865992", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409809653}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b] mystic alcoholic demon lawyer simulator [/b][/h1]\n\nThis interactive novel is great - awesome world and characters developed by really solid writing.

difficult ARPG tailored for hardcore gamers, but it also includes difficulty settings that will allow more casual gamers to enjoy it without being overwhelmed.  The story holds a great deal of nostalgia value for fans of the first two Ys games, but no prior knowledge is needed to understand and enjoy it.\n\nThe game world consists of only a single massive dungeon, though it does offer you a safe area at the start that you can warp back to at any time to consult with friendly NPCs and upgrade your weapon.  The dungeon itself is mostly a single path, with many short branches down which you will find critical upgrades.  Exploration is not emphasized in this game.  Combat is!\n\nThe difficulty even on the normal setting for this game is fairly challenging.  It expects you to find and make use of every upgrade, meaning that if you miss one, you may suddenly find yourself struggling (don't worry, you can go back to get anything you miss at any time).  Needless to say, Nitemare difficulty leaves very little room for mistakes!  Bosses all come with multiple phases and many unique attack patterns.  Healing during a boss fight is impossible, which makes it critical to avoid taking hits.  Even if a single hit doesn't seem very damaging, they will add up over the course of the fight if you are careless!\n\nThere are three main characters to choose from (one is unlockable) each with their own unique moveset and story.  This adds significant replay value to the game, for not only are you treated to an entirely unique perspective storywise, but you might find that facing down certain bosses with a radically different moveset requires an entirely different strategy.  On top of this there are also bonus modes, like Boss Rush and Time Attack.\n\nI would recommend this game to any and all fans of the ARPG genre.

Aufr\u00fcsten und Story Elementen unterbrochen wird. Die Bosse sind alle unterschiedlich genug um es zu genie\u00dfen. Fertigkeiten, die man erlangt um den Weg weiter zu gehen f\u00fchlen sich teilweise nur wie Schl\u00fcssel an, da sie im sp\u00e4teren Spiel nicht mehr gebraucht werden.\nDie meisten gro\u00dfen Bosse machen es notwenig auf sie zu springen um ihre Schwachpunkte zu attackieren. Aber die Sprite zu Sprite Interaktion kann hier ein bisschen schl\u00fcpfrig sein. Das wohl da die Bossmonster nicht wirklich Plattformen sind und der spielbare Charakter an Ecken h\u00e4ngen bleiben kann oder and Schr\u00e4gen abrutscht.\n\nDie Daialoge waren mir oft zu lang und das Spiel bricht f\u00fcr mich so ziemlich die Regel von \"Zeige, erzahl nicht!\". Die Hintergrundgeschichten der Charakter m\u00f6gen zwar nett sein und erg\u00e4nzen sich ganz gut mit den 3 spielbaren Charakteren im Spiel. Aber, da man als Spieler nichts davon erlebt hat ist es schwer sich involviert zu f\u00fchlen.\nStatt diesen langen Prologue mit Yggdrasil dem Weltenbaum h\u00e4tte die Geschichte vielleicht auf dieser Himmelsinsel starten k\u00f6nnen. Da dieser Ort im finalen Bosskampf und damit als Teil der Spielstory als so wichtig erachtet wird. Aber man hat Spieler keinen Bezug dazu.\n\nEs w\u00e4re nett gewesen wirklich wenigstens einen der \"Dunkelinge\" spielen zu k\u00f6nnen anstatt Toad, der nur auf die Seite der \"Dunkelinge\" gewechselt war. (Toad ist ein Charakter, der freigespielt wird wenn man mit Hugo und Yunika durgespielt hat.) Das h\u00e4tte f\u00fcr mich mehr tiefe in die Geschichte bebracht. Vielleicht war das an einem Punkt geplant gewesen, aber man hat es dann nicht umgesetzt. Die Hintergrund Geschichten dieser Charakter und warum sie genau diese Macht erstrebt haben w\u00e4re sehr interessant gewesen.\n\nDie posiitven Seiten sind die Atmosph\u00e4re. Tats\u00e4chlich sind die Graphiken und Musik das was ich mir von einem 3D \"Metroidvania\" gew\u00fcnscht h\u00e4tte.\n\nDie Story nur in R\u00fcckblenden erz\u00e4hlt zu bekommen und, dass erworbende Fertigkeiten wie das Unterwasser Atmen und diese Maske, die Geheimnisse sichtbar macht, nur einmal wirklich n\u00fctzlich waren ist schade.\n\nAber es hat trotzdem eine Menge Spa\u00df gemacht zu spielen.

exceto uma coisa: nosso ador\u00e1vel Adol Christin.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria acontece s\u00e9culos antes de Ys I, tratando de eventos relacionados ao fato de Ys ser uma ilha flutuante, as deusas estarem da maneira que est\u00e3o em Ys Chronicles e, n\u00e3o jogamos com Adol, mas controlamos dois ancestrais dos sacerdotes deste jogo.\n\nO grande problema da campanha curta de Chronicles \u00e9 corrigido aqui, com um jogo que pode exigir de 10 a 15 horas (ou mais, dependendo do jogador) num first run. Sendo dois personagens e um secreto, com pouca diferen\u00e7a em termos de tempo, o jogo vai exigir, no m\u00ednimo, 25 a 30 horas para que todas as informa\u00e7\u00f5es poss\u00edveis do jogo sejam reveladas.\n\nVale o tempo gasto, tio Zanatus? Com certeza. A trilha sonora, como dito, mant\u00e9m a qualidade, trazendo ainda m\u00fasicas antigas e conhecidas, em remasteriza\u00e7\u00f5es e melhoras nos arranjos. \nA jogabilidade foi melhorada, abandonando o bump system passando para um action/RPG de a\u00e7\u00e3o mais fren\u00e9tica e intuitiva, ainda contando com sistema de combos, r\u00e1pidas trocas de magias e armas, e uma m\u00edriade de comandos para ataques diferentes.\n\nCompra obrigat\u00f3ria para qualquer um que jogou o Chronicles.\n\nOs CONTRAS? O jogo ainda exige grind, e isso \u00e9 um ponto bom e ruim, por n\u00e3o se tratar de um grind comum a RPGs e similares. Nas dificuldades extras e modos extras, o replay \u00e9 muito alto, mas a dificuldade vai afastar boa parte dos jogadores.\nTodos podem zerar? Sim.

Simple Story. Fast and Exciting gameplay. Relatable Characters. And there are still more to come for me. I was scrolling looking for a game like Tales Of and came across this series. I went to http://digitalemelas.com/index_ys.php to figure where I should start the saga. You should check out the link, if you want a little background on what the series entails. \n\nMore about the game.\n\nThere are two characters you can start out with, Yunica and Hugo. So far I would say Yunica and one of the hidden characters has the best story line. I'm easily going to sink another 5-7hrs each hidden character you can unlock. Besides that it is pretty simple. You are to fight your way through waves of demons to find out why the two Goddesses have went missing. You learn more about the land and a bit about the people outside of your home, the solomon shrine, and what has really caused all of the conflict in the land.\n\nThe controls are very responsive on controller and mouse/keyboard.

I loved the action gameplay and the different variety of dungeons that you can explore. The magic system was also cool but too reliant upon. This game`s style reminds me a lot of Oath in Felghana`s gameplay with the magic and combat. It was nice to see the similarities. It was cool to play as three different characters, each with their own backstories and combat traits unique to them. I thought the whole endless dungeon crawler became repetitive over time as I completed each character`s story one after another. I thought we`d actually be able to explore the kingdom of Ys in this game but it was just a tower structure with endless dungeons one after the other. Regardless, the game does a great job of introducing the characters and the story behind the goddesses as well.

Seeing the similarities with this game I decided to pick it up, and while I wasn't disappointed I also wasn't nearly as impressed as I was with Oath in Felghana.\n\nThe game takes place all in a tower with numerous floors. The floors have different themes, but they're still floors in a tower. As a result the game doesn't really feel as grand in scope as Oath in Felghana. It feels like a long day, which I guess is the intent going by the story, but somehow it just lacks that same feel of a big journey that I tend to enjoy in games like this. Oath in Felghana took you from mines to volcanoes to mountains to castles, and the varieties of enemies and bosses complemented that. There is still variety in bosses and enemies in this game, but it just doesn't feel nearly as expansive.\n\nThere's also a sort of eye-rolling quality to the story that Oath in Felghana didn't have. Maybe this is because I played through as Yunica, but the \"oh I'm so inexperienced\" shtick got rather annoying pretty quickly. Maybe this is also due to the tower theme, as over the course of a long day she went from totally inexperienced to besting legendary demons of unimaginable power. There are two other characters, one of which is unlocked, and they may not have had that same annoyance factor, but I couldn't really get up the desire to play through the game again.\n\nWhich I guess leads to my personal biggest point in the comparison to Oath in Felghana, which is that I replayed Oath 3 times moving up through the various difficulties, whereas this game I picked the hard difficulty, played through once, and couldn't summon the interest to play it again. I enjoyed the one playthrough, but it just didn't stick with me and keep me wanting more like Oath in Felghana did.\n\nBased on all that, if you had to pick one Ys title to play, don't make it this one - go for Oath in Felghana. But if you loved Oath and want more, this game might not wow you in the same ways but it will still satisfy.", "timestamp_created": 1511617680, "timestamp_updated": 1511617801, "voted_up": true,

Finally Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana is all that is left. With a early 2018 expected release date for PC. Below is how I rank the games I have played and beat so far from best to worst.

The combat and attack controls are better then any other Ys game. Near perfection I must say.  Normal enemies are not as tough to take down as in other Ys titles. But feel detailed and original even among other Ys games.. The boss fights are very challenging! The game is not the longest in length but has three charachters meaning more replay value. Level design is fairly good too. The game has less metroidvania elements then other Ys games but it still gets the job done. What I mean by metroidvania is returning to old areas with new powers to exsplore more. There are parts were you will get a little tired of grinding but other Ys games have been worse. No major issues I have with the game. As in many Ys Games the controls and combat may take a little to get used too.

Ever since I've played Ys VI, I've been hooked. Oath in Felghana drew me in with it's fast-paced and action packed RPG gameplay.\n\nThis game is no exception, and was well worth the years it took to finally get an English translation. I have to say, I'm not disappionted.\n\nThe main thing that sets this game apart from the others was the inclusion of 3 playable characters (before Seven made the party system). Each of these characters play different enough from each other, and each of them are just so much fun to play.\n\nPlayable Characters: Yunica is as close to the familiar gameplay that started with Ys VI, with strong melee and straightforward magic attacks. Hugo is a ranged spellcaster with interesting magic attacks. Then you unlock the Claw, who uses fast melee with a powerful boost mode to go with it (you'll understand when unlock him). \n\nThe Gameplay: This game is a fast paced 3D platforming Action RPG style game. The combat is fast, brutal, and some enemies will require more than just hacking and slashing to beat. Learn your movement and attacks, and you should do just fine. There is some exploration, but nothing too big, so you shouldn't get lost. The controls are pretty simple and fluid, but I do recommand a controller.\n\nThe Presentation: The presentation pretty good, even if the enviroments aren't the most impressive looking. Then again, graphics can't sell a game completely. After all, a shiny pile of crap is still a pile of crap. The character artwork looks nice too, and the visual effects are nice to look at as you slaughter your way through monsters. \n\nThe Music: As to be expected from Falcom's own in house rock band, the songs are blood pumping rock songs. Each song will get you pumped to fight all manner of monsters, be it a set of mooks or a massive boss. The Ys is legendardy for this, and this game has it just as good.\n\nThe Story: As far as plots go, they're pretty alright. Ys has never really been known for complex or deep storylines, but it's decent enough to keep you interested in the characters. I'm not gonna say much, because why would I spoil the plot? Thankfully, the plot is fast enough that you won't be spending too much time on the dialouge, so you can get right back to the action.\n\nThe Difficulty: There's plenty of options here for anyone to enjoy. You can take it easy on lower difficulites like Easy or Normal, or go straight for a quick death on something like Nightmare or Inferno mode.\n\nExtra Modes: Even if you finish the Story mode, you still have Time Attack, a Boss Rush mode, and an Arena mode with some extra goodies to get from playing it. Arena Mode is where most of my hours after the Story Mode was done.\n\nIn Conclusion: This game is simply wonderful. It's well worth the price and will give you plenty of enjoyment for hours. The only problems you may find is that the platforming can be a little problematic at times, but nothing you can't deal with.

The most refined combat and best level design.  Which, well, is good...because you're going to be playing it through several times.  The good this game does, in giving you three unique characters to play with, having one of the more fleshed-out stories of the older Ys games, having the most polished combat, is somewhat tempered by the fact that you have to see it all multiple times to beat the game (one for each playable character).  On top of that, it's all set in a tower, so while you have a lot of variation in theme from floor to floor, it [i]is[/i] all in-doors.  This lends a sense of progression since you can quantify how much you're progressing through the tower, but it also leaves the game feeling, I dunno, claustrophobic compared to the outdoors settings in all the other games.  \n\nThis game continues the long Ys tradition of great OSTs--Genesis Beyond the Beginning being one of my stand-out favorites.  \n\nIf you've played any of the other Ys games and enjoyed them, Ys Origin is a no-brainer.  If you're looking to get into the series here, you can, but you'll be missing some obvious context, mainly from Ys 1 and 2, which this is a prequel to.  However, I'd say the story stands well enough on its own that you can get away with skipping those two (especially since their combat does not hold up well).", "timestamp_created": 1503563669, "timestamp_updated": 1503563834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34162878": {"recommendationid": "34162878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209928564", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504679611}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u8c01\u6709steam\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5668\u554a\uff0c\u5b9e\u5728\u5237\u4e0d\u52a8\u4e86\u60f3\u62ff\u4fee\u6539\u5668\u8fc7\u53bb\uff0c\u7f51\u4e0a\u627e\u7684\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528", "timestamp_created": 1502436004, "timestamp_updated": 1502436101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34148700": {"recommendationid": "34148700", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988486869", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 2037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502377793}, "language": "koreana", "review": "8.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1502377948, "timestamp_updated": 1502377948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34118459": {"recommendationid": "34118459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233945348", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469962506}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f0a\u82cf\uff0c\u66fe\u7ecf\u7684\u6211\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u4e09\u904d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u4f9d\u7a00\u8bb0\u5f97\u5973\u795e\u727a\u7272\u81ea\u5df1\u65f6\u6211\u5dee\u70b9\u5c31\u54ed\u4e86\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u5173\u8fd8\u6709\u4e2a\u5f69\u86cb\uff0c\u7ea2\u53d1\u8272\u9b54\u89d2\u8272\u89e3\u9501\u3002bgm\u6ee1\u5206\uff0c\u4f0a\u82cf\u7cfb\u5217\u7684bgm\u90fd\u5f88\u8d5e\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u6211\u73a9\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u90fd\u4f1a\u542c\u4f0a\u82cf\u7684bgm\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u559c\u6b22\u65e5\u5f0frpg\u5e76\u4e14\u559c\u7231\u770b\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u4eba\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502257131, "timestamp_updated": 1502257131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34115481": {"recommendationid": "34115481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338625111", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501391407}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u5f88\u597d\u542c~", "timestamp_created": 1502241076, "timestamp_updated": 1502241076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34104135": {"recommendationid": "34104135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083367301", "num_games_owned": 862, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461543972}, "language": "english", "review": "I LUV DIS GAME, I LUV DE SOUNDTRACKS \n\n1000/10", "timestamp_created": 1502201274, "timestamp_updated": 1502201274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34094133": {"recommendationid": "34094133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273011256", "num_games_owned": 1680, "num_reviews": 185, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502156857}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]Vine buscando cobre y encontre oro [/h1]\n\nPues... wow. \nCompre este jueguito pensando que era un rpg generico de turnos o algo asi y pues la verdad nada que ver xD\nEs un \"rpg\" que quiere ser  hack n slash muy bueno; la mecanica es simple; vas por cuartitos encontrando secretitos mientras matas cositas que te encuentras en el camino y resuelvez puzzles o descubres secretines.\n\n>La historia (a grandes rasgos):\nHay una torre que aparece de la nada y las \"reinas/diosas\" del reino van a revisar; al ver que no regresan.

It took me a dozen different work arounds to successfully pass the cut scene to fight the boss. Once I beat the final boss, I was elated! To only be stripped of that elation moments later. I wasn't going through that ordeal again for the chance that the game will end.\n\nI'm highly disappointed therefore I'm changing my rating to do not recommend.

accomapnying Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim, but takes place before Ys 1 and 2, the first games in the series. I strongly recommend playing Ys 1 and 2 before you play Origins, as much of Origins is a complete retread of 1 and 2 to the point where it feels like a modern retelling of the story, for purposeful reasons. While the description of the game describes it asa \"Metroidvania\", it has ery little to do with the genre - there's very little backtracking save for 2 specific parts of the story, and the use of new skills is almost entirely 'going forward', rather than unlocking new parts of previosu content.\n\nYs Origins takes place 700 years before Ys 1 and 2, and tells the tale of three adventurers, Yunica, Hugo, and a 3rd unlockable, as they scale the Tower of Darm searching for the Goddesses, who have gone missing from Ys. Yunica and Hugo's stories are slightly different, and the game is short enough to where playing them both (and then the 3rd character, for the \"Canon Story\") is something that can be accomplished in about 20-25 hours of game time. If all you care about is the story, my recommendation is to play it in the order of Yunica -> Hugo -> 3rd Character, all on Very Easy or Normal, depending on your skill. If you're an achievement hunter or looknig to 100% the game, be aware that you'll be beating the game a minimum of 6 times, with 3 of those being on the hardest difficulty level, Nightmare. You'll also be doing side arena challenges and grinding them for extra, non story related, content. There's little reason to play difficulties between Very Easy, Normal, or Nightmare in my opinion - one for just experiencing the story, one for a standard challenge, and one to tear your hair out.\n\nThe art style and presentation is much the same as the rest of the Ys series: A bombastic, anime-styled tale full of dramatic adventure and magic, backed by orchestral and rock music that constantly keeps the game running at a full throttle energetic pace. Each section of the tower is themed with a new, vibrant tileset, so climbing the new sections of the mega dungeon feels different aesthetically. Returning fans of the series will find the game runs so much common ground with Ys 1 and 2 that oftentimes you'll know how to solve a puzzle or sidequest just from the presentation of it. The instant you get the Blue Necklace, you know what it's used for, and as soon as you see the Dreaming Idol, you know you're looking for something to slot into it, and so on. It's full of pleasant callbacks, as the entire game takes place within Darm's Tower, and on some level, feels like a modern remake of the second half of Ys 1.\n\nCombat is still breakneck paced, and runs off the engine of the previous games. For those unaware, the Bump Combat system of the early Ys games was replaced by a button mashing swift attack and magic combo system, with no directly usable healing items. Healing items drop from killing enemies, as do strength, defense, and MP regen buffs. EXP earned also increases the longer your combo goes, and so combat entails you mad dashing from room to room, constantly hammering and crashing through foes to keep up your combo and buff meters. There is also a \"Boost System\" that ups your character's defenses and their magic powers, but doesn't directly buff their attack, making using it a matter of skill more than button mashing. The game works to keep you constantly engaged, and it accomplishes it magnificently. As you go through the game, you feel powerful, as skills level up and your own ability to plow effortlessly through mobs increases. The game also features SP you use to level up abilities outside of direct XP, things like decreasing MP cost for spells, increasing the boost meter recharge, increasing resists to statuses, and so on.\n\nThe two characters differ, both in story presentation and in combat. While the basics of the story are the same, the characters accomplish different goals, and NPCs are seen in a different light based on who you choose. The 3rd unlockable character's story is different in its entirety and features new bosses and content not seen in the other paths. Yunica Tovah is a magic-less knight who fights with a battleaxe (and later a Greatsword), similarly to Adol, the protagonist of the other games, and those familiar with Ys will find she's an easy fit. Hugo Fact is a magician who handles like a walking shmup character, firing blasts and lasers, sacrificing speed for range. His abilities are slighlty less straightforward than Yunica's, but having a spammed range attack option that pierces enemies in a Ys game makes the game so much easier it almost feels like cheating at times.\n\nBosses continue to be highlight encounters of the series, and test your pattern recognition and reaction speed in equal measure. I did not play on Nightmare, and have no desire to, but there are a few bosses who I can only assume would be absolutely maddening to go through. Yunica in general has a harder time with bosses due to being melee, and due to her block mechanism being a timed parry rather than an easy to put up forcefield - but it's not much of a difference, and you quickly find that Yunica can go completely hyper aggressive, using her guard parry to allow her to constantly stay in a boss's face with no fear whatsoever. In general I would say the expanded repertoire of the game makes the bosses in the Napishtim Engine games easier. I have not played Oath or Ark yet, so I unfortunately can't compare to those games, but from what I hear, those two games are more difficult in boss terms than Origins.\n\nAll in all, a story that explains the \"Origins\" of the series, coupled with a sterling presentation, and consistently fun, engaging gameplay, the Ys series continues to impress. It should be at the forefront of any action gamer's list to play, if they haven't already. With a wide range of difficulties to accomodate all skill levels, and a relatively short playtime per story, completing and learning everything is well within the grasp of even non-hardcore gamers who might otherwise be put off by the series' somewhat legendary difficulty levels among its more rabid fans.", "timestamp_created": 1499741692, "timestamp_updated": 1499741692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33331958": {"recommendationid": "33331958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089565611", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507330761}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego perfecto a mi gusto, a pesar de que no soy fan de este genero, Ys Origins es un juego muy movido y con controles muy buenos, ademas de tener una historia y una banda sonora perfecta..... simplemente es un juego hermoso y muy poco conocido.", "timestamp_created": 1499399237, "timestamp_updated": 1499399237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33212640": {"recommendationid": "33212640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301126451", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503826649}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f0a\u82cf\u5728RPG\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u65e0\u53ef\u64bc\u52a8\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1499137701, "timestamp_updated": 1499137701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33167484": {"recommendationid": "33167484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289692728", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500177058}, "language": "koreana", "review": "2D", "timestamp_created": 1499057206, "timestamp_updated": 1499057206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33150713": {"recommendationid": "33150713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111147894", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476656032}, "language": "english", "review": "If i would be born in a 2nd life,i would deffinetly buy this game again and again and again,this is worth all the money", "timestamp_created": 1499026485, "timestamp_updated": 1499026485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33057119": {"recommendationid": "33057119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104036352", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498857922}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys Origin, is a fun game but it might not be for you.\n\nThe story is very cheesy, if you're into the typical jrpg story and dialog, you're in for a treat. The conversations were especially cheesy. I would not be able to finish the game if it were not for the playing aspects.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple, a mix between top down and side scroller, the game is actually 3D. Much of the game is linear, and you remain in a single tower for the entire game. Just going up, up, up.\n\nIt provides various difficulty settings, which is nice and may give you a second run through. The other option is to pick onw of the other charaters to play through, there are three.\n\nThe leveling system is nice and they do a good job here, making sure you can run into difficult enemies that later become easy due to your level.\n\nThere are items you can obtain that do special things, like avoid certain damage or have a physical mechanic.\n\nThe controls were simple, but I wish I could customize the controls a bit more and separate some of the actions from a single button. For instance they tie attack and confirm and this should be allowed to be broken out. There is one more thing that makes me mad and that is you can't jump after attacking right away and it just makes it feel clunky, where you can attack and avoid damage appropriately.\n\nGraphics a clean, colorful and nice to look at. Still old school and simple, but they do an okay job with animations. The sprites are not 3D, they have several poses depending on the direction your facing. This means they are flat, but that's okay for me at least.\n\nMusic is typical of these genres, Some electric guitar and fast past background noise. Not by any means memorible.\n\nThere are several bosses as you climb the levels of the tower, each level is pretty short but the leveling aspect takes a bit longer, so you do have to level grind a bit, going back a forth between enemies to boost the return of exp.\n\nThere a temp buffs that boost states and exp. Enemies drop this. There are no consumable items for healing or cure, all of them are used instant on pickup. Buffs are the same way so you need to kill enemies fast to keep buffs.\n\nNone of the bosses were particularly challenging to solve their weakness. Last boss was a bit, but it's pretty much just magic and attack. Timing plays a part and figuring out the enmies attack pattern.\n\nI played the game on Hard from the get go so the challenge is what kept me going. Not sure if I would have continued if it were easy, since the story is so cheesy.\n\nI purchased this for cheap, couple bucks. I wouldn't pay more the that, since there are many go titles in the ball park. But than I guess my top limit is like $25 for any game.

I've had Ys III for years but never got around to playing it. After BoneSnapDeez and Exhuminator, two of my friends from the Racketboy forums,\u00a0recommended Ys Origin to me as a good entry point for the series, I figured I'd take their advice and give it shot considering that I had it in my Steam library already. I've played a lot of games on recommendations, but this is probably the best recommendation I've ever gotten for a game.\n\nYs Origin is a very approachable action RPG, and it's a damn good one at that. It offers five different difficulties, making it a good romp for veteran players as well as a non-threatening entry point for new players. You get to play as one of two different characters (three once you've cleared the game once), and while I only played through as one (axe chick ftw), my understanding is that the main plot of the game is largely the same between the two with minor perspective details differing - certainly worth playing through with all characters if you want every side to the story but not different enough that you NEED to play through the game three times to get the Ys lore.\n\nI'll try not spoil anything, but the basic plot of the game is that the two goddesses of Ys have vanished from the magical floating temple where all the humans live without a trace down to the surface which has been overrun by and infested with demons for the past a lot of years. Your character - whichever of the two you pick - accompanies a search party of mages and knights to the surface on a mission to find and protect the goddesses. The game itself takes place entirely within a giant towers that the demons erected to try to reach and/or rival the magical floating shrine place.\n\nThe visuals are charming, and the soundtrack is superb. Honestly, the game is worth playing through just for an excuse to listen to the music. The narrative is delivered entirely through subtitles - no voice acting - so there are no aggravating voices to interrupt the bitching music. My only real gripe with the entire game is a minor technical problem - the aspect ratio. I played on Steam, so I don't know if the regular PC release is any more cooperative, but I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the aspect ratio set to 16:9 instead of 4:3 (assuming there is a way at all). I know it's not the end of the world, but I was playing on my Steam Link on my giant living room TV, and the huge (or, as our president-elect says, yuge) black bars on the sides got irritating. Aside from that, though, this game is about as flawless as I can imagine any action RPG being.\n\nYs Origin is not a long game - it took me about 10 hours to clear - but I think that the length is actually pretty solidly in the Goldilocks zone for this game. It's not so short that it feels like it's over in the blink of an eye, but it also doesn't drag on and on and on and on like a lot of RPGs start to. It lasts long enough to tell a story, get you involved in it, offer some compelling and satisfying challenges, and then let you on your way. Speaking of satisfaction, the most satisfying part of the game for me was definitely the boss battles. The bosses in Ys Origin - and in Ys games in general, from what I've been told - are all a matter of figuring out the \"key\" so to speak to victory. You can't just rush a boss and blindly start hacking at it and expect to win (unless you're ridiculously overpowered, I guess). You have to take note of a boss's attacks, look for possible weak spots, and find out how to exploit those weakness while taking as little damage as possible, and it will often take an attempt or two to figure out how to win. I was only able to beat three of the game's bosses in one attempt (ironically, though, those were the last three bosses of the game, but I'd powered up the strongest armor and maxed out my weapon upgrades as well as being a pretty high level, so I think I might have been a smidge OP by that point).\n\nYs Origin is not without its flaws....but those flaws are very, very few and very, very far between. Those used to super long RPGs may be left wanting at the end of Ys Origin, but for those of us who like to get a story and move on to the next story, the length is perfect, and for those of you who enjoy longer games, the three playable characters offer roughly 30 to 40 hours of gameplay for you. Ys Origin is, in my mind, as close to a perfect action RPG as I've ever played, and I look forward to collecting and playing the rest of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1498524853, "timestamp_updated": 1498524853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512259", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32806939": {"recommendationid": "32806939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191338545", "num_games_owned": 1054, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480389284}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u6570\u4e0d\u591a\u7684ARPG\u4f73\u4f5c\uff01\u54c7\uff01\u8fd9\u723d\u5feb\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c~\u81ea\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d77\u6e90\u662f\u4f0a\u82cf\u7cfb\u5217\u5dc5\u5cf0...\n\u8c01\u8bf4\u8d77\u6e90\u662f\u7ec8\u70b9\uff01\u867d\u7136\u6b22\u4e50\u767e\u4e16\u6ca1\u80fd\u628a\u4f0a\u82cf\uff1a\u6811\u6d77\u548cV\u2161\u987a\u5229\u767b\u9646Steam~\n\u4f46\u662ffalcom\u4eb2\u81ea\u628a\u4f0a\u82cf8\u641e\u5230\u4e86Steam\u5e73\u53f0\uff012017\u5e74\u79cb\u5b63\u53d1\u552e\uff01\n\u672c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7\u8ddf\u7d22\u5c3cPY\u4ea4\u6613\u4e0d\u4f1a\u518d\u6709PC\u4e00\u4efd\u4e86\uff0c\u8c01\u77e5\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\u723d~\u5e0c\u671b\u4e0d\u8981\u662fPSV\u79fb\u690d\u7248\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6211\u5728\u5984\u60f3\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498468141, "timestamp_updated": 1498473279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32795791": {"recommendationid": "32795791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074564799", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499213415}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has so many issues.

environment as that installment of YS, by which I mean the near impossible jumps with no clue as to how to extend your jumps, this game is filled with fantastic music, fun fast gameplay mechanics and a decent variety of way's to play with a total of three playable characters in the long run who all play dramatically different dood. \n\nIt has a decent amount of story which held my interest from start to finish with each character, it's not super hard but not easy so the gameplay is satisfying there too, if you are looking for a fun adventure game to whittle your hours away with and rock out to some really nice soundtrack's then I highly suggest this game, even going through on the other playthrough's and fighting the same bosses (which is a negative granted) is fun due to the variety of the other characters fighting styles and change of tactics dood. \n\nAs a final note for fans of the other games, you do not play as Adol in this game but instead three other characters who as far as I am aware unless I missed something have nothing to do with Adol either, if you do buy this game (as a result of my haphazard review no less) I hope ya all enjoy it dood's. :D", "timestamp_created":

der Zeit verbringt man mit Hack & Slay, immer den Turm weiter nach oben. Ganze Monsterhorden werden mittels Angriffen, Spezialangriffen und Magie in Windwseile in Loot verwandelt. Die Monster sind dabei vielf\u00e4ltig und oft gegen bestimmte Schadensarten besonders anf\u00e4llig. Von riesigen Rittern, deren gro\u00dfer Schild alle Angriffe von vorne abblockt bis zu fliegenden irgendwas, die Monster sind abwechslungsreich und mitunter sogar anspruchsvoll.\nKonterpunkt stellen die Bossk\u00e4mpfe dar. Sie sind anspruchsvoll und man muss die Taktiken der Bosse verinnerlichen. Im richtigen Moment springen, im richtigen Moment zur\u00fcckgehen, wer einfach reinrennt, stirbt. Manche Bosse sind derart anspruchsvoll, dass man Stunden damit verbringen kann sie zu legen, ich pers\u00f6nlich kam mir aber nie betrogen vor, sondern \u00e4rgerte mich \u00fcber meine eigenen Fehler.\nWem Ys Origin mal zu schwer erscheint, der findet im Levelsystem eine einfache M\u00f6glichkeit es sich leichter zu machen. Ist ein Boss mit Level 23 zu schwer, kann es schon helfen einfach bis Level 24 einfache Monster umzuhauen und schon verursacht man selber mehr Schaden am Boss. Man sollte jedoch nicht vergessen zu speichern, denn Ys Origin tut es nicht f\u00fcr den Spieler. Oldscool.\nEtwas Kritik: Leider l\u00e4sst sich die Schwirigkeit nicht im Spiel, sondern nur am Anfang des Spiels, einstellen. Wer 4h gespielt hat und Partout den Boss nicht schafft h\u00e4tte hier vielleicht gerne eine Alternative. Auch ist das Spiel ziemlich linear. Letzter Kritikpunkt: Japanische Spiele muss man m\u00f6gen. G\u00f6tter die von Menschen gefangen genommen werden? Geh\u00f6rt zur Story, als h\u00f6rt gef\u00e4lligst auf zu fragen warum! Ach ja, und warum die kleine Pelzige Kreatur in der Ecke die m\u00e4chtigste Robe im Spiel hat? WEIL HALT!\nErw\u00e4hnen sollte ich noch den guten und stimmungsvollen Soundtrack und die teils brilliante Artwork in den Zwischensequenzen.\nAch ja, das Spiel l\u00e4sst sich mit drei grund verschiedenen Charakteren spielen. Ritter, Zauberer und  Hakentyp.

You will be hearing a lot of that.\n+ It's like a mostly-2D cutesy Dark Souls.\n+ Controls are mostly very tight, the only weird thing I noticed was sometimes accidentally firing a second skill after using a charged skill. If you get hit, it's probably your fault.\n+ Bosses are all sufficiently unique that it feels good to die to them over and over again until you learn their patterns and beat them into the ground.\n- Level scaling and equipment levels' effects are ridiculous. It seems like either the designers or programmers didn't know how much damage a boss should do or take. After spending ten minutes grinding a few levels or finding weapon or armour upgrades, a boss can go from doing 20 damage a hit and taking 50 a hit to doing 8 damage and taking 100. It doesn't take that long to grind, but it's make-work and is frustrating when you just want to beat the shit out of the boss on a balanced playing field. It also feels pretty lame when you enter a new area and are suddenly doing 1 damage a hit to enemies that look almost identical to the ones you have been pulping before.\n- No auto/turbofire function for Hugo, the projectile-spamming character. I gave up on him after an hour when I decided damaging my hands was not worth it. \n- Puzzles are mostly formulaic and consist of find x item and bring it to y location. Potentially cool stuff like the Mask of Eyes which lets you see and interact with hidden objects while blinding you to living creatures is used only a few times in the entire game.\n- Plot is completely ignorable.

The story and characters are quite adorable. The tower is well laid out, simple small maps for each level/story, yes it feels like a dungeon crawler,but technically its a tower. In which you start your adventure at the base of the tower searching for 2 princesses. Music is really well done, animations etc, just exceptional, a really cute fun game. Technically as an aRPG fan this game is well worth full price, but if you are like me and have a large back log of great games, it comes on sale for a few dollars now and then. For a few dollars this one is a no brainer, as a casual and value gamer this one is a steal of a deal. Do not miss this one! Probably the cutest aRPG I own. Yes i say aRPG, it really doesn't feel like a jRPG to me honestly. Mostly because when the game starts, the story telling is in French(I am pretty sure) and English dubbed. Some may not like the unskippable cutscenes, especially if you have already had one playthrough, I personally am not really a fan of visual novels either but once the gameplay actually starts up, its not that bad or as long of cut scenes, but I do agree there should be some sort of skip/next button.", "timestamp_created": 1487526766, "timestamp_updated": 1487527219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30030009": {"recommendationid": "30030009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017179501", "num_games_owned": 612, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488758978}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start off with saying I own Ys III for the SNES but other than that game of the series, this is my first time really sitting down and playing an Ys game.

I will keep this as short as I can and layout the pros/cons and give a summarization.\n\nPros:\n-The graphics in this game are great with lots of detail in most areas\n-You will level up fast and find that enemies will never be to overpowered \n-The music in the game is fantastic and will usually not get too dull\n-Bosses are great, fun to fight and great music with them too\n-The story is decent although a little cliche\n-New players to the series will feel welcomed and don't need to play the others to understand whats going on\n\nCons:\n-Collecting all ore in order to power your weapons is necessary, bosses will be to strong if you miss 2 or more later in game\n-There are some cheap deaths in the game such as having a certain item equipped will kill you instantly if you don't already know about it, or a certain boss will be able to trap you (unfairly) and you will take massive damage with no way to regain health during the fight.\n-The game doesn't give that well explanations on what items do and whether you need to equip them or not in order to use them (some are passive with no explanation of it)\n-Mid to late game you will start to see enemies from the early game that are just stronger than before (hp and strength,  some aquire new moves too)\n-Weapons are pretty bland and basic for Yunica, not sure about the other two characters.\n\nAlthough I go into detail about the cons, I found that I really liked and enjoyed the game and will continue to play it with new characters to see what the difference is between them and update this review once I have done so. I do also plan to play the other games of the series because I do love this type of gameplay/story. For now I will rate the game a 8 out of 10.

It has (I think) the most bosses, it also has the best bosses, its dungeon is really well-designed for the most part, and the action got even further refinement from Oath in Felghana. There are two problems however. Having three character is nice, but having to play three times is not nice, especially when considering the dungeon design stay more or less the same. And when that third and hidden character's story is the \"truth,\" it means you have to play it at least twice to get the actual story.\n\nSo it actually comes down to how much into Ys you are. I do not recommend this to people who are going into Ys for the first time; it's not a good reflection of how Ys series actually work, because it's a game entirely based on dungeon-crawling. Not only that, the storytelling is more similar to Trails series than Ys series (same scenario writer), so you have to be fine with crap-ton of dialogues.\n\nIf you like Ys 6 and Felghana, you can just play it once as Yunica to feel satisfied with its mechanics, because it's one hell of a tight ARPG, but really, the game wants you to have played Ys 1 and Ys 2 before playing this. The level design, story, characters, background music, they are all designed around the fact this is a prequel to Ys 1 and Ys 2, and the game doesn't shy away from making that connection.\n\nBut to be honest, if you've played Ys 1 and Ys 2 and have fond memories of it, Ys Origin has such a good story that gets to you in so many ways. There are so many subtle connections to Ys 1 and Ys 2, and a lot of them add a lot of emotions to those games retrospectively. You get to understand its lore better, a few of its characters better, and you get to understand why and how things came to be when Adol first got washed ashore on Esterian beach in Ys 1. It's dependant on whether you have played those games or not, so it's not recommended to everyone, but if you have, this is a must.", "timestamp_created": 1484924361, "timestamp_updated": 1484925067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29291572": {"recommendationid": "29291572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201837847", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478703271}, "language": "italian", "review": "Riprende il Gameplay di Ys Oath in Felghana e Naphistim, unendo il tutto a 3 personaggi che si controllano diversamente, personaggi interessanti, trama buona ed il solito gameplay action nonstop tipico della serie.\nDivertentissimo e consigliatissimo.

Not a huge deal if you're just doing \"regular\" playthroughs, because each story is pretty unique and there isn't much overlap. Where this gets annoying is if you're going for the Steam achievements where you have to beat the \"unbeatable\" bosses, because you have to reset the game every time you fail and go through the dialogue again, because dying doesn't trigger \"retry\" option. \n\n\nYs Origin is one of those games that I wish I could go back in time and experience all over again. I picked this gem up a few years ago on a whim, and wow. W-O-W. From the combat to the characters to the classic-but-heart-wrenching story, this game delivers on all fronts. The story is beautifully unveiled, as you can play through with three different characters (one unlockable after beating the game with either one of the starting characters), and each one tells a different story, so you have to beat all three playthroughs to get the full story, and there is a special last boss that is only available on the secret character. (as well as a special ending sequence) What makes this great is that each character plays completely differently, so in addition to having new story content you have a completely new playstyle to learn, which especially affects the boss fights. Personally I chose axe-girl (yunica) --> mage (hugo) --> secret character, and I would recommend playing through in that order, because Hugo is a little OP so you spoil yourself if you start with him, and the secret character reveals all the secret details of the story so it's best to do last. \n\nFrom the moment I picked the game up I couldn't put it down, grinding my way through 3 nightmare playthroughs (yes I'm insane), and completing the challenges for beating the bosses that are supposed to be too hard for you to beat. (You know those bosses that are supposed to kick your ass in the storyline, where you're supposed to beat them the next time you fight them? Well you *can* beat them for a steam achievement, although it only changes a few lines of dialogue, and they are FRIGGEN HARD). I had many moments on my first playthrough that had me screaming and raging at the screen as I started my 15th, 20th, or even 30th attempt at a specific boss. I chose nightmare mode to be challenged, and it doesn't disappoint. But even with the frustration of getting my @$$ kicked repeatedly, the combat was so good, and the story was so engaging that I kept coming back for more. \n\nOne thing that I think is very cool is that the bosses actually gain new moves and effects as you increase the difficulty, rather than just stat boosts. I only played on nightmare but if you want to play through on a lower difficulty first, the fight will be different when you up the slider, which is excellent design. \n\nThe game was so good that I instantly went out and bought all the other Ys games on Steam. Unfortunately, I fell a little bit TOO in love with the characters in Origin, and was saddened that I wouldn't be able to play them again in the other games (because Origin is set 700 years prior to the rest of the series). That combined with the fact that I was uncertain if I wanted to play the (very) old Ys1&2, but not wanting to play the games out of order, meant I didn't end up playing any of the others! At least, until now. I can gladly say that I have started the series back up, having completed I and am currently almost done with II, and am enjoying them very much. So I thought I would come back and write a review for the game that sucked me into this amazing series, and here we are!

(Unlockable only after beating the game once as Yunica or Hugo, Note: His story is the actual cannon to the series)\nYs origin uses the same Ys engine that began with Ys VI and later improved in \"Oath in Felghana\" and as its own game and prequel story it holds quite well. Areas are broken to floors as you are climbing up the tower but variety exists as each floor as its own theme (Water, Sand, Fire ect) and its not just going up stairs upwards as they spice of the areas giving you places to explore for goodies and what not. However despite the variety in areas unlike other games in the series Origin is very linear in where you can and can't go to with only a very small bits of Exploring later down the line. There's also not that many Intresting characters to meet as most of them are either from the search party or the Villains of the game limiting the feel of a living world like previous games.\nDespite those small down parts Ys origin is still fun and challenging game like all other Ys games in the series.\nOne small problem that kind of annoyed me is the Checkpoint systume. unlike the two eariler Ys games using this engine (Ys 6 and Oath in Felghana) if you die in an area/room you will restart from the start of that room and you can go back to a previous area if you are low on HP however Ys origin doesn't do that and instend your only means of checkpoints our the Goddess Statues that let you save the game/buy upgrades.\nWhich means if you died a along ways through an area without getting to the next Statue its all the way back to the previous one, And while you can Teleport back to one at any point to save any progress you made (I.E points or Key story items) you still have to go all the way back to the last point you got to which on later Difficulties can get on your nerves sometimes.\nBut if you've played any Ys game before and tried to beat it on Nightmare mode you should be pretty used to the pain and suffering by now. :P", "timestamp_created": 1483382261, "timestamp_updated": 1489154596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28936584": {"recommendationid": "28936584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183874634", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506266042}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u4e0d\u7ba1  \u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u5fc3\u76ee\u4e2d\u6700\u68d2\u7684\u4f0a\u82cf   \u867d\u7136\u4e5f\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\u8fbe\u5a1c\u548c\u7f07\u5a1c   \u4f46\u662f\u81ea\u4ece7\u4ee5\u540e\u4f3c\u4e4e\u54ea\u91cc\u4e0d\u5bf9", "timestamp_created": 1483355739, "timestamp_updated": 1483355739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629630", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28903955": {"recommendationid": "28903955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126776501", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483618392}, "language": "english", "review": "too much story but quite fun", "timestamp_created": 1483280579, "timestamp_updated": 1483280579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28900430": {"recommendationid": "28900430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037159968", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483689397}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubc0c\ub354\ub77c \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4\n\uc720\ub2c8\uce74\ud560\ub54c\ub294 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc774\uac8c \ubb50\uc57c \ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5b4\uac70\uc9c0\ub85c \ud588\ub294\ub370 \uc720\uace0 \ud1a0\ub974\ud560\ub54c\ub294 \ub208\ubb3c\uc0b4\uc9dd \ucc14\ub054\ud588\ub2e4\n\ub178\ub9d0\ub85c \ud588\ub294\ub370 \uc804\uccb4 \ud50c\ud0d0\uc774 23\uc2dc\uac04\uc815\ub3c4 \ub418\ub2c8\uae4c  \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0a8\uc73c\uba74 \ud574\ubcf4\uc148", "timestamp_created": 1483273043, "timestamp_updated": 1483273043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28899943": {"recommendationid": "28899943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003118919", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483388097}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game.\nBest Story Line\nBest Soundtracks and the theme.\n", "timestamp_created": 1483271936, "timestamp_updated": 1483271936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28856839": {"recommendationid": "28856839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085930820", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483162455}, "language": "english", "review": "Started with 15 minutes of unskippable, extremely boring cutscenes.

Origin is a highly entertaining ARPG that let's you slice, smash, and burn your ways through demons floor after floor. The first Ys game as far as the lore background of the series is concerned, Ys Origin takes place several hundred years before the events of the first game and portrays several issues that have only been mentioned by name or entirely left in the dark in the previous Ys games.\n\nIn the game's main mode, you can choose one of two (later three) heroes to reach the top of a mysterious demonic tower in pursuit of two goddesses. Though the game mechanics and the tower itself are identical for all characters, each plays a bit differently - Yunica is a fairly tough melee fighter with useful area of attack special abilities, while Hugo is a range-centric mage with a strong standard attack and largely defensive skills. The third, unlockable character finally is goes full rogue, being capable of dishing out lots of damage in close combat yet also sharing Hugo's fragile nature.\n\nUnless you plan to start in nightmare mode right away, the difficulty of the game generally is reasonable. Trash mobs typically do not pose much of a challenge unless you are seriously underleveled (and this problem can be solved with a bit of grinding), but the boss fights more than often will take you multiple tries to find the right strategy. Fortunately, this rarely becomes frustrating, not to the least because the game's fantastic soundtrack is one hell of a motivating factor.\n\nStory-wise, the game is okay-ish. Though Ys Origins does answer lots of questions propped open by the earlier games, two of the three playable character follow the old \"THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP(tm)\" plotline, with daddy issues galore. Ys Origins certainly has its moments, the plot will become fairly predictable if you've ever played a JRPG before\n\n\n\nDespite of its minor flaws, Ys Origin still is a more than decent ARPG and one of the better parts in the Ys series.", "timestamp_created": 1482974937, "timestamp_updated": 1482974937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28735520": {"recommendationid": "28735520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323253117", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489055975}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u4e70\u5149\u76d8\u73a9\u7684\u3002\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u65e0\u826f\u76d7\u7248\u5382\u5546\u505a\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u9996\u9875\u4e0a\u770b\u5230\uff0c\u60f3\u90fd\u6ca1\u60f3\u5c31\u4e70\u4e0b\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u3001\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u68d2\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u5165\u624b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1482891689, "timestamp_updated": 1482891689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28722671": {"recommendationid": "28722671", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983384690", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508121630}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so big,\nso hard,\nso fast,\nso awesome,\nand yet it looks very straight.\n\nVery recommended.\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1482865063, "timestamp_updated": 1482865063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28689503": {"recommendationid": "28689503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044043915", "num_games_owned": 539, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483193743}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5ed\uc2dc \uc774\uc2a4\ub2e4 \ud314\ucf64\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ubbff\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4\n\uc774\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc640 \ucbd4\ubc14\uc774 \ucd94\uc5b5\ud314\uc774\uc77c\uc9c0\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub294 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \uac15\ucd94\ud55c\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1482791612, "timestamp_updated": 1482791612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28677879": {"recommendationid": "28677879", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990149968", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482769009}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played it now for a few hours and i'm guessing i'll play it some more!

W\u00fcrde. Die K\u00e4mpfe sind so schnell und actionreich wie von der Serie gewohnt und die epischen Bossk\u00e4mpfe \u00fcberzeugen m\u00fchelos. Dar\u00fcber hinaus bietet dieser Spin-off sogar einige Verbesserungen gegen\u00fcber der Hauptserie. So gibt es hier drei spielbare Hauptcharaktere, welche allesamt ihre eigene Pers\u00f6nlichkeit mitbringen und sich sogar vern\u00fcnftig artikulieren k\u00f6nnen. Da kann Adol noch was von denen lernen.^^ Allerdings sollte man sich bewusst machen, dass man es hier mit einem Dungeon Crawler zu tun hat. Wer gerne eine etwas offenere Welt erforscht und nebenbei ausgiebige Schw\u00e4tzchen mit Dorfbewohnern f\u00fchrt, der k\u00f6nnte von Origin schwer entt\u00e4uscht werden. Und auch das Prequel-Format mit jeder Menge Fanservice f\u00fcr Kenner der ersten beiden Teile, ist eine etwas zwiesp\u00e4ltige Angelegenheit. Nichtsdestotrotz ist Ys Origin eine runde Sache f\u00fcr Serienfreunde und Action-RPG-Liebhaber. F\u00fcr den Preis von 15,99 \u20ac (Steam-Preis) bekommt man ein sch\u00f6nes Spiel f\u00fcr seine Download-Spiele-Bibliothek. Allerdings sollte man sich f\u00fcr das Geld erst einmal ein paar andere Ys-Spiele g\u00f6nnen, bevor man sich Origin zulegt.\n\n\nPro und Kontra:\n\nPro:\n- schnelles, unkompliziertes Hack'n'Slay-Spielprinzip\n- anspruchsvolle und toll inszenierte Bossk\u00e4mpfe\n- hoher Wiederspielwert durch drei spielbare Charaktere und zus\u00e4tzlichen Spielmodi\n- nette Story mit viel Fanservice f\u00fcr Kenner der ersten beiden Teile\n- die neuen Hauptcharaktere verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber eine eigene Pers\u00f6nlichkeit und k\u00f6nnen sogar sprechen^^\n\nNeutral:\n- Ys Origin ist ein Dungeon-Crawler. Dinge wie die Erforschung einer Spielwelt, Dialoge mit NPCs und dergleichen sind also kaum enthalten\n- es ist ein Prequel und keine Fortf\u00fchrung von Adols Abenteuern\n\nKontra:\n- das gesamte Spiel findet in einem optisch recht unspektakul\u00e4ren Turm-Dungeon statt, was auf Dauer recht \u00f6de werden kann\n- viele R\u00e4tsel wurden nahezu 1 zu 1 aus dem ersten Teil \u00fcbernommen\n- der Soundtrack geh\u00f6rt nicht unbedingt zu den Besten der Serie", "timestamp_created": 1481063359, "timestamp_updated": 1495652351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28211457": {"recommendationid": "28211457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043306954", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481950013}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an Y's game with a wicked soundtrack, good graphics, tight controls and fairly interesting prequel story.

Even absolute neophytes will be able to clear the game on Very Easy, but every time you go up a level, you have to learn new attack patterns and new ways of dealing with them. The only drawback to the difficulty levels is on the Nightmare difficulty, which pulls the nasty trick of nerfing the XP and SP given by mobs, and turns the game into a long, dull grind.\n\nThe game opens with two playable characters, and there's a third to be unlocked later. There is also an \"extra\" version of each of the characters with slightly different abilities, an alternate outfit for Yunica, and an unlockable \"arena\" mode that pits you against waves of mobs, complete with online cheaterboards if you're curious who can tweak Cheat Engine the most effectively. That's quite a lot of content!\n\nPlot-wise, the game is set in the ancient history of Ys, long before the original [i]Ancient Ys Vanished.[/i] This means that [i]Origin[/i] is the only Ys game not to feature Adol Christin as the main character (he can be unlocked as a bonus character in the arena, but not in story mode).

Never heard of Ys before this. Overall I really enjoyed Ys Origin. I went slow at first and stopped playing it for a few months after just 2 or 3 hours. I thought that I would need a large slot of free time to play it, but then I discovered this isn't true. Ys Origin is a fast-paced RPG-- you can pick it up, save, and put it down fairly quickly. I thought that finding most of the secrets would also be tedious. But once you get into the groove of how the game works you can really blaze through it finding most things along the way. I thought the game had a great pace overall. The bosses were interesting. The basic enemies were fun. It feels great collecting the dropped powerups. I like the sound effects a lot. The music is somewhat repititious but it never bothered me. The whole game takes place in a tower but it never got old or felt too confined.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like much was the story. It was extremely basic. A few parts went on and on and I felt like it could have been summed up faster somehow. BUT I have not yet played the other Ys games, and to my knowledge their stories come after Ys Origin even though the other games were created before this one. Sooo it's quite possible that the reason why the story in Ys Origin was a little flat was because it was only trying to sync up properly with the later older games. But I really don't know!\n\nBarebones story aside, this was still a GREAT game. I love the graphics. Graphically the game's characters remind me of Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Calibur, one of my all time favorites. Roy looks similar to Magnus. On the other hand, I wasn't so fond of the anime artwork. The main characters ( the three that you can be and also your main enemies ) all looked fine, it's mostly just the artwork of the lesser characters that bothered me. They seem to look corny or really lacking any standout detail head to toe. That could just be me being nitpicky though, because as soon as I finished one playthrough with Yunica I was ready to give it an entire other playthrough as a different character. I can see myself coming back to Ys Origin several times. A very addicting RPG.

Great game though. As a fan of the games since the first Ys, which I played on the Sega Master System way back in the day, I can say they did a great job with the Tower and enemies/items/weapons/etc...The only thing I would have liked is an actual Origins story. You start at the Tower, which is the whole game, and Ys already exists in the sky, and the goddesses already exist, and the pearl, demons, etc...How did that all happen? When did the goddesses come into existence? Who are the six priests and why were they chosen? When did they write the books? When does Adol, the savior swordsmen, come into the prophetic existence? What was the land like before the catastrophe happened? Who the hell is Dalles and where did he come from? What's the deal with the Fact bloodline? What's up with the Roda trees and why are they sentient? Why are they called Roda trees? There are literally so many questions this game doesn't answer and it's supposed to be an Origin game. It's a fun JARPG, but don't go into this as a fan hoping to see the beginning of the world of Ys. It's just like the other games only further in the past, but not quite the beginning.

In a nutshell your reflex and speed will be put into test. Ys Origin also considered to be the best of series. This is also only game where \"Red Hair Swordman\" isn't main character, but instead has more than one main characters with different point of view on one grand story flow. A Story in this game is a pre sequel to all those other Ys games and can be played at any order you feel like. \n\nGameplay is all about beating enemies solo and at the same time avoiding their attacks, you'll have to be quick and ready to evade every possible enemy attacks and ready to strike back anytime before their defense are up again, you'll have to exploring dungeon for items and equipment, leveling up your characters to strengthen their power, and at last an unforgiveable hard boss fight. It plays similarly of those famous torture action RPG game like Dark Souls, Demon Soul or whatever you can name of and feel like a real hardcore gamer. Luckily for those who're not good at this kind of game, there're very easy and easy mode for easy story experience and get used to it at acceptable pace. \n\nYs series has their own charm, an impressive scenery, catchy soundtrack and several difficult monster and boss battle, good arts and characters design. A plot of story however is not something mind blow as a game's mostly made for just gameplay experience. For this game, you start with selecting character you want to play and then listening to some prologue storyline before they throw you into exploring tower duty where you go in and solo every floors, including beating monsters and immerse boss creature. As you explore, you will encounter more and more events as they reveal a secrets and purposes of the tower, characters's own trauma pasts and their desires. There're cute and silly moments but non of them are obtrusive. The level design is quite simple like a platform game, you jump, walk, run, destroy just to find part and continue, combine the use of each skills given as you process through tower to further strengthen your movement ability to reach an even more platforms and grab some hidden items, avoid traps or enemy ambush etc.\n\nDepend on your difficulty setting and your skill with a game, you may die a lot from just one boss battle trying to figure out the way to beat him by your own, there's FAQs about boss fight but even with those you will still have hard time fighting them first try. There's no healing in this game, if a boss can kill you in just 4 hits, then you can only take 4 hits of mistakes at most, no more. Boss's hell bullets, attack powers and patterns are also different depended on difficulty setting means that you can't completely refer Hard mode boss to Nightmare boss, they don't just increase their HP and stats, they also add even more harder to dodge movesets or special buff to those bosses, in short it's not some cheap spike in diffculty like other hardcore action game. Most bosses can also heal themselves overtime in which you have to interrupt them or all your hardwork mean nothing.\n\nYs is actually short game, 10 hours would be more than enough to complete each playthrough, however to actually complete main story of a game you need at least two playthrough and to complete all the achievements; it gonna drain a lot of your playtime. There's one big feature and only feature that can determine who's actually a skilled player, it's boss rush mode, in a nutshell you're put into series of boss battles from start to end without resting, this mode is also required for 100% complete achievement, it's a most fun and frustrating of all.\n\nSince this game is all about difficult, it's hard to recommend to everyone but it's one hell hard of a game that some people who seek only some frustrating can enjoy for a meantime. Of course some moment of this game story is actually touchy too so even people who enjoy reading text can have some fun. This game can be played with both keyboard and controller.

The bosses I played were very creative and possibly some of the best I've seen in a game of this genre. So why don't I recommend it? First off, unskippable, long, unnecessary intro. Supposedly you can skip it if you've beaten the game - still not acceptable. The next major beef is the bizarre leveling system. One character level can mean the difference between unbeatable boss and wow, that boss was easy peasy. Finally, the boss and area that made me pretty much quit early was the Construct. Cool boss design, but I'd like to damage him successfully. The fight is pretty much you play for like 2-3 minutes to be able to take off a tenth of his health bar. It's an easy fight, but the patterns are so predictable that it just feels like a massive waste of time. The next area, I don't know what happened. Maybe I shouldn't have been able to beat that boss, but the standard enemies just became massive damage sponges. Went from dealing like 40-60 damage per hit to 2-7. Just completely unfun.

The idea of some janky JRPG with 3rd person action combat has always sounded weird and, from what little I've experienced, didn't work out too well. I come from the Final Fantasy line of games and use that as the barometer for whether or not a JRPG will be good, and look for those elements, and was less than optimistic going into Ys Origin, and on through the opening credits, but once the gameplay started, I was hooked. \n\nThe controls are tight, everything is useful throughout the game, and it takes skill more than anything to make progress. A certain amount of grinding is necessary for your average gamer (read: everybody that isn't doing a speed playthrough and min/maxing like crazy), and knowledge of enemy attack patterns is crucial, but knowing character limitations and being able to execute around enemy patterns trumps everything. On top of that, the game is damn hard; I played through on normal and got lambasted. I can't remember a boss that I beat on the first try, and there were two difficulties above that, meaning that whenever I give nightmare a shot is going to live up to its name.\n\nAs for the story, it's not on par with what I associate with an RPG, but it also doesn't feel like it's trying to tell a large, dynamic story, but instead just introduce a handful of characters and set the background for the other Ys games (it is Origin so I'll have to confirm any of this by playing the other games). From Yunica's perspective, it's a classic coming of age \"I can't do anything and basically become a God by the end\" kind of story.\n\nThe in game art style reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics with more stuff going on, while the character portraits and cut scenes are appealing without being obtrusive. The music is also on point, keeping with Japanese gaming tradition.\n\nOverall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this game. It was a small investment during a steam sale, and now I want to go back and try out the rest of the Ys franchise. I recommend Ys Origin with a 8.5/10; it doesn't try to do too much in terms of story or gameplay, and opened up a whole new franchise to me.", "timestamp_created": 1476315921, "timestamp_updated": 1476315921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25996963": {"recommendationid": "25996963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273380328", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503887448}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f9d\u7a00\u8bb0\u5f97\u90a3\u5e74\u9ad8\u4e09\u9003\u8bfe\u4e0a\u97f3\u50cf\u5e97\u8f6c\u60a0\uff0c \u770b\u5230\u4e00\u76d8\u300a\u4f0a\u82cfF\u300b\uff0c5\u5757\u4e70\u4e0b\u6765\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u5bb6\u6253\u4e86\u4e00\u6574\u5929\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u8fdb\u5165\u4f0a\u82cf\u7684\u5927\u5751\u3002\nYSF\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u5c31\u9707\u60ca\u4e86\u6211\uff0c\u6301\u6709\u53cc\u7ffc\u7684\u5c11\u5e74\uff0c\u98de\u9a70\u5728\u5192\u9669\u7684\u65c5\u9014\uff0c \u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u8981\u7684ARPG!!\n\u8bf4\u56deYSO\u3002YSO\u662fSTEAM\u4e0a\u4e70\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8YS\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u90e8\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u4f0a\u82cf\u4e00\u8d2f\u7684\u7d20\u8d28\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u8d85\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u624b\u611f\u4e00\u6d41\uff0cBOSS\u6218\u60ca\u9669\u523a\u6fc0\u3002\n\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u6279\u8bc4\u4e0bYS7\uff0cYS\u6811\u6d77\uff0cYS8\u5f15\u64ce\u6362\u4ee3\u540eBOSS\u6218\u6ca1\u6709\u90a3\u4e48\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u4e86\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u662f\u4f0a\u82cf\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u8fd8\u6709\u90a3\u7f8e\u5999\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u4f1a\u4e00\u90e8\u4e00\u90e8\u4e70\u4e0b\u53bb\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1476276751, "timestamp_updated": 1476276751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25991743": {"recommendationid": "25991743", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972142968", "num_games_owned": 1438, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 2665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476760612}, "language": "english", "review": "The Ys series is one of the longest running franchises around.

Ys Origin is a 3D Action RPG game, a fast paced one at that, developed by Nihon Falcom.\n\nIn Ys Origin, you could play as either Yunica, a girl that wield a heavy battleaxe, or Hugo, the prodigy of magic. (There's a 3rd playable character, which is unlockable after you complete the game with either Hugo or Yunica)\n\nSo, now to the review as always !\n\nPros (+)\n- Story, it's pretty decent i would say ! Each characters have their own stories (and playstyle), which is awesome. There's a lot of reason to do another run in this game. I personally love Hugo's storyline.\n- Playtime, There's 3 playable characters, it takes about 10 hours more or less to complete the game, also, there's some extra after finishing the game, so, no need to worry.\n- Soundtrack, it depends on each own preferences, but i gotta say, you'll most likely, loves the soundtrack. It really fits the game and adds a lot to the immersiveness.\n- Controls, the controls feels really responsive.\n- Challenging, the difficulty feels right. The boss fight is totally fair, there's no unfair attack that leads to sudden death all out of nowhere. It's required to learn the behaviour or pattern of the enemies here. There's also difficulty option.\n- Progression ! Level, Move based artifacts, blessings, you will find a new playstyle along the stories.\n- Artstyle, again, it depends on preferences, but personally, i find it to be unique and ended up loving it a lot.\n\nCons (-)\n- This game could be, a bit... grindy. If you're not good at this kind of games. At least, that happens to me, ahaha.\n- The enviroment feels a bit monotonous, well, we're inside a tower so.... yeah.\n\nConclusion :\nSo to sum it up, this game has, a good story, awesome soundtrack, great amount of playtime, good enemies & boss design, and the progression also feels nice. \nPretty much, it has, everything you need to make a good RPG games !\n\nSo if you love a fast-paced, 3D action games, i totally recommend it for you.", "timestamp_created": 1472136985, "timestamp_updated": 1472136985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505550", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25105440": {"recommendationid": "25105440", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977008047", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472010645}, "language": "english", "review": "Klunky interface, lazy game design and subpar play.

Origin lets you play through the turmoil that seeds the eventual corruption of Ys. You watch how characters are drawn by fate to play certain roles and see the motifs of the later games form. You get three playable characters with their own stories that justify multiple playthroughs, and they greatly expand on the lore surrounding the Fact line. A strong theme throughout the narrative is whether characters are doomed by fate and their lineage, with an underlying theme of elitism and gender discrimination that get resolved by the end of the story.

Actually getting to gameplay took almost 11 minutes of unskippable-cutscenes and dialouge (with me jamming through skippable dialouge). One of my biggest criteria for a game is how long it takes me to be able to PLAY the game. This can be mitigated by interesting presentation. Ys Origin does not have interesting presentation.\n\n7 minutes til you can start pressing a button. 7 minutes to get past \"So there was a paradise named Ys. Then demons showed up. Twin goddesses lifted their city into the sky. Demons made a tower to get at them. Then the goddesses left. You're a member of the team to track them down in the tower.\" Then you spend 4 more minutes scrolling through \"Where am I? I better go to the tower\". Finally, after ANOTHER cutscene showcasing the Barad-Dur rip-off, you get to the tower and start fighting the monsters. But this is broken up by lots of clumsy tutorializing. Skip ahead a few more minutes and you get actual control. So if you want to start a new game, expect close to 20 minutes before you get to play the game. Great. Excellent pacing.

I have to say this game is really good, if you played modern Ys games such as Ys Oath from Felghana or  Ys Ark of Napistim and enjoyed them, this game plays very similar to them and you would like this game too.\n\n     At first I was a little disappointed in the setting that the entire game would take place in Darm Tower from Ys1 and there would be no towns to visit, but the way the inventory/items/power ups are handled is smart in \"divine belssings\" at Goddess statues which replaces the need for buying things in towns, the search team dialogue adds in the backstory to replace the townspeople, and Darm Tower is from 700 years before Ys1 so the designers could take liberties on how it was presented in Ys1 and make it their own for this game.  So after playing it for a bit these design choices were actually brilliant and I didn't miss exploring an overworld or the fluff of towns.\n\n    Also having two playable characters from the start makes the game worth a replay with different play styles. Also unlocking one of the villians as a 3rd playable character makes it almost a new game? Ys Origins is perhaps my favorite modern Ys game made in the 2000's so far.

Because you will be pressing that attack button a lot. In all seriousness though Hugo is pretty fun to play as. His weapons a bit more defensive and require you to play strategicly. His story is pretty good and has some amazing moments. Better than Yunica in terms of story in my opinion.\n-Toal Fact: And here is my man. The secret character who is also the main character. You unlock him for beating the game as Hugo. First off in terms of story Toal is easily the best one. Because while the other characters have good stories with great moments, Toal is ONE BIG moment himself. I also love the fact how they made you unlock him , this is good because they first introuduce everything to you with other characters and then give you the final story. In terms of gameplay he pretty technical compared to the other characters. In fact if you know what you are doing you wont have to grind as him once and you will still make mince meat out of the bosses. \n\nThe music: Comon its falcom we are talking about here of course the music is godly. Just listen to the trailer song and you will know what I am talking about. Its not my fav sountrack (that honor goes to the trails in the sky games also made by falcom) but its definitly my fav Y's sountrack. \n\nThe graphics: In terms of models well this is an old game but you know what I think it looks nice on the eye. It has aged nicely in my opinion. \n\nGoing through the tower: Well the trailer already spoiled it so yeah the entire game takes place in a tower. Don't worry it has areas inside it. Like lava, water, desert, demonic etc... You also have these statues that serve as save spots, shops , and teleportation spots. You can pretty much teleport to any statue in the game once you activate them. So backtracking is NEVER a problem.\n\nOverall its a fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1467473821, "timestamp_updated": 1467473821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555802", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24016846": {"recommendationid": "24016846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992709020", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463197666}, "language": "english", "review": "Scratches a Link to the Past itch like nothing else has.

Monsters are essentially pi\u00f1atas that when killed will explode into an array of multi-colored pieces of equipment. After spending so much time on games such as these, my mind dulls to the point where I stop caring about saving the world, or performing some heroic and death-defying feat. All I really want to do is look at numbers rise. I need an intervention. I need to refocus. I need Ys Origin.\n\nAll you really need to know about the Ys Series is that everyone fights with an un-matched level of ferocity. Imagine a thousand buzz-saws being shot out of a thousand cannons, and everything they shred also gets set on fire. When the series was still very young, the early games required the player to kill monsters by running at them and striking either of their sides. In a way the later games such as Ys Origin are an extension of this basic design. In the interest of balance, the improved controls and maneuverability means players have to contend with more intense battles. A plethora of difficulty settings assist the player in finding a level of challenge that suits them. The hardest settings deliver an experience akin to a 2D shooter, where the entire screen is flooded with death. \n\nAs you\u2019d expect from the title, Ys Origin establishes the roots of the series. Fans will quickly note all of the references to the first entry, which include characters, events, and even boss-battles. In fact, the entirety of the game takes place in Darm Tower, which is essentially where most of Ys 1 also took place. Still, aside from the boss-battles none of this is particularly exciting. This game was originally released in late 2006, and even with the update to Steam, an option to skip cut-scenes was never developed. The dialogue is fairly good, but the story is very traditional and there are certain events that have to be sat through. The time spent outside of combat, tends to be really dull.\n\nThere are three playable characters in this game and each of them has a different fighting style, a few unique bosses to contend with, and their own path in the story. Yunica Tovah is the token cute-girl-with-a-big-axe. Her companions and adversaries are quick to point out her lack of magic ability, but I can\u2019t tell the difference, when she\u2019s summoning firebirds that lay everything to waste. Hugo Fact on the other hand is all about the spells, though his style of play can best be described by the classic arcade shooter [i]Mercs[/i]. Expect to run & gun your way through the tower if you play as this wizard. Big brother Toal Fact is unlocked after beating the game with either of the other two characters. His fighting style resembles Wolverine. Basically you go pork or bacon on enemies and claw your way to success. Each adventure should take around six or seven hours to complete, although this can be slightly effected by the difficulty setting.\n\nDarm Tower is a lot like Dracula\u2019s Castle in that the forces of evil can shape it to fit their whims. I\u2019m absolutely certain that when I scoured this tower in the first game I did not have to deal with swimming through flooded corridors, jumping over spike-traps, and dealing with that always-necessary lava level. Each level has a theme and by the second or third you\u2019ll figure out everything you need in order to progress. This adventure is almost entirely linear; however you\u2019re free to backtrack in case you missed anything. Unfortunately even though you get some cool powers like the ability to double-jump there really aren\u2019t any instances where you can go back to prior areas to find items you couldn\u2019t get to earlier. This is the same case for all three playable characters, so once you learn the layout, all you have to focus on is the methods for dealing with the demons. \n\nThe combat is by far the greatest aspect of the Ys series, and the same can be said for this entry. All fights move quickly and multiple types of foes all attacking at once is a regular occurrence. To keep things fair the demons have a \u201ctell\u201d when they\u2019re about to attack (they blink white for half a second). Also, while all demons are capable of hitting very hard, as long as you\u2019re exploiting weaknesses they go down just quickly. If you\u2019re not doing enough damage, usually a level-up will balance things out, and a second or third might even make you slightly overpowered. Still, don\u2019t expect to grind through bosses as experience points drop to about one per kill, which will force you to move on. The boss-battles in this game are especially great, probably among the best in the series. At first I was worried that every boss was going to be a weak-point mashing affair, but each encounter is varied and just awesome. Some demons like The Creeper are not only relentless but can also induce serious headaches by healing themselves in mid-battle. Unlike a few of the other Ys entries there also aren\u2019t any herbs, potions, or elixirs that can be purchased to bail you out. But hey, all this difficulty adds to that feeling of accomplishment. \n\nReplay value in Ys Origin is certainly high. After completing the game with all three characters you\u2019re given access to the time-attack, arena mode, and bonus shop. The time-attack is a boss-rush where you can face off against any or all of the major demons for the possibility of a spot on the leaderboards.  Arena mode has you dealing with waves upon waves of monsters, if you survive you can use the points you earn to buy prizes from the bonus shop. You can always head back to the tower and attempt the harder difficulties as well. There are plenty of achievements and getting them all practically requires that you master the game. \n\nReally there\u2019s not a whole lot that can be said about Ys Origin. There\u2019s no hidden meaning to be found and this is not some life-reaffirming experience that I could write thirty pages on. This is simply an excellent action-RPG that despite being more than a few years old it still contends with among the best the genre has to offer. On the other hand if your experience with the genre has never gotten beyond breaking open monsters and collecting all the armors, swords, and belts they were stowing in their nether regions, then steer clear. This game keeps it focused and judges the player entirely on their ability to evade and strike, luck isn\u2019t a factor in the slightest.", "timestamp_created": 1464264356, "timestamp_updated": 1511214534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23208577": {"recommendationid": "23208577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249687760", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478390359}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u7684\u6e38\u6232\uff0c\u7ae5\u5e74\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b3e\u901a\u95dc\u591a\u6b21\u7684\u6e38\u6232\uff0c\u4f0a\u8607\u8cfd\u9ad8\uff01Falcom\u8cfd\u9ad8\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1464212191, "timestamp_updated": 1464212191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23129532": {"recommendationid": "23129532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190495241", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514780510}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ys Origins es otro gran juego de parte de Nihon Falcom con una buena jugabilidad, m\u00fasica, jefes e historia adem\u00e1s de replay value gracias a sus 3 personajes jugables y reto una de las grandes joyas que puedes encontrar en steam.", "timestamp_created": 1463887717, "timestamp_updated": 1463887717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23112951": {"recommendationid": "23112951", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996799433", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479560028}, "language": "english", "review": "happy 10th birthday ys origin\n\nyour cutscenes are still long af and I wish you were oath in felghana but you alright", "timestamp_created": 1463822411, "timestamp_updated": 1463822411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23048525": {"recommendationid": "23048525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021794395", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1339398000}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuckin awesome.

It is deceptively simple in its mechanisms, but it adds layers of different components and tricks as time goes on.  The gameplay is intense, but strategic. The music is equally intense. The game rewards you the faster you cut down foes by rewarding additional XP per hit, but that counter will decrease as time goes on; this encourages you to keep progressing. The boss-fights are intriguing, and are (deservingly) much more difficult than the enemies around them. This requires a more tactical approach than just mashing buttons; you may end up dead before you can blink if you don't pace yourself.  The platforming elements require timing and focus.\n\nYour mileage may vary on a few of these next details, but I think that they are good to note. The game doesn't force you through several of the immersion-breaking and random overworld fetch-quests that can detract from other JRPGs, but at the cost of no overword (that I have seen) to explore. I see it as a pro for this particular game as the world around the tower is a wasteland rather than a varied environment to explore. Due to the facts that the game only appears to take place in a tower, that it is an action game based on a relatively simple to use combat system, and that the game is fast-paced, I suspect that some playing this would tire quickly. Play on Nightmare difficulties for getting the most out of the game: truly exhilarating boss-fights.\n\nAll in all, an excellent game that I recommend highly.", "timestamp_created": 1462937475, "timestamp_updated": 1462937475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22905113": {"recommendationid": "22905113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000822199", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489952899}, "language": "english", "review": "buy it", "timestamp_created": 1462933468, "timestamp_updated": 1462933468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22839221": {"recommendationid": "22839221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045285245", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386667547}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute anime girl beats up monsters and does flips n shit, I like it.

You start on the first floor as one of three characters (only two initially unlocked) and fight your way up, to deal with the baddie at the top. Along the way you can appreciate some awesome...\n\n[1] Boss fights. The Ys series is known for its boss fights and these are no exception. They're tough, without ever feeling cheap.\n\n[2] Pacing. The game typically involves 2 or 3 floors of regular enemies (who can be quite challenging!) between each boss fight. You'll usually need to explore these thoroughly in order to find the key to the boss and any equipment upgrades. Yet these intermediate sections don't overstay their welcome. And it's entirely possible to run through them if needed.\n\n[3] Polish. The camera works. The controls work. The game provides proper feedback. Everything feels smooth and responsive, which makes the game a joy to play purely at the tactile level.\n\n[4] The music. Ys music is awesome.\n\nOn these strengths, I give the game a thumbs up. If you like old-school ARPGs, this one is sharp and sleek. It'll provide about 10-15 hours of gameplay for the first playthrough. If you really like it, it's then got two other characters as well as boss attack / timed modes (though, big surprise!, the leaderboard is dominated by cheaters).\n\nDo keep in mind, however, that this game doesn't offer as varied an experience as other RPGs. Gear progression is strictly linear. Though each boss and its levels have different environmental themes (sand, lava, etc), there's ultimately not much variety in setting. You certainly aren't doing any globe-trotting. The story is serviceable, rather than inspired. So know what you're getting into.\n\nDIFFICULTY RECOMMENDATION: Ys games can be tough, but provide a variety of difficulties to compensate. This one has very easy, easy, medium, hard, and nightmare. I, personally, wouldn't recommend ANYONE play below medium. If you don't want a challenge, then play a different game. As a veteran gamer, I chose to start on hard. A good choice. Challenging, but never insurmountable. I had to look up only one boss fight - mostly because I misunderstood a mechanic. When I did the boss attack mode on medium after, I beat most fights on my first try. I wouldn't recommend Nightmare for your first playthrough. It'll be tough to learn the fights while simultaneously worrying about timing, aim, and movement.", "timestamp_created": 1462380389, "timestamp_updated": 1481267027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22734362": {"recommendationid": "22734362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980169432", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480065887}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best JRPG I have ever played without a doubt.\n\n*Amazing soundtrack\n*Great combat\n*Interesting story\n*Mind blowing boss fights\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1462067818, "timestamp_updated": 1480065764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22719111": {"recommendationid": "22719111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046279407", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452937649}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10 Great art style and fluid gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1462007825, "timestamp_updated": 1462007825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22709869": {"recommendationid": "22709869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048350678", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1354348800}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game its fun and country to what some say is repetitive a very intresting and creative experience", "timestamp_created": 1461957698, "timestamp_updated": 1461957698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22655116": {"recommendationid": "22655116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083351443", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508997618}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is extremely underrated.

This is one solid little franchise.  There are so many things that Falcom does right in caring for this classic property, and I have high hopes for future Ys games I will be playing.  \n\nThis is yet another perfect little charming gem of an action RPG.  It mixes 2D sprite animation and seamless 3D architecture to create a style both retro and timeless.  The care and attention payed to the characters, story, music, and ys heritage is truly admirable.\n\nDesign wise, this game is a typical dungeon crawl, but the challenge is quite thrilling during boss fights.  The exploration aspect can get a bit tedious if you play through the game multiple times in quick succession, but I imagine this can be offset by tweaking difficulty levels to your liking. \n\nOn that note, the story of Ys Origin plays out with a Roshamon style redundancy; with three individual character's story-lines.  Much of the joy of this game comes from experiencing the events of the narrative from these different perspectives.  Granted, there are slight differences in each Character's narrative, with only one (Claw's) considered 'cannon', but walking through the game in each of their shoes lets you become much more familiar with the characters and the world in which they live.  I can't imagine having only played through this game with a single character, and I found each separate run interesting and challenging due to the different play mechanics.  \n\nIt's a faithful loveletter to the Lore Falcom has developed for Ys over the last several decades.  The characters, the settings, and even the music is heavily inspired by past games in the franchise.  Now at the time of this writing, I had managed to play the steam releases of Ys 1&2, as well as Oath in Felghana (remake of ys 3).  These games stand perfectly fine on their own story wise, and it is absolutely unnecessary for anyone to have any prior knowledge of the franchise to get your money's worth.  That being said, each entry also helps to paint a beautifully detailed picture of a larger whole.  Falcom seem quite devoted to the world they've created, and the relationship between games is actually quite nuanced.  \n\nI'm so very glad I played through this, and I encourage everyone to take it for a spin.  If you're only interested in a charming hack 'n slash romp, by all means coast through it.  If you're at all interested in the story of Ys, I very much encourage you to experience each story line.  On the lower difficulties, each play through should take about 8 hours.

Mon avis \u00e0 propos de ce jeu est donc en fonction de ces deux choix. \n\nCe que j'ai moins appr\u00e9ci\u00e9\n\nPremi\u00e8rement, \u00e0 propos de la dur\u00e9e du jeu, elle n'est pas tr\u00e8s longue. En ce qui me concerne, j'ai d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9 tous les bonus du personnage et j'ai tu\u00e9 tous les ennemis autant de fois que n\u00e9cessaire pour avoir toutes leurs caract\u00e9ristiques dans le livre des monstres et en bout de ligne, le jeu m'a pris moins d'une quinzaine d'heures. Si j'avais fait ce jeu sans cette mont\u00e9e en niveau excessive, il m'aurait pris probablement le tiers de ce temps, voire moins. \n\nIl est bien entendu possible de s\u00e9lectionner une autre difficult\u00e9 au jeu, qui permet \u00e0 ce que la mont\u00e9e en niveau soit plus lente, mais pourquoi choisir cette option? Si je voulais du d\u00e9fi, je pourrais prendre la difficult\u00e9 la plus facile et battre le moins de montres possibles pour monter le moins possible en niveauT Pourquoi vouloir consciemment ralonger la partie la plus chiante du jeu, soit la mont\u00e9e en niveau, \u00e0 moins de vouloir des troph\u00e9es Steam?\n\nConcernant les troph\u00e9es Steam justement, je trouve que le jeu n'est pas tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reux. Pour en obtenir pour certains boss, il faut passer le jeu avec deux ou trois personnages, ce qui signifie refaire totalement le jeu deux ou trois fois. J'ai suffisament aim\u00e9 le jeu pour envisager le refaire un jour avec un autre personnage, mais apr\u00e8s cette longue et p\u00e9nible exp\u00e9rience de mont\u00e9e en niveau, ce ne sera pas imm\u00e9diatement. J'ai d'autres jeux \u00e0 faire! \n\nJ'aurais aim\u00e9 un mode nouvelle partie + o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de monter plus vite en niveau avec le personnage suivant et o\u00f9 les bonus seraient tous d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s, afin d'\u00e9viter de faire de nouveau, un deuxi\u00e8me et une troisi\u00e8me fois, la partie p\u00e9nible du jeu. \u00c7a aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et \u00e7a n'aurait rien enlev\u00e9 au jeu que d'offrir cette possibilit\u00e9, sans pour autant la rendre obligatoire. \n\nCe que j'ai davantage appr\u00e9ci\u00e9\n\nCe que j'ai le plus aim\u00e9 dans ce jeu, c'est le gameplay en tant que tel, si on exclue la mont\u00e9e en niveau. Toute l'action se passe dans une seule tour, mais pourtant, on n'a pas l'impression d'\u00eatre toujours au m\u00eame endroit. La maniabilit\u00e9 du personnage se fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tr\u00e8s bien. Il est possible de donner plusieurs coups d'encha\u00eenement afin d'avoir des bonus de poins d'exp\u00e9riences, ce qui donne une certaine fluidit\u00e9, je dirais m\u00eame un certain rythme, aux combats qu'il y a sur le chemin du personnage. \n\nLes techniques qui utilisent les points de magie sont peu nombreuses (il y en a trois), mais cette simplicit\u00e9 donne un charme au jeu. On n'a pas \u00e0 se casser la t\u00eate avec des dizaines d'attaques comme dans les autres jeux o\u00f9 de toutes fa\u00e7ons on finit toujours par utiliser les deux ou trois plus fortes (ou plus mont\u00e9es en niveau). L\u00e0, on a un choix limit\u00e9 de techniques, mais elles ont toutes une force \u00e9quivalente, tout \u00e9tant relatif \u00e0 la situation et sur les ennemis sur lesquels elles sont utilis\u00e9es. \n\nLa musique, comme toujours, est excellente.

You must study the bosses power and trick to beat them takes time and patient to beat all bosses. Special mention the boss fight music is insanely badass. Downloaded ys origin OST ! download it too if you want . :)\nStory/Art/Graphics- Well written amazing art nostalga graphics. Not just that the story slighty change when you play a different a character. \nOverall Gameplay Experience- Amazing one of the best JRPGs that I've ever played the best Ys game ever. I love dungeon crawling I love the dungeon challenges and mostly I love the search party crew. If you don't like challenges,trial and error and nostalgic feeling then stay out of this game.\n\n\n11/10 One of the best games I've played.\nPrice is just about right but recommeded buying it on sale or not :) \n\nStill hoping all ys game will be on steam. :3\n\nSorry for my english and grammar I'm an asian please spare me :D", "timestamp_created": 1456490743, "timestamp_updated": 1456547757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21408595": {"recommendationid": "21408595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037917342", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501446421}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, hardly any problems to speak of. Would recommend to basically anyone who can still appreciate older style games and who isn't turned off by cheesy japanese storytelling. This game is also very friendly to people with high end PCs, supporting resolutions beyond 1080p and refresh rates beyond 60Hz. The game actually renders very well at higher resolutions, though the character sprites and portraits become somewhat pixelated.\n\nYs Origin is essentially a 3D action platformer in the style of Alundra for PS1, and to some extent the 2D Zelda games. I would compare it to a sped-up Link to the Past. Emphasis is primarily on combat, but also on finding your way through the game. Each area has a few branching sub-areas which you must navigate to find a key to the boss room. This usually involves going through the area until you reack a fork in the road where reaching one end of the fork will activate some switch that will allow you to grab the boss key from the other end of the fork. \n\nCombat is very fast and consists of attacking, using special abilities, jumping, and some other moves. You have 3 special abilities that you can use in combat that offer you some mix of damage, utility, and range. The abilities are different for each of the 3 playable characters but serve the same general purpose. Part of the game is figuring out which ability is most effective for the area you are exploring or the enemy you are fighting.\n\nThe best part about this game is without a doubt the bosses. Every fight throws something completely unexpected, yet refreshingly original at you. Very rarely will you ever go up to a boss and simply whack it until it dies. Almost every boss has a weakness that must be revealed in some way before you get the chance to actually deal damage. And each boss has attacks that you need to dodge in creative ways instead of just running in a circle. \n\nI will give the example of what was probably my favorite boss in the game. The boss is basically a centipede where each pair of legs was its own section of body. The way to kill the boss is to destroy each body segment. The challenge lies in the fact that each time you destroy a body segment, it will start spewing poison bombs that explode if left on the ground too long. This severely inhibits your mobility and also throws a lot of extra damage into the mix. Keep in mind the boss is constantly moving, so you not only need to dodge everything, but also catch up to it so you can actually deal damage. By the end of the fight the field is entirely covered in poison bombs and you have to find a way to weave through them, jump on the boss, and kill the last segment before you die. This boss killed me probably 20 times, but it was still a great experience because each time you can make tiny optimizations or notice something new about an attack that will let you avoid it more easily. \n\nThough this game actually involves very little actual platforming, the game utilizes 3D space very well. You are constantly moving up and down through the environment which is a nice change from the typical top-down games where everything is just a flat plane. 3D space is even utilized in combat, with airborne enemies that must be taken down with jumping attacks, to boss attacks that can only be dodged by jumping. From my boss example above, the same boss is able to climb on walls, going completely out of your reach. While doing this he will shoot lightning at you, which you must avoid to keep from falling behind. However, you have a special ability that when charged up has a huge vertical range. If you want, you can hit the boss with this move while he is on the wall. This introduces a risk into the fight by letting you hit the boss while he is high up, but you need to come to a stop to use the attack, opening up the possibility of getting hit by the lightning. Many combat moments in the game involes this same sort of risk/reward that weighs more damage against a higher probability of getting hit, which leads me into my next point...\n\nThis game has no consumable healing items and no way to heal yourself during combat. This is especially relevant during boss fights. You only have one health bar, and you have to kill the boss before he kills you. This makes for very tense fights, knowing that each mistake is permanent, each risk you take is a real risk and can't be immediately undone by healing yourself. These fights are reminiscent of many boss fights in JRPGs where you desperately hope that you can kill the boss before your healers run out of MP. You can't cheese out any boss by spamming healing items each time you take a lot of damage. This game forces you to learn the patterns and exploit the weaknesses of every single boss. The same is true during regular combat, but normal enemies drop health pickups and there is also an accessory in the game that allows you to heal which standing still. Even so, the game sometimes throws extra tough enemies your way, and you are forced to kill the lot of them in one go which can be just as challenging, especially if none of them drop a health pickup. \n\n\nNow for some minor complaints:\n\nThe game starts throwing really annoying enemies at you late in the game. While I appreciate challening combat where you don't just mash a button until everything dies, these enemies also flat out waste your time either by being extremely resistant to damage or having small, spread out periods of vulnerability.\n\nThe plot of the game is pretty bottom of the barrel. It's the exact same good vs evil, friendship is power, find your true strength generic japanese crap that we've all heard a million times before. The game isn't quite as cheery as something like Dragon Quest, but you can pretty much predict the exact plot of the game if you've played any other game that follows the same story structure. \n\n\nHere is some stuff that may be good or bad, depending on your tastes:\n\nWhile there are no healing items in the game, you can always just grind levels and become near-invulnerable if you are having trouble with a boss. I would really recomend not doing this, as every boss in the game is beatable in a reasonable amount of tries without this, but it's still possible. Sometimes grinding a bit can really help out, as being underleveled during a boss fight is extremely punishing as you can sometimes be dealing damage in the single digits and taking huge chunks of damage for small mistakes. \n\nThe game takes place in a tower and only in a tower. This means no towns, you never encounter any new NPCs to talk to, the only \"shop\" is at save points, and the only way to go is up. This does bring about a few perks as well though. If you like streamlined games with no fluff, this is perfect for you. The tower structure also lends itself to being a game with almost zero backtracking through previous levels. The only times you do this are for quick story progression segments. \n\nOverall, this game is great and worth playing at least once, if not multiple times with each playable character. It is very reminiscent of older games that were made by a small team of dedicated devs, and you can tell the game was made with love. If you are already a Ys fan, expect something above and beyond. If not, maybe save this one for last becuase I truly think it is the cream of the crop as far as the PC titles go.", "timestamp_created": 1456246225, "timestamp_updated": 1479921548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21381166": {"recommendationid": "21381166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025151422", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513900291}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys series in general are not very long and their challenge level is fair with minimal grinding required.

I wasn't sold on the demo, but I got this one on sale. So happy I decided to do that. The demo does not do it justice, not by any means.\n\nPros\n\n- The gameplay is the best part of this game. Fast paced and challenging in a good way. You're not going to find yourself losing because of cheap tricks, it's almost always something you didn't do correctly. The boss fights are intense and unforgiving. You have to learn how to beat a boss, you won't be able to mash buttons and luck your way through it. They demand skill, and will likely take multiple tries on a reasonable difficulty level before you figure out how to counter everything a boss can throw at you.\n-The stories are also an amazing aspect of the game. Each character is unique and will draw you into their individual approaches toward the main plot.\n- The graphics are simple and beautiful, and perfect for this type of game. I love that they didn't try to make this into a movie, like the idea seems to be for far too many games today. If you want a game that's going to blow you away with the gameplay and not make you feel like you're spending 5 minutes playing and then 15 minutes watching a pretty animated movie, this is the game for you.\n\nCons\n\n- The only con I have, and it may just be my situation, is that my mouse does not like this game at all. It seems to lag horribly, and this makes particular parts of the game a real mess. It can be very frustrating when you lose a battle not because you did anything wrong, but because you were trying to move one direction, but because of latency issues, you move another. Also, I've found that the skills (controlled by my mouse wheel) seem to switch even when I'm sure I haven't touched the mouse wheel at all. The game can be played with a keyboard, but that presents it's own challenges. This game really seems like it's perfectly suited for a controller.\n\nOverall I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one. The difficulty levels are scaled perfectly, and there's one for every type of gamer. It's one that you'll probably keep playing just to complete everything about it that you possibly can, because it's that addicting.", "timestamp_created": 1456011570, "timestamp_updated": 1456012589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21315957": {"recommendationid": "21315957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012274457", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455882885}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys Origin is one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nIt has the perfect balance between story, music and gameplay.  The combat is simple to learn but hard to master if you want to tackle higher difficulties or venture into Arena or Time Attack mode.  You'll probably want to use a controller.  The story in this game is simply one of the most perfectly paced and emotionally driven games I've had the pleasure of playing.  This game completely blows every other Ys game out of the water (Take that, Adol!).  If you're a Ys fan, or any sort of JRPG fan, or even an anime fan, this game was made for you.\n\nWith every track of music that is perfectly tuned for each area to match the locale, to the incredibly deep characters that have their own personal motivations and feelings, this game will blow your socks off and keep you guessing about some of the characters until the very end.  This is what game design should be about.  Graphics don't matter, they don't have to cost millions of dollars, they just need a little bit of love.\n\nPraise the Goddesses.", "timestamp_created": 1455883647, "timestamp_updated": 1455884157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.931035", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21307823": {"recommendationid": "21307823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156387449", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474563993}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e07\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e0b\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e0b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19", "timestamp_created": 1455840455, "timestamp_updated": 1455840455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500260", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21243912": {"recommendationid": "21243912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052784928", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457255718}, "language": "english", "review": "This is definitely a Classic style Action JRPG.

The gameplay is satisfying with its RPG elements, action based combat and simple platforming, the soundtrack is absolutely great and fitting for the gameplay, the main characters are surprisingly interesting and the bosses offer plenty of challenge, really requiring you to learn their patterns and time your attacks correctly especially on higher difficulties. Even the story has its moments despite never being invasive, and the graphics are pleasant enough in all their simplicity. My only slight gripe with the game comes from its few heavily compressed animated cutscenes which could've looked smoother.\n\nThe game will initially take you about 8-12 hours to finish, but it has three different characters with different storylines and slightly different events, and I strongly suggest that you take the time to finish the game with every character if you want to get the most out of it and its story. As such, the replay value is strong especially if you're going for achievements which the game is almost designed for with its multiple difficulties, unlockables and the boss rush mode where you fight all the bosses of the game in a marathon setting. If going for full completion though, the replay value eventually depletes and the process turns into more of a grind towards the end of it.\n\nThe combat consists of slashing and blasting through numbers of enemies with a combination of regular and special attacks while jumping around platforms and structures, avoiding enemy hits and collecting the currency and temporary power ups that they drop, all while the speedy and melodic soundtrack is playing at the background. Most of the depth and challenge comes from the tried and true mechanic of dodging and timing, which is very apparent in the several boss fights the game will throw at you. On harder difficulties you'll have to retry several times to get the patterns down properly, and while you can overlevel yourself by one or two levels with some extra grind to make many bosses noticeably more doable, in boss rush you have no such luxury. On the other hand if you just want to sit back and chill, the game has easier difficulties as well.\n\nOverall, YS Origin is a simple but solid ARPG that I can recommend to anyone.",

Felghana, el gameplay, como era de esperarse, cumple con lo esperado y engancha desde el primer momento.\n\nEntre otras virtudes que tiene este juego es que posiblemente sea el Ys con la mejor trama de todos (No es como si eso fuese muy dificil por eso, solo Ys I & II tienen una buena trama pero la presentacion en esos juegos palidece en comparacion a Origins) y, como de costumbre, la banda sonora es soberbia.\n\nYs Origin tambien es el Ys con mas rejugabilidad, 3 personajes, 5 niveles de dificultad, posibilidad de desbloquear versiones alternativas de los personajes y el tipico time attack, disponible con todos los personajes y sus versiones Ex, ademas de eso, ofrece un coliseo que tambien dispone de distintos niveles de dificultad y desde el que se puede desbloquear a nuestro pelirrojo favorito, Adol Christin, para usarlo tanto en el coliseo como en el Time Attack.\n\nSi habeis jugado a cualquier Ys y os ha gustado, no lo dudeis, Ys Origin es la obra maestra de Falcom.",

"english", "review": "[i]Ys Origin[/i] is built on what is possibly the best ARPG engine out there, featuring fast and tense combat with responsive controls that requires a little strategic thinking.  On top of that, the graphics manage to be impressively beautiful while retaining excellent system performance.  The plot's pretty good, too - about as straightforward as you'd expect in a game like this, but I think the character development carries it, and the fact that there are three slightly different versions of it (one of which is unlocked by clearing the game once, has you initially fighting [i]against[/i] the other protagonists, and includes additional plot revelations) improves replayability.\n\nI do feel, though, like Falcom made a mistake with the difficulty levels and achievements - many mistakes, actually.  For starters, SP (points for buying ability upgrades) gain rates are tied to difficulty level, and some upgrades are so exorbitantly expensive that getting the related achievements is only feasible by playing through and farming on the lowest difficulty level, which is so easy as to be boring.  That's not the really crazy part, though.  The crazy part is the extra outfit for one of the characters - let me say that again: it's just an alternate sprite, and an achievement to go with it - that requires beating the game at least 6 times, including 3 on nightmare difficulty, plus spending a lot of time in Arena Mode.  Even if you just want to fight the unlockable optional boss, which I kinda do, you'll still have to do the 3 Nightmare runs and the grinding in Arena Mode.  Now, I do have to give Falcom credit for making the higher difficulty levels challenging in ways that are a little more creative than damage dealt/taken adjustments.  I already mentioned the SP gain rates (I think EXP is also affected to a lesser degree), and your special abilities have longer cooldowns, but the most noticeable difference is in the enemy AI: on higher difficulty levels, enemies will attack more frequently and aggressively, with bosses in particular saturating their lairs with hazards to your health, making the game not just more difficult, but also more exciting.  Unfortunately, though, your chances of surviving still come down to experience level.  A single level gain makes the difference between a boss fight you have absolutely no hope of winning and a boss fight you can probably clear with your character just barely still breathing if you practice a few times.  Upgrades, of course, help too.  And, remember, farming is slower on higher difficulties.  What this means is that a Nightmare playthrough is basically a long, tedious grindfest punctuated by occasional intense boss battles.  It doesn't help that all the dialogue, which ordinarily I'd appreciate, is all unskippable, and there's sometimes a lot of it immediately before a boss.  I had been planning on getting as close to 100% completion as I reasonably could (Caress of Steel?  Ha, ha, NO.), but having beating the game once with each of the three characters, including one Nightmare run, and cleared all but the last arena stage multiple times, it's gotten too repetitive, and I'm kinda sick of it now.

It's worth every bit of money I spent on it. But it's not perfect. There are some flaws with the game that prevents the game from being great.\n\n1) The story\n-If you've already played Ys back in the golden age of the Super Famicom, you'll probably appreciate the story in this prequel. But if you never played them, chances are you'll be disappointed with the story. It's very cliche and predictable. Even worse is the story for each characters. Long story short, each of them aren't parallel with each other.\n\n2) The difficulty\n-Hard games are good and welcomed but the difficulty in Ys Origin is borderline cheap and unfair. Basically, the higher difficulty means enemies have more health, takes less damage and deals more damage to you. It pretty much boils down to grinding enough levels by killing the same enemies over and over again, just to inflict damage more than 1 to the enemy. That, and finding power-up item to strengthen your weapon because if not, the later stages becomes nearly impossible. Unless you're a masochist or have a lot of free time, just play it on normal or easy.\n\n3) The gameplay\n-It's fun enough for a few hours, especially after getting all abilities but it get pretty old as you play.

The regular enemies are mostly an easy grind, but the boss battles are a different story. If there is another thing the Ys series has a reputation for, it's [u][b]grueling boss battles[/b][/u] that often require multiple attempts and still manage to decimate your HP even if you emerge the victor.\n\nThe one major downside to Ys Origin is that----unlike previous Ys games that involved exploring an overworld, traveling to different towns, and exploring different dungeons---Ys Origin is just one non-stop slash-fest through a single extremely long dungeon. While the dungeon wallpaper does change somewhat as you make progress, the entire dungeon pretty much feels exactly the same, which can leave you feeling bored of the scenery hours before reaching the final boss.\n\nThe game also has multiple characters with which to complete the campaign as well as an unlockable arena mode. If you are the kind of person who likes that kind of extra content and you like the action of the game enough that you feel like making one more go through the dungeon all over again with a second character, then you will be pleased to have the option. As for me, I personally got too bored of being trapped inside the one neverending dungeon for 14 hours, so the idea of doing it all over again just to play with a different skill set for fourteen MORE hours does not sufficiently entice me. Since the game is somewhat of a grindfest (especially near the end), I just don't find the replay value to be nearly that high. Still, it is a great bonus for those who want an extra challenge or just haven't eaten their fill of the hacking and slashing yet.\n\nI feel like I only have one major gripe with the game, which is that the designer chose to arbitrarily disable your ability to pause the game or access the main menu during boss fights or cut scenes (which--to make matters worse--are unskippable). When I raised this concern to other players, some came to its defense explaining that it is an intentional design decision to keep you from swapping equipment in battles. However, I don't think that is a very good excuse. One very well could have disabled access to the inventory/equipment screen only. But making it impossible to pause the game or open the main menu means that, for example, if you decide that you want to QUIT the game during a boss battle, then your only option is to Alt+F4 or kill it via task manager. Both of those are easy enough to do, sure, and yet I can't help but feel like this is an obtuse and unwieldy measure taken for a small design nitpick. The fact that you can't skip cut scenes or even open the main menu during cut scenes seems even less excusable, since there can be no game design argument for it.\n\nSmall gripes aside, if you are at all a JRPG fan/enthusiast and want to slash up some monsters in an action RPG, I'd recommend giving it a whirl.\n\nAs for the other question: is it worth twenty whole dollars? I personally feel like $20 is slightly steep for this one. $15 feels like a good maximum price to me. $10 or below is a bargain. Therefore, using the rating scale below, I rate the game at around a 4.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n[b]4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.[/b]\n3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.", "timestamp_created": 1448601754, "timestamp_updated": 1448602798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19280859": {"recommendationid": "19280859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098153128", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448787825}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u8bc4\u662f\u5f53\u7136\u7684\uff0c\u8c01\u8ba9\u6211\u662f\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7\u7684\u8111\u6b8b\u7c89\u5462\u256e(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3\")\u256d \u8fd8\u6709\u5440\uff0c\u5feb\u53bb\u628a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5927\u5751\u586b\u4e0a\u554a\u5582\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u4e00\u76f4\u6316\u65b0\u5751\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1448521420, "timestamp_updated": 1448521420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19272846": {"recommendationid": "19272846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087051225", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445798622}, "language": "italian", "review": "Nihon Falcon, sinonimo di qualit\u00e0 e divertimento, basta questo...", "timestamp_created": 1448485785, "timestamp_updated": 1448485785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19257813": {"recommendationid": "19257813", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987266552", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461817279}, "language": "english", "review": "YS, always been a fan of YS ever since maybe 80s or 90s?

Nothing out of ordinary here, but not bad either.\n\nCONTROLS: 5/5\nIt has fantastic controls. I just finished my first playthrough and started my second one (with another character) using an xbox controller and it plays just awesome. Responsive action, simple, yet rewarding controls. Maybe that's the best part of the whole game, it sounds kind of silly, but it just feels good to control the characters as you go. In a simple sentence: the game just feels amazing on your thumbs as you play.\n\nGRAPHICS: 4/5\nPretty cool graphics that remind me of PS1's RPG games: anime-like portraits, Ragnarok like sprites, pretty good, overall. The in game effects (such as explosions and fire) are just okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good and nicely rendered.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 5/5\nA simple, intuitive item/level system, with very few choices to make. Reminds me a little of how DMC deals with this kind of thing: you get stronger as the enemies get stronger (no choices in stats), and your weapons compose a little, but handful, arsenal, which you'll have to switch around to get through various enemies/situations. I usually like this kind of system, since it gets me more focused on the gameplay, not on the mechanics, but I do feel they could have done with a little more variety, ability wise. Still, solid system, which absolutely doesn't get frustrating as you go (i.e. no grinding absolutely required, at least on normal dificulty playthroughs).\n\nSOUND FX and MUSIC: 3/5\nMusic is pretty cool too, although a bit repetitive. Sound effects are what you'd expect from this kind of game, adds to the good feeling you get from hacking at an enemy (could have used the rumble feature on a controller, though).\n\nOVERALL:  4/5\nOverall, I give this game a solid 4 out of 5 score. It's not a Steam MUST PLAY, but you definitely won't regret going through a couple of playthroughs.

That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.)\n\n     [*]Note 2: I will be comparing this to Oath in Felghana's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion. \n[/list][/h1]\n\n     This is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint [b] not [/b] a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order. \n\n     For those of you that don't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were \"tweaked\" or \"improved,\" rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series. \n\n     Now, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it). \n\n     In Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine. \n\n     The second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't [i] need [/i] it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out. \n\n     Regarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life. \n\n     On the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly \"harder\"). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin. \n\n     Boss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one. \n\n     This, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks. \n\n     To compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment. \n\n     Upgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.", "timestamp_created": 1440038912, "timestamp_updated": 1454248784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17619076": {"recommendationid": "17619076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136545980", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 4202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509364621}, "language": "english", "review": "best damn game ever \\(\u309c\u2200 \u309c)/", "timestamp_created": 1440012252, "timestamp_updated": 1479925551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17585318": {"recommendationid": "17585318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240478896", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457506720}, "language": "english", "review": "I've got to say i'm totally fallen in love with this game.

YS forsakes the turn-based combat of most JRPGS for an arcade-action style of button mashing mayhem.  The combat system isn\u2019t very deep, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun in the way that something like Golden Axe or Gauntlet was in the 80s, and magical effects are really beautiful.  However, what really impressed my about YS Origin is the quality of the PC port; its got graphics options galore, has been properly adjusted for PC monitors, supports keyboard and gamepads (go with a gamepad, trust me), and it runs at a constant smooth framerate.

It's damn fun smacking the crap out of enemies.\n\nDespite taking place in one location, a single 25 floor tower, the game has enough variety in its areas to keep it constantly fresh and entertaining, with new mechanics to work with and environments to traverse. It has a nice difficulty curve, with bosses that continually test your wit. If you're looking for a nice challenge, pick this game up and play it on hard. \n\nAnd its soundtrack is damn good. Seriously, go to Youtube right now and type \"Ys Origin - Genesis Beyond The Beginning\", and tell me it doesn't make you want to play this game.

Kinematics are made with illustrations in a manga style, allowing to tell the general story of why we are there and why it is like that. As usual in every good Japanese RPG, we have a cool bad guy, with long and brilliant hair, which wants to control the world of Ys for a random reason, and which has some underlings in order to stand in your way.\n\nThe game takes place completely in a tower, we climb gradually its levels, by exploring every floor, collecting what we find as equipment and killing everything we can, jumping from time to time on platforms to move forward. At the end of every level, we have a boss to explode. There are 6 levels, each one has around 3 floors, and every level has its universe (fire, water, sand\u2026). Yes because there are completely aquatic floors. In a tower. And above, there is a lava world. And also a forest. Yes. In a tower. A TOWER. :D\n\nAs a consequence, we adapt our fighting techniques to every level. For example thunder is very effective on the aquatic monsters, whereas fire will be effective against plants. Hello, Pokemon players!\n\nThere are several difficulties, it goes from Very Easy to Nightmare. YS Origin will take about ten hours to finish with a first character.\n\nAbout characters, we have the choice between a knight girl and a magician boy. The first is a specialist of hand to hand fights, with special techniques in short and medium-range, the other one is a specialist of remote fight. Besides the difference of gameplay, every character has its own nature and background. This will influence a bit the global scenario, but the final goal won\u2019t change: prevent the bad guy with nice hair from destroying the world. In other words. So big potential of replaying, in spite of the repetitive aspect of the game, especially because a third character is unlocked in the end of the game, as well as the bonus games like Time Attack mode or Arena, to kill a lot of monsters in a limited time.\n\nConclusion: a good RPG as Japaneses know how to make it, with a manga universe both in graphics and musics. The gameplay brings nothing innovative but is very pleasant.

Its pretty cool and the soundtrack that goes with it helps a lot.\n\nOnto music which we touched on before, at the start you would think that its a little cookie cutter but after a while you understand that the music goes with the various themes and the emotions of the game. For this reason they seem to compliment eachother very well and it sort of amplifies the emotions that you feel throughout the game. \n\nStoryline of this game isnt the most complex one ever id say, that being said ive only done a singe playthrough and its designed for you to play the three charecters because they each have different viewpoints in the story, they each lead to the same point but you will have to face various challenges to get to your end goal. At some points you will question what your protagonist is thinking or what their motivations are. Its well thoughtout id say but the introduction into the game was a little poor. As i understand this is the first in the series so i imagine it is meant to lay down a good foundation to the rest of the series so think of it as a prologue, a very long prologue. Its about 10-12 hours to finish the story for a single person, i imagine its the same or faster with the others.\n\nDifficulty, this is the meat of the game because holy hell is it hard. Just go into the discussions and you will witness the poor souls that have come close to throwing all sorts of hardware out the window, at the wall or at a sibling due to how hard this can get especially the bosses. The normal difficulty of this game is hard, the easy difficulty of this game is challenging, hell even in very easy you will struggle at times. Its not for the faint of heart but that is a good thing because its pretty rare to get a fleshed out game with those sorts of scenarios anymore. It also leads to the 400+ types of monsters that you will occur, some are strong, some are weak, some resist fire, some arent. You will encounter all sorts of rabble but they all want to kill you. \n\nIn the end this is a game that i can recommend to anyone, if you dont want to break anything then play on very easy and then work your way up, it certainly is addictive and you get one hell of a euphoria after you beat what seemed like an unbeatable boss at first(looking at you mantid)", "timestamp_created": 1436361398, "timestamp_updated": 1436361398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766760", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16890996": {"recommendationid": "16890996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107337551", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459175084}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f0a\u82cf\u8d77\u6e90\u6beb\u65e0\u7591\u95ee\u5236\u4f5c\u7cbe\u826f\uff0c\u7cbe\u7f8e\u7684\u753b\u9762\u3001\u52a8\u542c\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u4f18\u79c0\u7684BOSS\u6218\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u5708\u53ef\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6258\u5c14\u7bc7\uff0cCG\u56fe\u7247\u7b80\u76f4\u7f8e\u3002\u672c\u4f5c\u7edd\u5bf9\u662fYS\u4f17\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u6d41\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1436088400, "timestamp_updated": 1436088400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16886829": {"recommendationid": "16886829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008646087", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437848168}, "language": "english", "review": "Good combat and a fair story are the strong points of this game.\nExtremely linear progression and the fact that you are confined to a tower for pretty much all of the play are it's cons.\n\nYou play as three characters (a playthrough for each, one being unlockable after finishing with one of the other two) through the story mode to unravel their story as they ascend the demon tower, battling monsters and large bosses along the way. The story itself is fair, with some expected plot twists (and some not so expected) but doesn't have that much in the funny side. Everyone seems more into serious business mode. So if you want something with laughs this isn't really the game.\n\nCombat is real time, meaning that for the most part your skill at dodging attacks will determine your success, mostly in the harder difficulties. You don't get healing items nor healing magic either but some enemies drop use-on-pickup items. Some heal, some boost a stat for a time, and there's also currency drops you use to buy upgrades. A gripe I have is that the items and currency are dropped pretty much everywhere when killing monsters and because they disappear over time, you sometimes have to choose between clearing the room or pausing to run around to grab the spread items. Each character has basic attacks, including jump and jump attacks, and obtain magic items through the game that allow them to use special abilities used mainly for battle but are sometimes needed to get past certain parts of the game. There's no puzzles here either so most of the time you are either in combat or reading the story.\n\nSpeaking of sounds, there's no voice acting here and the music is pretty much midi based. In fact all sounds remind me of the final 16 bit (SuperNES) to early 32 bit (PS1) era games so don't expect a John Williams score here.\n\nVisuals are the same. Characters and common enemies are all sprite based(they do have beautiful portraits), while the stage and bosses use very low polygon models, akin to PSP games. Sprites are drawn in the chibi style while portraits use the usual serious anime way. The one complain I have about the visuals is that the whole game takes place in a tower where all rooms are similar in terms of textures and such, only changing their color every few stages. Sure, no room is the same and there's plenty of enemies to get you busy, but I myself like variety of backdrops and open spaces. Then again hard to do when the premise of the game is to explore a big round demon tower.\n\nOverall it's a good game I can recommend to throw yourself back with a simple yet effective gameplay, simple visuals that while similar, don't completely bore in my opinion, and a good story to boot.", "timestamp_created": 1436060116, "timestamp_updated": 1436060116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16768771": {"recommendationid": "16768771", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967686701", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487013710}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

He shoots pretty fast and you will get upgrades along the way that will increase your projectiles for a duration. He's a mage so the typical low health, crazy magic damage applies to him . His shooting range is enough to be able to shoot enemies from afar.\n*The Claw plays as a hack and slasher. He's a good balance of health and strength and he has a nifty transformation that's fun.

painfully awkward(ly translated?) writing, cringeworthy story, setting and characters that it shoves in your face in lengthy, unskippable conversations and cutscenes.\n\nYou should still totally play it, because once all that stuff takes a break this game is an addictively fun simple brawler with a limited but very satisfying moveset, basic but enjoyable rpg systems and very challenging (depending on your level and difficulty), varied and interesting boss fights - all supported with a catchy soundtrack.\n\nDon't expect Dark Souls though: if any encounter is too rough - likely because you're underleveled - it usually can be trivialized by grinding a room full of enemies for 15-30 minutes to get a handful of levels over the boss. There's also easier difficulties to pick if you don't feel like \"powerleveling\".\n\nThe regular playthrough is a very decent length already, and the game is designed for multiple playthroughs with different characters with different abilities and boss encounters, so if you enjoy the gameplay the game certainly delivers tons of it.", "timestamp_created": 1434602185, "timestamp_updated": 1434602429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527931", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16483722": {"recommendationid": "16483722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089188576", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434605461}, "language": "english", "review": "Well Holy Shit!\nI bought this game one boring winter break with money from the holidays thinking \"Aw, what the hell? It's cheap and has pretty good reviews.\" Turns out this game was much more fun (And difficult) Than i would have ever thought. The plot is fairly simple and easy to follow, but it's still there. I loved the music (especially the song that play's after the encounter in the mirror room.) and it changed on every floor of the tower, cycling through all sorts of various tunes and styles. The controls felt smooth (At least when playing as Yunica, I don't know about hugo) and it was especially nice to move around with dash/ double jump. But i think the best part of Ys:Origin is the boss fights. Most enemies will fight, and while their no pushovers, they go down pretty easy. But the boss's, damn are they angry. The one I remember giving me the most trouble was the end boss of the Guilty Fire segment. so many hours went in to beating that guy. but all of the boss's give trouble, keeping you in the heat of the action every time you think you've figured them out.\nThis is the first game I've played in the YS series, and i had no trouble figuring out who went where and what was when, I Highly reccomend this game to people who enjoy quick, smooth combat and challenging bossfights with a wide varity of music!", "timestamp_created": 1434580247, "timestamp_updated": 1434580247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16479468": {"recommendationid": "16479468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042729216", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435111553}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.  3 story characters to play as. (You need to unlock one). While they all tranverse the same levels they have a few differences in bosses but mostly story wise. They also each play differently. One weilds an axe, one is a mage, and the unlockable is a berserker.\n\nSpoiler:\n[spoiler] Toal, the unlockable chraracter, is the character with the canon storyline and true final boss. \t[/spoiler]\n\nThat said I felt the game had a great story and very worth its price, and with each character getting their own storyline it gives you a reason to play them all. Difficultly ranges from Very Easy to Nightmare. Upgradable skills/traits. You have to find your gear upgrades there is no shop to buy them from. Fear not since the gear upgrades are either in chest or given to you. No RNG luck based element to make you spend your days grinding instead of playing.\n\nBosses have gimmicks but they also for the most part seem to follow a pattern. Though the gimmicks each boss have can be enough to prevent you from winning on your first encounter with them, and 2nd, maybe 3rd. This isn't a bad thing. It requires you to actually learn how the boss works if you want to beat them instead of just brute forcing it.\n\nThat said I would just like to point out a couple of cons.\n\n1. Keyboard controls for the most part are fluent but on a certain boss they are a bit chunky.\n\n2. The same above applies to trying to fight flying enemies. I would suggest a gamepad if you have one.\n\nThat said I am a keyboard player and still find it around 95% fluent.

Lets start with the things I really liked. The gameplay was wonderful, honestly I would change a thing about it. Yunica moves where you want, attacks where you want, slaughters thousands of enemies in an effort to grind levels, the way you want... and umm hmm I'll talk about that pretty soon. The visual style was really good to look at with a SNES era feel to it. Although, same of the 3D environments looked a little choppy and jagged it was enough to take away from the game. I liked the good use of colour throughout the games many different environments. What I found really neat that despite the fact you spend the entire game inside a tower the developers still put floors dedicated to elements such as desert, water and lava. My favourite part of the game was hands down the combat which was a pleasure to utilize. The boss fights were always overwhelming and in general were very unique. They provided a great deal of challenge to the player and some would not be defeated easily. Just my basic two cents on what I feel was done right.\n\nOn the other hand there are some areas for improvement that I feel should be touched on. I'm not providing any plot spoilers but I do think the story was all anything to special. If you look at the whole picture then maybe the story is more meaningful, but the events leading up to the end just felt a little bit empty to me. I'm not saying it's bad but it just wasn't what I was expecting. Another thing that I found rather bland was the characters. They weren't very likeable and for that matter many of them just felt forced into the game. A lot of them were unlikeable and literaly added nothing to the game or the story. The villians of the game didn't really have a reason as to why they wanted fuck shit up. A character later in the game dies and the plot sets it up to be very emotional but I think that character had maybe like a dozen lines of dialogue before hand. Anyway, enough about the story elements lets get to the elephant in the room. That's right a JRPG's best friend, grinding. Oh, Jesus Christ, the grinding. Let me just say that I played though this game on normal and I probably spent a very sizable amount of my time proforming mass genoside on these creatures. Why is it that even though I kill all of the enimies in the area, when I get to the boss he rips my asshole in half? Seriously, like I slaughtered every enemy on the way to the fight and the boss don't give a fuck. So, what do you do? You go back and grind until you level up again. Alright, round 2 you piece of shit boss mother fucker. Nope. You lost again. Game over. Welp, I guess I grind some more levels. This time the boss is fucked, right? Nope. Fuck you. And when you finally beat the fucker you cele-fucking-brate because you know that all that grinding is past you. You are like overleveled now so, time to go to the next area. The first new enemy you find in the next area does more god damn damage then the fucking boss you just beat. At this point you are just like whyyyyy? Why Falcom why? And they are all like fuck you thats why! So then after crying for half an hour you go back to the last area and grind so you can fight the enemies in the next are and not die. see a pattern here. I've seen more grinding in this game than a the club for fuck sakes. The worst instance was charging the Evil Ring. After trying to figure out how that criptic bullshit worked, I finally figured out I had to kill those sand goat things an area back. So I start attacking the bastards and only do 1 fucking damage to the little cunt. I start attacking the other monsters in the room and do like 55 to them. So what the fuck am I doing wrong? Since the trend has been grind grind grind so far I was like fine I'll just level up, it won't be so bad. I shit you not, after leveling up 3 fucking times, I still did 1 god damn, mother fucking, fuck, fuck, fucking damage. After stabbing a pencil into my crotch and not playing the game for 4 months I learned that one of the wankers at the bottom floor upgrades your weapon for you. Now Falcom/Xseed if you can can excuse my language for a second. Ahem... HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW THAT!?!?! How the fuck is anyone supposed to know that 4 eyes down there has mastered such witchcraft! You don't because when he spoke he was too busy saying useless rubish that no one gives a sween little fuck about! On top of that way back closer to the beginning of the game 4 eyes is hiding from you in an empty room that you need the mask to lets you see through walls to find him. which is fine but the the game gave no fucking clues or fucking hints to wear this ugly mask in this cock sucking room. It's not like I would want to where the mask, as it makes me see in black and fucking white and also makes all the monsters invisible. Point being that, 4 eyes piece of shit wanker ass hat, over here is the scum of the Earth and there should have been a way to throw his troll ass of the side of the tower and its 25 floors of glory. \n\nGames really good. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1428049592, "timestamp_updated": 1428049942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15032102": {"recommendationid": "15032102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031976721", "num_games_owned": 1122, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 4118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514335596}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc0dd\uac01\uc5c6\uc774 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \ub531 \uc88b\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1427194401, "timestamp_updated": 1427194401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15017946": {"recommendationid": "15017946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054063956", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436116710}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow this is one amazing game.

It's the 8th game from the series. It's only available on Pc and it's a prequel of Ys I & II. (So it's better to play Ys I & II to understand a bit more.)\n\nSo first of all, I just want to add that I have around 120 hours on this game and I didn't finish entirely. (I'm finishing the third character at Nightmare Mode and I'm focusing to get every achievements. Not an easy thing to do.) \n\nPros:\n-The story is great. (You will get the point of view on each character.)\n-4 difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard and Nightmare)\n-Music is so great.\n-Fast paced game. \n-Button mashing game.\n-Anime game\n-Time attack/Survival mode\n\nCons:\n-Nightmare mode can be a pain in the ass. You really need to focus on farming a lot of level and to know every pattern of each bosses. You will restart a lot of them and yes, you will want to throw you controller at your screen a lot of times.\n-Only two characters (a third one can be unlocked. But if you only play only one time with Yunica or Hugo, you won't be able to unlocked it.)\n-The \"real\" story is with the third character. So people who don't love to play the same game over and over won't be able to taste it. (You need to complete the game with Yunica and Hugo, that's it.)\n-Maybe overpriced if you only play one time and at easy mode. (Approximately 4-5 hours if you know what to do.)\n\nNote 9/10 because this game has made me a fan of Ys.\n\nEdit : If you want more information about the order that you need to play the game, check this link : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552476829", "timestamp_created": 1425496782, "timestamp_updated": 1473804038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14732558": {"recommendationid": "14732558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025141228", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419834603}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, to put in perspective how good this game is, I was recommended this game by a friend and within the weekend I ended up beating it with all three characters.

The game primarily revolves around either Yunica Tovah or Hugo Fact, and yes, those family names should be familiar to those who've played the first two games. Each of them plays differently, with some mechanics making some fights a lot easier than others, some more difficult.\n\nThis game serves as the seventh canonical entry in the Ys series (Ys V is non-canon), and as a prequel to the entire series. It does a lot to explain a lot of the lore in the first two games, as well as why even in the main series, there is always a seemingly world ending threat around the corner.\n\nThe game has three characters, two of which are available from the start: Yunica Tovah and Hugo Fact. The third is unlockable after beating the game with either one and finishes the story with its true ending. Even if you don't beat it with him, there is still a lot that is canon from Yunica and Hugo's endings, just not the true mastermind, a very familiar enemy who was responsible for the events in Ys I & II.\n\nKilling normal enemies is rather easy, and if you are having trouble, go back to a previous zone and grind a couple of levels, then come back. You will easily know when you've grinded enough in a zone when the experience rewards vs. the amount needed to level becomes more grindy than the time needed is worth. Basically, if you need to level, you can gain   a level in about 10 - 15 minutes, sooner if you're on the low side for the zone.\n\nStill, the main focus is the bosses. Each has unique mechanics and weaknesses that you need to take into account. Don't be surprised if you die a few times figuring out the boss, and if your attention slips, or you make a wrong move, then you are in for a world of hurt. That's where the fun is.", "timestamp_created": 1423979455, "timestamp_updated": 1423979455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14470895": {"recommendationid": "14470895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114304968", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423947808}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game, good music, good gameplay!", "timestamp_created": 1423950259, "timestamp_updated": 1423950259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14455236": {"recommendationid": "14455236", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993780873", "num_games_owned": 1045, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423873269}, "language": "english", "review": "On the pluss side:\n+ This game had a smooth and nice gameplay and from time to time I really did enjoy it.\n\nOn the other hand the negative list is far to long for me to give it a thumbs up. The negative is:\n- The controlls when using a controller was incorrect since it displayed the keys for the keyboard\n- I thought no game could beat Half-life intro in boringness and length, I was wrong.\n- Because of the boring intro, I lost intrest in the story and all the story elements was just lost on me.\n- The grafics was kind of bad, both in the cutscenes and in the game. The fact that I am stuck with the resolution 800*600 makes matters even worse.\n\nSo if you play with a keyboard, like stories that takes ages to even let you play and like this retro style with mixed 2d and 3d modells, this might be the game for you.

Each character has their own dialogue and conflicts most notably the secret third character has a lot more bosses than the other two. \t\n\n[h1]Progression[/h1]\n\n+Statues offer instant traveling back and forth\n+Enemies are highlighted red to progress\n+Grinding is minimum (10-15 minutes if you're underleveled)\n\nTraveling from floor to floor can take some time, luckily you have goddess statues that teleport you instantly to other statues you have unlocked along your travels in the giant tower. This allows the player to be able to teleport to any floor he thinks requires more exploring weather its to grab a item he missed or simply to teleport back to floor 1 for upgrades. Not only that but you are fully healed when in range of the goddess statue, you can also save.\n\nThere is practically no grinding in this game if you do not skip mobs, even if you were somehow still underleveled its relatively quick to level to the proper tier for the boss. Grinding is not required in order to defeat bosses, it can be beneficial in order to survive more hits but dealing more damage only works on anything under the highest difficulty. Being on nightmare there is set amount of damage you are going to be able to do against any bosses. This is to keep the game challenging for the purpose of the difficulty mode so that players won\u2019t find a easy way to accomplish the feat.\n\nRed highlighted enemies are triggers to progress through the levels. For example killing a red highlighted knight can trigger a jumping platform so you can reach a certain area otherwise unavailable. \n\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\n\n+Nice variety of environments\n\nDespite the entire game taking place in a giant tower there is a surprising variety of environments and design with their own elements that seperate how you proceed through them. \n\nThere is platforming but it never really gets too complicated to the point where you're constantly backtracking because you cannot perform the required jumps, its especially gets easier once you get helpful power ups like double jump.\n\n[h1]Mechanics[/h1]\n\n+Multiple obstacles throughout the game solved with unique items\n-Cinematics can interrupt your movement (Very Rare)\n\nGoing through the game you will find yourself often unable to past an obstacle that requires you to have a special item in order to proceed to the next floor. For example the item that helps with magic resistance will be useful for resisting the pull of statues trying to drag you down into a trap that sets you back to another floor and further away from your goal. \n\nCinematics interrupt your movement if you happen to be above a trap for example in water when you trigger a cinematic you will fall into the spike trap and take damage when you're able to move again\n\n[h1]Game Modes[/h1]\n\n+Nice leaderboards (keeps track of alot of variables/characters)\n\nUpon beating the game you will unlock more content for example the first time I beat it with Mittens, I unlocked time attack which features a circuit of going through all the bosses you fought throughout the game with set equipment and having to race the leaderboards in order to pass your friends. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nYS origin feels like one of those old very challenging arcade games with rpg elements and some platforming. The features a nice variety of boss types, even more bosses can be discovered by playing the other characters which gives the game more replayability. The game lasts around 12 hours per playthrough and with 3 characters thats a good chunk of time not to mention you have extras to go through.", "timestamp_created": 1423195864, "timestamp_updated": 1423201832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14345320": {"recommendationid": "14345320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042046002", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498908913}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, this be my first review... Dunno how to format it but i'll try my best\n\nStory: The game has 2 normal endings but 1 true ending, giving 3 in total. While they of course vary, there are many things which stay the same in the story such as how each character progresses. At points this makes you believe you already know all the story and what's going on after one play through, but later on the story can completely take a twist for each character. Each story does start off pretty slow, especially if you go in without any prior knowledge to the Ys series, but once the plot thickens, it thickens good. It is pretty engaging and most the characters are quite understandable and likeable.\n\nGameplay: I suggest you play the demo itself. On higher difficulties it can be fast paced, manic, epic and overall very enjoyable. There are a few moments in the game mind you where it can be frustrating trying to defeat a boss or enemy, because some of them are just soo cruel on the insane difficulty!.. Each character have 3 abilites they unlock through the game, each of them have their special uses for puzzle solving but also for combat, the main problem I find is that you unlock these all of these three abilites around half way, leaving not much else to unlock except for one super move or a sort per character (Which is awesome but missable) and passive abilities.\n\nOne thing which did annoy me a lot though is how vague the game could be with it's in-game instructions. For example - if you play as Yunica the game will tell you about how you can use a descending jump attack, what it DOESN'T tell you until later, after soo many chances where it could have been useful, is that the attack is capable of stunning enemies, but since the attack does little damage alone you will probably spend a lot of time playing the game without knowing this gameplay element. Neither does the game explain thrusting or how the boost meter charges quicker when you have less health (Which is really essential to know for a certain task otherwise you could be waiting about for a good 30 minutes). Now, honest maybe it did explain some of these things in the game, but if it did, it obviously didn't make it's point since i'd completed the game twice without knowing some features...\n\nVisuals and Audio: Uh... Well this is a sorta old-ish game now, so the visuals aren't all that great for the 3D? models. Weirdly though I find the special effect in game to still look top notch, flashy and cool. The audio is fine really, I haven't much comments on it except that the OST is pretty epic and great, especially nearer to the end of the game.\n\nOverall: Since you can, I suggest you just play the demo first, it's a great game in pretty much everyway, there are a few moments which will make you pull out your hair but otherwise the experience as a whole is brilliant for the price.\n[b]8/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1423179584, "timestamp_updated": 1423179584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14334930": {"recommendationid": "14334930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047536549", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423481127}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome, but they ruined Tornado, it was way better in Oath in Felghana.

THE EMERSION! A game that, to me, gave a really good bonding experience with the playable characters. Good difficulty and balance, yet still the possibility to easily gain some more fighting strength for tough fights. \n\nNot many games do, but this game gave me that empty feeling of sadness when it was over. I was forced to consider what just occured, and the meaning of it. And let me tell you, my conclusion wasn't a happy one. Knowing that your character was done and that you would never again experience the same thing is not very pleasant in this case. This is something I rarely see in the modern gaming genres. I want to mention a couple of things to those who have doubts about this game.\n\nIt's a japanese game, so it does have some anime-esk cut-scenes and images. Yet, these occur very rarely, so do not be concerned if you think this would bother you (Though, seriously, why would it?).\n\n It's an old game, don't look for good graphics and such. Though, that's not what you primarily should be looking for in a game. \n\nThe gameplay feels smooth and fast-paced, something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Characters that are extremely unique and different from one another. Discovering the plot feels utterly fantastic. Any time something plot-related occured in between my beat up sequences, I couldn't help but let my excitement lead me through the dialogues. Remember when I mentioned I felt really empty and sad about my character that I played? How I wasn't going to be able to see her anymore? Well, that happened with not only that one, but some NPCs as well. Definitely an achievement.\n\nSomething more about difficulty. The game has 5 difficulty settings, two above and below normal. This makes it very suitable for people of all skill levels or interests. Keep in mind that you cannot change your difficulty throughout the game, yet this is also not necessary as you will always be able to beat the boss without exception because of the possibility to grind a level or two. Not once have I felt like a boss was truly overpowered. Rather, that I, myself, was underpowered. And that is something that's easy to fix. \n\nNow, something I really appreciate about this game is that you have 3 playable characters. One of which is unlocked by finishing the game with one of the other two. This is because the final one is the hardest one to play and to minimize sploilers for the other two. The reason for that is something you will have to find out for yourself. The last one also has the one true story, meaning, the heaviest plot.

Very simplistic in its setup, but my god the best part is the boss battles. Well designed requiring more than just skills but also a certain strategy, makes it less easier than killing simple masses of enemies in comparison. This is probably one of the best non-turn based and non-party JRPG games out there. And that goes for the whole series, as I assume the original games are even better story-wise.

Combat is smooth and rewarding, not too complicated but it's not just buttonmashing either. The platforming is done very well, challenging but not frustrating. Bosses are awesome (as far as I've gotten). \nOnly niggle (ugh, really steam? I'm saying n.i.g.g.l.e) is if you're really having trouble with a boss, it may be you're just underleveled. The game doesn't really emphasize your level so it's easy to miss, but I found that after going back and gaining 4 levels, the boss that was seriously kicking my behind, was suddenly pretty easy (although you'll still need to learn each boss' attackpatterns). Luckily though, grinding those 4 levels was very quick, probably no more than half an hour or so, and didn't feel like traditional grinding (aka boring) at all.\nOne comment though, everyone's saying how tough the game is... Well, it's not easy, but you might think it's a frustrating experience. As far as I'm concerned it's not. It offers a challenge, but it never feels unfair and to me personally on normal mode I find it's just right (and I'm not normally a glutton for punishment, still havent dared to start up dark soulds ;-))\nI haven't gotten anywhere near completing this game yet, but just wanted to share this quick review because the game is still on sale for another 21 hours or so.

Well, then this is what you have been searching for your whole life.\n\nGeneral Overview:\nAs you start the game, you can select between playing Hugo and Yunica. Hugo is like an SMG, you can spam your basic attacks like crazy, but is slower than a slowpoke. And Yunica has oven mittens... oh, and an axe, and is quite mobile. After that you can choose your difficulty, whereas nightmare really is a nightmare, and easy for Hugo players (yes, I hate him and I can't play him).\nIn this game, nightmare actually adds stuffs like attacks to the enemies, not just way more health and damage. Don't worry if you get stuck on a boss for 3+ hours in this mode.\nUpgrading your character is also possible. You get small crystals which are your ingame-coins. In Nightmare every crystal is 1 point worth. In every other difficulty, I think, the bigger crystals give way more points.\n\nThe story:\nThe goddesses are nowwhere to be found on Ys. It's your job to go to the surface and find them. Of course, they are in the giant Darm Tower, the lair of the evil guys. Depending on which character you play, the story changes a bit. You get a few different bosses and other cutscenes. Due to this, you want to play it again, just to see how everything plays out for each character.\nOverall, to leave it mostly spoilerfree: Each story had it's emotional part and was well thought-out.\n\nGameplay:\nHugo: Will make your hands hurt (You should map a key to autopress the shoot button 30x a second)\nYunica: Solid Movement, good attack speed, fun to play and mittens.\nThere are a lot of enemies. Some are just powered up versions of older enemies, others are completely new. Especially on Nightmare difficulty you have to be very carefully to choose how to deal with the enemy. Some are almost completely immun to your skills. Learing the patterns of your foes helps a great deal.\n\nSetting:\nYou play in a huge tower. However, this doesn't mean the interior is all the same. Every time after one of the bigger bosses, the tower changes completely. One time you play with lava, the other time you play with sand and also mirrors!\n\nUnlockables:\nYes, this game has unlockables. Once you complete the game with any character, you unlock something awesome and the boss rush mode. After you finish the game with every character, you get the arena mode and a shop. In the first you defeat enemies for points, which then can be exchanged for stuff in the latter one. The shop allows you to buy many things, like powered up spells, Hugo still sucks though.\n\nSoundtrack:\nJust listen to the trailer music. It's so awesome! The rest is also pretty good.\n\nLong story short:\nBuy it, so we get even more Ys on steam!", "timestamp_created": 1420816279, "timestamp_updated": 1420816424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3,

Yes, another great game. As a fan of rpg games. I can say that Ys origin have alot of rich stories from different perspective of the characters. This is an rpg with action that requires more than repeatedly hitting the same buttons. If you have played a YS game before then you probably know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe buttons are simple, it's easy as 1 2 3. There are 5 modes that you can play. Which are the Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard & Nightmare. A single playthrough on Nightmare takes about 30 hours the first time through, it's pretty hard. So those repeatedly buttons will require more than skills to finish it. There are 3 different characters that you can play, different skills, different stories, and different outfits. lol. \n\nFrom the artworks and cutscenes, it takes creativity in order to create something like this. I can't say I like it, I love it. There's alot of things you can do here, you won't get bored I assure you.\n\nAfter completing the game, you get to experience new menu's from the game which includes the arena mode, boss rush and such. If you're really planning to 100% complete this game, goodluck. \n\nWhat I didn't liked about the game is that, the dialogues are pretty much the same for the characters but your experience will be pretty much the same each time aside from different attack methods and skills of the characters. You'll understand this if you play the game.\n\nSo all in all, if you don't have this game.

I'll make sure to come back later and polish it up. :)\n\nI've never played any Ys game before, but I'm thoroughly enjoying my playthrough so far. Only about 6 floors in so I have no idea howmuch there is left and I'm repeatedly getting my rear handed to me on nightmare mode first playthrough. I have to say this is one of the few games where constant death doesn't bother me as it generally feels like I made a mistake.\n\nSo far the enemies have been scaling really well in all of their drops, and anytime I get stuck on a boss (so far both I've run into one) I don't mind going back and grinding a level or two to beef up my stats and try again and feel a noticeable difference. Leveling feels really solid so far as I feel a discernible, if not momentous, difference each time I gain a level, and makes me feel rewarded for hard work.\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight with the combat and platforming working very well to challenge your mastery of the game's mechanics.

Fast paced combat, enough story to keep you mildly invested, and multiple characters to help fit more than one type of playstle. Ys Origin has many [noticible] flaws and successes, most of which make it the game it is today.\n\nPros: \n3 Playable characters- We have your battle axe wielding berserker-style teenager, your snooty mage, and your \"Git gud and unlock me\" Character. Each one plays differently because of movement, magic skills, or how well they can manage themselves in, what I like to call, \"crisis\" situations (instances where you end up in a terrible spot and thinking/reacting fast is your only means of survival\".\nJumping- FINALLY, A GAME WHERE I CAN PLAY AN RPG, FIGHT IN REAL TIME, AND JUMP!!!! Moving in 3 dimensions makes platforming puzzles and combat reach another level of challenging.\nPuzzles- Puzzles are NEVER stupidly difficult and one particular puzzle can actually be solved without getting a \"mandatory\" upgrade nearby as 2 of the 3 characters. Puzzles are more meant to keep you from \"completely\" blitzing through the game.\nStory- Story is spaced out enough that it will never wholely interrupt your climb through the tower, but will still be there to keep you interested\nBoss Fights- Probably the crowning achievement of Ys games, the boss fights will almost ALWAYS let you have a ton of fun on any difficulty (Yes, even people like me who are frustrated on higher difficulties still enjoy Nightmare mode/Inferno mode for Oath in Felghana). The fact that most of them keep the same pace, or even speed up a bit near the end of the fight, keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes victories that much sweeter.\nDifficulty select- You can't change once you start...but at the beginning there are multiple difficulties for the casual/hardcore masochist in all of us. Very Easy mode for the people who just want to beat the game, all the way up to Nightmare for the people who want to be challenged/punished for slightly better unlockable rewards.\nMusic- FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING SACRED AND DEMONIC IN ALL WORLDS, THIS MUSIC IS AMAZING :L I am a SLAVE to the soundtracks in Ys games! Fanboying aside....we DO have many memorable tracks and a few that may put you to sleep (I'm looking at you 2nd sector >.<) but the tracks are all VERY good standalone....just not always for extended periods of time. The BGM will be the same for the ENTIRE time you are in a sector/until you enter a boss area, so get used to them.\n\n\nCons- \nCombat playstyles- Each character can only really play one way...turning trash mob combat into tedium when you are a few levels shy of doing any real damage to enemies. Trash mobs WILL eventually turn into beat-em up sections if you need to go level grinding for any reason.\nLevel to Damage scaling- You will get new armor and be able to upgrade your weapon as you play through the game but at the same time your level is just as dependant on your damage. If you are even 2 levels shy of where you \"should be\" you will do little to no damage. You will literally get a small damage/defense spike around certain levels just so you keep up, a pattern present in Ys: Oath in Felghana as well. The same applies to having a weapon too low level. I was at the 3rd boss of the game as the 1st playable character and I noticed I could barely do 2 damage to the guy. Turns out, I missed an upgrade partway through the tower section I was in; because the MOMENT I got it the boss was taking normalized damage again. Upgrade (as a result) are NOT optional, which may kill the game for you if you are playing on Hard/Nightmare and you are going in blind. \nGlitches- The game is relatively glitch-free from my 160-170 hours on record, but occasionally you will witness things like falling through a floor during an attack or clipping into things that stay relatively solid. Nothing too bad, but it did hurt a little getting to the true final boss and falling through the floor RIGHT as I pulled out my nuke move.\nUpgrades- Remember how I said upgrades \"should\" be optional in places? This is where the game has the potential to be a real deal breaker for some. Most RPGs have proven that treasure chests are relatively optional unless something you NEED is in them. Ys: Origin loves planting things that make not getting OHKO'd/combat even remotely possible late game IN treasure chests and then giving you free reign to ignore them. This is not a complaint, but this HAS halted/slowed the progress of a few people Ive helped out on the forums. You should ALWAYS go for chests you see...even if it looks like a pain in the butt to get if you want to have a decent time above Easy mode.\n\n\nOverall, I give this an 8/10, its EASILY one of my favorite games (especially out of my Steam Library) but even I can see where this game would piss someone off.", "timestamp_created": 1419917890, "timestamp_updated": 1419917890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.985056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13693175": {"recommendationid": "13693175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158487155", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445633990}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging and engaging the kind of JRPG reminds me of the old PS2 games.

The game plays like a rpg in the way of magic, equipment and character development, but everything else play like an action rpg, perharps a bit like zelda too, if he could turn super sayan! This particular one challenge you with multiple playable characters each with their touch and varying stories.\n\n-Lost", "timestamp_created": 1416380236, "timestamp_updated": 1416380236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12983146": {"recommendationid": "12983146", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996972938", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418869459}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is what happens if you take the dungeon crawling part of Recettear, remove all the annoying parts, improve all the fun parts, and give it a nice coat of paint.

I reccommend it highly for anyone who likes the idea of fast combat, and who doesn't mind a little bit of a grind (but really, just a little bit.)

I recommend playing the game at least three times, once with each character. The order I played in was: Yunica (close/medium-range), Hugo (medium/long-range), then the secret character (very close-range). All three have interwining stories, and you only get the full picture after beating the game with all three. \n\nThe story itself is interesting, and makes you want to keep playing long after the credits roll. The good thing about Ys Origin is that you don't need any backstory from the previous games, due to this title being a prequel to the rest of the series. The combat is addictive, with the environments and enemies changing often enough so as not to get repetitive. The soundtrack is sublime, and will make you want to listen to it even outside of the game.\n\nI played the game on Normal difficulty, and doing so will probably net you 8-10 hours of game for each character.

There are levels you are meant to be at, as the boss time attack mode makes clear, and sometimes you don't get to those levels without going back and bashing mooks for a while. Still, at the right level, you can treat Ys like a real game and not yet another RPG grindfest.\n\nOther problems, it's flatly worse than Ys Oath in Felghana. The mook combat is more interesting but the addition of multiple characters with different styles screws the balancing all up.\n\nThe story tells an \"origin\" that doesn't really ever justify itself. The priests of Ys had no grand mystery behind them and other than locking you in a dreary endless tower and throwing a lot of redone Ys 1 and 2 enemies at you, this story ends up offering no real insight to the Ys story, nor does it ever really get interesting enough to justify the freakishly long unskippable cutscenes.  Oath had a bloated tale too but at least it was a rollicking good adventure.

Even though the Ys series is as old as Zelda and has enjoyed immense popularity in Japan since the first game, Ys 1: Ancient Ys Vanished (1987), the series has never been that popular outside the Orient.\n\nA few entries did make it west on PS2 and PSP, either through Konami in 2005 with Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim (the first English release of the series in thirteen years) or XSEED\u2019s masterful handling of translations starting with Ys: The Oath in Felghana. XSEED released Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (1989), on Steam in March. This is the first time most PC gamers get to experience what is (in terms of number of game releases) the largest Eastern RPG series second only to Final Fantasy. \n\nReleased on Steam in May, Ys Origin is the seventh game in the Ys series and a prequel. It takes place first in terms of chronology, 700 years before the events of \u201cAncient Ys Vanished\u201d (Ys I & II). As you explore a huge vertical dungeon known as \u201cDarm Tower\u201d, the game elaborates on much of the series\u2019 backstory, including characters, mystical artifacts and locations. \n\nThere are three playable characters (one is initially locked until you beat the game once with either of the other two), each has their own story and combat style. Yunica, a young knight, uses an axe and sword for close-range melee. Hugo Fact, genius magician and all-round asshole, shoots bullets and is the easier of the two to play. We\u2019re not going to spoil the third character for you.\n\nCombat is fast and action-packed, with enemies having clear and recognizable patterns to their attacks. As you hack-and-slash your way up the tower, there are some mild puzzles to solve and mild platforming elements to jump through. There\u2019s a kind of momentum system to keep you pushing forward: as you kill enemies without stopping, you gain a bonus to the rate at which you get experience points and \u201cSP\u201d. The \u201cSP\u201d points are spent to permanently buff your character, such as increasing resistance to negative effects like poison or confuse , or to upgrade your armour.\n\nThe boss fights are where the game (and series) really strut its stuff. While mowing through general enemies is pretty easy, boss fights require focus. You\u2019ll need to learn their attack patterns, figure out which skills to use against them, and if you\u2019re really into that kind of thing there are Time Attack and Boss Rush challenge modes.", "timestamp_created": 1411432320, "timestamp_updated": 1411432320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12180141": {"recommendationid": "12180141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032183811", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450966012}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys Origins is a old school JRPG time of game. part of the Ys franchise it is actually a prequel to the other games.

Pretty visuals? An excellent story? Intense action? A challenge? If the answer to the last two questions are \"yes\", you should try this game. The anime/JRPG style visuals may not be everyone's cup of tea, so take that into account. The story is by no means bad, but nothing that'll keep you at the edge of your seat. But there are some really good reasons why to play this game. \n\nFirst of all, the gameplay. Fast-paced and fluid hack&slash action typical for an ARPG with the difference that it has a vertical dimension as well, adding some platforming to the whole concept. Initially you get to pick between two characters, and can unlock a third one. The story remains more or less the same (it's best described as 3 different points of view), but there are significant differences in how the characters are played, each of the 3 offers a unique gameplay experience. You can pick either a controller or the KB/mouse duo, both work just fine. The configuration tool is user-friendly and offers a lot of freedom in defining your desired configuration.\n\nThere are five difficulty levels, ranging from \"very easy\" to \"nightmare\". The game is quite challenging, don't be shy to try it on a lower difficulty if you just don't seem to move forward. The strongest point of this game are the numerous and intense boss-battles, which test your reflexes and wits alike. You won't get anywhere with the \"hit it until it stops moving\" idea even on \"very easy\". Expect to hit the retry button numerous times, sometimes it's not obvious what you need to do from the start. Explore and experiment, it's fun! \n\nFinished story mode with all 3 characters? The game still has replay value! In the Time Attack mode, you can test your mettle against the game's bosses without having to replay the whole game again. And it doesn't end there. While Time attack can be played right after completing the game with one character, once you clear the story mode with all 3, you gain access to Arena Mode, where you fight waves of enemies from the level of your choice and collect SP (the game's currency) to unlock bonus content. \n\nThe soundtrack is simply amazing. Masterpiece after masterpiece, greatly adding to the enjoyment the game has to offer.\n\nIf \"challenge\" is your middle name, then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\nThe verdict: 8.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1409074999, "timestamp_updated": 1409083049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11858529": {"recommendationid": "11858529", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989870348", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408370931}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e9s bon RPG d'action.

LOOOOONG. Like, possibly the longest intro to an RPG I've ever played.\n\nHOWEVER, once you get past the intro, you're introduced to the meat of the gameplay, and holy hell is it satisfying! The combat in Ys: Origin is fast placed hack n slash that seems mindless at first, but if you just mindlessly spam attacks with no thought, you will die. A lot.\n\nIn fact, even if you're careful, you will most likely die a lot, because this game is HARD. The normal enemies are usually no trouble, though there are indeed cases where they can chump you if you're not careful, but the real meat of the difficulty lies in the boss battles.\n\nIf you're at all familiar with the Ys series, than you probably know that one of the series' most lauded aspects is the incredibly designed, incredibly difficult boss fights, and Origin is no exception. You will most likely die to a boss at least once before you learn how to deal with them. And each boss as their own styles, attacks, and strategies, so each boss feels fresh and exciting.\n\nAlso, did I mention the music? Because HOLY HELL the music is amazing. Quite possibly one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for an RPG with fast paced action, an interesting story, amazing bosses, amazing soundtrack, and a difficulty level that constantly keeps you on your toes, then Ys Origin is for you.

One of the first action-oriented JRPGs, and one of the few series that still sticks around today. There's a reason for that, it's a series that has evolved over time without losing it's roots. It's still all about running around, killing monsters, growing stronger, finding key items and fighting challenging bosses.\nIn that, it's pretty much a cousin to the Legend of Zelda. \n\nIt does have it's own style of combat, and it's own setting (generic by today's standards, but when the series was new it was one that helped build the stereotypes) and each entry tends to have it's own twists and tricks. \n\nThis is one of the later entries to the series, and uses 3d environments with good-looking 2d spritework for the characters. It mostly sticks to overhead view, but there's sections that twist the viewpoint along the way.\nstory-wise it's the prequel to the story. As such, the mainstay hero swordsman Adol is nowhere in sight yet, and instead you have 2 playable characters with their unique playstyle (with a 3rd one to unlock).\nEach character has a different playstyle, and gets different special skills to use.\n\nPros:\n- Game provides a good challenge on Normal difficulty, ramping up quickly but smoothly. Easier & harder difficulties are also available.\n- Bosses are memorable, with fairly tricky attack patterns at times (and mostly references to the bosses from earlier games in the series)\n- The playable characters do handle completely different, adding replayability\n- Crisp high-res artwork, holding up well today even though the original Japanese version of the game dates back to 2006\n- Pretty cool soundtrack\n- One of the playable characters is a non-sexualized, non-stereotypical female protagonist. That seems to be a big deal in this day and age so I'll list it as a pro.\n- Plenty of customization options. (if using a gamepad, you will want to remap the pause/menu button though - for some sillt reason it's not mapped to start button by default)\n- Solid controls\n- Update: Unlockable bonus modes, with leaderboards and all, which start unlocking once you complete the game\n\nCons:\n- While good-looking, there isn't that much variety in the different environments you'll run through\n- There's a couple of weird things, like a key equipable item not being in the equipment screen, but tucked away in between the usable items instead.\n- No auto-saving. This being an old-school game it uses a savepoint mechanism, which works well. What's weird is that savepoints do work as checkpoints when you die, but don't auto-save to an actual save game.\n- Non-skippable cutscenes. Which is annoying if you want to start a new game but can't skip the minutes-long opening movie to get into the action. Update: At least the long animated scenes become skippable after you complete the game once.

If you fail, it's your fault - it's quite Dark Souls'esque in this regard. Especially noteworthy are the bosses that are all very unique in their mechanics and that are thoroughly fun to fight. Each and every one of them has move-sets that are to be learned and understood if you want to defeat them. It's not too difficult to figure out what to do because each of their movements can be predicted by the animations they have - to me it seems that's one of the biggest strengths that Japanese/Asian games have over western games (the rules to beat the game are very clear - it's still tough).\n\nThe level design is great. There may be some backtracking involved but it's really only if you didn't check everything properly in your first run-through. Everything is connected in a consistent and logical manner and there are various styles of areas.\n\nThe sound design is great as well. The feedback you get for your actions is quickly ingrained into your brain, and helps you understand what's happening even if you can't take in all the visual information at the time - perfect. The soundtrack is pumping and very well done, suits the overall game.\n\nThe graphics are not top notch but they suit the kind of game Ys Origins is. They are probably even perfect for what the game tries to achieve. They are simplistic but nice to look at, everything fits together and there is nothing that sticks out as ugly or unfitting. Especially noteworthy are the character models that look very nice.\n\nMy one problem with the game is that if you are underleveled, you will have a really tough time against some of the bosses. An unnecessarily tough time that may force you to go back and grind 2-3 levels. Which doesn't take too much time but is tedious nonetheless and could've been circumvented by making levels count less and making items count more for the overall strength of your character.\n\nAll in all - who woulda thunk it after reading what I just wrote - Ys is one of my favorite games of all times.\n\nI won't give you a stupid random number for this game though - judgements of games are always subjective.\n\nIf anything, I'd give the same rating Conan O'Brien gave for Tomb Raider:\n\nEdit: Sorry, but it doesn't start you at the right time, even though I linked with time.

Unfortunately the great gameplay, soundtrack and visuals are dragged down by downright cringeworthy dialogue and a by the numbers story with a very flat ending.

The character sprites are well made and environments have clear and different themes and feels. The fast pace of the monster slaying is maybe a bit too often grinded into a halt when you have to sit through lengthy and uninteresting line exchanges between the monotone and cliche characters.\n\nOne interesting thing of note is the other main character of the game, Hugo. He should probably get an award for the most edgy video game protagonist ever. Most of the cringe material of the game comes from his teenage rebel attitude. The story might have been much less cringy had I picked Yunica for playable character, but I also think the edginess is kinda charming and memorable.\n\nIn conclusion the rock solid gameplay and soundtrack totally redeem this game from any negatives I might have towards it.

There's enough about it that's bad enough to give it a thumbs down, but it's definitely done some things pretty well.  This review lists major points concisely with more detailed explanations at the bottom.\n\nHere are the flaws I've seen so far:\n-Character and item upgrade systems are pathetically bad.\n-Uninspired levels.\n-The 'puzzles' involve finding an item and backtracking to use it.  \n-Framerate issues with some graphical effects.\n-Controls need autofire and autocharge.  Other control problems may be specific to me.\n-Too many rpg text dialogs that can't be skipped.  \n-The difficulty curve isn't right.  \n-The rate of levelling needs adjusting, and the effect of gaining levels is not done well.  It increases damage done and decreases damage taken, altering boss fight difficulty too much.\n\nGame's strong points:\n+The bosses are very challenging with fully-avoidable attacks\n+The action is fast-paced.  \n+The graphics are colorful, and I like the graphical style of the characters.\n\nRegarding difficulty,\nOn Hard difficulty with the magic user, the monsters are a joke, unable to threaten the player.  The bosses are very challenging.  On nightmare difficulty with the melee character, the (skippable) trash monsters are about right, but the bosses are extremely challenging.  \nThere is at least 1 boss fight that cannot be won without grinding due to its being a dps race.  It is not obvious that grinding is the intended (and only) way to win the encounter.  Grinding 5 levels for that fight also reduced the boss's attacks from 40 dmg/hit to 9 dmg/hit.  I do not know how hard those bosses are supposed to hit, and I suspect the developers don't either.  \nWithout grinding, nightmare bosses can take 1-10 hours to beat, including the time to learn their moves.\n\nUnskippable dialogs\nare ubiquitous and boring.  Even if I were interested in reading the story of a hero who rescues princesses and saves the world, my replays through the game would not be.\nThe intro cinematic is well done, but it can't be skipped either.  It takes at least 15 minutes to start a new game due to the unskippable cut scenes and dialog.\n\nThe controls\ndesperately need an autofire button and a way to hold down the magic charge button.  Using outside configuration utilities creates some problems in the game such as menus opening and closing due to autofire.  Holding down the magic charge button while imtermittently holding down the attack button and periodically jumping has led to some hand soreness.  Without autofire, the repetitive button presses will cause a lot of repetitive stress.\nEven after some configuration, there are still occaisional phantom axis motions, and recharging magic immediately after casting makes it cast twice.", "timestamp_created": 1408247713, "timestamp_updated": 1409723814, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618985", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11746801": {"recommendationid": "11746801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051564881", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424846313}, "language": "english", "review": "Everyone will enjoy this simply due to:\n\n2D RPG style with 3D Graphics\nPuzzle style mixed with hack and slash gameplay\nReally challanging boss fights\nSimple to play, requires possibly 3-4 buttons.\nCheap", "timestamp_created": 1408239670, "timestamp_updated": 1413241486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11694274": {"recommendationid": "11694274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064669577", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408133616}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego 9 puntos de 10 .\nBuena jugabilidad , buena grafica ,buenas escenas  , buena banda sonora.\nPara mi gusto me hubiese encantado jugarlo en espa\u00f1ol  para entender 100 % la historia , pero tambien esta bueno que te habilite mas personajes a medida que terminas el juego con cada uno \n\n100% recomendado!!!", "timestamp_created": 1407968356, "timestamp_updated": 1479975192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11692260": {"recommendationid": "11692260", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999574444", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415569547}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a game that you just can go to play... forget this.

I've been wanting to play a game in this series for a while and I'm so happy I picked this one up. A Diablo-style action RPG, this game is hella fun. I'm several hours into my first playthrough and have really enjoyed it so far. Challenging boss fights, decent level design that rewards you for exploring while providing a decent story. It's all a very solid and polished experience that's worth your time. A lot of games like this have mecahnics that suffer or that are a bit loose. To me, this is a crucial part of enjoying a game's platforming sections. It's very frustrating when you feel like you told your character to jump from the platform they're on to the one on the right only to find that you were pressing every so slightly in an upwards/downwards direction which caused you to miss the platform and fall into the pit. Not so here. I felt like I had good control over the character and rarely if ever made such a mistake that felt all too common even in AAA titles that are top ranked in their class. \n\nOverall I really can't find much to fault in this game. To nitpick I'd say the costumes are a bit plain when you're talking to others but this is also refreshing at the same time. It's simple, and practical. I would also say there maybe could have been more variety with the monsters but this doesn't really bother me at all either. It's just a fun game that's knows what it is and has fun being just that. If you like games like this I highly recommend giving it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1407872704, "timestamp_updated": 1407872704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11677347": {"recommendationid": "11677347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003997834", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407876747}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the best Ys game on Steam, great replayability, great music, and Falcom's seal of quality.

Both the engines of Ys I & II and Origin & Felghana have the perfect balance between graphics, performance and gameplay quality.\n\nI won't talk too much about the plot because I usually don't care about that stuff.\nYs Origin is a prequel set 700 years before the events of Ys I & II and tells about the past of Ys, the twin goddesses, the black pearl and Solomon Shrine. Most of humanity fled to Solomon Shrine (which is on a floating island up in the sky), as the surface got taken over by demons. For the very first time we're not playing as Adol. We will be playing as one member of a group of adventurers (you can choose between 3 characters) sent to investigate on the disappearance of the twin goddesses, who seem to be inside the Darm tower.\n\nPro / Cons:\n+ = pro\n- = con\n\n- no more \"bump mechanics\" from Ys I & II. In my opinion, this combat system was unique and kinda set Ys apart from other action RPG's, also it made boss fights a bit more challenging. Ys Origin & other newer Ys games ditched that system for more generic hack n slash mechanics + magic which is okay but nothing special.\n- the game takes place entirely inside of the Darm Tower, so there is not that much variety environment-wise.\n- while Ys I had very short but extremely fast & challenging boss fights (except for a few bosses with bugged AI's), the boss fights on Ys Origin are slow and long, and since the bosses heavily rely on RNG, defeating a boss on Nightmare difficulty is 50% skill 50% luck unless you overlevel to fight that luck factor. Either way, there is too much luck involved in boss fights, and sometimes it can become frustrating even if you can actually beat the boss 100% of the times. This also makes boss rush / time attack extremely tedious and frustrating especially on Nightmare where you will be barely equipped to beat the boss. In Ys I & II, on the other hand, the boss fights were 100% skill based and used nearly no RNG-based attacks, but they were so challenging that you had to practice for a bit to master them even if you memorized them, so the results of the boss fights scaled directly with the player's skill.\n- there is a lot more grinding required, too much for my tastes. Leveling up for bosses takes much longer and filling the monster book is now random instead of having to kill each mob 31 times.\n- the dialogue can be sped up but not skipped. this can be frustrating when playing through the game multiple times.\n- the save system does not allow you anymore to save anywhere - you can teleport to save points, but you will have to save there so that adds some useless backtracking when saving before dangerous situations. On the other hand, the teleport system is handy to quickly teleport to every area of the game, but a system like the wings in Ys II would've been enough.\n- Alt + F4'ing the game has a chance to corrupt your monster book\n+ a playthrough takes about 10 hours if you kill all of the bosses first try and 20-30+ hours if you take a few tries to beat each boss, which is pretty optimal for multiple playthroughs or speedruns.\n+ amazing soundtrack with lots of remasters of the original darm tower musics in Ys I\n+ lots of references to Ys I & II: remastered bosses, lots of monsters in common, lots of remastered music, some key items in common and the plot is nicely linked and properly explains all of the backstory behind Ys I.\n+ very high replay value: each character sees the story from an entirely different perspective, will encounter slightly different bosses and each character's boss fight is balanced differently. There's also an arena mode where you will be able to fight monsters from different areas of the game to gain SP you can use to unlock alternative versions of the characters and other bonus content, including a secret boss. Completing all of the achievements will take up to 6 playthroughs or more.

Come on, you have to have one ending that ends well for everyone, right?\n-Heavy grind game, if you play on the harder difficulties with Yunica or Hugo, expect more grinding than with The Claw.\n\nVery good buy, especially if you're a fan for awesome stories and fun (Yet punishing) games.", "timestamp_created": 1405693709, "timestamp_updated": 1405693709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11303968": {"recommendationid": "11303968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038554678", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406436148}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Great Game!!! with various puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1405693026, "timestamp_updated": 1405693026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11275858": {"recommendationid": "11275858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101593194", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462576374}, "language": "english", "review": "The game that introduced me to the Ys series.

The PC gaming market is small over there, and it's common for developers to misunderstand PC expectations. Moreover, these types of games attract a passionate fanbase, who will often overlook technical flaws in their reviews.\n\nGood news: none of this applies to Ys Origin. \n\nThe game runs at 60 frames per second without a hitch. Widescreen resolutions are properly supported. There is minimal letterboxing on menus, but devs have added additional graphics on the sides (rather than black bars), a nice touch. 7 hours in, I haven't been able to spot a single bug or glitch. Keyboard controls are implemented and the various tutorial screens actually reference these keys rather than gamepad prompts.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, other reviews give a good overview so there's hardly any need to expand on this. Personal recommandation, don't let your ego get in the way of a fun experience. As someone who finds the Dark Souls series' reputation for punishing difficulty to be largely overblown (and I love all Dark Souls games), Ys Origin's demo boss still handed my ass to me several times on Normal difficulty. Picking Easy for my real playthrough after buying the game, so far it has been appropriately challenging. \n\nAlso worth noting leveling seems to be important in this game. Sometimes, getting two extra levels can be the difference between hitting a boss for 1 damage per hit or 10 damage per hit (those numbers might seem paltry either way, but when you think about it, the latter hits ten times harder). On Easy there hasn't been any need to grind experience so far.\n\nOverall, an excellent game. -75% discounts come and go on a regular basis, and at that price it's a steal if you're even remotely interested in the genre.

I think this is worth it.\n\nThere are a lot of games in the Ys series, several of which are on Steam. This is actually a prequel, set hundreds of years before the main series games.\n\nYet... this is my favorite.\n\nThe Ys series are action RPGs. What makes them unique is that a level-up should not be underestimated - it makes the difference between getting served by a boss and dominating it. So grinding feels genuinely rewarding, and something you shouldn't have to do much of if you're not playing on higher levels. Plus, the soundtrack absolutely rocks.\n\nThere is a bit of a Metroid feel as you'll be backtracking and searching around for powerups to help you get further into the tower. There are three characters, and for me the game was never really boring enough not to replay with the other characters. Getting all achievements, however, requires beating the game a total of six times, and on the highest difficulty for three of them. Don't think I'm going for that.\n\nThe Ys series was never huge on story - you won't find anything revolutionary here. But it's not a problem, since the gameplay more than makes up for it.\n\nIn summary: Genuinely fun action, great music, and a great intro into the Ys series.

Unlike most Ys games, you don't play as familiar, red-haired protagonist Adol Christin, but rather one of two characters (there is also a 'secret' third character), the axe-wielding Yunica and the mage Hugo. This is a different take on the series than most entries, and is a welcome change as there is a lot of variety with the playstyles of each character, and this also adds to the replay value as you can play through the game multiple times with different characters, the story being slightly different for each as well. \n\nThe story is rather bare-bones, but mildly interesting, particularly if you are an Ys fan or a fan of traditional fantasy storylines. Nothing to set the world on fire, but the main characters are likable (particularly Yunica) and the story does not get in the way of the game's main strength: the fast-paced, action-RPG combat. If you've never played an Ys game, particularly the older titles, the game plays as a mix of a top-down hack n' slash and a 2.5 platformer. Many of the skills you gain have dual uses for both platforming and combat, and there is a decent variety of abilities. That being said, there is much more combat than platforming in the game, and while the platforming can be occasionally frustrating, the combat is where the series, and this game in particular, truly shines. Combat requires you to quickly chain together attacks, make smart use of your skills, and avoid enemy attacks by dodging and jumping. Basic enemies are not too difficult, though there is a wide variety of enemy types to fight, all with their different skillsets and strategies. The bosses are the main attraction, being both difficult and surprisingly epic for a game without state-of-the-art graphics. \n\nOne more thing about this game, and the Ys series as a whole: the music is FANTASTIC! Some of the best videogame music I have ever heard is from this series, and this entry keeps the bar set high. There are quite a few stellar tracks, many of which are boss themes. Overall, I would reccomend this game to any fan of the series, any fan of action RPG's, and any fan of Japanese games. If none of these categories apply to you, then pick this gem up on sale. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed, and maybe you'll become another fan of this underappreciated (but spectacular) series.", "timestamp_created": 1404946304, "timestamp_updated": 1404946304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11156935": {"recommendationid": "11156935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061518089", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395291694}, "language": "english", "review": "This a fast-paced, exciting RPG with an addictive soundtrack and tons of action.

The game tells the story of two children(?) whom are traveling with their people to find their deities that seem to have gotten captured. You pick one of the two characters, each offering a \"unique\" story but ultimately the same main points are hit the same and you play through the exact same levels. What keeps this fresh is that the two characters offer a completely different play style, one is like a tank the other a mage (there's also a third one who plays like a berserker) so there's a little replayability. The stories are mildly interesting nothing ground breaking, it's pretty much every jrpg ever so you climb the tower, find bad guys, things aren't what they seem to be, etc. I'm being a little harsh on the story, many may like it far more than me but after playing games like The Walking Dead and Ni no Kuni it seems lacking in comparision. \nI reccomend this game to any ARPG lovers or JRPG fans in general.\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1404148204, "timestamp_updated": 1404148204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10957410": {"recommendationid": "10957410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080535958", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481770150}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't spend your time watching screenshots of this game.

I mean this is not multi-million dollar production, but it does have cut scenes, like-able characters and even some psuedo anime/cg thrown in for good measures. \n\nIt reminds me of those games of yesterday and I have to say I enjoy it's simplicity and fun combat.

It's a great game.\n\nYs Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system. There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters. Each character has a very specific playstyle. To avoid spoilers, I'll only detail the initial two.\n\nHugo Fact is a ranged caster. He is very powerful, firing off spell bullets from his wand and his twin artifacts known as the \"Eyes of Fact\" that hover at his side at all times. His is very agile, but he cannot fire while moving. \n\nYunica Tovah is a melee attacker. Armed with her handaxe (and later greatsword), she excels at close combat. She is very quick, dealing fast, hard damage to her opponents. \n\nWhen you start the game, you get to choose from many different difficulty settings (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Nightmare), as well as choose which character you want to play as. Each character has their own storyline, though all three of them are intertwined. Playing each character is highly recommended, as each storyline offers more and more insight into the overall picture.\n\nGameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings. In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens. The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore. They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere. At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss. The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat.\n\nYs Origin includes a neat Arena Bonus Mode and a Boss Rush/Time Attack Mode. In Arena Mode, you choose a character and fight wave after wave of monster in a specific location. As you defeat enemies, you accrue SP. You can then use this SP to unlock a variety of things for this mode, such as extra costumes and even a surprise guest character! In Boss Rush Mode, you can choose to either battle one Boss at a time, or every boss in the game consecutively.\n\nThe music and sound effects are top-notch. The Ys series is known for their amazing soundtracks, and Origin is no exception.  After awhile I found myself whistling along as the music played! You may be inclined to find and purchase the soundtrack online...just a warning! :P\n\nOverall this is just an awesome game. I got it on sale for about $7, but in my opinion the original, full price is WELL worth it. You get a lot of game for the price.\n\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1401493558, "timestamp_updated": 1485064571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 92, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712431", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10281030": {"recommendationid": "10281030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007268034", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424112776}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this when it came out in japan, didn't understand much then, but its a heck of a lot of fun :)", "timestamp_created": 1401408551, "timestamp_updated": 1401408551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10270567": {"recommendationid": "10270567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048788919", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483749537}, "language": "english", "review": "First game in the timeline of Ys.

The story's nothing to cry home about, but it's engaging enough to make you want to learn more about characters. Basically an okay plot, points for that.\n\nGameplay is fantastic; three unique characters that each get their own special abilities and varied fighting styles, as well as boss battles that are tailored to their story rather than set bosses (though set bosses still appear). Again, more actiony than RPG-y, but it makes it fun.\n\nThe music helps carry the game, since it almost obviously coined the term \"rpg combat music\". It is literally as generic fantasy-rock as you can get. I swear this is how a music company got its start. The music still helps the game move along.\n\nOverall a rather fun game to play, and one of the few I've played multiple times just to see everything.

From the silky smooth 60fps gameplay to the surprisingly decent graphics (and pretty impressive bosses), Origin does a great job graphically despite being an older game. The music of couse kicks ass, although I'd put it a notch below the music from Oath in Felghana and Ys I & II. The game is strange in that it doesn't star Adol Christin - instead, three different characters are available to play. To get the most out of the game, you'd need to finish the game with all three characters. In some ways it's rather repetitive since the puzzles and situations don't change much, but the way the characters play differ greatly - especially Hugo, who makes the game almost like a shoot-em-up.

Man kann zu beginn zwischen 2 Charakteren w\u00e4hlen, Yunica welche mehr auf Nahkampf fokusiert ist w\u00e4hrend Hugo ein Fernkampfcharakter ist (nach dem ersten Durchspielen wird ein dritter freigeschaltet). Das Gameplay ist simpel wie fordernd. Man guckt aus der Vogelperspektive auf seinen Charakter welcher mit der einen Taste angreifen kann, mit einer anderen Magie nutzen kann und mit noch einer Taste durch die unterschiedlichen Magieskills switchen. Und es gibt die M\u00f6glichkeit zu springen (Ich sage nicht welche Tastenbelegung ich habe da sowohl die Steuerung mit Tastatur als auch mit Gamepad einwandfrei funktioniert und alle Tasten frei belegbar sind) Die wahre St\u00e4rke des Spiels zeigt sich bei den Bossk\u00e4mpfen. Diese erfordern meist sowohl eine Taktik als auch ein gutes reaktionsverm\u00f6gen und stellen schon auf niedrigen aber gerade auf den h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeitsgraden eine gro\u00dfe Gefahr da. Das Spiel an sich kann in wenigen Stunden abgeschlossen werden aber hat einen hohen wiederspielwert durch die verschiedenen Charaktere und einen Boss-Rush modus welcher wohl die Gr\u00f6\u00dfte herrausforderung darstellt, aber auch diejenigen unter euch, die das Spiel nur einmal durchspielen wollen kommen durchaus auf ihre kosten. Ys Origin geh\u00f6rt definitiv zu meinen Lieblings-RPGs auf dem PC.

It's an excellent prequel to Ys 1&2. It does a great job leading into the other games in the series if you've never played them, and ties up all the loose ends if you have played them. All difficulty levels pose some level of challenge, even on the easiest setting, which keeps with the Ys tradition of hair-pulling moments. This game really appeals to me as an avid Ys enthusiast because of all the refernces to Ys 1&2 that aren't story related. Obviously, as a prequel, many story elements have a lot to do with the events of other games, but it's the more subtle references that I enjoy. I especially liked the fact that most of the bosses are from the original games, but the fights are different.

It plays very much like an old-school RPG but with action elements instead of turn-based combat.  You're slashing, smashing, and magicking your way through a 20-something story tower full of demons.  I don't want to go much into the story because that's half of what makes this game so brilliant.  I haven't played a game with such a great story in a very long time.  Finish this game through to the end as well, because there's a bunch of unlockables (time-attack and an arena battle mode, to name a couple... naming more would be spoilers).  The replay value is pretty good but if you're going for a 100% completion it could take a long while.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has a few quirks to get used to, and it'll take some time, but once you've got it down it's pretty easy.  The boss battles are INSANE, and there are a LOT.  If you're a fan of great boss fights, you'll love this game.  Each difficulty brings a new attack pattern, etc. to the bosses in addition to basically oneshotting you if you're not properly leveled/geared.\n\nThe only qualm I can see that some people might have is that, like I mentioned earlier, if you aren't properly leveled you're going to have a rough time in certain areas of the game (bosses in particular).  The good news is that you'll catch on pretty quick.  The bad news is that you might have to sit there grinding enemies for a while - which isn't too bad, but you have to make sure you save often just in case.\n\nTLDR: Fantastic story, quirky controls, fantastic boss fights, lots of unlockables and decent replay value.  \n\nPick this game up and if you want more of the story, pick up Ys I & II as well as Oath in Felghana.

Ys Origin, being my very first Ys title makes a VERY great impression on me as not only an RPG obsessed gamer, but a huge fan of the ARPG as a whole. \n\nHaving only experienced Yunica's story thus far, the game itself is beautiful in nearly every way. The art style is what you would expect from the older Final Fantasy games and is greatly complemented by the stellar soundtrack. In fact, during cutscenes during major plot points, the music actually adds a powerful layer of emotion, which really made the game complete for me. The story keeps you wanting more, and you're always itching to progress some more, to see what happens next. \n\nAs for the gameplay, it is nothing but awesome. Even though Origin takes place in one location only, each new floor you ascend to varies from the previous floors, so you never end up feeling bored, or feeling like you're on a slow grind to the summit. Enemies are varied, environments are varied, and nothing really seems to be reused. It's hack n' slash style gameplay is also fast, and furious, and there's little to no downtime between enemy encounters, which keeps the flow of the game fresh and constant, which is a must in an ARPG. \n\nBoss fights are unlike anything you'll see in today's generation. Boss fights have multiple mechanics to each, and force you to learn the mechanics until you're doing that fight like clockwork. Some boss fights become intense endurance matches, and when you see the boss fall to your feet, the feeling of victory is nothing short of amazing. \n\nOverall, if you love RPGs, or you're just looking for an intense hack n' slash game that will keep you busy for quite a while (Between playing through all three storylines, time attack, boss rush, and Arena), give Ys Origin a try.

I found the story to be a run-of-the-mill \"good guy wants power, turns evil temporarily, and repents through the power of friendship/love\". I'm generally not the type of guy to delve into, and enjoy, the story of a game very much anyways, so I didn't mind it. In fact, considering that I look for \"great gameplay\" in games, and what type of gameplay I'll tend to go for, I would practically expect a story to be \"the usual\" in a game (not to say I haven't enjoyed original stories). I don't know how the story goes with the other 2 characters, since I haven't played them yet.\n\nThis game, played with a top-down camera angle, plays kinda like a shooter when Hugo is the chosen character, as his attacks revolve around shooting magic missiles straight ahead of him. After a quick test run, the other 2 characters appear to revolve around close-range melee combat. On the hardest difficulty level, the bosses offer such a challenge that you'll find yourself grinding a lot, just to gain that extra level or two and be able to defeat the boss at all (and even then, your battle strategy better be near perfect). This game has some simple puzzle-solving, if you can even call it that. You'll find yourself having to press buttons, defeat certain enemies, obtain and use items/skills, and so on. I did enjoy the challenging gameplay, but it would get frustrating at times with bosses, and also 1 time with a certain enemy that can practically insta-kill you (but that you'll still have to deal with). The only thing to do there is keep looking around for equipment and the like, and grind in special spots to gain levels.\n\nIf you want to know how nice the graphics look, just \"You-Google-Tube\" some gameplay footage on the game. And while you're at it, check out the soundtrack for it as well. It's pretty awesome. As of this post, the game is normally $19.99 USD on Steam and I'd say it's worth the price if you love to spend many hours on a challenging \"battle-grind\" RPG. If it turns-out that you love the game, then you may also love \"Ys: The Oath in Felghana\", which follows a similar gaming style. You may want to avoid Ys I & II though, which has your main attack revolve around ramming into enemies (like in Hydlide), which ruins any sense of \"gameplay\" (at least in my opinion).", "timestamp_created": 1388364192, "timestamp_updated": 1388365446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8404109": {"recommendationid": "8404109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062293675", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388440821}, "language": "english", "review": "A frenetic-action-RPG.\nThis game is a true stress relief.\nBe prepared to grind a lot if you want to play in hard mode.\nI wonder how difficult is the nightmare mode   O.o", "timestamp_created": 1388343456, "timestamp_updated": 1388343456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8395444": {"recommendationid": "8395444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067943387", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386699364}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0420\u041f\u0413, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0435-\u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a, \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1388321535, "timestamp_updated": 1388321535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8392104": {"recommendationid": "8392104", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983993131", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443948424}, "language": "english", "review": "EXCUSE ME BITCH WHY ARE YOUR READING THIS?

It's also unique compared to other games in the series due to the fact that you never play as Adol, but rather as two (actually three) other characters, each with their own style of combat. There's Yunica, whose style is the most similar to Adol's, with mid-range combat skills. Then there's Hugo, who's more of a long-distance fighter. And finally, the third character, whose storyline is considered the \"canon\" one but is also the hardest due to his short-range fighting style. \n\nAlthough there are differences between the three, you're still exploring the same dungeon, so it may get repetitive playing as each one. However, doing so helps flesh out the world of Ys further and brings some fun tie-ins to Ys I and II.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is well balanced. Normal feels just tough enough but not too much so, making it an enjoyable and rewarding experience. There's also plenty to do for completionists, from beating the game on the highest difficulty (Nightmare) to doing Boss Rushes to Arenas. It'll keep you coming back until you've unlocked all the things and gotten all the Steam achievements. Again, it's hard but not so hard that it seems impossible. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to people looking for a fun adventure title and are maybe looking to get into the Ys series as a whole.

In my opinion they are overlooked far too often, but I also have a soft spot for a good old hack n' slash so take that with a grain of salt if that isn't your thing.  Ys Origin is a great addition to the Ys series, they don't try anything funny with going waaaay outside the mold but they do some new stuff as well.  It's gameplay is very similar to Ys Seven.  For those that haven't played that it is a pretty simplistic action RPG battle system.  Step1: Hit with weapon and watch numbers pop out, Step 2: Wallop with magic and watch bigger number pop out, Step 3: Grab loot.  This description, while accurate, does not do the game justice by any means as there are several other aspects to battles as well and it isn't always as simple as button mashing to stay alive.\n\nThe gameplay is fast paced and there is just enough story to keep you interrested in what is going on, but not so much that you are just mashing your keys to get through dialoge so you can get back to the action.  As per ususal the music is very good and the environments are reminicent of a simpler 2D era of gaming.\n\nYs Origins is the first time (I think but I could be wrong) that a Ys game has had multiple playable characters.  It is indeed worth it to play through the game with each of them.  I say this because games will often slap an additional caracter on the roster just to extend playtime, but each of these characters plays so differently it feels like a new experience.  Bosses that were a breeze with one person prove very challenging with another, some characters also have different bosses to fight by base. \n\nThe only complaints I have are that 1) Some of the achievements are not hard so much as incredibly time consuming, 2)While the gameplay is very different for each character the story itself does not stray much for each person, though there are subtle differences.  3) In order to experience all the game has to offer in the way of unlockable bonus content and achievements you will need to do a lot of grinding, and by a lot i mean several metric ****loads of grinding.\n\nPlay this game if you like: The rest of the Ys series, Hack n' slash, Metroidvania titles (somewhat), grinding, electric guitars in your RPG soundtracks.", "timestamp_created": 1387591567, "timestamp_updated": 1387591567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8133268": {"recommendationid": "8133268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034128475", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512295239}, "language": "english", "review": "A truly epic action RPG experience.

Ys is one of those darling series where everyone seems to want to tell you how good it is yet few people have played. While I won't say it's become one of my favorite series, it's become one I've begun to follow, and it along with Trails in the Sky has put Falcom on my mental map when it comes to video games.\n\nYs, pronounced something like \"ease\" with only the first letter capitalized and no apostrophe, is basically an action jrpg without random battles or a heavy story emphasis. There's a moderate amount of text dialogue but it's interesting enough and no voice acting to drag it down. Ys Origin is essentially a far prequel to the events of Ys I and II, also available on Steam but significantly more dated. You are given two choices of characters. Yunica provides gameplay more similar to that of series protagonist Adol, specilizing in close combat fighting. Hugo seems to be a more experimental playstyle for the series, focusing on long range magic attacks.\n\nI strongly suggest Yunica to be your first playthrough character for the game. Her playstyle is simply exceedingly more engaging than Hugo, who simply becomes a button spam unless playing at one of the more difficult settings. Luckily to unlock the third character you only need to beat the game as one of these two, which is nice if you want to experience the full canon story of the third character without slogging through a Hugo playthrough. Though you may find you don't mind and will want to play his story anyways.\n\nYs Origin is a brief experience, which is good considering that if you want to see everything you have to play the game a few times. It also allows for replays and taking on higher difficulties if you find you truly want to master the battle system. While the common enemies may not offer much lateral thought in how you tackle them, the frequent and varied boss encounters are quite a relative spectacle and there's no re-skinning or re-hashing to be seen here. All of them are tackled in a different way.\n\nThere is a plethora of music selections for each section of the tower. The whole soundtrack is great an I often found myself humming some of the more memorable tracks. There's also good variety, so finding a few floors with a theme you don't really care for is offset by knowing that a new track is just around the corner.\n\nDefinietly consider it if you are looking for a unique jrpg without the bloat that SE or someone like NamcoBandai puts out these days.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1387175604, "timestamp_updated": 1387177148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8058115": {"recommendationid": "8058115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002922639", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430308221}, "language": "english", "review": "HAN!!!!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1387133547, "timestamp_updated": 1387133547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8050703": {"recommendationid": "8050703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052983021", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1385693295}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys games are classic, and origin is no exception.

This is going to be more a summation of my thoughts rather than a proper review, so here we go. This game does just about everything right, it's a very tightly designed game that's extremely hard to find any flaws in. You can tell they fine tuned and tailored the game for each and every difficulty setting. While more modern games are using cutscenes and CGI as their set pieces, this game uses gigantic bosses that are both creative and challenging. You're almost guaranteed to die a few times before figuring out how they work, which is exactly how bosses SHOULD be. You might find yourself underpowered sometimes, but the game never requires you to do any more than 5 minutes of quick grinding. In fact, if you explore you may not even have to grind. The artwork in this game is amazing, as is the use of colors. It's really nice to have feminine anime characters that aren't at all sexualized for a change. You're consistently unlocking different attacks and using them against enemies whose attack patterns are constantly changing, keeping everything fresh the entire way through. The game even does platforming well, and adds variety to that as well. You're given access to 3 different characters (one you must unlock), and although I'll admit I haven't gotten to the third yet (currently working on beating the game on nightmare mode with all 3 characters, half way through Hugo right now), the game plays remarkably different with each. One is a hack and slash, the other kind of makes the game into a shoot em up believe it or not. Even the achievements, which I usually ignore as I think they're a useless gimmick, are achievements that you'd get through unlocking everything in the game anyway. With the exception of maybe 1 or 2 VERY easy ones, there's no made up fluff like \"beat the game in under so and so time\" or meaningless things you wouldn't otherwise do. This game really demands to be played with a gamepad in hard or nightmare mode, otherwise it may devolve into carelessly tanking everything and mashing buttons.

This is also the very first YS game without Adol Christin being the protagonist.\n\n[h1][The Game\u2019s Strengths][/h1]\n- A good story to introduce you into the world of Ys\n- Three storylines with different characters which show you different perspectives\n- Different characters also use completely different skills and weapons\n- Fast paced and challenging action combat\n- Four difficulties with the higher ones being a real challenge\n- Decent amount of challenging boss fights\n- The option of grinding monsters until bosses become manageable\n- Simple and easy to understand controls, best played with a controller\n- Clean yet beautiful 2D rendered environments that have a 3D feel\n- Character sprites in gorgeous pixel style\n- Memorable soundtrack that will stick to you even after you have finished the game (I highly recommend checking out the YS Origins super arranged version)\n- Boss Rush, Time Mode, Arena Mode\n- 15 to 35 hours of playtime depending on your playstyle\n\n[h1][Outro][/h1]\nCertainly one of the best action RPGs on steam and despite it's age, is still hella good looking.

If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/07/ys-origin.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nThe Ys series has been a popular action RPG franchise since 1987, but has only had limited release in the US.  Ys Origin serves as a prequel to the rest of the series chronologically, but is one of the most recent releases in the series.    While the combat sometimes seems more like a hack-and-slash action game than an RPG, there is a sense of strategy and patience required in some areas, especially boss fights, which maintains a more cerebral element in the game.  In addition, there are some good platforming sequences and simple puzzle elements that add enough variety to keep the game from feeling monotonous by breaking up the combat sequences.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nThis game is extremely simple to pick up and play.  It features the choice of mouse and keyboard controls featuring point and click movement, or you can control your character with just the keyboard when more precision is needed.  Personally, I only use the mouse when I have a slice of pizza in my left hand.  When new powers are unlocked, brief tutorial screens pop-up to explain their use, and most of them feel fairly intuitive anyway.  The game also does a fairly good job of offering direction, feeling fairly linear except for a few brief moments, often due to dialogue from the NPCs.\n\nWith that being said, this game is not without its challenging points.  The bosses tend to be extremely powerful, at least until you master the patterns of their attacks.  Even then, they require some precision movement and possibly some level grinding to survive.  For those familiar with the bullet-hell genre, you may find yourselves following a familiar strategy of focusing on not getting hit, only taking attacks when you have the rare opportunity.  The rest of the game is fairly tame, although if you let yourself get impatient or careless you will likely end up dying.  Save often.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nI feel a bit torn regarding the visuals of this game.  The cut scenes use a great mix of 3-D and anime style graphics and are usually gorgeous to look at.  The hand drawn character art used during dialogue is on par with many other games, although the character designs feel a bit stale, like you\u2019ve seen them all used before.  The sprites for the characters have an odd, compressed feel to them, looking more like dwarves than the anime style drawings used outside of gameplay.  The game also uses an odd semi-locked camera at three-quarter view, but the level designs do a good job accounting for this.\n\nThe music in this game is phenomenal, playing on both the classical and rock aspects of traditional game music to keep every fight intense.  One thing that struck me was the lack of voice acting in the game, which I feel could have done a lot to enhance the overall experience of the game, especially during some of the longer cut scenes that can break the momentum of the game.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nWithout a doubt, the star of Ys Origin is the boss fight experience.  Every boss fight seems bigger and more epic than the last, and each one requires better timing and more complex movement to follow its pattern.  Off hand, I really enjoyed the giant centipede boss, Nygtilger, playing as Yunica.  It wasn\u2019t necessarily the hardest boss, but the amount of movement and explosions, coupled with the amount of time you spend climbing on it made it a really fun experience.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have as many exploration or story elements as many other games of this genre, Ys Origin\u2019s saving grace are its gameplay and music.  Each character has a very different feeling to its playthrough, including some alteration of the level design and especially the bosses, greatly increasing the playtime on this game.  With scalable difficulty and already difficult bosses, it can also prove a suitable challenge for players seeking it, or to encourage subsequent playthroughs.  Personally, while I enjoyed the game, I am glad I picked it up while it was on sale.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I would wait for the next Steam sale to roll around to pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1385653711, "timestamp_updated": 1385653711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682211", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7805519": {"recommendationid": "7805519", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962325027", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447215656}, "language": "english", "review": "Hack and slash console game.

E3 is in full swing, with publishers announcing their latest and greatest titles. However quite frankly I'm finding myself distracted from all the excitement. Why, do you ask? It's because I have found my personal Game of The Year, and I don't think anything else that could come out right now could possibly top it. You can take your Diablos, your Modern Warfares, your Max Paynes, and you can file them all away for some other time and place. I'm too busy saving the ancient land of Ys from demonic hordes hellbent on the destruction of humanity!\n\nIt has been a mere three months since XSEED made their Steam debut with the smash hit Ys: The Oath in Felghana. In that short time their crack squad of programming gurus and translation wizards have been working overtime to bring us more Ys goodness, and this time they've takes us back to the beginning with Ys Origin. This entry in the series is actually a prequel, taking place 700 years before the events of the first Ys games. This of course means that Adol Christin has to sit this round out, however do not despair! This time around we have THREE playable characters to fill out the roster, and each of them brings their own story and unique gameplay style to the table.\n\nIf you have played a Ys game before (and I'm sure you have) then you should feel right at home with Yunica Tovah, our first playable character. She's a tough but compassionate young girl who has dedicated her life to protecting the goddesses. Do not underestimate her abilities because although she cannot use magic, she can swing around a massive battle axe as if it were a feather duster. Players new to the series should start with Yunica, as she is very easy to handle in combat. Once players feel comfortable they can tackle Hugo Fact, a magic user who plays out like a bullet hell shooter. The third (and secret) character will unlock once you finish the game as either Yunica or Hugo, and suffice it to say he's only for experienced players.\n\nOf course it would not be an Ys game if it didn't have big badass boss fights, and Ys Origin delivers in spades! As usual each boss has it's weak point and a pattern that you can exploit, and half the fun is figuring out how! Unlike other games that have impossibly punishing bosses, in Ys Origin if you're dying frequently you can simply level up and try again. Also be sure to check out the upgrade menu at save points, though they may seem minor, the right enhancement can save your life. Also be on the lookout for rare cleria ore, as it can be used to temper your weapons.\n\nThe music and graphics are of course as stunning as you would expect from a series of such a high caliber as Ys. From the stirring violin strains of the opening theme which give way to choral chants and guitar riffs, you can guess from just that track alone that the soundtrack is something special. And it truly is, with a wildly diverse soundscape of orchestral music inlaid with the finest hair metal that Falcom Sound Team J.D.K. has to offer. Just ad rich are the gorgeously rendered 3d backgrounds and lush sprites that make up the visuals.\n\nAfter you finish the main quest in Ys Origin there's still plenty to do. A host of unlockables including Time Attack, Boss Rush, and Arena modes round out the package, offering hours of gameplay beyond the main story. If you yearn for an epic story with brutal bosses, complex character development, and a truly hardcore soundtrack, look no further than Ys Origin.

Ys Origins feels a lot more like a very fast legend of Zelda title mixed with a dungeon crawler, as in you navaigate dungeons while solving puzzles and killing a lot of enemy demons rather than a Final Fantasy type game with it's turn based battle mechanics. The game consists of three characters Yunica, Hugo and Toal, the game must be completed once to unlock Toal.\n\nThe three characters have very different distinct play styles and abilities which really makes the game feel fresh even though you are revisiting the same areas each time, also each time you will see a different side to an interesting story. The entireity of the game is spent climbing a tower, with your surroundings, traps and enemies varying from floor to floor.  You will solve puzzles while fighting hundreds of demons which will give you experience to level up to get stronger and sp to enhance other abilities. \n\nAlong with the three characters the game also contains a time trial mode that times your climb of the tower and an arena mode which you fight waves of monsters increasing the replay value, which you can unlock other versions of the three characters and the main character from the other Ys games.\n\nEnemies are very varied, but every few floors you will face a gigantic boss, the boss's are very challenging needing different tactics each time and extremely rewarding when you finally finish it off. \n\nI really enjoyed playing it as all three characters and will be purchasing the other ys games on steam and reviewing those too. \n\nPros\n- Nice graphics feeling retro and new at the same time\n- Interesting storyline and characters\n- Lots of replay value\n- Fun gameplay\n- Very action packed\n- Amazing boss fights\n\nCons\n- No world map, entirely in the tower\n- The inside of the tower barely changes for each character\n- Some of the steam achievements didnt seem to unlock although im sure I met the criteria\n\nOverall Score\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1385405604, "timestamp_updated": 1385407597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7655246": {"recommendationid": "7655246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075125142", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414849423}, "language": "english", "review": "Phenomenal Action-RPG!

It was cheap in a Steam Sale, and I thought 'Hey why not - lol backlog'. However, times are a changing, and it's no longer about buffing that backlog game count, but actually PLAYING GAMES. \n\nYes, playing games. On steam.\n\nSo, having finally gotten around to playing this game (thanks to Steam Roulette), I have to say I'm genuinly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's a simple RPG/Adventure game, with some very basic yet effective hack'n'slash mechanics. While it would be wrong to say it's similar to Devil May Cry in the way that the combat is simple, but at the same time a little frantic, it does help paint a similar picture. \n\nThe most rewarding part of the entire experience are the Boss Battles. They're old school - patterns & phase based, rather than just being normal mobs with a crazy amount of HP, dealing insane damage. Nope, no spank'n'tank here - these bosses have patterns of attacks, and phase of attacks based on their HP. Classic. \nThey're frustrating to the point of fanfare when you finally take them down, which is great. \n\nGames tend to skip over the challenge and frustration these days, which means gamers miss out on learning, resilience and fist pumping when they finally topple the twat that's blocked their way for the last hour. This game doesn't deny you that pleasure. \nI feel like I'm not really doing the game justice - if you're still unsure there are 10/11 youtube videos linked to my Steam Account of my playthrough, so you could always check those out too. \n\nUltimately, give it a go and you might surprise yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1381527600, "timestamp_updated": 1385411778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601388", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7346451": {"recommendationid": "7346451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043377913", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1384793924}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic game.

In 2006 a prequel to the first two games in the series was made called \"Ys Origin\" it  allowed you to play as three different characters with three different playstyles and abilities. You got to move around a strategize how you were going to attack your foes with melee or magic spells in nicely done varied areas such as a water and fire sections. The game has some platforming and slight puzzle sections at times too which is a nice change of pace. Falcom here again did a nice OST to listen too while your killing those bosses or even when jumping from area to area or running down hallways killing everything in sight.

At first, the level designs and monsters were fairly basic, but this is not so much of an issue as you progress higher up the tower.  The amount of variety in the demon designs and floor designs later on isn't spectacular, but keep in mind this is all going on inside of a tower.  The bosses--I would say--are the only exception.  The level and skill system revolve around finding new equipment and gems.  Although simple in design, there is just enough variety to keep you interested.  The story itself is alright (at least to the point where I am at...), and the characters aren't too bad.  You won't be interacting with them too much anyway.  In order to improve your character's own abilities and the abilities of some of your weapons and other equipment, the game allows players to cash in the SP dropped by defeated demons.  This SP is cashed in at the game's Goddess statues, which also serve as save points.  Generally, the distance between these save points is just the \"right\" distance.  If you don't know what difficulty to play at, I would recommend the \"normal\" difficulty setting.  Normal might seem too easy at first, but the game becomes significantly harder later on.  However, action RPG veterans will likely want to bump up the difficulty a notch or two.

The story is your standard \"bad guys did something bad; now the good guys better do something about it\" fare, so it won't carry anything on its own (not to mention it only shows up for a few minutes of exposition every hour or so).

Can't beat a boss? Grind some levels, because a single level's worth of stats will make an enormous difference in the damage you deal/take. Two levels will change a fight from brutally hard to a pushover (although that's more \"return of the 90s\" than \"when free-to-play games attack\"). There are a bunch of bonus game modes you can unlock and extra characters and alternate character versions with different attacks and all sorts of stuff like that, but they require beating the entire story mode so many times (and weirdly, most of the achievement requirements are also \"beat the game multiple times\") that I'm guessing at least 90% of people will never even see things like arena mode. I know I certainly won't, even though I'd try it out if it were available immediately after having beaten the game the first time.

Dove almeno personalmente il difetto \u00e8 uno solo, il leveling alla lunga pu\u00f2 diventare ripetitivo e frustante. Per il resto \u00e8 solo un continuo salire. Pi\u00f9 prosegui nella trama e pi\u00f9 ne rimani coinvolto. E soprattutto, molto intelligente la scelta di farti scegliere prima di iniziare il gioco con quale personaggio preferisci iniziare. Non solo non cambiano alcuni dialoghi, ma una volta finito il gioco, ti d\u00e0 perfino la possibilit\u00e0 di giocare col cattivo di turno e vedersi l'intera storia nella sua prospettiva. E inoltre ogni personaggio ha le proprie abilit\u00e0 ben diversificate, ogni stile di combattimento \u00e8 diverso, invogliandoti a rigiocare il gioco e affrontare i boss in una maniera completamente diversa. Inoltre i vari personaggi sono tutti caratterizzati bene, nessuno \u00e8 banale, e tutti hanno il proprio bel background, infatti il gioco presenta alcuni flashback e alcuni dialoghi un po' lunghi, ma non pesanti, tutti utili al fine della storia. Inoltre altro punto fondamentale di questo gioco. L'OST. L'OST \u00e8 composta solo da tracce memorabili, dalla prima fino all'ultima, infatti mi ha invogliato a procurarmela e di inserirla nel mio telefono il prima possibile. Come gameplay, \u00e8 un mix di Platform/RPG/Hack and Slash. Tutto confezionato in un modo ottimale, un gameplay abbastanza semplice per\u00f2 efficacie, che rende il titolo mai noioso e sempre giocabile. Soprattutto rigiocabile grazie alle abilit\u00e0 diverse dei vari protagonisti che si vuol scegliere prima della fine del gioco. E poi i boss. I boss sono tutti diversi, tutti difficili, dove c'\u00e8 bisogno di fare attenzione che anche la minima cazzata vi pu\u00f2 compromettere l'intero combattimento. Infatti mi \u00e8 capitato di morire assieme al boss, e di fare vari ragequit, ma una volta battuti, vi verr\u00e0 voglia di stappare lo spumante. Infine \u00e8 un gioco che non mi sentirei a consigliare a tutti, perch\u00e9 la trama \u00e8 fin troppo \"giapponese\" e quindi per qualcuno pu\u00f2 far storcere il naso. Si parla di Dee, maghi, cavalieri sacri e quant'altro, magie demoniache e robe cos\u00ec. E si perde in qualche momento che per alcuni non potranno risultare emozionanti per niente. Per\u00f2 dall'altro canto se non vi potr\u00e0 piacere per la trama, di sicuro vi piacer\u00e0 per il gameplay.

I didn't really know what to expect when I started playing it but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The combat is solid and the graphics are charming.  Although you aren't given free reign to upgrade your character like a Western ARPG you level up as you kill monsters which strengthens your stats and you also gain SP by killing monsters which you can use to purchase upgrades for your character to increase passive stats such as Mana Cost for spells. Grinding is also well done in this game, if you kill the monsters as you advance through the game your character will be strong enough to defeat the bosses; however, if you're having trouble with a particular enemy you can grind up to increase your stats if you wish. Speaking of bosses, it was the best part about the game. The boss fights are well designed, challenging, but also fair. It's kind of a \"find the pattern\" type of deal, but there's a lot of skill involved in defeating the many bosses in the game. It had a Demon's Souls type of feel for the boss battles but the rest of the game had a Zelda-esque feel to it. The bosses were so fun I thought to myself while playing, \"it would be awesome if this game had a boss rush mode.\" Little did I know, it does! It unlocks after you beat the game.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the game a lot, it did have a few problems. The game is linear, with you having to find a key or item to get to the next area and there isn't an open world as you're just going up a tower. That's not to say the environments aren't varied, as they are, it just means there isn't much exploring to do. There's also a bit too much backtracking for my taste, but it wasn't too excessive. The music is pretty low quality and repetative and the control settings aren't adjustable in-game (you have to use a separately loaded launcher) so if you don't have your controller settings set properly you have to exit the entire game to get it right; other than that the controller support in the game is quite good. \n\nThere are three playable characters (one of which is unlockable), each of which gives you a different point of view on the narrative. The unlockable character is actually a demon as well, so you get the antagonist's point of view on the story which I found quite cool. The story itself is rather tropey, but still was a little more adult than other JRPGs I have played (it has swear words and death) which I enjoyed. The game loads and exits in a snap, which is also a plus.\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay\nStoryline (multiple perspectives)\n3 Characters that play quite differently\n\"Grinding\" done well for a JRPG\nBoss Fights\nUnlockables and Bonus Modes (with leaderboard support!)\nExcellent Replayability\n\nCons:\n\nMusic/Audio\nBacktracking\nLinearity\n\nI really enjoyed this Japanese take on the ARPG genre. If you enjoy killer boss fights I'd recommend it for you. There's also a boss rush mode which is amazing for this game and many other unlockables to keep your interest in the game after you've beaten it. The three available characters all play differently and show you a different perspective on the events of the story and I'm really looking forward to coming back and playing this game again once I've finished the other games in my collection. There are a few negative aspects of Ys Origin (I really disliked the audio engineering) but they don't overbearingly detract from the fun I had with this game. A-\n\nNOTE: I did play Ys Oath in Felghana and I have to say I wasn't as impressed with that game as I was with this one.  The boss battles weren't as epic, grinding felt more necessary, the music was better (but still repetetive), and basically everything that was good about that game is in Origin, but there's a lot missing.  The protagonist is also silent (which hasn't been cool since Freeman did it), and there's only one playable character.  I would NOT recommend Oath, but Origin is great.  If you want more of the same gameplay, play the other characters on Origin - skip Oath unless you REALLY love the series.", "timestamp_created": 1364092874, "timestamp_updated": 1364092874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562500", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2650863": {"recommendationid": "2650863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010507014", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478690425}, "language": "english", "review": "Outside of some irritatingly lengthy dialogue and some repetitive interior design, this game, like the rest of the series, is fucking awesome.

There are 3 different playable characters with their own playstyles and multiple difficulties to choose from. The basic \"grinding\" and leveling system is fun and addictive. You'll just want to keep slaying enemies after another, before your accumulating +exp, +str and +mana regen meters run off. The levels have puzzles and ofc treasures aswell, so it's not all brainless grinding (though you still can't turn your brain off while leveling, it's easy to die to normal mobs unless you pay attention). The level designs are nice aswell, there's enough to explore and it's not linear at all.\n\nBut the best part of Ys: Origin are the hard boss battles. (If you're experienced in this kind of genre, I recommend either Hard or Nightmare difficulty to make the best out of the fights) The boss tactics are quite varied, though many resembled me of Touhou games, just in 3D. In other words there's quite a lot of projectiles to avoid, and you can't take too many hits. The fights usually take some time to learn to execute good enough, but beating the boss in the end is a great feeling.\n\nThe story isn't anything fancy unfortunately, so better not get your hopes up on that. Music on the otherhand is great, not the best of the best among the J-RPG composers, but still great. I love those upbeat tunes that play during the boss battles, they make the fights feel even more epic!\n\nThe graphics are really outdated, since the orginal game was released in 2006.

The final entry in the \"Napishtim/Felghana trilogy\", Origin takes place 700 years before the first Ys game, giving us a much broader history of the setting of the first two games.\n\nInstead of our usual red-haired swordsman, Origin starts giving players the choice between two characters. Yunica Tovah is the granddaughter of one of the six priests of Ys and fights with an axe -- she plays similarly to Adol. Then there's Hugo Fact -- the son of another priest -- who fights with magic, flanked by two orbs that multiply his attacks: the \"Eyes of Fact\", a family keepsake. Both characters were sent down as part of a search party to the surface from the floating continent of Ys after the two goddesses, Feena and Reah, go missing one day. Unfortunately, they're attacked and separated by a mysterious attack, falling unconscious as they fall to the surface. There, they find Darm Tower, a gigantic ziggurat seemingly built by the monsters that have taken over the land. Informed that the goddesses were seen entering the structure by the twin Roda Trees, our heroes set off on a journey to find the missing goddesses and find out what purpose Darm Tower serves.\n\nSince Felghana refined the gameplay to perfection, Origin doesn't really change much in terms of the game's engine. The entire game takes place within Darm Tower, essentially cutting out the game's overworld segments. However, the settings in the Tower itself are pretty diverse, ranging from a desert with slippery gold floors, a volcano and even an underwater segment -- significantly more extravagant than it was in the original Ys. A lot of the bosses from the first game (and one from the second) return, somewhat reimagined in a much more epic state.\n\nThe graphics are much like the two previous games, but I still think Origin is gorgeous for a budget PC game from 2006. XSEED did increase the game's resolution size and added widescreen support, but that's the most that they changed. Much of Origin's soundtrack consists of both original songs and rearrangements of music from the first two Ys games.\n\nOrigin definitely shines when in comes to extras. After completing the game with either character, a third character is unlocked, but I'll keep their identity a mystery.  There's also the standard boss rush, as well as Arena Mode, which pits players against 6 waves of enemies. SP can be earned in this game, which can be used to buy additional content, including Adol (only playable in the bonus modes) and extra versions of each character.\n\nIt's hard for me to recommend Origin as a first Ys game, simply because a lot of the game's storyline and setting depend on knowledge of the first two Ys games. While these are available on Steam (as Ys I & II Chronicles+), they don't play anything like any of the other games present on modern PCs. Origin is still a great game without the context, but somehow I feel like knowing about the references made in the earlier version makes the game feel more complete.", "timestamp_created": 1517727800, "timestamp_updated": 1517727800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39785861": {"recommendationid": "39785861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440309009", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 164, "last_played": 1521352341}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Endless Tower with Storymode\", if you have to discribe Ys Origin as short as possible.\n\nAs always Nihon Falcom and XSeed deliver as expected, another challenging game.\n\n[u]Nightmare[/u]\nAmazing mode for gamer, who is looking for hardcore gameplay, insane challenges and to show off own skills.

It even uses the same engine as said games.\n\nOne of my most favorite things with The Legend of Heros is the great story and writing. In terms of story and characters, this game is a complete 180. \n\nThe main character, (there are 2 initially to chose from), in my case Yunica, has very little past and even less personality. She's forgettable and dull in almost all aspects. You can say the same for all the characters. Although most of the time you have no idea whom anyone is or why you should care.\n\nThe story is your standard there are some bad guys, doing bad things, and well, let's kick their butt. Well, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, but you are a girl on a mission.\n\nThe game mechanics revolve around a hack and slash style game. The mechanics are simple enough that anyone can wrap their heads around it. Perfectly fine to play on any game controller as well.\n\nThere is enough variety in the game to keep it interesting for the 11 or so hours it will take you to clear. You basically slash your way through an area. You find new armor, weapons, items as you wander. Occasionally you upgrade your weapons, skills, and armor. At the end of an area, you fight a boss. Lather rinse, and repeat.\n\nThe bosses have a fair variety of them. Most of them are not that difficult, but I did count 2 or 3 that might take you a couple tries to clear. The last few are shockingly easy.\n\nIf I have any major complaints there are a few areas of the game where you can get stuck looking for things. This could be a key, or you almost instantly die in an area, or can't figure out how to advance the story. If you cut these areas out there is probably less than 10 hours on a play-through.\n\nOverall it's OK as a mindless hack and slash game to blow a few hours with. If you are looking for any kind of story, look elsewhere.

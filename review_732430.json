It captures the feel of \"falling with style\" quite well and the maps are usually great and not buggy. \nHowever there is one annoying problem that other games like this one also suffer from. A problem that will mostly effect casual players that pay $3 and expect just a relaxing, distracting game.\n\nAfter you become half decent (about 5 minutes of play will get you there), the game becomes waaay too long. For a casual and relaxing game to have \"runs\", the runs need to be short (10 minutes tops). However you can really just go on and on forever. There is no real change in difficulty and the only challenge comes from how daring and greedy you get with combos. That means unless you like to constantly crash into things every minute, the game becomes way too easy and boring.\n\nIt's a problem worth not recommending over because games like Superflight need to be short, sweet and relaxing. Not long, boring and repetitive.\n\nIt really is unfortunate that I feel the need to make this review since I would have expected other reviews to mention this problem. But nope, it's all praise and regurgitating the game's steam description -_-\nI realise that writing a negative review on a game with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating is probably futile, but just in case someone reads this it might be worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: seeing how the dev's are actually responding to some reviews, I guess all I could recommend is something to spice up the gameplay and difficulty (preferably optional). \n\nLike for example some maps give more points but are windier or have lesser/greater gravity. Another idea is if some of the maps generated could have goals of some kind (outside of points). Like say you could try to figure out how to get to the center and when you do you teleport with a permanent  x1.5 multiplier. Off the top of my head the only other idea I have is seeing a ghost of yourself from a previous run fly with you. It could be cool since if you use the same routes enough it might look like you are a flock of birds or something. It wouldn't make the game more difficult but it would add another element to the replayability.\n\nI honestly can't really think of a good solution since anything too crazy could be asking too much for a game that is so cheap and only developed by a few people.", "timestamp_created": 1514703278, "timestamp_updated": 1514703307, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545791", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38890844": {"recommendationid": "38890844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013660776", "num_games_owned": 778, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "last_played": 1514702119}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple.

I mean there are some other similar games but they  doesnt give the same good feeling when playing this. The game is relaxing and difficult , and even frustrating at some points. But the frustration is gone in an instant as you start a new game. Physics works great never had a problem at all. Now i see alot of people complaining that its imposible too use a keyboard. But i can tell you right now that it isnt at all.\nIts really down too personal preference. Thats what i like. That you can change up controls and try something new.\nThe brilliant part of this game is the seed function. Put in a series of numbers or words and a new level generates. Amazing how i played this for hours on hours end never got bored. This game is art. This game will be praised by many.\n\n\nGood job devs.  I want too say thank you for this amazing game you have made. Its really something you just want too play after a stressing work day and just feel relaxed. Only thing is that this game doesnt have music. I was kinda dissapointed put youtube is your friend. Maybe put on some zen music  if you want too relax, or some Trap music if you want too do sick stunts.

The objective is to get the highest score and to do that you need to fly close to walls & objects as long as you can to build speed and a score combo/multiplier. As it tracks your highscore you can climb the online leaderboards and earn achievements. There's no music but that's okay, it's better if you put on your own anyway.\n\n If I had to nitpick or complain about it, the list would be small. It lacks a first person view mode and lacks accessibility when it comes to choosing which analog stick to use. The Dev should definitley include those options. Even a VR mode for those who want it would be welcome.\n\nNot much else to it. As the description says it's simplistic and can be intense or relaxing depending on how you wanna fly through the maps.

After hearing heaps of praise for the game, and seeing the minimal entry fee, I decided to pick it up. I died. And then I started over, dying again, and again, but learning from my mistakes. As I hit the achievement for dying 300 times in a span of roughly 80 minutes, not once did I regret any of those 300 retries. It is a game where you perfect a line, gliding through tunnels and avoiding crashing and racking up a score that puts your friends to shame.\n\nI anticipate that the game will continue to be supported and hopefully have little updates here and there, but honestly even at $3 normally, this game is well worth it.

You fly around, preferably as close to objects as possible, and you rack up points. It is very reminiscint of the \"oncoming\" bonus from Burnout where you'd rack up extra boost for driving against traffic and between cars.  Despite the mechanics themselves, Superflight is a very relaxing game. While there's a ranking system of sorts and you can compete for high scores, the game doesn't particularly force that aspect on you; the gameplay truly seems to have its focus set on the freedom of flight. Sometimes a game is best defined by what it doesn't have, and minimalism can really bring out the simple beauty of a game or its mechanics; I think this perfectly describes Superflight. \n\nThe sound design for the game is great. My only gripe is that the score sound can be a bit grating, but you can turn it off if you like. There is no music, but the sound of the wind I found very relaxing, actually. \n\nThe controls are a bit flighty, no pun intended. There's a certain floatiness to them, especially on keyboard. I haven't yet tried the game using a controller, however, though that may improve the experience somewhat. Despite this, you can still find yourself pulling off some really neat maneuvers and the game genuinely feels good. \n\nProcedural generation works pretty well for the level design here, and you can \"create\" your own levels by entering a seed to use for generation. Maps can also be saved so you can later revisit levels that you'd like to play on again. There appears to be quite a bit of variation in the levels; some with large pillars and small pathways, others with small thin floating walls with holes in the center. It's easy to change maps too, as the game will instantly transport you to the next map if you get to the bottom of the current one, or if you enter a portal.

Each \"level\" is unique, generated from a random seed, and there are multiple portals strewn throughout each level to take you further. Sometimes you're faced with thin, snowy towering pillars, other times primary-colored floating \"mountains\" with tiny tunnels carved throughout. There's no way to know where the next portal will bring you, and I still get surprised by some of the different environments I see.\n\nAnd on the topic of visuals, the minimalist graphics fit the concept perfectly - there's the expected motion blur, AA, and post effects, but they're kept to an appropriate level. It's like Katamari and Journey had a baby that grew up playing Minecraft.\nI did encounter some slowdowns when entering new worlds after playing for a while, but I'm not sure if it's a system issue or the game itself - and it would clear up after a short while of flying around.\n\nThe ability to generate your own levels based on seeds is a nice touch; try your name, your phone number, etc, and see what kind of world appears as a result. \"superflight\" gave a nice challenge, and \"Zen\" was decidedly un-zenlike.\n\nWhile the time to 100% is short (I was able to do it in about 2 hours), the real enjoyment comes from just playing the game. Whether you want to go for the highest score among your friends, or turn on Zen mode and just glide, Superflight is the perfect antidote to overburdened AAA games flooding the market nowadays.", "timestamp_created": 1513621098, "timestamp_updated": 1513621098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38403932": {"recommendationid": "38403932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057221241", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 424, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1513619209}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1513619232, "timestamp_updated": 1513619232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38400899": {"recommendationid": "38400899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309928385", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 123, "last_played": 1514741561}, "language": "russian", "review": "I \u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c", "timestamp_created": 1513609679, "timestamp_updated": 1513609679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38399899": {"recommendationid": "38399899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294000414", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1514579057}, "language": "italian", "review": "[h1]PREFAZIONE[/h1]\nPrendete Steep.

through\n- Score system + leaderboards\n- Easy to learn, difficult to master\n\n[h1]Room for improvement:[/h1]\n- levels generate entries and tunnels with dead ends. There is often no way to know when flying in.\n\n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\nSuperflight is a delightfully simple concept, and I like it.\nYou control a character with a wingsuit and you fly through strange surreal landscapes which are randomly generated.\nIt seems deceptively easy, but make no mistake, this game goes fast and you will crash... a lot.\nYou will not find a story here, nor an enemy, or worlds filled with quests and collectables. There is however a scoring system based on the stunts you perform, and a leaderboard. The more dangerous your stunts, the more points you score.\n\n[h1]My experience:[/h1]\nI found that the more I practiced, the more fun I was having. As I soared through the mountains and did one ridiculous stunt after the other I experienced a nice flow. And adrenaline as well! There is something about soaring through a small hole in a mountain at incredible speed and suddenly having to make a sharp turn because of a wall you did not see and then nailing that move.\n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1]\nThis is made possible because the controls are very good. To be fair, I noticed that I was a lot more accurate using a controller as it allows you to make smaller changes as opposed to the keyboard (and no mouse support as far as I know).\n\n[h1]Dead ends:[/h1]\nThere is one gripe I would like to share. As said, the levels are randomly generated. Which means one world may not be as nice to fly through as another. What I found particularly unfair is that if you see an interesting spot to fly inside a mountain it could easily be that it is actually a dead end which means you crash and lose all points. Yes, there must be a sense of danger and risk involved, but if you go for a high score this demotivates from flying dangerously.\n\n[h1]Technicalities:[/h1]\nTechnically the game ran perfectly fine. No loading times, not even between worlds. Controller support worked well, even though steam warns that the game is not optimized for it. I also played via Steam Link, also no problems.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nYou get a great game for a low price which is fun to boot up every once in a while. Easy to learn, difficult to master. Consider this a nice break from the more complex games out there and just enjoy your flight.\n", "timestamp_created": 1513463763, "timestamp_updated": 1513463763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38361898": {"recommendationid": "38361898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127216963", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 311, "last_played": 1514422017}, "language": "english", "review": "Now having only played this game for a total of 45 minutes so far, I can safely say that: if you're like me, someone who's always wanted a really good flight/gliding simulator, this is the game for you.

There is no end to how long you can go at this and thus (if you're willing to grind for like an hour) you can break one million points pretty easily and get absurdly high on the leaderboard with no real skill or effort.

There were no crazy boss fights, no tutorials to hold my hand, no sneaky agonizing puzzles or ridiculous AI chats, I was just a little wingsuit person floating around these crazy structures and if I managed to survive, I got points. The game only demands that you fly around, nothing else. If you fly really close to a structure, you get points. If you fly through a structure (some have arches, loops, holes in the walls, crevices etc) you get points. At first the controls are on default so you crash into everything and hate yourself, but after adjusting the sensitivity of each control (WASD only) you find that it's really easy to maneuver and go wherever you need to go. The game gives you 24 achievements you can unlock, and I don't know what it's like for other people, but my very first time running the game I was so excited to accomplish my first achievement that I sat myself down for five straight hours unlocking as much as I could. When you do crash into things, and you WILL crash into things, your score pops up along with your high score and your highest combo score and your world ranking.

It's basically a game where you glide through a world of obsticles playing it as safe or a dangerous as you want- with more points being awarded to you for risky moves. You end up crashing a lot, which is fun, but it only takes half a second before you're back in the air to try again, and the more you do it, the better you get.\n\nOne of the aspects of the game that I really appreciate is that it has no music, just nice sound effects. So I typically load up some songs on youtube that I want to listen to and let it play in the background as I play the game- that works very well. The game also only requires one hand to play- so it's easy to just sit back, rest one hand on the arrow pads, and play like that- and there's never really a need to use the other hand. \n\nI've also tried this game using the Occulus Rift. I don't think it's made for this, but if you use something like Virtual Desktop, it will allow you to open and play the game in Virtual Desktop, and then you just enlarge the screen area in the VR until it's all you can see. Since the action in the game is almost always in the middle of the screen, this works well with VR- though it's still not as fully as immersive as if it was 360 degree. \n\nSo if you're thinking about this game, definitely get it- it's fun and relaxing, and a great thing to do if you just want to chill and listen to some music in the background.", "timestamp_created": 1513040965, "timestamp_updated": 1513040965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38245849": {"recommendationid": "38245849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357704747", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1514437852}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game to play when bored 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1513036959, "timestamp_updated": 1513036959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38242491": {"recommendationid": "38242491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010058829", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2936, "last_played": 1513820316}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and simple gameplay.

It's a great way to get your mind free and escape into a wonderful, endless world where your dreams of becoming a bird, spreading your wings and gliding away can finally come true. I have never played a game that delivers the sensation of flying so well as Superfly does.\nI have absolutely nothing bad to say about the game. The worlds look gorgeous and mysterious, the animations are fluid and the controls are very responsive. You have a lot of options to play around with to tailor your experience and make the game suit your playstyle and hardware. Also: The price is more than fair!\n\nThere are still a few things I would like to see in the future:\n\n-Character models (maybe unlockables after reaching a certain score) that are a little more aerodynamic. Maybe even an editor, where you can pick colors, hats, trails or wingsuits.\n-A coop mode, where you can glide along with your friends (optionally with and without collision).\n-A little more freedom when it comes to movement. Barrel rolls (maybe by pressing Q and E), holding your character sideways at the cost of dropping quicker (could be realized by repeatidly tapping Q or E), the ability to fly loopings and combine them with the before mentioned barrel rolls.\n-The camera is a little shaky at times, which really doesn't play well with my motion sickness. It would be great if one could turn off the camera shake, especially when flying close to objects and it starts to count the score.\n\nObviously you can not expect the developer to update the game, as it doesn't sit at a high price point nor is it declared as early access, beta or alpha. Still, I would love to see some features added in the future to keep the game a little more interesting and engaging.

Also it seems to save levels even if you don't request it to which is kind of annoying because then you have to go in and delete them and constantly clean up the save map area.\n\nThe other thing I wish there was is a new world button or option in the pause menu to save time.\n\nOther than that, this is absolutely amazing.

I don't mind paying \u00a32.09 for a simplistic game because it puts money in the pocket of indie developers who may one day produce an awesome game because of the money they raised with this game.\n\nThe game isn't going to win awards in the graphics department, but the graphics are fine for this type of game.

Nice touch, but it seems like it is \"comparing apples to oranges\". If I have a map that is really easy to navigate and someone else has a difficult map, his/her score of 10000 is well-earned while mine is not. If there isn't a way to turn the global ranking off, I would suggest this would be a nice feature.\n\nMy wishlist has two items:\n\n1) The ability to do a loop-the-loop.

GrizzlyGames managed to polish this concept and develop a timeless and well functioning game that can be played over and over again. Superflight combines intuitive controls with the power of procedurally generated levels.\nMany indie games I've come across lately suffer from some kind of childhood diseases: Either they're repetitive, buggy, not intuitive or boring. Superflight however is the perfect match - it feels sleek, fast paced and all in all just well thought-out.\n\n[b]What I Really Liked:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]very intuitive controls and physics\n    [*]pleasing art-sytle, modern but yet timeless\n    [*]procedurally genereated levels for endless fun\n    [*]bug-free experience, it just works\n    [*]good performance\n[/list]\n\n[b]A Big Plus:[/b]\nThe game features some very well made achievements which are demanding but manageable to get.\n\n[b]My Conclusion:[/b]\nSuperflight is a fun game and an excellent example of pure gameplay - no clutter.

Right from the start I was hooked. The controls are easy to pick up and the infinitly unique maps can really start to make you lose track of time. The scoring system is rewarding and the things you discover within each map are exciting and often challenging. You can even create your own map by typing in phrases, words, and gibberish (typing as many capital A's as possible creates a pretty sick looking map).\n\nAll of that being said, there is so much more that can be done with the game. Zen mode is alright, map creation is often humorous, and the leaderboards for largest scoring run/ combo and highest overall score can certainly push you to the limits of your competitive nature. But thats it. Nothing else has been added and I know that after a certain amount of time it will start to feel repetitive (I'm already sort of at this point), which is why I'm hoping that the development team will take as many steps forward as they can starting with different game modes. A couple of ideas my friend and I had in mind are as follows: \n\n1. Trailing or being able to follow a Bot or a Friends run through a set map with varying difficulty.\n2. Some sort of obstacle course where you have to fly through set checkpoints until you reach the end (again with scaling difficulty).\n3. Multiplayer/ Online play would be awesome specifically for races (maybe with special powerups to help or deter your opponents?) but I realize that takes some time to work out.\n\nAt the moment, the game feels limited, so much more could be added to SuperFlight and I hope that certain things will be added in the coming months. I would still recommend this game because even in its very early stages, the mechanics and physics are sound and I havent encountered a single bug or glitch. Its a great time waster and an essential addition to your steam library.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511681087, "timestamp_updated": 1511681087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37630491": {"recommendationid": "37630491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008320655", "num_games_owned": 1178, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512975312}, "language": "english", "review": "So simple, so profound!\nThis may be, hands down one of the best values on steam... its certainly one of the best experiences you can have with a controller (and I include Mr. Massagy).\n\nThe sense of speed you feel winging through these narrow slots, using the currents to propel you onward...

You can take it at your own pace, find the parts of the game you enjoy and just play. There is no combat, alien invasions or zombies. Your goal is to just fly. How and where is up to you.\n\nIt is a third person flight simulator with randomly generated maps. Each map is a 3D island full of holes, passages and cliff faces for you to fly along, under, in and through. You want to go at speed, just look down and plummet away. This can make your suit a little unresponsive though - gravity and aerodynamics are like that... You want to chill, enter 'Zen mode' and glide along. You can reset any map whenever you choose, change maps or save them for replaying/sharing (plenty of interesting ones suggested in the forums). Really basic in terms of refined graphics, audio, etc. Really well developed in terms of gameplay important matter, like physics and responsive controls.\n\nPositive:\n[list]\n[*] Smooth gamplay that can played at your own pace.\n[*] The level generator is spot on. \n[*] Controls are easy to use.\n[*] The physics system is well developed.\n[*] Achievements are easily obtained and fun to try for.\n[/list]\nNegative:\n[list]\n[*] Some players may dislike the lack of direction in game.\n[/list]\nConclusion:\n\nKnow what you are getting here.

It is a small game but still, developers are hardworking and responsive. \n\nPlay your favorite music playlist in the background, and just fly for hours. While flying, rest your mind and even think deeply about anything you want. Escape from reality! :)\n\nLastly, Superflight might sound like a relaxing game like walking simulators from my review. However, It can be very challenging at times, especially if you are trying to achieve high combos. The difficulty purely depends on your play star.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1511550277, "timestamp_updated": 1511550277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37396537": {"recommendationid": "37396537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048472784", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512865712}, "language": "english", "review": "A relaxing game.", "timestamp_created": 1511549733, "timestamp_updated": 1511549733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37390581": {"recommendationid": "37390581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003585956", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511546221}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely breathtaking game.

I only intended to play it for 5-10 minutes to try it out.  The game is incredibly simple.  The graphics are earthy toned geometric blocks.  Your man in a wingsuit is made of blocks.  The map is made of blocks.  When you crash - and you will crash - you explode into all of your little blocks.\n\nThe entirety of the game boils down to a score attack.  There's no time limit.  There's no metric that dictates how aggressive or how careful you have to be.  I already find myself being aggressive earlier in runs, then being more selective with my angles as I realize I'm approaching my high score... and then aggressive again when I feel like I'm running out of focus (It's easy to forget to blink) to try and land a big combo or two before I disintegrate into a rock wall.\n\nAs best I can tell, a round can go on forever.  You start off in an area descending towards a random collection of walls, plateaus, tunnels and ledges.  As you descend further and further (it is a wingsuit game, you can't just fly at top speed in any direction like Superman) eventually you will start to see portals (pink blocks swirling around together) and/or start to blackout as you descend to the bottom of the map.  If you take the portal, you gain 1000 points and fall into a new area.  If you simply blackout, you continue into another area at the same angle and velocity you left the last area with.\n\nThe game rewards you with more points, higher multipliers and aggression bonuses depending upon your risk-taking.  Flying really close to a wall for 10 seconds might net you 1500 points if you're very snug.  In comparison, shooting for a wingsuit-tiny vertical gap at high speed with walls on every side might net you 15000 or more if you make it.  You can score in giant, satisfying bunches or slow, calculated manuevers.\n\nWhen you crash - again, you will crash - you are presented with your final score for the flight, your top score of all time (along with that score's world ranking) and your top combo of all time (along with a ranking, again).\n\nIt is simple.  It is beautiful.  You can play this game like a Red Bull athlete with a deathwish, shooting for every tiny gap you can find, blind to what is on the other side.  You can play this game with a relaxed attitude, floating here and there, always staying in your comfort zone, making a flight last - well - probably as long as you wanted to.\n\nThis game accomplishes exactly what it was designed to accomplish and comes from a team of three people.  It is easily worth the full $3 dollar price-tag.  In half an hour, it has made me smile, laugh and gasp.

And it's an excellent experience of getting closer to flying with its tight controls and colorful worlds full of wondrous shapes,  Frankly, I can also get a little closer to the very real possiblity of falling and crashing and dying without really having to fly.\n\nIf you don't just want to relax, you can also play for glory: namely, for the highest score. I'm usually not a fan of highscore-driven games. Achievements motivate me more than online leaderboards. But getting a nice long combo on Superflight is motivating, because of the multiplyier the game offers. Seeing the numbers go up continously is just so addicting. And finding a map you can train on, one that compliments your own flight style, is just so, so rewarding.\n\nThe only thing the game is missing is a soundtrack, which doesn't really bother me, because I like to listen to my own music during the game.

A largely relaxing experience gliding around giant coloured monoliths. It's an unapologetically casual game for when you are looking for a bit of quick escapism without much thought required in a break between sessions of Path of Exile or just before bed.\n\nScoring is based on how close you can fly to the monoliths and for how long you can maintain that without crashing. Extra points are awarded for proximity to monoliths on more than one side. For example, flying through a tight valley might give you 2x points while flying through a small tunnel might give you 4x points for proximity on 4 sides. (These multipliers are arbitrary, I have no idea of the actual math here.)\n\nYou\u2019re not forced to fly close to anything either. If you\u2019ve just been though an intense tunnel experience you can simply glide outside the range of anything risky for a bit until you compose yourself again for your next daredevil stunt. Or you can glide from one map to the next and enjoy the view if that\u2019s your thing.\n\nStill, the scoring mechanism adds some interest and I suspect that for most players the game would get old pretty quickly without it. Scoring also gives you some incentive to return to revisit your previous best and to push your luck enough that you\u2019re probably going to die sooner rather than later, and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nIs it a well done game?

But with higher production values and more interesting physics within. The procedural level generation is topnotch for a game of this type, the controls are good, decent learning curve and plenty of opportunity for some crazy flying and true mastery. It reminds me of AaaaAaAa for the Awesome, another wingsuit high speed indie game, which already was a great game using a similar concept... except this game just goes on and on and on forever with new levels every transition (either through a portal with a 1000 point bonus or by falling 'through the ground' at which point a new level appears), which is superb. Of course, when you die, you restart in the last world that was generated. \nFor it's price this game is going to be excellent bang for the buck. Even if you only play one hour, this game has the potential to lure you back in, keep you hooked for months trying to beat the online leadboards. IF you get a kick out of high speed games in general, moving just right, past deep pillars, through tight corridors, following down breathtaking depths like the many wingsuit daredevil videos you can find on the YouTubes, then this game is totally for you!! \nHonestly, I kind of wish this game had a tricks system of some sort or more opportunity for bonus scores. I mean it might feel out of place for a game this abstract or stylised, but it could be a neat way of creating much longer combos. At the moment we're kind of dependent on what the procedural level generation provides us with (most notably passing through the tightest corridors seems to provide the highest bonus scores). \nIf there's one critique possible for a game of this type, it is how sometimes lining up for a perfect soar through a window shape rock gives you more points, than pulling of that crazy turn and recovery, steering away from the rocks in the nick of time, whilst also continuing your run downwards at very high speeds. I think a reasonable argument can be made the scoring system for 'tricky manouvres' could have been taking more advanced flying into account.\nEither way, this game is an easy 9.5 out 10.

The three students who made this deserve all the praise they've been getting.\n\nMuch like Dejoban's \"AaAaAA!!! \u2013 A Reckless Disregard for Gravity\" series, this is a \"falling simulator,\" where you have a limited availability to navigate around things in your path, you get points for doing this by getting particularly close to things, and bonuses for navigating particularly tricky gaps and running up points continually for period of time.\n\nUnlike AaAaAA!!, there are no cheering/booing fans, there aren't glowing bonuses scattered everywhere or on particularly challenging paths, the levels weren't exactly 'designed' by anyone (although you can play any level you like over and over), and you never have to land. There's also no music but the wind, you're more gliding than falling, and you could potentially play one single game forever without dying and without seeing the same level twice. You can also turn on \"Zen mode,\" which turns off the point indicators, so you can just soar around and fall without pressure.\n\nEach level has a randomly chosen \"seed\" of characters to \"name\" the level, and that seed is used by the game's algorithm to generate the level. Any specific seed will generate the same level each time, so can also use this seed to share levels with people, or create your own by entering a name, birthday, mashing on the keyboard, whatever.

There are no bad guys, evil creatures, or even a story (though one wouldn't be hard-pressed to come up with some sort of lofty analogy to describe on Polygon for back-patting fun); it's just a boxy sort of creature weaving around, over, under and through surreal landscapes as it fights the ever-constant pull of gravity.\n\nThe joy of the game, then, is in its precise controls and the sheer thrill of threading the proverbial needle as you navigate the twists and turns of rocky crevices, looking for that perfect score run or simply just looking to survive as long as you can.  On the surface, the quest of getting useless points and seeing where you rank with every other yahoo that's been playing Superflight seems a little lacklustre, but once the game gets moving (and it takes seconds to get going), you begin to understand just how GrizzlyGames beaded in on a very singular focus and made it exhilirating to play.  The boxy-looking thing (seriously, it's not a guy) moves exactly as you think it ought to and that's what makes Superflight an instant hit.  The folks at Grizzly knew exactly what they wanted to do and executed it almost flawlessly.\n\nStarting high above a randomly-generated environment which is typically rocky and scraggly (craggly? jagged?), you navigate your winged creature with just the stick.  There's no propulsion so you are at the mercy of gravity and physics and it feels oh-so-good.  The ultimate goal of the game is simply to score as many points as you can as you make your descent and cash them in before you face-plant into a rocky wall.  You do this by flying as close as you possibly can to the landscape - a vertical playground of crevices, nooks, crannies, and holes - and the longer you can keep doing it, the bigger the combo you an create.  Special moves like skimming a wall to the point of making the character model go berserk or just squeezing through a very tight space or a hole nets you big point bonuses.  Any time you catch some free air away from the structure, the points cash in and you're free to start another combo.  Obviously you want to maintain the longest combo you can, but get too greedy and you'll fly right into an inescapable cave and your score will amount to nothing.  If you manage to make it to the bottom, you can either aim yourself through a portal to get to a new world for a few points or simply dive into the mists and achieve the same result (no score bonus here).  That's it.\n\nWhat Superflight really excels at is risk-reward.  Few things are as satisfying as committing to a blind crevice at an insane dive and somehow making it out of there without a scratch.  You can just as easily spiral around the outside of the landscape, but it's boring and you'll score very little.  At first, it can be tempting to simply do that if only because you'll find your life expectancy much greater, but inevitably, those teeny tiny gaps are going to call out to you and you're going to grow a pair and go for it (I'm talking about the game here).  After a rocky start (*snort*), soon enough you'll be threading the needle and just taking stupid risks just for the hell of it.  With the sound design blowing the wind and the camera shaking as you gain speed, there's a nice visceral tangibility to the whole experience.\n\nAs far as frustration goes, it mostly stems from the level generator.  No matter what the map is, there's a certain visual language that you'll come to understand in that there are certain queues which the generator is prone to putting into the map that say things like \"there's a crevice here,\" or \"there's a hole here\".  Or at least that's what it would be, but there's a small chance that it's a complete and total lie.  I've ruined a few good runs flying right into a spot that should have had an exit, but didn't, where had it been a human hand crafting that space, it's certain there would have been one.  It makes taking those risky dives or turns even moreso because there's just no guarantee that there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  The other thing that happens quite a bit, though it has been dialed back in a few patches (still present as of this writing) is when you enter a new map via portal or falling through the bottom and you're basically careening into a wall or a flat plain.  There's nothing you can do at that point.  Crash and burn, Mav.  Crash and burn.\n\nAll that being said, Superflight is a game that gives you what you put into it.  It can be a relaxing gliding sim or it can be a vicious adrenaline trigger.  It can be a pleasant distraction or an addicting obsession.  It can be both.  However you approach it, you probably can't say that you haven't spent more on worse.

I wish so much that there was a VR mode as it seems like it would be a perfect fit.\n\nI have been playing this game in Virtual Desktop on an Oculus Rift. Pair that with some relaxing music and this becomes a true assult on your senses. When you pull off a big combo it feels a little like the old days of Tony Hawks, only distilled down to something even more pure.\n\nOnly cons are...\n- No VR support, but that obviously affects very few people anyway\n- Lack of ingame soundtrack - But hey it's easy to play your own\n\nCould be improved with...\n- Multiplayer hot-seat mode... Where you all fly the same seris of 4-5 maps and battle for the highest score. This would work oer the internet too. This game feels so good that I just want all my friends to experience it too.\n\nBottom line...\nBuy it now, it would be a steal at 4x its current price.

In short, I want a more seamless experience.\n\nNevertheless, I recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1510864595, "timestamp_updated": 1510864595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36558357": {"recommendationid": "36558357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043348130", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511897097}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, easy, good little timewaster :)", "timestamp_created": 1510864543, "timestamp_updated": 1510864543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36558347": {"recommendationid": "36558347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056733882", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511215735}, "language": "english", "review": "No need to spend RL money to buy loot boxes.

It's very easy on the eyes, though there are levels generated that have awful colors (bright green & pinkish-purple for example, the kind of crap colors you'd see in really old games).\n\nSound is okay. There's no music at all which is a bummer. The only bad part is the sound made when your earning points as it gets annoying really quick, though you can either turn off the sound or switch to zen mode which turns off the point display and sound, though you still earn them. \n\nThis is a great game, more than worth the asking price. Que up some easy-listening tunes, and you've got gold.\n\nOverall, an 8.5/10 and easily a contender for being the best indie GOTY.", "timestamp_created": 1510817502, "timestamp_updated": 1510817502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36546183": {"recommendationid": "36546183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089314595", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513073596}, "language": "english", "review": "Spellbinding.

I originally thought I'd give it a quick try and just refund it if it was awful - but it's definitely not.\n\nIt is very simple in concept. You are a blocky character in a wingsuit, and you appear in the air above procedurally generated blocky floating islands. You rack up a score by flying dangerously and not crashing. That's about the extent of it.\n\nWhat that doesn't tell you is that it's oddly relaxing. It shouldn't be. It should be frustrating as hell, and exactly the sort of game that I hate... but it isn't. It's one of those games you can turn off your upper-brain for and play on instinct.\n\nIt's not perfect, but for the price, it's well worth a try if you're even remotely thinking about it. A controller is recommended, but not required. I found the game much more enjoyable with one.\n\nSome of the flaws... well, the graphics are pretty blocky. That's fine, as it's part of the art style - but some more variation would be nice. It's also often hard to figure out how close you are to a wall. You do get a shadow, but you don't get any indication for horizontal closeness. Diffuse shadows to either side could potentially help here without breaking anything.\n\nThe maps themselves are a bit hit and miss. They're procedural, after all. Your score can skyrocket based on the random map you happen to get, or you could splat into the ground the instant you spawn into a new one. (Rare, but it has happened).\n\nBut, flaws aside, it's a great - and fun - game, and definitely well worth the low price.", "timestamp_created": 1510727462, "timestamp_updated": 1510727462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36525719": {"recommendationid": "36525719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049937681", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510975042}, "language": "english", "review": "Woosh...\n\nI'm a plane.", "timestamp_created": 1510725853, "timestamp_updated": 1510725853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36525698": {"recommendationid": "36525698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087338186", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510727838}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, got it on sale for less than $3.

It's possible to save your favourite maps aswell and load them later.\nShort video of the game itself:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1201315722", "timestamp_created": 1510699758, "timestamp_updated": 1511382278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36520575": {"recommendationid": "36520575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071235217", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511268602}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the best flowing games ever. an incredible feeling of freedom and control when playing and it really challenges your ability to adjust and react quickly with the procedurally genrated maps.

I'm notorious for getting bored easily but they've done a splendid job with the procedural generation and physics engine meaning it is always different and I can enjoy wooshing through brand new maps at break-neck speed.\n\nIt is a warmly recommended impulse buy which is worth much more than it is priced for. You should get it no matter what!\n\n---\n\nI'd like to offer players some tips I'd like to think help enhance your gameplay experience even further:\n\n- Play with a controller. \nWhen I switched to a controller I was able to make more fine adjustments which of course helps tremendously with getting points (and with frustration).\n\n- Turn off audio for scoring points.\nThe experience gets a lot more \"zen\" without the sound of racking up points all the time. Unless you play on actual Zen mode where there are no points, but I still recommend turning off the score sound.\n\n- Play some appropriate music in the background.\nFeeding off my point above, when there are no distracting sounds apart from the wind and effects then you should improve your experience by playing some great music in the background. Think the soundtrack from the scene in Avatar when Jake flies for the first time. I recommend the YouTube video \"3-Hours Epic Music Mix | MOST BEAUTIFUL MUSIC - Best Of Collection -\" by Pandora Journey which I feel fits perfectly with this game.\n\n- Play it safe!\nIt might not be as fun, but it is helpful to know that you can get a lot of points just flying close-ish to walls and staying there as your multiplier goes up. Key is actually knowing when to -not- take risks. Thread those holes if you feel sure you can, if you're at the right angle and speed etc, not just because there is a narrow opening that can give you a lot of points.\n\nAnother helpful tip: Unless you know the map, DON'T try to fly into caves and holes that you can't see a bright white light through. If the light is dim there is a risk you'll find yourself in a dead end and lose your run!

You score points by flying close to walls, shooting through gaps, chasms, and loops, etc. One touch of anything means death and restarting (a very painless process; one button press and you're right back into it, or linger to watch your flight path replay in reverse). \n\nControls are best by analogue stick for this. \n\nCons: There's some quality of life options I'd like, like the option to change the sound of the scoring. I ended up just turning that sound right off. I also find it a little aggravating that there's no centered reticle on the screen to show exactly where you're aiming (although momentum plays a role in your path, so perhaps that would just serve to confuse?). The graphics are simple and I could do with more variety, but I'm sure that can come in time.\n\nPros: It's simple and perfect. Go fly your wingsuit through procedural worlds.

It doesn't take long for you to master them - or at least not be awful.\n2) The procedural worlds are colorful \"sky formations\" - usually mountains, but at times spires, islands, platforms, and more.  There's enough variable generation to surprise you as you fly about.\n3) A simple scoring mechanism lets you challenge yourself - mostly the closer you fly to something the longer more points (even more in tunnels)\n4) Random generation and saveable maps let you save wondrous places with your friends.\n5) You can play in a short burst or loose yourself for an hour.\n\nSuperflight is pretty much a must-buy if you want a relaxing casual actioner.  You can't go wrong with the price to get something so well-made.  Best of all ints incredibly accessible - almost anyone could enjoy this.\n\nAlso?  Great gift.

It's simple, yet addictive. Within 2 minutes of gameplay, I was hooked. This is meant to be a casual game, again, so eventually, I'll be playing this game in short bursts, but that is the point. It's an escape from other power-hungry, AAA-titled games that demand a lot of energy from you. The art style is great, it reminds me of the style used in Sumotori Dreams. Simple, but very fitting, since I consider this an \"art\" game. \n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n\n[*][b][u]The gameplay:[/u][/b] It's simple. You fly around the landscape and get points by flying close to the walls as possible. But, this will prove addictive. You'll say \"Huh, that's it? Pretty easy.\" Well, you'll get to the point where you'll keep restarting, but this time you're not raging. It's not a game you could rage to, and that's the beauty of it. It's such a relaxing game, but it still gets you straight up on the chair, as you tighten your butt trying to go through so many crevices. It is engaging, it is relaxing, it is plain fun. You can also create your own maps (though, I think the system simply conjures one up for you), and save maps you think you had a jolly good time in.  \n\n[*][b][u]The visuals:[/u][/b] I like how abstract enough the game is made to look to give off the laid-back feel to it. It's easy on the eyes, nothing flashy, it's very simple, but the particle system, ambience, the colour palette used to fit the theme of the game worked so well with the idea of the game, you'll eventually want to occasionally fly around just to admire the landscapes.\n\n[*][b][u]The controls:[/u][/b] The controls are extremely simple. You use WASD to manoeuvre in the air. Controller support is excellent, I had no issues with it. I played a lot better with the controller, since using the keys will pitch the character to 100%, while pushing the left stick on my PS4 controller according to just how much I really want to makes it easier for me to direct my character in an efficient manner. What I noticed though, is that pressing the confirm button with the controller when highlighting the \"Quit\" option brings you back into the game. It could be a glitch. Hopefully, this gets addressed soon. Not a problem for me, though, it's very minor.\n[/list]   \n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n\n[*][b][u]The soundtrack:[/u][/b] It's not that what you hear in the game that is bad... it's the lack of it. When I read \"This game doesn\u2019t have:\", I went through the list to see \"A Soundtrack\" as one of the listed items. I was somewhat disappointed. For a game like this, a slow soundtrack would work so beautifully. I mean, it doesn't [b]have[/b] to have it, but I like to imagine something upbeat and artsy playing as you soar through the skies.\n\nThis point is not necessarily a con either, given how the game's ambience is meant to calm you more than give you a brilliant auditory and visual experience. But still... it would be really nice to have it. I guess I'll just Shift+Tab and use YouTube in the background...\n[/list]\n\n[h1]My Personal Suggestions:[/h1]\n[list]\n\n[*][b][u]First Person Switchability:[/u][/b] Now hear me out. Imagine flying around in first person. Not a lot of us have the luxury to go wingsuit flying. And since the game is powered by Unity, adding an FPS camera is easy! If not, then I hope this game has community content for mods, and a modder would make it possible.\n\n[*][b][u]One More Mode?:[/u][/b] So far, there's only Zen Mode. Good thing, too, looking at the score can be annoying, since it'll keep you engaged all the time. But, what if we add a mode with loops to pass through as you fly around? That would add a tiny bit of a challenge.\n\n[*][b][u]Mouse Control:[/u][/b] Now this is possibly a lot harder to implement, but I feel I could play the game with a LOT more control if I was using my mouse to fly, instead of a keyboard. It'll be like flight stick or something. \n\n[*][b][u]Steam Trading Cards:[/u][/b] . . . Please? :3 \n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\n\nIndie Game of the Year 2017. I'm calling it. \n\nI've always wanted a game like this. And finally, that prayer has been answered. There's no game like this. And the best part is that this was made with just three dudes. I salute you guys. I can imagine just how much work would've gone into something as small as this. It's not easy. And the price tag, wow, really cheap. Maybe it should never be on sale, the asking price itself is the biggest discount ever! The game is unique. And that's more than enough of a word for someone to convince themselves to buy this game. \n\nAnd the proudest moment they must share is that this is their first game. What other indie game company has produced a game with such mastery? Just a handful. The numbers are definitely growing. But, it's still a handful. What [b][i]Superflight[/i][/b] achieves is that it literally stands out as this curious, serene little experience.

First, it would require me to climb a mountain, or jump out of a plane, two things that I don\u2019t plan on doing anytime soon, if at all. Second, I\u2019m certain that as soon as I take flight, my body would involuntarily seize up, and I would just Frisbee into the side of the mountain, spewing vomit the whole way. Third, it would require me to go outside for an extended period of time, and hahahahaha.\n\nSo instead, my pale, but perfectly-safe, butt gets to experience wingsuit flying via video entertainment. Namely, through Superflight, a new indie game from GrizzlyGames.\n\nThe premise is simple: players take control of a little figure who appears to be made out of cardboard. It\u2019s exactly as I imagine I\u2019d look if someone gave me a moving box and said, \u201cHere Tom, now go fly.\u201d This is about how I\u2019d end up looking:\n\nAnd then I would die.\n\nMy time playing Superflight was half spent saying, \u201cOoooh, neat!\u201d at the colorful landscapes I flew through, and half spent saying, \u201cOoooh, shit!\u201d at the colorful landscapes I flew into.\n\nIt\u2019s okay though, dying in Superflight is no big deal; players who crash lose whatever point combo-chain they had and their remaining point score is tallied on a personal and global ranking. Points are easily acquired by flying close to the landscapes, or through the little caverns and holes that are usually scattered throughout every zone. Each zone takes the form of a floating landmass, and the player is dropped near the top. If the player flies below the floating landmass, they\u2019re transported to another zone where the descent continues. There are even warp portals that players can fly through to instantly be transferred to a new zone and pick up some bonus points for doing so.\n\nZones are procedurally-generated and players can generate and save their own maps to share with friends. For example, if you type EpicBrew into the seed generator, you\u2019ll get a blindingly pink map. Pro tip: there is a hole straight down from the start of the map that leads right through to the bottom, so you can escape before your retinas burn out.\n\nFor under $3, I did not expect Superflight to bring much to the table. What you see in the video is what you get. The sound design is a bit rough around the edges, \u2014quieting the wind whistling noise was a necessity\u2014 and a nice ambient soundtrack would have been nice, but then again, Superflight is a $3 game. Adding a custom soundtrack or a sound designer would bump that price up by a handful of dollars. An excessive cost when Spotify fixes the problem just fine.\n\nI found that playing Superflight with a controller (I used a USB Xbox 360 controller and it worked flawlessly) feels so much better than using the keyboard. For whatever reason, the mouse is not used, so flying is controlled with the WASD keys, which felt clunky. The joystick on the controller felt so much smoother, and I could even recline back in my chair as I flew my little cardboard Iron Man into another mountainside.\n\n\n[[RECOMMENDED]] Superflight is a fun, affordable game that perfectly fits into a quiet evening.\n\n\nThis review originally appeared on epicbrew.net.\nA Steam copy of this game was purchased by Epic Brew for the purpose of this review.", "timestamp_created": 1510422778, "timestamp_updated": 1510422976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36449402": {"recommendationid": "36449402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043567666", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511103762}, "language": "english", "review": "You are a flying cardboard man who smashes into walls. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1510422368, "timestamp_updated": 1510422368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36449226": {"recommendationid": "36449226", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997810842", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510479733}, "language": "english", "review": "Superflight is a good casual game and I imagine it would be a lot of fun playing it with friends on a big TV.

Relaxed gliding around the edge of the maps will almost certainly allow you to continue onto the next map, whereas daredevil flying through narrow twisty canyons eventually leads to a sudden and messy end.\n\nThere are a few problems with it at time of writing. Sometimes the invisible out of bounds areas are too close to the edge of the random map, forcing you into a cliff face without warning.

This game was [b]originally[/b] made as a school project but the developers seemed to love this game so much that they put it on steam for a cheap price, and I am so glad they did. Do / Did you enjoy the Just Cause 3 Wingsuit experience? If you did, SuperFlight is for you.\n\nSuperFlight is a Wing-suit simulator where you are supposed to get the highest score possible to have a ranking of #1. Unfortunately, It isn't all that easy. To gain points, you must do dangerous stunts for a long time (i.e Flying really close to a ceiling, ground or walls). This can be very difficult to some as you have to survive at least 1 second after the stunt for the score to save. If you crash, you lose all the points you had then and you die. It's that simple.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and it's completely worth playing. There are multiple randomly generated maps to play. You can even put in a random seed and it will give you a new never-seen-before map. Each map contains multiple portals too so you do not have to stick to one map until you die. When you go through a portal, a brand new map spawns and you get +1000 points added to your score. The more portals you go through, the higher your score goes. There is also a lot of competition in this game, ranking wise. This means that it will take a lot of effort to get Ranking #1. So far, my high score is 11,000 in a gameplay space of 5 minutes and the ranking for that is #1800. \n\nIt is def. worth replaying too. The game offers hours of content as you can play over 1,000 randomly generated map so you do not have to stick with one map. The replayability feature makes this game really fun. \n\nIt is also amazingly optimised for a game made by students. I can run this game at 180fps on 1080p, AMD R7, Intel i3-6100. I did have to turn down the Anti-aliasing to AAx2 but it is still great. I'm sure it is even optimised enough for Toshiba, Lenovo Laptops! \n\nOverall, It is worth the buy, especially as the price is extremely low. It is worth grabbing completely! Hopefully they may be able to make multiplayer one day!

Bem, nem sempre[/h1]\nA proposta do jogo \u00e9 simples, \u00e9 direto ao ponto: voe com sua wingsuit e seja livre. Mas o que a princ\u00edpio parece ser um jogo relaxante em que voc\u00ea se sente solto em mar de possibilidades, pode acabar virando mais um \"Super Meat Boy\", em que voc\u00ea morre in\u00fameras vezes e fica refazendo alguma manobra ou percurso que voc\u00ea pensou at\u00e9 conseguir complet\u00e1-lo. As possibilidades s\u00e3o infinitas e as formas de jogar ainda mais. Sim, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel jogar de forma descontra\u00edda sem levar tudo muito a s\u00e9rio, mas o jogo fica muito mais cativante quando voc\u00ea entra na brincadeira e se desafia a ir cada vez mais longe.\n\n[h1]O jogo em si[/h1]\nSuperflight n\u00e3o \u00e9 complexo, possui gr\u00e1ficos legais, mas nem um pouco detalhados. O que, na minha opini\u00e3o, acrescenta muito a din\u00e2mica do jogo \u00e9 o formato de mundos gerados com seeds. A cada vez que se entra em um portal, ou voc\u00ea segue em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao horizonte, voc\u00ea \u00e9 transportado a um mapa completamente diferente, com cores diferentes, estruturas diferentes e formatos novos. Para mim este \u00e9 o ponto forte do jogo, o motivo de manter o jogador entretido por mais do que 10 minutos dentro dele, gera a curiosidade do jogador sobre o que vir\u00e1 a seguir e o que posso fazer neste novo cen\u00e1rio. \nA jogabilidade tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bem fluida e os comandos bem intuitivos, o que pode causar um pouco de dificuldade no in\u00edcio, mas rapidamente voc\u00ea ser\u00e1 capaz de dominar a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e planejar suas manobras mirabolantes. \n\n\n[b]Na minha vis\u00e3o n\u00e3o h\u00e1 pontos negativos a se destacar no jogo, ele \u00e9 simples mas se prende e cumpre muito bem a sua proposta. A dura\u00e7\u00e3o ir\u00e1 variar de acordo com a vontade de cada um, mas para um jogo t\u00e3o barato, n\u00e3o vejo como isto pode se tornar uma m\u00e1 compra para algu\u00e9m.

Es ist wunderbar minimalistisch und die Spieleidee ist super! F\u00fcr nur 3 Euro ist es unglaublich was man hier geboten bekommt.. Man kann das game immer weiterspielen, denn die Welten werden generiert, daher gibt es quasi unendlich Welten/Level \u00e4hnlich wie bei Minecraft. (Welten Seeds sind ebenfalls eingeb/ausles-bar. Die Welten sind relativ abwechselungsreich und wirklich sch\u00f6n gestaltet, und es macht Spa\u00df sie zu durchfliegen. Es l\u00e4uft wunderbar fl\u00fcssig und bugfrei auf meinem low end PC (1Gb Grafikkarte, 8gb ram, i5 2500k...) und das auf DREI 1080p Monitoren per Eyefinity. Dazu ist es auch nahezu perfekt f\u00fcr drei Monitore geeignet, legedlich das Men\u00fc/Einstellungen sind nicht vollst\u00e4ndig lesbar/nutzbar. Es geht in dem Spiel darum so nah wie m\u00f6glich an und durch Objekte/Die Welten durchzufliegen und dabei so viele Punkte wie m\u00f6glich zu erreichen. Je n\u00e4her man an Dingen vorbei fliegt, oder je enger die Objekte sind durch die man durchfliegt/umso knapper eine Kollision ist, desto mehr Punkte bekommt man. Das sorgt dann des \u00f6fteren auch f\u00fcr einen kleinen Kick^^ Nat\u00fcrlich kann man auch einfach so rumfliegen und dabei gut entspannen..(Bin mir aber nicht sicher ob man die Punkte-Sounds deaktivieren kann) Ich lege jedem Spieler ans Herz, dieses Spiel mit einem Controller/Gamepad zu spielen (Ich nutze daf\u00fcr den Xbox One Controller), denn damit funktioniert es auf jeden Fall pr\u00e4ziser als mit den Pfeiltasten. Ich kann aber keine Angaben dazu geben ob andere Gamepads, oder NVidia Surround bei diesem Spiel funktioniert (Ich sch\u00e4tze aber mal es sollte funktionieren) Ich finde es sch\u00f6n zu sehen, wie ein relativ kleines Entwickler-Team hier so ein sch\u00f6nes spiel abliefern kann..

You get quite a kick out of travelling through a tiny crevice at great speeds or just seeing how close to the wall of a mountain you can get without crashing.\n-There is also Zen Mode (which you can activate in options) in which you do not accumulate points and just wonder through the maps to relax\n-Simple robust shapes and vibrant colours add a great atmosphere to the game, making it aesthetically pleasing to look at\n-Easy to get into and play, with simple controls and basic mechanics, but this is perfectly executed\n-It has Steam Achievements. They aren't too hard to get, will take you about 3-5 hours to 100% the game\n\nCons:\n-None.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best and most relaxing games I have played for its rather small price tag.

Denn auch hier zeigt sich wieder einmal, das ein simples Spielprinzip nicht unbedingt ein schlechtes Spiel bedeuten mu\u00df.\n\nWas ist Superflight?\n\nSuperflight stellt sich als arcadelastiges Wingsuit Spiel dar. Ihr seht euren Konterfei in der Third-Person-Perspektive und steuert diesen zwischen anmutenden Felsenschluchten und H\u00f6hlen hindurch um Punkte zu generieren. Diese werden dann in eine Weltrangliste eingetragen. Der Flug wird erst dann beendet, wenn ihr an einer Wand zerschellt. Abst\u00fcrzen k\u00f6nnt ihr nur dann, wenn ihr gerade durch eine H\u00f6hle fliegt und nicht mehr gen\u00fcgend Auftriebsschwung habt. Ausserhalb der Felsengebilde gibt es keinen Boden. Erreicht ihr die Nebelbank unterhalb der Felsenformation, spawnt ihr automatisch in einem neu generierten Level und setzt euren Flug fort. Zwischen den Felsen verbergen sich hier und da auch lilafarbene Portale. Fliegt man in diese hinein,dann startet man direkt in einer neuen Welt.\nFalls euch mal langweilig ist,dann kann man auch per Tastatureingabe krytische Buchstaben und Zahlenkombis eingeben um sich daraus selbst Level generieren zu lassen. Diese k\u00f6nnen dann auch, wenn sie euch besonders gut gefallen, abgespeichert und wiedergespielt werden.F\u00fcr Abwechslung ist also gesorgt.\nDie Grafik ist Zweckdienlich, aber auch nicht unbedingt h\u00e4sslich. Einzig und allein h\u00e4tte die Spielfigur ein paar mehr Polygone vertragen k\u00f6nnen.\nDie Steuerung geht mit einem XBox360 Gamepad locker fluffig von der Hand.\nAlles in allem kann man hier wirklich nicht meckern. Das Spiel macht wirklich eine Menge Spa\u00df und l\u00e4dt immer wieder f\u00fcr ein Spiel zwischendurch ein.\nKlare Kaufempfehlung von meiner Seite her.", "timestamp_created": 1515227448, "timestamp_updated": 1515227448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585890", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39110303": {"recommendationid": "39110303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160822770", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1515225431}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really satisfrying.", "timestamp_created": 1515225681, "timestamp_updated": 1515225681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39110048": {"recommendationid": "39110048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064312736", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516193071}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e35\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e44\u0e27\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e06\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e47\u0e07\u0e46 \u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e49\u0e32\u0e17\u0e32\u0e22\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e08\u0e30\u0e21\u0e35\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e23\u0e39\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e08\u0e30\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 \u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e15\u0e32\u0e22\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e15\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e01 \u0e08\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e01\u0e47\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e36\u0e01\u0e1f\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e04\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e04\u0e30\u0e41\u0e19\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e19\u0e35\u0e48 \u0e04\u0e34\u0e14\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e0755555", "timestamp_created": 1515224865, "timestamp_updated": 1515224865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39109373": {"recommendationid": "39109373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080384500", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515891095}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic Game for it's price.\n\nPros ------------\n- Great Controls\n- Lots of maps(their randomly generated)\n- Tons of fun\n- Good sound effects\n\nCons ----------\n- Hard to get used to controls", "timestamp_created": 1515222700, "timestamp_updated": 1515222700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39108637": {"recommendationid": "39108637", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998963615", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1515220232}, "language": "english", "review": "Tough but fair.

Sale or not, I recommend purchasing it whenever you have an extra amount of cash remaining. I am not a fan of the whole \"block\" and procedurallly generated maps but Superflight is a game worth buying if even if not you're into atmospheric gliders full of repetition and fluidity. [b]Superflight does it different.[/b] The game is complimented by realistic wind and very easy controls and beautiful maps that will leave you wanting to more.[/i]With that, let's proceed with the Review.\n\n[list]\n [*]Superflight is a simple indie atmospheric game where you, the player, glides through procedurally generated maps or levels. You earn points gliding through holes, gliding at a daring space between the floor, walls or ceilings. You only \"die\" if you smack yourself to something. \n\n [*]Superflight has easy controls but the game itself is difficult at first. But as you slowly get into the game, you find yourself playing dozens of minutes before you realize you were actually playing within an hour already. \n\n [*]The game also realistic wind complimenting the difficulty even more.\n\n[*]The game is beautiful, really. Considering the fact that these are procedurally generated maps, every has a different kind of charm while still having the same aesthetic.\n\n[*]Speaking of maps, you can save maps you accidentally discovered and loved. \n\n[*]Portals in the game transport you to a different map. Simple feature but fun otherwise.\n\n [*]Feeling competitive? Well, the game also offers a scoreboard so you, the player, can figure out where you are standing globally.\n\n [*]That's about it. \n[/list]\n\n[i]Verdict with (more) Additional Notes: I admit that the game has more potential than many would realize. Heading onto the Suggestions/Discussion Thread, you can really see that the game can grow and develop more as a whole. But, considering the fact that the game is made by a small team and it was fairly recently made, they already made a game worth buying and playing. I would love to see what the small teams of devs can cook up into the future of Superflight. In this, I have hope considering the fact that the small community that makes of the game is active than you simply think. I absolutely see myself investing in the game since the potential of Superflight can only be seen if you play it. If you are not into these type of games, feel free to buy it during sale. With its decent price, the satisfaction of playing is worth more than the actual price. Superflight is worth giving a shot nevertheless.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1515130921, "timestamp_updated": 1515131081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39073584": {"recommendationid": "39073584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068222276", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 214, "last_played": 1515354244}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first review I have written in a while. \nI bought this game - full price, only \u00a32. \nPlain and simple, to the point, what you see is what you get. \nAlthough, I found the gameplay paired with the amazing audio to be very addictive. \nTook me however long is on my playtime to \"complete\" the game (unlocking all achievements).\nJust buy this game, I can see this game having hours of replay value, and for such a small price, you can't go wrong!

For fun.\n\n[h1]Look...[/h1]\nThe maps are pretty and they serve the main purpose of the game - relaxation - very well.\nWith procedural generation, they look different each time, even though they are built with the same components.\n\n[h1]... and Feel[/h1]\nIt's awesome! I've never had a chance to fly a real wingsuit, but this is exactly how I hope it would feel like.\nI've mostly played with a controller and it was great. I checked out keyboard too and it was good enough. Controller feels more natural, but if you prefer a keyboard, you'll be fine too.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThere's no music here, just the whooshing sound of air when you're flying. And the occasional crash noise.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere are two game modes. \nFirst one is competitive - you get points for flying close to structures. The closer you fly by, the more points you get. And you have to beat your high score.\nThe second one is called Zen - all the HUD notifications are disabled. You don't have to worry about points, multipliers or anything else. You just fly, enjoy the view and try to relax.\n\nOne feature worth mentioning here is the procedural generation. Yes, I've said it before, it's there. But the cool thing about it is that each map is generated based on a seed number. That means when you encounter a map that you like, you can save its seed and regenerate the same map whenever you want. Or you can share that seed with your friends or anyone else, so they can try to beat your score on the exact same map. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI've played this game for two hours and that was time well spent. \nBut I don't think I'm gonna be playing it much more than that.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- relaxing\n- pretty, procedurally generated maps\n- seed numbers, allowing to exchange maps with friends\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- no endgame\n- nothing to do after 2 hours\n\n\n\n[i]For more reviews, follow my Curator page[/i] - [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31210849-Sublime-Dent/]Sublime Dent[/url][/b].", "timestamp_created": 1515106951, "timestamp_updated": 1515168976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39065420": {"recommendationid": "39065420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120813983", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1514937644}, "language": "english", "review": "So much fun.

amount of speed and the fact that you crash so darn frequently even if you simply circle the outside of the maps. I have no problem with this being a stressfull game, it's actually super fun that way, but the video claims it can be relaxing so I just wanted to mention that at least in my opinion this is far from the case. Maybe if they added in a slow down button it could be more so. \n\nHaven't played the game for very long as of yet but it is incredibly fun and definitely worth the asking price. The random worlds are all really cool an unique and I love that you can save the ones you like really easily. A First Person Perspective would be really neat if the devs are listening. I'd also love it if they tracked how long a single flight lasts. You crash so damn often in this game, if you manage to stay in the air for more than 40 seconds it's pretty damn exciting and I'd be more interested in beating my last flight time than I am in the high score.

<>\n==============Pros================\n[u]Gameplay [/u]- Pretty simplistic but fun. Swooping around is so relaxing.\n[u]Design [/u]- The levels are always familiar yet distinct.\n[u]Graphics [/u]- Graphics are pretty simplistic too but charming. The levels look similar but a different coat of paint in every world makes for some pretty awesome scenery.\n[u]Sound Design [/u]- There isn't that much in terms of sound here, crashes, the portal sound as you glide from one world to another and the wind whirling as you build up speed. Normally minimal sound would be a negative but here I think it was intentional. The game is relaxing and its peaceful atmosphere benifits from not much sound. Plus if you play your own music it over (like I do), there won't be any clashes.\n==============Cons ================\n[u]Score System [/u]- I don't have many complaints but I think the scoring is a bit off. Sometimes you can pull off a really tight space or close call and get no points for it. It kind of discourages taking risks when there are no benifits, other than your own satifaction of course!\n===========Conclusion================\nWith a very modest 3 euro price tag, 1.50 on sale right now, this game is a steal. Honestly souring between cliffs while listening to Radiohead or David Bowie's 'Heroes' were some of my most memorable game moments this year. This is the antithesis to the AAA FPS game, this game's fun derives from its peaceful, soothing atmosphere and tight gameplay. As for the games longevity, although there isn't a tonne of variety here, I can see myself returning when I when to passively do something while I listen to a new album or when I just want to chill.\nPLAY THIS WITH RADIOHEAD'S 'IN RAINBOWS'.

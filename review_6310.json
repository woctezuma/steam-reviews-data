It is a gem hidden among many story telling games. the graphics are terrible and almost laughable. But at the time it was great to look at, just use a little imagination while playing this title. Also i recommend turning on anti aliasing since the game doesn't have one. DO NOT USE FXAA!!! it makes images flicker. only things like the characters will be smoothed out. That is if you want ot make it easier to look at. Last note the voice acting is at best under average. This was made in the late 90's. It isn't like it was today where it is more fluid.

On a surface it's a classic 90s point & click adventure with a significantly dated visuals. It is pain to run TLJ properly on modern systems, so you'll need to check some guides and do some modding to be able to play it. Gameplay-wise you'll encounter a lot of backtracking, rather slow pacing and some counter logical puzzles. The Longest Journey is not just a name of the game \u2013 it's really a long one. It took me 16 hours playing everything with a walkthrough. If you choose to play on your own you can easily make your journey 2-3X longer than mine. \n\nAfter all this you could wonder why it's worth playing in the first place? The thing is The Longest Journey is truly a gem in a lot of ways, if you can overcome its shortcomings. I was really surprised with quality of writing \u2013 choice of words, structure of sentences, rhythm \u2013 it's all absolutely great, and somewhat unexpected from non-native writer, but Ragnar Tornquist did an excellent job. Plot itself is a very beautiful fairy tale with well-crafted characters, witty jokes and beautiful, contrasting settings. Another exceptional part of this game is voice-acting. All the actors did great, but Sarah Hamilton, who voiced the protagonist, did something on entirely different level. It's really difficult for me to recall any other title which has voice-acting on par with this game, despite budgets in industry grew substantially in almost 20 years since release of TLJ. Honestly, it's worth playing just to hear beautiful voices reading beautifully written lines of text.\n\nIf you appreciate a good story and aren't afraid of huge amounts of text in your games, you absolutely should play The Longest Journey. I'm sure you'll fall in love with it. Just consider my advice and don't shy from using a walkthrough \u2013 don't let the sloppy parts of gameplay to halt you on one of the best journeys in the gaming.

La storia \u00e8 ambientata nel futuro e ruota attorno ad una ragazza di nome April Ryan, la quale scopre di avere il potere di viaggiare attraverso due mondi: Stark che rappresenta la terra dove regna la scienza (e dove vive April) e Arcadia, un mondo dove regna la magia. Il guardiano dell'equilibrio \u00e8 scomparso e a causa di questo la magia di Arcadia si sta riversando su Stark, rendendo l'equilibrio instabile. April dovr\u00e0 cercare di mettere le cose a posto e di ristabilire l'equilibrio. \n Il gioco \u00e8 un punta e clicca e c'\u00e8 da leggere... Molto. Oltretutto, i posti dove cercare e usare gli oggetti non sono scontati, bisogna avere un occhio di falco e mettere il puntatore ovunque per vedere quale interazioni possono esserci. Anche nei dialoghi bisogna parlare molto con gli altri personaggi per andare avanti, quindi \u00e8 importante esplorare tutte le risposte anche quelle non importanti (nel caso, saprete molto di pi\u00f9 sulla storia!). Cosa molto utile \u00e8 che tutti i dialoghi vengono trascritti nel diario di April, cos\u00ec se vi perdete qualcosa o vi dimenticate qualcosa aprite il diario e lo trovate l\u00e0 ;)\n Interessante anche lo spazio dei pensieri di April, dove potrete leggere tutti gli avvenimenti della ragazza prima dell'avventura (e quindi scoprire un po' i retroscena della protagonista).

I want to state that I am an avid and proud classic gamer.  I have an embarassing amount of classic gaming gear in my closet of shame, and I fully appreciate classic games of all genres.  I've played many classic point and click games, and I'm aware of how the genre has evolved over time.  That is why I was surprised at how disappointed I was with playing The Longest Journey for the first time in 2017.  \n\nThe game's dialog seemed forced - as in they literally force you to sit through all branches of the conversation tree (with ALL NPCs), and you better do it or you'll miss out on some info that lets you continue the adventure.  Seriously, there is so much exposition in this game, you'd think it was an exhibit at the 1999 World's Fair (if there was one).\n\nThe puzzles were either too easy or completely ridiculous.  You'll see other reviewers complain about the \"Rubber Ducky\" puzzle, and they should.  It was a masterpiece of communicating to me that this game hates me.\n\nThe voice acting might have been good for 1999, but now it is only passable on average and unbearable at times.  The guy who did the Slingblade impersonation made me think about switching to subtitles only!\n\nI didn't connect with April (the main character).  There was something about the character that just seemed too young and inexperienced to be relateable.  Then I found this wonderful review which helped me identify what my problem was: \n https://www.popmatters.com/193427-the-longest-journey-makes-clear-a-good-story-is-not-timeless-2495531946.html\n\nIn case you don't want to read that article, the basic idea is that games have gotten really good at being serious.  Mass Effect, Bioshock, Batman, Skyrim, The Witcher and a ton of Indy titles have accepted the challenge to deliver a compelling and inspirational story, but in 1999 that wasn't the case.  As a result, the almost self-mocking tone that TLJ takes comes off as overly apologetic and holds the player back from truly identifying with the characters.\n\nFinally, I literally fell asleep during every extended playing session with this game.  That is probably mostly my fault, but I just couldn't take it anymore and had to quit.  If the game still came on CDs, I think I would have made it to somewhere in disk 2, but that was enough for me.

No hints, tips, help, guides or advice of ANY kind can be found in the game, you are literally stuck trying to figure out the first of presumeably many puzzles in this so-called award-winning, critically acclaimed game...which it's not...in any way/shape/form and those defending this game are outright liars for not seeing it's flaws and mistakes.\n\nNow the music is good, the voiceover work is fantastic given back around 1999/2000 VO work was extremely rare in video games and almost never done, however the storyline/plot will leave you confused as hell and even on that 1st screen I have no idea what's going on. You have to redirect some waterfall to help a tree that in turn will save an egg for some giant phoenix type bird and I can only assume you get to move on from this, but my brain was hurting just trying to figure out how you re-direct the water with the stick you found. Cue the rage quit.\n\nNow you can argue this is only the start and yes that's true, however I watched some YT videos /wo spoilers and they do state the game has several puzzles that require logical thinking to solve, which is fine...IF the game had proven more helpful, but you get nothing, and bare in mind yes nowadays you can find the answers online, however:\n\n1. If this had been 1999/2000 early internet would NOT have given answers so you lot would have been just as stuck if your a veteran of this series so you should understand my anger\n2. I had ZERO interest in cheating my way through this game with help guides, I was expecting it to be enter game, play through story, work my way through the trilogy, it's all done, game was flawless, no issues, but this is not the case\n\nA good game will ease you in, help you settle into the game and progress through it, TLJ does not accomodate for this and your first few mins with a game really factors into whether you will like/enjoy that game or not and games that don't help you out when they should (especially in RPG types) really let themselves down in that regard.\n\nI cannot recommend

husband and I recently got addicted to VR and have been fairly desperate for a brand new computer with all the bells and whistles.  That said, my decision to pursue a graduate education has left us penniless for the time being.  One night, the gaming bug bit me particularly hard after seeing some of the puzzle/adventure PSVR releases that have just come out, and I rather desolately fired up the 7 year old laptop that occupies space under my bed, hoping to find something on steam that it could run (generally hit or miss, with more miss than hit) and could also be entertaining enough to occupy my time.  I knew that with the graphics being as bad as they were, something point-and-click would probably be the best.\n\nI found this game on a list called 100 best point and click adventure games or something like that.  It was $10, so if it only brought me a few hours of middling entertainment, it was probably a decent value.\n\nWow.  It's now two days later.  I have done nothing in my free time except play this game, despite the fact that I am in my last week of grad school and I literally have the final exams that will make or break my graduation in two days.  I can't help it--it's really well done, with very tricky puzzles (I am a dedicated puzzle gamer, artifex mundi, myst, name it) that really had you trying just about everything, tons of lore from a bunch of different races, and cutscenes that while old, are really impressive and almost emotional in how cool some of the effects are.  I have no idea how many hours it took me to finish this game, but it is the kind of game that you really shouldn't start unless you have a few days free, because you probably won't be doing anything else for a while. \n\nIf this is any indication, I see that there are two sequels, but I am purposely NOT going to buy them until after finals, because if I fail my finals because I was playing computer games, my husband is going to be so pissed.

Some puzzle design needed revisiting and some scenes pull the player out of the world, but these are more like distractions to an otherwise lovingly crafted game. Strong voice acting makes already likable characters even more compelling. Most of the puzzles are logical and straightforward and rarely require outside help. I'm glad I played this game, and I'm glad I finally beat it: it's a very satisfying check to add to the classic point-and-click list. \n\nAgain, it's unpolished at points (80% of the puzzles, voice acting, and scenes are great; the other 20% can be grating) but the good strongly outweighs the bad. The pacing of the story is questionable (slow start, steady and exciting middle with occasional bumps, hyper-fast ending) but it's compelling and immersive enough throughout. \n\nHighly recommended, albeit with advice: be patient, don't expect too much, and let yourself enjoy the journey.", "timestamp_created": 1512846547, "timestamp_updated": 1512849664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38134394": {"recommendationid": "38134394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037002672", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 224, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516912579}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1512669353, "timestamp_updated": 1512669353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38124249": {"recommendationid": "38124249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107541078", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453833289}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing work of art from it's time [Release date: 17 Nov 2000].\nI like the story.\nWe will miss April Ryan.\n\nContinue the story in -> Dreamfall: The Longest Journey", "timestamp_created": 1512636928, "timestamp_updated": 1512636928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38091678": {"recommendationid": "38091678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279859334", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512514557}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una aventura grafica que ya tiene sus a\u00f1itos a pesar de eso tiene buena calidad y la historia cumple ademas de tener con uno que otro personaje carismatico que recordar, eso si la historia es lineal ya que las desiciones que tomas no afectan en como continua, los puzzles son la mayoria sencillos, tienes que ser bastante observador y probar con todos los objetos que tengas a la mano ya que si no haces algo o no tienes un objeto simplemente no avanzas, aunque eso si hay un puzzle a mitad de historia mas o menos que te lo pondria complicar ya que no se explica mucho, aun asi hay guias y si te atoras lo puedes pasar sin problemas.\n\nUn juego para pasar un rato tranquilo escuchando dialogo tras dialogo mientras te enteras de la historia, dura aproximadamente unas 18 horas sin saltarte los dialogos y escuchando todo lo que tienen que decir y tardando haciendo los puzzles en un tiempo normalito.\n\nEl juego a pesar de venir en ingles se puede pasar a Espa\u00f1ol y ademas no se tarda nada en hacer, la traduccion la puedes encontrar en una guia de la comunidad.

Would I recommend this game wholeheartedly? Not unless you have a computer near completely compatible with its aged requirements, like a non-Nvidia graphics card (unless its like five generations old). So let's say I recommended it most-heartedly.\n\nThe annoyance comes from the obnoxious outdated standards the game comes with, and the fact that even though there are working fixes for some issues they decrease the quality of graphics - like activating software mode to rid my screen of the flickering. The biggest pain though comes with my desktop - which is probably best fit for games around 2014, lets be honest - displaying flickering textures upon character movement, and having no conclusive fix. So, in total, this game is perfect for my laptop save the software mode activation but unplayable on any relatively up to date system.\n\nIt's a shame that no further fixes or patches are available, as this game is truly an experience worth exploring; this simple point 'n' click puzzle game holds more engaging humour and story within it than near all new games, especially AAA games. Also it's arguably more progressive in ways.

You play and you think: \"Wow, that must be it, the final chapter\", but no, there's more and more. It's an amazing, quite detailed and interesting story, and since I play the games only for a good plot, I tell you: buy it! I strongly recommend it instead of annoying romance books and superheroes-themed garbage.\n\nThe strange thing is the age of this game. There is a lot of humour here (I literally laughed out loud, and those notes in the diary...), mostly about cliches of fantasy. The main heroine is a funny sarcastic girl, but look, I thought you'd want to be sarcastic about standart plot twists now, in 2017, but...not, like, 20 years ago. There were no such amazing games, for god's sake, to annoy people with their predictability! It's almost like the scenarist is a time traveller!\n\nI don't know though why this game feels so fresh. I've read many books, played many games and watched lots of movies, but this one... is nothing I've heard of. Yeah, sure, it has a lot of standart fantasy things like magical races, dark woods, prophecies, good and evil sides, but there are so much more sudden development twists, and it's sooooo very interesting that I couldn't get away from the game! I really wish I could erase my memory and play it once again. The atmosphere in general felt really nice, that cyberpunk here and fantasy there... There certainly could be done something to make it even better, but still the atmoshere is really high-level, the scenarist did a great job to dip us into his story.\n\nAnd a female protagonist, how few of them exist! What a wonderful feeling I had while watching April go through all the troubles she had, all the adventures, and how she trolled that captain of the ship\u2026 Also, lesbian side couple. No comments, just thanks!\n\nAside from my delight about the story, there are gameplay, riddles, graphics, sound and one little thing more. All that keeping in mind the age of this game.\n\nThe gameplay is not very convenient, even kinda buggish? There will be some places where you'll need to go back to get a forgotten toy, to do something unobvious or the plot won't move any further and so on. There are scenes where you can't skip NPCs' slow walking (library...), where you can't properly click on something. Then again - 1999.\n\nThe riddles are fine in general. Not very difficult, most of them are quite logical... But in some places to move forward was impossible without a walkthough. Well, maybe I'm not that smart, but I just had to note it.\n\nThe graphics is, well... Okay. For a 1999 at least. Probably. You certanly will be surprised that Cortez is an old man when April will mention it... But you know, it's worth playing, despite the graphics. It's just so really good.\n\nThe sound is amazing. Very beautiful and atmospheric music will accompany your mood through the story. The voice acting is great as well, I fell in love with April the moment I heard her first sarcastic comment!\n\nNow what really bugs me after the end is the lesson of this story. Just what did the author want to tell us? There can't be a story without a lesson, but here I can't really understand it. Help your friends? Not really. Love your family? Nah. Be ready to sacrifice yourself, to admit your destiny? I wouldn't say so. Be brave? Be kind? I don't know! That remained a mystery for me. As well as the personality of the side characters. And in the end April, her character didn't really change. Or maybe it did, but we don't exactly know it, since the game ends so abruptly. And leaves so many questions without a near-future answer...\n\nI certainly will play the Dreamfall. And I will cherish the hope for the continuation of this beautiful story and my longest journey.\n\nUPDATE: Well, I greatly regret the decision to play Dreamfall from the bottom of my heart.

The puzzles in this game are obnoxiously nonsensical, and teh story starts off good, but becomes boring. \n\nIf you're checking this out because dreamfall chapters caught your eye, my suggestion would be to skip this one and start with either the 2nd or 3rd game. It is worth noting that you won't be missing any important backstory by skipping this one -- in fact there are some plot points that seem contradictory between this and the 2nd, (although I haven't finished the 3rd yet, so perhaps they bring them write around the inconsistancies later)\n\n(there's some overlap in the names, so to be clear: 1st is longest journey, 2nd is longest journey: dreamfall, 3rd is dreamfall chapters)\n\nThe story is interesting at first, but without any real events in the middle. It's like they had an idea for a good 3 hour game with the prototypical urban fantasy story: Girl is whisked away to another world, finds she has magic powers, goes on quest to retrieve magic artifact, and eventually saves the world. And honestly, that part is fairly good, (aside from the obtuse puzzles)\n\nExcept it's like they decided to make it super long by having a dozen artifacts instead of just a few, but then ran out of budget and just tore through the rest of the game. The first 3 chapters took a few hours each, and were just to get oriented to the new world. I think you're like 6 hours in, around chapter 5 when you get your first artifact. By chapter 8ish, you're like 15 hours in with maybe 3 artifacts. Now near the end, they just throw them at you. There's a chapter that's just a 3 minute cutscene where you get like 3 artifacts. It's highly uneven. \n\nThe voice acting was pretty good i thought, and the characters were likable.

Graphically, the game is playable on a modern high resolution monitor.  It doesnt look great, but it is definitely passable.  The graphical models low polygon count definitely show the games age.  And the backgrounds seem to get washed out from being stretched to higher resolutions.  The interface is simple and easy to use.  Everything accessable from the mouse, which is nice.  There is no need to use a keyboard, unless you want to skip through the lengthy spoken dialog.  As I said before, its faster to read the subtitles.  Some of the animations while interacting with objects, especially people, are annoyingly long and unskippable.  This is especially annoying when you are trying to do something repeatedly.  Some of the puzzles are really simple and require no thought.  While some are a little more complex.  There is one puzzle in the game that is so ridiculously difficult that it is considered one of the hardest puzzles in adventure games.  This game definitely falls into the category of clicking inventory items and just seeing if they interact with what you are doing.  This game defintely has the failing of many adventure games, in that the solution is something you wouldnt think of.  You simply solved it by clicking inventory and interacting with the environment. \n\nAgain, this game is good, but nowhere near the likes of other adventure games.  Still, for the cheap price, it is worth it if you like the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1507335584, "timestamp_updated": 1507335584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506284", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35509031": {"recommendationid": "35509031", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970887173", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490206769}, "language": "english", "review": "I wonder how many people fell into the same trap I did.

I cared about this universe, and was curious and delighted as I found out more. I loved that while there was a lot of humor and fairy tale style wonder, it was also a story written by and for adults. The story is complex and doesn't wrap everything up neatly, and that is a feature and not a bug.

point & click adventure game, first released in 1999.  The story concerns a young woman named April Ryan who discovers that she's instrumental in preventing a catastrophe that threatens the Balance between two worlds; Stark and Arcadia.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nThe story.  I wouldn't necessarily call it \"original\" these days, but it's thoughtful, moving and VERY well told.  It challenges some common tropes of the genre without denying their necessity.  The characters are also well-rounded.  April Ryan is the perfect example of what a female protagonist [i]should be,[/i] in my opinion.  She's not a damsel in distress, but neither is she an arse-kicking, hyper-sexualized, I-am-woman-hear-me-roar style character, the likes of which Hollywood (and many other video games) love to put forward under the label \"strong female lead.\"  April has strengths and weaknesses, hopes and fears.  She has a realistic body type and she dresses in reasonable outfits.  She feels like a real person, which only makes you as a player identify that much more with her plight.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThe graphics were considered pretty good when the game first came out, but they have NOT aged well.  The game is still perfectly playable, but it shows its age.  Likewise, the voices.  Some of the voice actors really go all out, others not so much.  (Thankfully April herself is in the former category, since you'll be listening to her more than anyone else.)  In 1999, when the concept of having voices [i]at all[/i] was still a novelty, this could be overlooked.  Today, it takes its toll.\n\nAlso, with the Steam version, there's one significant bug: confirmation dialogs for [i]exiting the game[/i] or [i]overwriting saves[/i], etc do not display properly (at least on Windows)!  Press \"Y\" for \"Yes\" or \"N\" for \"No\" to get past these mysterious empty white boxes when they pop up.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nThe Longest Journey is probably my favourite P&C adventure game of all time.  The story is the purpose for a game like this, and this story is worth experiencing, even if the audio/visuals are showing their age.  It's also the first installment in a trilogy which does not disappoint as it unfolds in full.\n\n[i]Fair warning to parents:[/i] There is strong language in this game (multiple F-bombs) which you might not expect, given the presentation.  I don't personally find this offensive, but others might.\n\n[b]Why Should I Buy It?[/b]\nIf you've read the review this far and are still considering it, buy this game!  You won't be disappointed.\n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.

A must for people who love point and click games, and a steal if you buy it on sale.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing Story\n-Not a short game\n-MemorableCharaters\n-Voice Acting Is Great\n\nCons:\n-Puzzles difficulty might be hard from some (Just nitpicking here since i didnt have alot of problems with them but i definitely can see some people needing to use a guide in someplaces and nothing is wrong with that)\n-There are some glitches that can happen (This is an old game so modern PC will have trouble play them. Use the link below to find fixes for them)\n\nSimply an amazing game, the title itself tells you you really are in for a long journey alongside a very likable main character (April Ryan). I first came across this series (The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, & Dreamfall Chapters) with Dreamfall the second game and loved it, i was honestly sad to see how short it was with a cliffhanger ending that makes you feeling for more badly. I realized that it came out a long while ago when i played it and whated to see if their were any talks about a next game. Luckly this was around the time the kickstarter was making great strides so you can guess i was happy. \n\nAnyway, seeing that i never played the first game i wanted to get caught up before playing the newest one and honestly after just finally beating it (Writing this review right after just finshing it). I gotta admit the longest journey's story just blows away Dreamfall. Im so glad i went back and played it but while i still say Dreamfall is a great game, it must have been a bit disapointing to fans going from such a grand scope of a game storywise to dreamfall and feel like your'e getting so little compared. \n\nIn short this game is a must if you are feeeling to get into the series, the story adds so much to what i knew from Dreamfall. I also loved the voice acting. Add this game to your collection especially if its on sale.\n\n(PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DOWNLOAD \"dgvoodoo\" FOR THIS GAME.

I played an hour or two every few days. It took a while. There is a TON of dialogue, AND slow-speaking characters giving you tons of background info on this and that. You just had to slog through it, however, you can keep your finger close to the ESC button to skip dialogue (and slow walking) if you can read it on the screen faster than they are speaking. That helps. The over-abundant dialogue about history/lore is the worst part of the game, and a few obtuse puzzles, and occasional pixel-hunting (I had to use the guide once just to find that there was a small item I easily overlooked because it wasn't obvious on the screen).\nApart from all that, this game is considered an adventure classic and is definitely worth playing. Sometimes the story is a bit cheesy and cliched, but it is overall a good game with a decent-to-good story.\n\nIMPORTANT: This game had trouble starting on my Windows 7 (64-bit) PC. If I started my PC and tried to start the game, it would never start the first time, giving me a DirectDraw error, which also made my mouse cursor only work on half of my desktop, so I would have to ctrl-alt-del and log out from windows. BUT, when I would log back in to Windows and start the game again, it would work perfectly, every time. So, if you have the same problem, just start the game the first time when you don't have any other important applications running, hit ctrl-alt-del when you get the error, log out, log in and start it again.

Auf The Longest Journey bin ich gekommen, weil ich Dreamfall Chapters spielen wollte, aber von vielen Seiten h\u00f6rte, dass die Geschichte kaum zu verstehen ist, wenn man die Vorg\u00e4nger nicht kennt. Im Nachhinein sch\u00e4me ich mich ein bisschen daf\u00fcr, dass ich The Longest Journey nur spielen wollte, damit ich die Nachfolger verstehe.\n\nDas Spiel erz\u00e4hlt eine unglaublich fantastische Geschichte, die mich oft an Fantasy-B\u00fccher erinnerte, die ich in meiner Kindheit gelesen habe (z. B. Wolfgang Hohlbein, f\u00fcr alle die den Namen kennen :). Es geht dabei um ein \u00fcbernat\u00fcrliches Gleichgewicht von Wissenschaft und Magie, das zwischen den Paralleluniversen steht und deren Existenz sichert. Dieses ins Wanken gekommene Gleichgewicht gilt es wiederherzustellen und das bedeutet f\u00fcr den Spieler eine Reise in die verschiedensten Winkel beider Welten.\nDieses Gef\u00fcge und die Historie beider Welten sind an sich schon unglaublich interessant, aber dazu kommen noch unterschiedlichste sympathische Charaktere (abgesehen von der Hauptfigur April Ryan nat\u00fcrlich). Von lesbischen Vermietern eines Studentenwohnheims mit fragw\u00fcrdigen sexuellen Vorlieben, einem flapsigen sprechenden Vogel als Sidekick, bis hin zu einem teuflischen Alchemisten, der in seiner fliegenden Festung den besten Pfefferminzkuchen aller Zeiten backt, ist wirklich alles dabei.\n\nWas die R\u00e4tsel angeht, w\u00e4re ich ohne die gelegentliche Konsultierung der Komplettl\u00f6sung vermutlich auf mehrere hundert Spielstunden gekommen, aber ich bin auch nicht besonders Fit darin. Im Nachhinein betrachtet sind die R\u00e4tsel aber (gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils) fair und sowieso sehr kreativ gestaltet.\n\nThe Longest Journey war eine Reise an die ich mich auf jeden Fall noch lange erinnern werde :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1503155588, "timestamp_updated": 1503155588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34281787": {"recommendationid": "34281787", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974382241", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502238235}, "language": "english", "review": "Being a fan of point and click adventures, there was little doubt I'd like the game. However the game differs quite a bit from your traditional adventure of the era. For once, Puzzles are a little bit rarer and more confined to certain areas of the game, making them more accessible. Also the game is skewed towards telling its story, so there is a bunch of lengthy conversations happening instead of puzzles all the time. Knowing this era only from puzzle-heavy titles like Monkey Island or Sam&Max, I really enjoyed this shift. Overall the gameplay feels quite slow, with a lot of running and listening involved.\n\nNow as all point and click adventures, this game also suffers from the gamplay problem of being stuck. Sometimes you are bound to miss things or interpret situations differently from what the developers intended. Given the more straightforward and limited nature of the puzzles in this game, I found myself being significantly less stuck and able to keep a good pace through the game.\n\nThe story was really engaging for me. A nice mix of science fiction and classic fairy-tale fantasy made for some funny and likeable moments. Now the story isn't really anything out of the ordinary nowadays, but the way it is being told and the characters used made for a nice unique experience in my view, with a certain sidekick stealing the show. There is also a nice portion of geek culture references, so if you belong to the target audience, you get some more laughs out of it.\n\nThere's no way aroung it, the game looks old, having your standard run-of-the-mill prerendered Backgrounds with some live rendered foreground, as was common for the time. I didn't think any of the voice acting was particularly bad, but some of the voices really stood out from the crowd.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend the game to fans of point and click adventures. Others might be put of by the slow gameplay or the dated tech. If you can look past such things, the game has an engaging bundle of science fiction and fantasy for you in store with a healthy chunk of humor.", "timestamp_created": 1502908951, "timestamp_updated": 1502908951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34281046": {"recommendationid": "34281046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177002086", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 2197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511437352}, "language": "english", "review": "I freaking love April she's so cute and witty she's the type of girl I'd like to date back from the good old days.\nA classic point&click adventure game which, again, reminds me of the good old days.\n9.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1502906291, "timestamp_updated": 1502906291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34272467": {"recommendationid": "34272467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036802400", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505110773}, "language": "german", "review": "wieso kann ich das spiel nicht per vollbild spielen? \nist nur ein kleines k\u00e4stchen oben links ...", "timestamp_created": 1502874745, "timestamp_updated": 1502874745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34184688": {"recommendationid": "34184688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041192762", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502518639}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game!

And even if there isn't that much to be seen of some of the characters I did come to like them quite a lot.\nFor some of the bugs others have mentioned I can't say anything, since I haven't come across any (the text was screwed up on time, but reloading a previous save fixed it and it hasn't appeared again).\nIf there's a game that deserves a (graphical) remake it's definitely The Longest Journey and I am happy to say that I'm very excited for the other two games.", "timestamp_created": 1499033469, "timestamp_updated": 1499097126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33139393": {"recommendationid": "33139393", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976477188", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516662580}, "language": "german", "review": "Damals im Jahre 2000 gespielt und geliebt und heute, meiner Meinung nach, immer noch eines der besten Point & Click Adventures die es gibt.

Certain things about just didn't age very well - such as the 3d character models, fonts, and fmv sequences. However, the rest, the core or the game, from the voices to the story to the puzzles and gameplay held up very well.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, and when paired up with the dialogue it is really good at telling the story. It can be funny when it needs to be, or sombre when the occasion calls for it. The story itself also flows very well, with good pacing from when April is just going about her daily life and how it slowly builds into this long journey.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, the puzzles are pretty good. With plenty of characters to talk to, and the very useful diary mechanic to keep track of everything, although you can get stumped at times theres almost always a way to puzzle out the answer.\n\nAs far as the art in this game goes, it can be alright. In-game some of the models used in characters look extremely low resolution, but it's not too off-putting. The fmv sequences are just ugly to look at.

The kid I was back then wasn't very much into adventure games but have remembered that fact as probably no other game spent so many time on that spot. El Duderino that I'm now is still not a huge adventure games fan but likes to try something from that genre now and then (Dracula and Sam&Max series being the favorites). The reputation this game has as one of the best in the branch is well desereved. Those funny Norwegians have done a great job!\n\nPlaying this was just like the title says...it was like taking a very long journey. A thoroughly enjoyable one.\nSome would say that the graphics are awful but in all honesty if that is true it didn't bother me at all (played on 1080p monitor and the picture wasn't stretched or anything). The moment I dived into such an interesting story with completely believable characters I was just there. It felt like I could actually touch the person I talk to or stand on a cliff and look into the depth of a beautiful landscape while the breeze on my face. The mixture between magic and logic, fairy tale and (futuristic) reality is done great and you never get tired of either. I slightly liked more the magical part. The struggle within the main character is also properly served before the player and progresses in adequate tempo as the game rolls out. Voice acting is spot on as well as the music. I'm not going into any details on purpose, you gotta inhale them on your own.\n\nI would suggest playing in little doses (those 25 hours you see happened over last 4 months but no need to have such a slow tempo xD), couple hours per day tops. That way you won't be annoyed by long walks/runs across new or known screens which this game (unfortunatelly but not tragically) delivers. Don't worry about forgetting parts of the story if you stay away for some time, it won't happen I asure you (but if it does there is an automatic in-game Diary that will help out in a jiffy). ;)\nIf you have technical issues with menues or something there is a very quick solution for that (Google is your friend).\nThe puzzles are perfectly balanced, not naive but not \"head-breaking\" either.

I mean most of them don't add anything to the game apart from difficulty): http://www.ladyofthecake.com/thelongestjourney/index.html", "timestamp_created": 1492981242, "timestamp_updated": 1492988468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31041933": {"recommendationid": "31041933", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976234124", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491749136}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good quaint adventure game with a good story and excellent voice acting.

It starts with one theme, then abruptly picks up another, starting with a unique character and ending with a stereotype.\n\nThe puzzles are difficult, and there are a lot of them, but they aren't very intuitive. They're good for a brain exercise, but I didn't find them fun. I ran to the walkthrough a lot (and I hate walkthroughs) because the game design didn't get me to care about the puzzles. This could very well be personal preference, though.\n\nYou can sprint or walk, but even while sprinting....You. Run. So. Slowly. Over. Vast. Distances. \n\nThe game world tried very, very hard to be immersive and one-of-a-kind. It offered a lot in the way of lore and history to the world, locations, etc. But I found it all to be ultimately lacking. It felt like somebody who loved fantasy and sci-fi writing one of their first stories. Not bad at all; I can tell they loved their creation, and I appreciate their efforts. But it's not something I would want to PAY for, if you know what I mean. \n\nIt's not a bad game. Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy parts of it. But, for the most part, I found myself continuing just for the sake of finishing, and in the hope it would get better along the way. I did buy the sequel, so, again, it's not a bad game. But it's not a great one, either.

It's still beautiful, it's still emotional, funny and immersive.\n\nIt's a point-and-click adventure game unlike anything I've ever played. The game has a well-realized world that gives off a very European, 80s-90s sci-fi vibe. The amount of cinematic beauty such a low-budget game can come out with is impressive.\n\nThe story is very detailed and probably the most important aspect of the game, this isn't JUST a puzzle-solving point-and-click. I'd say it's a visual novel as well, with full voice-acting. Some NPCs can talk for up to twenty minutes about the well-realized lore created by the development team. It's got a snarky and relatable main character that keeps every moment interesting as she projects her personality onto any situation by using the \"examine\" feature.\n\nMy only gripes with this one is that the game drags on a little long near the middle, and a few of the puzzles are just ridiculous and you'll either have to get really creative with your problem-solving skills, or be following a guide.\n\nEven if you're put off by puzzle-solving or point-and-clicks, I'd still say give this a chance if it goes on sale or you feel sponatenous.

In terms of story, the game excels and the world is equally incredible as it incorporates both sci-fi & fantasy elements. The Longest Journey is imaginative in its way of creating a diverse and unique universe filled with lore and characters that remain memorable. April Ryan is fantastic as the game's leading protagonist. She is well written and stands out as a main character. The world is truly great from the moment the player enters the futuristic world of Earth, being set about 300 years into the future. Sci-fi alone is done so well in this game and so is the fantasy aspect inspired by classic medieval lore with a fantastical touch. \n\nWhile filled with great lore and characters, the adventure filled game play can seem slow at times due to April's walk speed and this requires a bit of patience. This may be a problem as it can make the game experience seem a tedious one. Nonetheless, despite this The Longest Journey features amazing voice acting and dialogue coupled with a very well written script. This game is a true classic and really is one of the greatest adventure games ever made; nothing since has really compared to the degree of detail evident in the game's story structure and lore. Scale-wise, it is a series filled with imaginative lore containing creatures and characters from different worlds and backgrounds. This all combines to make an outstanding story adventure. The Longest Journey is the first of the Dreamfall series and anyone interested in fantasy, or sci-fi with an emphasis on narrative should definitely experience this game.", "timestamp_created": 1483940932, "timestamp_updated": 1483940932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29122199": {"recommendationid": "29122199", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998827138", "num_games_owned": 694, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496056175}, "language": "english", "review": "Required a bit of workaround to get it working properly with Windows 10 64bits, but it then ran without further issues.\n\nThis is one of the best and, indeed, longest point and click adventure games.

It's a decent game pure technically and runs smoothly but it's faults are too serious to ignore.\n\nThis game offers\n*Dissapointing humour\n*Boring storyline\n*Unrelatable heroine\n*One-dimentional side characters\n*And some no-sense-making puzzles\n\nIncluding some minor technicalities as well\n\nLike seriously, I can see why people liked it 16 years ago, but now? Please, there are tons of games better than this one available on Steam today. There is no reason to play through this game these days (as I also hear it's very long). \n\nI didn't like the heroine, since she always fails to be funny, whines about how difficult the truth is to accept, yells at the only character who understands and obviously wants to help her (even though she secretly believes in everything he says) and... she sometimes speak like a robot. Also, she's a complete nobody with seemingly no personality. Thank god there are worse characters in the game!\n\nThe story itself, isn't the best one. I wasn't amazed in any way. It's just too boring. Another \"Save the world\" kind of plot, basically. As if I've never heard that one before... Nothing new or unique, just dissapointing.\n\nAnd please, the humour in this is unbareably cringeworthy! I'm refering to a scene in some back-alley where you use a certain toy and a certain garbage pile and make it look like a cop pointing a gun at someone and shouting: \"Do the ape dance\" or something equally silly. And guess what? He falls for it... hillarious(!) That's the kind of humour you will have to endure by playing this.\n\nI've heard so much great things about this game and I've looked forward to trying it out for quite a while, but I can't finish it if the whole game will be like this. So could someone, anybody, please tell me exactly where this \"Journey\" actually starts? Because, right now... I'll settle for the end.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1483873081, "timestamp_updated": 1483873081, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.340668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28956661": {"recommendationid": "28956661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044709096", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514238074}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the greatest adventure game ever.

Lo siento, de verdad, espero que alg\u00fan d\u00eda puedan perdonarme. No puedo recordar porque tom\u00e9 aquella paup\u00e9rrima  decisi\u00f3n, pero la hice, y comenc\u00e9 la historia como no se debe,  con su secuela (Dreamfall: The longest Journey). No creo que haga falta aclarar que estaba m\u00e1s perdido que surfista boliviano, bueno, por lo menos al principio. Conforme avanc\u00e9 en la historia pude comprenderla mejor, pero no como deber\u00eda.\n Pero un d\u00eda todo cambi\u00f3, esa desaz\u00f3n por no saber que jugar me llev\u00f3 a descargar el juego y a \"re-jugar\" la saga. Y me dije bueno, probemos con [b] The Longest Journey[/b], Abr\u00ed el juego y pens\u00e9 que era un juego m\u00e1s de miles, pero enseguida veo que no. No es un juego de puzzle, ni una aventura gr\u00e1fica, ni un point & click. Es una obra de arte, relatada con la precisi\u00f3n y sensibilidad perfecta. Poco merecido tengo, emitir opini\u00f3n alguna sobre este pedazo de juego.\n\n Es uno de esos juegos que hay que jugar antes de morir, altamente recomendado, este y sus secuelas.\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1480858514, "timestamp_updated": 1480858800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28177993": {"recommendationid": "28177993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333824370", "num_games_owned": 724, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487253584}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely lives up to its title.\n", "timestamp_created": 1480835158, "timestamp_updated": 1480835158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28177646": {"recommendationid": "28177646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158836921", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480831219}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\nStory-The story of The Longest Journey is probably one of the best I've seen in a video game. When you think the game becomes too predictable, it quickly throws you into a loop to think otherwise. \nWorld-The world I think was \"magical\" if I was to be so blunt. The environment and background images were truly beautiful. \n\nCons:\nFont-The game turns off clearfont setting in my pc, so I have to turn them back on again after playing. \nHidden agenda-Some of the characters in the game seemed forced to act a certain way to appease some sort of hidden political/social agenda by the developers. \nVoice Acting-Some of the voice acting for the side characters seemed pretty bad to me. One character spoke in a monotonic voice in one sentence, but then spoke in a 1950's greaser accent. There are others as well that bothered me. \nPuzzles-Most of the puzzles in the game were pretty good, but some in the first few chapters were pretty ludicrous. \nGraphics-I'm used to old graphics, but obviously some people don't like outdated graphics.\nLanguage-Wish at least the subtitles in the game would be in norsk, that way I could practice bokm\u00e5l. \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it to friends. If side characters bother you, just skip through or ignore the extra diolgue with them.

me, I played it and it fast became one of my favourite games ever.  The graphics are dated now but to be honest the rich story and lore, the varied characters and personalities (and the way the game makes you care about them) and great voice acting more than make up for it.\n\nIts a fantasy story, sweet and lighthearted in some places, dark and sad in others. I loved the sequel Dreamfall too, and think I will love Chapters when I get round to playing it, but for now TLJ holds the top spot for me in the saga, and in point n click adventure games in general. \n\n I should probably also say the game is pretty dialogue heavy, personally I don't mind, I like talking to and bantering with  the characters and finding out more about them etc, but if you prefer action and fast pacing you may not enjoy the game so much. Also if graphics  are a big deal to you, and you can't look past them then possibly give it a miss too. \n\nOtherwise this game is probably one of the best adventure games I have ever played, with a strong fantasy story and likeable, believable, and well developed characters and if you love the traditional adventure genre and fantasy this game (and series in general) is highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1479989173, "timestamp_updated": 1506066662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27129204": {"recommendationid": "27129204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040477957", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479988093}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043a, \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0438\u044f, \u042d\u0439\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1479988172, "timestamp_updated": 1479988172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588651", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27109038": {"recommendationid": "27109038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158747672", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510452681}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es increible, me encanto.\nLos graficos no importa siempre en los videojuegos, si no la historia que cuentan o el mensaje que te transmiten.\nThe Longest Journey tiene una gran historia llena de tecnologia, magia, criaturas fantasticas, puzzles, personajes carismaticos, etc.\nEste juego se merece que le hagan un remake, es un gran juego de point & click.

I happened to be unpackimg my original Xbox after moving and found a few games that I hadn't played yet; Dreamfall was one--it was still in its shrink wrap.  I knew nothing about Dreamfall except it was an adventure game with a pretty girl wearing a pink tank top on the cover.  It turned out to be an awesome game.  Ater playing it, I wondered if there was a sequel and purchased Dreamfall Chapters and started playing.  I then discovered that not only was Chapters being funded through Kickstarter, but there was a preceding game called The Longest Journey.  I immediately stopped playing Chapters and downloaded The Longest Journey to learn about April Ryan's adventures that led to Zoe's adventure in Dreamall.        \n\nThe Longest Journey is an old-school point-and-click adventure.  Initially, this was a little off-putting, but I quickly got into the hang of it and playing it soon became second nature.  The puzzles were fairly easy, though I did have to peek at a walkthrough once or twice--but I was more into uncovering the story arc than actually solving puzzles at the time.

It's not particulary difficult, even though I was stuck a few places... But luckily there's a walkthrough somewhere :) \n\nThis game was absolutely worth everything, I got it on sale, and bought the package including dreamfall, then happened to start dreamfall first (as I was insecure if it even mattered which one I started to play of the two,) and dreamfall has a much bigger and better upgrade in looks and everything. So starting this to finish it before I got to dreamfall was a bit dull at first, but now that I've played it through it was soooo WORTH IT!!! \n\nSo the two are connected, and dreamfall is the second.

Like they say, they don't make stuff to last like before nowadays!\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nWell, this is a game from 1999, so forget about it, you cannot play this game expecting HD textures, expect Nintendo 64-like graphics at its best, with old Diablo-like cutscenes, nor there are any mods to that I could find to help with this, this is most unimportant anyway, since the true treasure of this game lies elsewhere. [b]However,[/b] I do find appealing all the drawn scenarios, thinking of all the work that went through the creation of this game to make all the world, I absolutely love it. Also, just as me, you'll probably have find issues with the graphics, with 3D models looking incomplete, this can be easily fixed by following the instruction in [url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=558693]THIS[/url] thread, easy peesy! The music and sound effects used always suits the areas you find yourself in, although only in some very specific ocasions I found the music to be of special notice, it was just pretty much suitable, makes you feel in the right ambient.\n\n[u]The Story[/u]\nThat is truly the point of this really, no? What is a point-and-click adventure game without its story. I must say, I had some expectations and they were fullfilled, I deeply enjoyed the story in this game. I won't go on the details, for what I love of the story is to be able to discover it as you progress, every little piece of it, and I won't take that away from you. Mind you, there is something you should know, this game is young adult-oriented, so be warned about the content you might expect to find in the dialogues. That said, if you have lots of crops on your sense of humor field, this game will certainly make you harvest them all, the characters are quite hilarious, sarcasm is the everyday bread, and witty verbal knives fly here and there. Even when it wants you to feel omnious, it keeps making you chuckle.This game makes you love its characters, so you are more inclined to care about the story has a whole. And the voice acting...is truly grandious. This is how I like my stories told to me. My favorite character without doubt was [spoiler]Crow[/spoiler], it is are amazing. And man, this had gotten me 20h to complete, I did not expect that either, the game is appropiately long.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nWell, this is an old game so if you are used to have clear aids on games, be aware this has none of it. By \"clear aids\" I mean like \"objetives menu\" \"map\", etc. No, you do have \"story follow up\" materials that help you remember what just happened and might be expected to do, and lets you review the conversations you had with NPCs should you have forgotten something important that they said, however apart from that do not expect any kind of leads or explicit help.\nThe puzzles can go from simple to \"OH MY GOD, REALLY?\", sometimes it requires you to push and get going on those  abstract thinking processes to be able to figure out what it wants you to do, makes your inner celeron dust its core quite a bit for sure. If you are truly lost, do not worry, it is acceptable that you might end up in a game guide at some point because some of them are quite tricky...very tricky...let's say. How to succed at completing this game though? My recomendations are the following:\n*From the very start, ALWAYS check everything in your scenario, everytime your scenario changes (whereas you went to a whole new area or you simply decided to take a look at something specific, scan it thoroughly, and see if you can interact with it in some way, or interact with items in some way. If you can grab something it -WILL- have an use or various uses along your journey, so keep always an eye peeled. One item you might have overlooked, and it might prove problematic later on, so be very vigilant, and very curious.\n*Pay special attention to what has been said by the NPCs.\n*Keep track of the details, and track of what you have in your inventory so it is easier to connect the dots with the help of your logic skills! The way you have to interact in with your environment always appeals in great deal to your logic (*Stark-ing intensifies* lol).\n\n[h1]Overall?[/h1]\nI would venture to say that this is a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I could send this game to be carbon-dated already, it surprised me as it surpassed my expectations. I was a little dubious when I purchased it despite having loved Dreamfall Chapters, but I absolutely do not regret it a single bit. I enjoyed every single chapter, and should you, reader, stumble over this title by chance, know that you are in for a treat, and one hell of worth it. And if you decide to give it a shot, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\nThis is the way storytelling should be.", "timestamp_created": 1467540180, "timestamp_updated": 1467540417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24041850": {"recommendationid": "24041850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107571800", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504126430}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic I played along time ago and since forgotten, still remember it was an awesome experience so going for a fresh re-run of this and Dreamfall.

In fact it seemed years ahead of the competition, I knew of no other beautifully detailed game quite like this. Back then there were no walkthroughs. Since I was also a child, seemingly easy puzzles sometimes took me days to figure out. I spent more than a month getting through the entire game (also because I wasn't allowed to game ALL day). This game left such a massive imprint on me and my imagination. I love the magical ambience of the game, the music, the main character (which, at least in norwegian, was kind of funny), the backgrounds and scenery, the places to travel to and the puzzles. Also, the controls were easy to use and the menus easy to manuver. Being able to skip long dialogues (perhaps accidentially revisited) with the right mouse button made things even easier. The only thing I felt a little negative about first playing this game was that there was A LOT of walking, even tho April runs she doesn't run fast enough! And a lot of dialogue where they go into great detail on almost everything. In my 2016 playthrough tho I find these long dialogues interesting, cause they fill in the gaps where I had holes in my understanding of the story. I'm also now more interested in knowing more about the characters and places because they're now distantly familiar. As a kid, some of the story was hard to make sense of. Yet through actions and imagery it all made sense in the end. \n\nWenever I think of The Longest Journey I get that magical feeling kids get around christmas time; anticipation. This game always had me curious of what would happen next. I'm so happy this game is available on Steam for newer generations to play, and for old-time players to revisit and reminiscence.

However, this game really interesting to me as it was both a throwback to my childhood and set in the future. Going on 20 years since it was made, it's definitely intriguing to see a version of how the future could be envisioned (plus a load of 90s fashion and cultural references). One of the things I definitely notice between then and now is how much more action focused our games have got - I was getting really frustrated with how slowly she travelled and walked to places.\nI bought this game because I'd heard good things about Dreamfall Chapters and then wanted to play the prequels to have a better idea of the storyline. For story lovers like me, this game won't disappoint. It has a really solid storyline and had me hooked. It was a really great intro to this series and keeps you thinking as a player of the game (which I really like).\nIt's also great to have a female protagonist and there's a lot of background legend to get involved in, if you enjoy that in your games. Overall, a great buy and I'd definitely recommend.\n(Note: at first, the game kept crashing, but by putting a HD video on on youtube in the background my laptop could deal with it better and the problem was 'solved')", "timestamp_created": 1466545140, "timestamp_updated": 1469399513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23687012": {"recommendationid": "23687012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301999567", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469366212}, "language": "english", "review": "I am absolutely gutted that i cannot overcome the techinical difficulty i'm having when trying to play this game!

Loved it. When I first started out, I was only half-interested in anything the characters were saying. Mind you, I'm playing this in 2016, so everything felt very 'been-there-done-that'. The further you progress into the story, however, the more you get pulled into it, into all of it, the world, the characters, everything. Talking about those characters- it just, it always amazes me how developers can pull of creating alternate worlds, the different creatures they invented were all just so darned likeable, especailly the Bandu. And it has to be said, for a 1999 game, it's very modern. It had a bunch of stuff in it that nowadays people tend to make a big deal out of, like a lesbian character and a wide variety of races, oh, and did I mention, blatant profanity just like in real life.\n\nAs for some of the more technical stuff. The voice acting was great, and everything was voiced over. I know that's possible with games like these because they tend to be smaller in size, but it really helps a ton with immersion. Sure, the graphics are from 1999 and sometimes you're not sure whether that's a face or a melted candle, but at least everyone's got stellar voices to go with their retro looks. Besides, the sceneries were lovely, just the characters that looked a bit clunky. As for the gameplay, it was just the basic point-and-click stuff, required some quick/clever thinking at times. Only thing I couldn't stand was April's walking speed, girl get a move on, buuut I could just speed my way through any animation that took too long for my liking, so that wasn't really a problem either.  I think if I'd have any serious \"issue\" (I say \"issue\" because it didn't actually bother me) it's that I felt no real emotional connection to most of the characters, so whenever anything happened to them, it didn't bother me, but I think when it comes to creating emotional connections to characters, you just need more time with em than a game like this can give you, so I wouldn't really chock it up as a flaw. \n\nOverall ratings:\nAudio: 9/10\nGraphics: 8/10*\nGameplay: 7.5/10\nStory: 10/10\n\n*keeping in mind it's from 1999, and the sceneries were very good", "timestamp_created": 1466466108, "timestamp_updated": 1466466108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23639809": {"recommendationid": "23639809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283438414", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466109541}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bierz, nie gadaj.", "timestamp_created": 1466284595, "timestamp_updated": 1466284595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23639333": {"recommendationid": "23639333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293317700", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465409783}, "language": "french", "review": "super jeux et fonctionne sur windows 10", "timestamp_created": 1466283025, "timestamp_updated": 1466283025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23550041": {"recommendationid": "23550041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205115380", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464770977}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a completely unique gaming experience, how it is so under-recognized is beyond me.

It looked pretty interesting and it was then that I learned about it`s predecessors and how I missed them. All of them. Never heard of the \"Longest Journey\" before. \nAnd so I decided to go and play these titles. Starting with the first part of the trilogy. \nAlthough I hab some difficulties with the immersion at the beginning of the game which were all caused by it`s really badly aged character models. The scenery looks even today pretty, but the 3D rendered models do not. But nontheless I kept playing and oh boy I don`t regret a single second of it. This game is amazing! \nIt`s storyline could have easily been a book. Or a movie. It`s fantastic. I loved this little masterpiece. \nThe games characters are full of life and absolutly believable. And most important you get to care about them. \nBrilliant writing. \nEveryone who like me several weeks ago didn`t play the game yet, please do.\nEveryone needs to play this, although the game is not flawless. The puzzle logic is sometimes questionable to say the least and the graphics aged not too good. And I wished there was a little more crow. Still this game is a masterpiece. \nBest adventure game I played so far. Even better than monkey island. \nLooking forward to the next titles of the dreamfall series.", "timestamp_created": 1461749854, "timestamp_updated": 1461749854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22644605": {"recommendationid": "22644605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287296597", "num_games_owned": 1077, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459715845}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Geweldig verhaal!\n\nEen lange reis die van mij nog wel langer had mogen duren. Om eerlijk te zijn ben ik dit spel gaan spelen, omdat ik het spel Dreamfall - The Longest Journey had gekocht (het vervolg op dit verhaal). Ik was bang dat ik Dreamfall niet helemaal zou snappen, als ik niet eerst dit spel had uitgespeeld.\n\nNa 20 uur spelen heb ik er geen moment spijt van. Wat een geweldig verhaal, en daar doen de ietwat gedateerde graphics (ook al zijn ze niet slecht gezien de leeftijd van dist spel) niets aan af. Ik zal eerlijk bekennen dat ik op een paar punten een een walktrough ben gaan gebruiken, omdat ik weinig tijd heb om te spelen en ik nog een waslijst aan andere spellen heb die ik nog wil spelen. Vast herkenbaar voor veel mensen met een gezin ;-) Anders zou ik misschien wel op het dubbele aantal uren zijn uitgekomen.\n\nNu ik dit spel gespeeld heb, weet ik weer dat een goed verhaal boven

I recommend this game to anyone, who wants to play out a really nice story that is more heavy on the dialogue and the text than the action.\n\nThe characters are certainly one of the best parts, and April as well as her friends made it a very enjoyable journey for me. The game felt really slow at times, especially when you had to wait for the characters to slowly move before they began dialogue, continued the story, or just allowed you to click around again. It certainly felt slower than what I have gotten used used to, but then again it is a long time since I played point and click adventure games.\n\nThe game is very dialogue and text heavy, but it kinda compliments the games slow pace and atmosphere. A few times it got annoying if the character was too weird or dull, but mostly April Ryan's personality made me enjoy it the game as a whole, as well as the diverse environment and cast.\n\nI only experienced one minor bug during my playthrough. When trying to save the game, return to the main menu, and close the game, the \"are you sure window\" just showed up as a white square. But after I realized I just had to press \"y\" or \"n\", so i didn't need to see it, it didn't really interfere much in the game or outside of it. So yeah, pretty happy I was able to play the game with no real problems. \nThough the \"40+ hours gameplay\" that it promised in the about section doesn't really seem right...

It is about 16 years old now, and it is stil comparable to some of the great games of today. The graphis were awesome I'm sure (~2000), but to some younger players the game may appear a bit Minecraftish. The story follows a heroin that goes form Art student to the destiny of becoming a savior of two worlds. While initially taking place in the far future of the Earthen city of New Venice she finds herself learning about \"magic\" and powers she has had since birth. \n\nThe characters in this game are well-developed and the main character herself, April Ryan, is quite funny and sarcastic. Both the conversations and her personal journal are humourous to read. The settings are really well thought of, and the futurisitc corruption of coporations are placed. It is a point-and-click game that is worth the money.  Also, if you're thinking of buying this game for your children you might want to wait until they're a bit older. (Lots of profanity and sexual references). \n\nMore about the game play....\n\nTHIS NEXT PART MAY HAVE MINOR SPOILERS \n\nThe game itself isn't too difficult to complete. It plays as more of a story with some actions, rather than actions that contribute to a story. It does have the typical puzzle solving that most point-and-click games have. I would say in general about 95% of the puzzles can be solved without too much difficulty. There were a couple of times I had to \"cheat\" by looking up walkthroughs. That rubber duck contraption to get the key in the railway was ridiculous. Also having to knock three times specficially to get the garage door open was kind of pushing it.  I ended up with some items that I'm not sure if I was supposed to use or not. \n\nI was a bit dissapointed that we never got to see what became of her art show and other tidbits about her personal life. Although, I read about Dreamfall and plan on eventually playing that. I'm curious if they're going to pick up on April's personal life in the sequel. I read mostly in online forums that her breast size changes. I guess that's what matters.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1458549908, "timestamp_updated": 1458549908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21944727": {"recommendationid": "21944727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197670019", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453479147}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Probably my favourite of the trilogy <3 \n\nIt's incredible how the story and the personality of the characters shine despite the graphics and the hours of dialogues (?) hahaha <3.

A la base, je ne suis pas un fin connaisseur des points & click et autres jeux d'aventures et ce m\u00eame si j'ai \u00e9norm\u00e9ment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les Runaway de Pendulo. Du coup j'h\u00e9sitais et j'ai pass\u00e9 un long moment \u00e0 lire les diff\u00e9rents tests tout en visionnant quelques s\u00e9quences de gameplay.\nFinalement, j'ai saut\u00e9 le pas en achetant les deux premier opus de la licence et bigre, je ne regrette absolument pas !\n\n\n\nLe gameur briscard se plait \u00e0 dire [i]\"Fiston, d'mon temps c'\u00e9tait mieux avant\"[/i]. C'est souvent vrai,surtout  lorsque l'on voit la propension mercantile de certains \u00e9diteurs qui nous font bouffer leur licence AAA \u00e0 coup de marketing bien plac\u00e9. Au final, l'on se retrouve bien souvent avec un bon jeu mais tr\u00e8s loin de nous offrir un plaisir vid\u00e9o ludique hors-norme. Pour ce faire, beaucoup aime retrouver les vieilles licences, celles qui ont d'ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquis un statut \"d'oeuvre culte\". \n\nC'est le cas pour The Longest Journey. Sorti en 1999 (Oui, \u00e7a commence \u00e0 faire un bail), le jeu avait fait parler de lui pour son sc\u00e9nario, tr\u00e8s bien \u00e9cris et son ambiance. Car oui, ce qui m'a profond\u00e9ment marqu\u00e9 dans ce jeu est tout simplement l'ambiance qui s'y d\u00e9gage. Celle d'une v\u00e9ritable aventure onirique o\u00f9 le f\u00e9erique c\u00f4toie la science-fiction, o\u00f9 l'ont parle de Dragon, d'industrialisation et d'exp\u00e9riences scientifiques. De prime \u00e0 bord, l'on pourrait penser que c'est un m\u00e9lim\u00e9lo de tout ce qui se fait de bon dans le genre. H\u00e9r\u00e9sie de penser \u00e7a car les norv\u00e9giens de Funcom savent \u00e9crire, c'est un fait et ils s'en sont diablement bien sorti dans The Longest Journey.\n\nLe joueur incarne une jeune fille nomm\u00e9e April Ryan et elle est loin de la bimbo hyper sexualis\u00e9e que le jeux-vid\u00e9o est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement capable de nous offrir, surtout \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. L'on se retrouve plut\u00f4t devant une \u00e9tudiante en art qui va rapidement se retrouver embarqu\u00e9e dans une aventure faite de proph\u00e9ties, qui va la d\u00e9passer. Pour son h\u00e9ro\u00efne, le jeu vaut d\u00e9j\u00e0 le coup. April nous gratifiera tr\u00e8s souvent de ses pens\u00e9es et de ses sarcasmes par le biais d'un journal intime ou de ses interventions dans les conversations. Amusante, coh\u00e9rente et tr\u00e8s humaine, April Ryan est un personnage comme ont aimerait en voir plus souvent. Il en va de m\u00eame pour les personnages secondaires. M\u00eame si l'on \u00e9chappera pas aux st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes du genre (Le Mentor, le gros m\u00e9chant despotique, le sidekick (R\u00f4le tenu par un Corbeau. Oui, un piaf.) , ils sont tr\u00e8s bien \u00e9crit et, pour la plupart, tr\u00e8s amusant. J'ai d'ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9ablement surpris par la qualit\u00e9 des doublages et du jeu d'acteur. Pour l'\u00e9poque, les doubleurs sont tr\u00e8s bien dans leur r\u00f4le et c'est tant mieux car ils \u00e9nooooooooorm\u00e9ment de choses \u00e0 dire.\n\nC'est un fait, le jeu est tr\u00e8s bavard et c'est, malheureusement, souvent pour ne rien dire. L'on se retrouve pas mal de fois devant des dialogues \u00e0 rallonge. Si, quelques fois, c'est justifi\u00e9 et am\u00e8ne des informations du lore, d'autres fois j'ai vraiment ressenti comme une impression de remplissage assez d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able. L'\u00e9poque n'aidant pas, la mise en sc\u00e8ne statique est parvenue \u00e0 me laisser d\u00e9crocher lors de quelques dialogues ce qui, toutefois, n'a pas g\u00ean\u00e9 ma progression.\n\nAu niveau des graphismes ... Mince quoi, le jeu n'a pas pris de coup d'vieux. Malgr\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution bloqu\u00e9e, les paysages sont somptueux et la mod\u00e9lisation est tr\u00e8s correcte pour la fin des ann\u00e9es 90. Le jeu va nous faire voyager et vous allez r\u00e9ellement \"voir du pays\". L'on \u00e9vitera cependant pas les aller-retour typique des jeux du genre mais cela ne g\u00e8nera nullement les habitu\u00e9s. \n\n\nBref, The Longest Journey est, pour moi, un incontournable. Un jeu qui sera parvenu \u00e0 me happer d\u00e9s les premi\u00e8res sc\u00e8nes. Un jeu coh\u00e9rent de sa narration, coh\u00e9rent dans ses paysages et son \u00e9criture. Un jeu onirique, \u00e0 l'ambiance unique. Je ne suis absolument pas d\u00e9\u00e7u d'en avoir fait l'acquisition et le recommande \u00e0 tout ceux qui h\u00e9siteraient \u00e0 faire \"le grand saut\".

It's easy to follow, but also deeper than you'll initially think, going into the game. Puzzles are challenging, but not impossible.

I am glad I gave \"The Longest Journey\" the chance, it didn't meet all those I stated, but it Indeed does have a fantastic story with great characters and settings. At first I did not really get into the game as it was a \"Point & Click\" type of game, plus it is quite old being released in 1999, with a few graphical tweaks I got the game working and looking decent with rendering issues. \n\nTo be quite frankly honest I did start this game quite some time ago, but never really got into it and put it aside, and I am glad I gave it a second chance as I could not stop and was always wondering what would happen next as the story picked up and drove me in.\n\nSo I'll give a basic overview of the story but I won't touch on it too much as I don't want to give too much away.\nYou are April Ryan, an 18 year old girl who ran away from home and moved to a new city to start a new life at an Art School Academy, working at a crummy cafe and living in a tiny room in a bording house with fellow students and friends. Stark is a futuristic world, in which you live in you yourself live in a place called \"Newport\". Life is going okay, your \"average\" student life and attempting to keep yourself alive with little pay until one day everything changes. April starts having strange dreams, and soon these strange things and creatures start burrowing into the real world, a mysterious man named \"Cortez\" helps you and guides you to your destiny. He tells and shows you a whole new world called \"Arcadia\" in which only \"Shifters\" can travel too, and April unknowingly is a Shifter, during her journey between Two World to restore the \"Balance\", April must confront many different trials in order to prepare for restoring the Balance, along the way she meets new friends that help her on her Journey. April has alot to take in, she must keep her sanity and focus on saving both worlds, as she only has a few days to do it.\n\nThe Gameplay, \"The Longest Journey\" is a point and click game, which I didn't mind after awhile I got used to it. That being said this game is quite \"Hard\", keep that in mind as it forces you to obtain items, combine items, and use items at certain moments, It may sound simple as I word it but It can become a mind bottling headache to attempt to figures out what to do next, there is also ridiculuous puzzles combinations such as \"The Rubber Ducky\" and others that will make you cringe when you do finnaly figure it out (If your lucky enough), most people tend to just look up a walkthrough though I prefer to figure it out myself. Let your imagination run wild with combining items, trust me the \"stupidest\" combo or use of an item you can think of will probably help you proceed to the next part of the game.\n\nThe Dialogue system is something I really enjoyed, your conversations can have many different turn outs depending on what you choose to say, you can be mean and crude or friendly and nice even silly in your responses to characters. April also keeps a Diary that you can access in the menu and ready her thoughts on her day to day activities, and struggles with everything that is occuring, all your dialogue you have chosen is also stored in the menu.\n\nOverall the game can be difficult, but the pay off is from the Story, Environment & Characters you meet along the way (Also the cheesy voice acting). This game has lots of great references to things in real life which is quite funny, but please note this game does have alot of Profanity in it (Swearing, Sexual References etc..) its better suited for an older audience.\n\nThe Longest Journey is a game that is hard to get into at first, but once you finnaly do it does certainly pay off.", "timestamp_created": 1455489263, "timestamp_updated": 1456008212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21212058": {"recommendationid": "21212058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058023128", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455404913}, "language": "english", "review": "Though, the visuals have aged quite some bit, the story of this game does not fail to deliver.

It's a monumental game, and one I can't recommend enough that people play.\n\nThe best thing about The Longest Journey is, hands down, its story. You play April Ryan, and young art student who's just found out she's a \"shifter\" - a chosen one who has to maintain the balance between two worlds - Arcadia, a world of magic, and Stark, a world of technology. Both worlds are rich in lore and fascinating to explore, and the characters you explore with are witty and charming. There's never a dull moment in The Longest Journey. \n\nI think my favorite things about the game is the way it breaks stereotypes. Not just in our protagonist, considering female protagonists were very rare at that time, but the twist at the end. The subversion of the \"chosen one\" trope so frequent in fantasy stories was really awesome to me, even though it was heartbreaking in execution. The ending to the game broke my heart, I'd grown so close to April and her sidekick, Crow, that seeing them both suffer disappointment made me so sad. It was an amazing feeling to connect with characters like that, and one reason I'll always recommend The Longest Journey.\n\nOne thing to remember about The Longest Journey is that it was released in 1999. It's a seventeen year old game, as of writing. But it still warrants saying... the graphics didn't age well. The backgrounds actually still look really pretty, but the characters look really blocky and low-res. For people who are used to realistic, high res textures, it can be jarring. Still, it's worth it to try to appreciate this game for what it was at the time of its release. Along with the graphics, another product of its age is the bugs. I didn't encounter a ton, but the ones I did were frustrating. There was a particular issue with saving and loading saves that I kept having, I couldn't overwrite a save spot and I couldn't load a save while playing, without the game crashing. Thankfully, that was the only major one I encountered, and I was able to play through the whole game without too many problems as long as I didn't mess with saving too much.\n\nOutside of the age, my other complaint was a pretty typical one for adventure games - some of the puzzles just don't make sense. Here's looking at you, rubber ducky. There were some really great puzzles in The Longest Journey, but I found it got bogged down by what I can only describe as video game logic. You basically have to scour environments for random objects just because. It doesn't make sense in the actual game's logic, we just do it because we know we'll need that random piece of chewing gum later down the line. \n\nHowever, frustrating puzzles aside, this game is truly great. Experience the story for yourself.

I decided to play TLJ1 first. Kinda regretting it, but I'd still play this game if I were to make the choice again.\n\nWaaaaaaaay too many slow, expositions of dialogues that made me want to pull my hair out, and at times I felt I was forcing myself through the game when it got to those long, never-ending dialogues. Everyone was so long-winded I wanted to scream at them. But, I am not one to skip dialogue/scenes, so I always want to make sure I squeeze out every answer for every available question. Since I don't like to cheat with the walkthroughs unless I'm stuck, that part on that Alatian Island or something was excrutiating to say the least. \n\nIn terms of character development, April, the MC, was at times very annoying, but other times ok or bordering likeable. I liked Crow, however. Overall April and Crow did make me laugh a few times, so out of the painful monologues there were a few gem lines here and there. At least the characters themselves sometimes acknowledge that other characters sounded corny and fake as hell.\n\nVoice acting - uh. Sometimes they just got on my nerves, sorry. The villains especially...so typical, those villainy voices. Anyhow I was not impressed but voice acting is not a deal-breaker for me considering I played FFX and still really liked it.\n\nThe good thing about the game was naturally the mystery solving and adventuring parts - they were fun, and some were not very obvious so I had to look up walkthroughs. Would have liked more of those as opposed to monologs, but thankfully I remember Dreamfall was a vast improvement. I didn't have high expectations about the adventuring part, since it was a fairly old game.\n\nI won't say anything about how the game looked, because again it's an old game so my expectations were low. Needless to say I'm looking forward to healing my eyes somewhat when I replay Dreamfall.\n\nIn terms of plot, I didn't really like the whole deal with the destiny/prophecy cliches - those were too convenient and my brain does not really like those plot devices. Overall, however, the game was a decent journey. Would have liked more wrapping up at the end, but meh I guess I'll just play Dreamfall to refresh on what happens after that. [SPOILER] All I remember from Dreamfall was this little creepy girl telling the MC to save April Ryan, and that I thought April was a b*tch[/SPOILER]\n\nAll in all I can only say I'm neutral about this game.

All characters are fully voiced and the acting mostly lives up to a high standard. The semi-orchestral soundtrack is also amazing and boasts some very memorable themes.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly standard point-and-click-fare. There are a few particularly obnoxious spots where the solutions can only be found by randomly combining things without any clear logic behind it (yes, duck clamp rope, I'm referring to you). All in all, much like the graphics, the puzzles are something of a weak link but still solid enough to not detract from the overall experience.\n\nThe story is the main attraction here. Combining scifi and fantasy the plot reaches some epic heights. It might start a little slow, but in my opinion it only makes it feel even more grand when it eventually starts picking up momentum. The story goes into some pretty dark places, and you might be in for a more mature experience than you may first think. When it came out and I first played it, I'd never heard so much swearing in a video game. Of course the industry has changed a lot during the years, and that aspect will probably not be as much of a shocker as it was then.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story, especially if they're into scifi or fantasy.

This type of game is not his 'genre', but he will sit and watch me go through it like he's viewing a movie, and pretty much, that's what this game is good about doing.  It's a slow moving movie, with a great plot and characters that you help move along.\n\nI even remembered the rubber ducky outside the window right off!  That's how long lasting this game stays with you.  I loaded the game, went through the opening sequence, and as soon as April was in her apartment I declared \"There is a rubber duck outside this window that I have GOT to get right now!\"\n\nI'm not a puzzle person, at all.  So that aspect of the game has always had me pulling my hair out, but I'm excited to take this game on as a 30 year old and not as impatient 14 year old, who'd give up and find a guide online to just get through it.\n\nLong story short:  If you love point-and-click stories.  Get this one.  It is most definitely my favorite of all time.  Right after that, find Syberia and Syberia II.

Make that stroll. Saunter? She's obviously in no hurry. Okay, looks like she's finally there now. Now? No, now. There. Several minutes later you can start her walking to her next destination.

One of logic and technology, and one of magic and chaos. They are kept separated and in order by this \"Guardian\" character, who spends a 1000 years or so before being replaced.

(har har)\n\nTo be completely fair, the graphics are, as expected, very dated. But as an avid fan of the old point 'n' clicks, that came as no surprise to me. That being said, the static backgrounds were often very good and at times even striking. Gave me that warm nostalgic feeling without ever causing any real troubles with seeing items or what is going on.\n\nProbably the highest compliment I can give to such a game is to say that I almost never came out of a puzzle still feeling frustrated. For illustration, let me compare this title to some of the old Sierra games (which I adore): frequently in Sierra games, you would either spend hours banging your head against the wall or break down and look up a hint to get you through some tough puzzles only to find that you needed to:\n[olist]\n[*]pound the wall next door to \n[*]knock a painting off the wall which \n[*]fell on a rat to stun him then\n[*]pick up the rat and\n[*]choose the correct dialog choices to make him bite you\n[*]wipe your bleeding hand on your napkin in order to\n[*]finally get the red pocket square you've been needing.\n[/olist]\nYes, this kind of makes sense. But no level of thought would have ever led you to that conclusion on your own. So usually, you are left to wander around trying every verb on every noun in the blasted game until the solution just falls into your lap. Not a very rewarding feeling.\n\nOn the other hand, TLJ only incited that feeling once or twice. True, some of the puzzles were especially easy -- perhaps [i]too[/i] easy -- but I went through the story feeling smart and engaged. \n\nThe last compliment I can give this game applies to the series (and studio) in general, but also applies here. Funcom/Red Thread are great at making their games inclusive (e.g. female protagonist, racial diversity, different sexualities) which really adds to the immersion for me. Being in a world that more accurately reflects the real world creates depth and allows me to get swept up on a journey of my own.\n\nThis is now one of my all-time favorite point-and-clicks and games and series. 5/5", "timestamp_created": 1436507953, "timestamp_updated": 1436508267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709364", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16967991": {"recommendationid": "16967991", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988328815", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436490375}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a really complicated time playing this one.

Soundtracks and voice actings are one of the bests ever, presentation is amazing and this game is simply P.E.R.F.E.C.T.\nAlthough most of the new-gen gamers out there will not going to enjoy this because this game didnt aged well for them, but if you are a person who likes to try completely new and difficult things, give this game a shot. \n\n[h1] Pros[/h1]\n- Amazingly designed worlds(Stark,Arcadia) and wonderful art design in them\n- One of the best atmospheres in video game history\n- Great presentation mixing real life into fantasy\n- All characters are wonderfully designed, they have realistic personalities.\n- Wonderful puzzles, the best in video game history in my opinion\n- Awesome gameplay\n- Great soundtracks\n- Amazing voice acting\n- More than 35 hours of non-repititive playtime\n\n[h1] Cons:[/h1]\nNone\n\n\nOverall Score: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1435969939, "timestamp_updated": 1435969939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694954", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16851277": {"recommendationid": "16851277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058687420", "num_games_owned": 614, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435872306}, "language": "english", "review": "I came to The Longest Journey expecting a classic, critically aclaimed point & click adventure with a great story, and the game really delivered. This has to be one of the best written games I have ever played, without any exaggeration. \n\nThe thing with game plots and game characters is that we usually compare them to other game plots and characters when we praise them, so \"slightly less superficial than everything else\" gets named \"brilliant writing\". The Longest Journey's writing could easily have been a book or a good movie screenplay however, and it definitely is shockingly better than most games I can name. Characters have personalities, distinct voices, motivations, relationships, lives. Their conversations make sense and are interesting. You get to care about everyone, and you can empathize with your down-to-earth yet epically heroic protagonist. The world-building and exposition never feels like a boring dictation that you need to click through to go on. Even the in-game Diary serves an actual purpose, adds to the story and delivers hints in writing that you really want to read. There is drama and silly jokes, grand adventures that get toned down with humor, an epic sci-fi/fantasy save-the-world plot with twists that make actual sense and don't leave gaping plotholes behind. It's all quite a feat, especially considering the theme.\n\nAnd yes, the graphics didn't age all that great, the gameplay doesn't reinvent the wheel, there's the long back and forth running through mutiple screens to patiently wait for, and some of the puzzles are what you'd expect from classic point & click adventures - namely not all that brilliant.

Sure, there are plenty of puzzles to solve, but it's the story that will have you hooked. You play as April Ryan, an artist who moved to Venice from the countryside,  who is struggling to make ends meet in her art career. Everything changes when she meets a man named Cortez, where she gets herself into a plot to save both worlds of order (science) and chaos (magic).\n\nGameplay is presented in the usual 'point and click' fashion. You click on areas of the map to move April, double clicking will make her run. You can press 'escape' to skip animations (if you allowed this in the options menu) and dialogue if you just want to progress through the story quickly (although I recommend not to skip the dialogue as you may miss important information). You can interact with characters and objects by simply clicking on them. There is an inventory system which allows you to store and use items to solve the puzzles. The puzzles  may be a bit tricky to solve as your not given a clear indication of where to go and how to solve the puzzles, which makes you refer to the 'trial and error' approach. Other times you will be moving back and forth areas due to some fetch quests. The store page says the game will last you '40 + hours' although I completed it in about 17 hours through using a wlakthrough (because I wanted to progress the story, without dealing with the puzzles).\n\nThe graphics are somewhat outdated in this current age. 3D-models are a bit blocky and the textures aren't as detailed as other games in the genre. Having said that, they do a decent job at setting the atmosphere in the various environments you roam in. The CG movies haven't aged well either.\n\nPlot is where this game trully shines. The story is unique and will keep you guessing as it unravels. Voice acting of the main characters (especially April herself) is excellent and believeable, minor characters voice acting are somewhat mediocre. Your emotions will be tested here as you will feel a sense of wonder and awe, fear, laughs and a bit of sadness as the you progress though the story.

If you are a gamer who cares about a great story in your games, this is one not to miss. \nThe gameplay, as you would expect, is of the classic point-and-click type, mainly focusing on talking to various characters, picking up and interacting with various objects, and using those objects in various combinations to solve a range of puzzles to progress the story. In truth, many of the puzzles in this game are obtuse to the point of being annoying, but there are plenty of walkthroughs around if you don't want to beat your head against them and want to simply enjoy the wonderful story.\nGiven that the game was originally released in 1999, its graphics have aged quite badly, even through they were lauded at the time for being pretty cutting edge. Fortunately, point-and-click adventures do not depend heavily on fancy graphics to be playable, so its not a gamebreaking issue.

Those people who claim it's one of/the best adventure game? They're right.\nI'm still digesting it so this will be rambly (and is more for myself as an aide-memoire in any case) so yeah.\n\nIt's from 1999/2000 and it shows, it only supports 640x480 for a start, the background pre-rendered stuff is still fine but many of the characters haven't aged as well. Mechanically though it still plays well, the only issue is with hot-points - there's no way of highlighting them you just have to sweep the screen with the cursor and hope you discover everything. There was at least one puzzle which had me stumped as I just hadn't seen the object I needed to interact with.\nHaving said that - the puzzles are really not the point here, this is clearly all about the story.\n\nThe story. Where to begin?\nYou are April Ryan a young art student struggling to come up with a painting for her college's end of year exhibition. Lately she's been plagued by nightmares, but is it from the stress of her painter's block or is it from the uncomfortable heatwave? (Of course we know better but [i]she[/i] doesn't)\nThat's essentially your introduction to what is probably one of the best realised worlds in an adventure. Often these games can suffer from a feeling of 'flatness' - that the locations are just sets, the characters props. But the writing here gives almost all the characters just enough depth to avoid this and all with a nice light touch so it's mostly done through allusions and conversations without ever feeling forced or like it's trying to make a specific statement. All of this has almost no bearing on the actual game either, it's just there to flesh out the world and it does a marvellous job. One character will confide in you about her concerns for a mutual friend with bad taste in men but you won't get the details as your character already knows them, and the game makes no judgement on this friend - that's just how she is. It's little elements like this that make the world and make you care about these characters so you do fear for them and want to help them.\n\nThat's just the background cast, April herself is a wonderfully believable (and likable) protagonist. She doesn't really know what she's doing, or even what she wants to do. She'll worry whether she is actually doing the right thing or if she even can do the right thing. She gets frustrated when characters are obtuse or cryptic rather than just answering her questions. She's witty but doesn't necessarily get along with everyone. A nice touch is that all the objects in the game are described from her point of view, so if she doesn't know she'll just guess or quote Star Wars because it looks a bit like the Death Star.\n\nWhich incidentally reminds me that the voice acting is all extremely well done and just adds to the characters (Crow and Captain Nebevay, I'm looking at thee).\n\nShe also keeps a diary as you progress through the game, and for a change it is an actual diary - usually it'll just be your quest log or a straight up history of what you've done. Here it's her view on what's happening, often the fears or thoughts that you wouldn't necessarily bring up in conversation. Again, this has no impact on the game and you could easily progress without even noticing it's there - it adds nothing beyond an enjoyable insight into the character.\n\nYeah, this really is an excellent story well told.\n\nTrying to think of anything similar and the only thing that pops into my head is Beyond Good And Evil, a normal extremely likable/human protagonist who just wants peace and quiet but gets unwillingly caught up in things and a well-realised world that you're just dumped in and left to figure it out from conversations and interactions.\n\nIt isn't Lara Croft or some devil-may-care adventurer, it's just a normal young woman who's ashamed to admit she's a little bit scared of the old homeless guy who hangs around her neighbourhood, and who hates her sleazy neighbour who keeps propositioning her despite repeated rejections.\n\nThe best adventure game?

There's a lot of blah-blah about these people and that culture, but you don't *see* it. Much of the important information you need to know to progress is just dumped on you. There is no pacing and it becomes somewhat overwhelming (there is a conversation log that is helpful).The story itself was interesting enough, but the vast majority of characters are *not* particularly memorable (despite what many appear to claim). In fact, most of them are intolerable. 75% of the male characters are literally the exact same grumpy, horrendously sexist piece of shit, but with a different face. So if you're looking for something deep story-wise, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nI don't even feel like I know the main character. Aside from the very beginning, very little time is spent getting to know April Ryan - every interaction becomes about the main plot or the universe's lore, and we learn about these sexist side characters a lot more than we ever learn about her. There is no meaningful character development. Despite its title there is no emotional journey for April Ryan - she seems to take things in stride pretty well all things considered. The only thing I know for sure is that she is frequently on the receiving end of sexual harassment and/or discrimination.\n\nI won't lie. I liked it enough to finish it - and I don't regret playing it (not too much, anyway). But I would definitely *not* recommend it and I would not say it was a good game. If it's on sale REALLY cheap and you have nothing better to play, sure. The puzzles were pretty good - you have to be creative and they were relatively satisfying to solve. I was more interested in what puzzles lay waiting than the progression of the story.

By the end of the game, for whatever reason, I had fallen a little bit in love with the world(s) this adventure spans. So it's a yes, but with some warnings.\n\nThis game was created at a time when 3D graphics technology, even pre-rendered, was quite limited. It shows, big time. The characters are chunks of polygons and the animations in particular are quite absurd. Like, unintentional humor absurd. Nonetheless, I could see how this could be visually captivating for people-- 14 years ago. I didn't come into this game expecting anything other than dated graphics but it is not a game that has aged well in that respect.\n\nIn terms of \"gameplay,\" there isn't a whole lot of it. It's an adventure game, so it comes with the territory that a lot of your time will be spent walking about and taking in the storytelling. This game felt like 80% of it was just spent listening to people talk. There's just a lot to listen to. At times, especially towards the first half, it can seem very slow just listening to all the talking. But there are eventually puzzles to solve. Unfortunately they're not good puzzles. If you're familiar with adventure games, you'll know there are right ways to do puzzles and wrong ways to do them. TLJ does them the wrong way. I was forced to consult a walkthrough [i]several[/i] times in order to progress, and the things I was \"missing\" were always ridiculous.\n\nThe defining (if not redeeming) aspect of any adventure game of course is the storyline. Despite a funky opening, The Longest Journey doesn't exactly dash out of the gate. The aforementioned long-winded dialogues quickly reveal a diverse cast, but they're not all what I would necessarily consider \"fascinating.\" Unfortunately the voice acting is extremely uneven. Rarely, it's quite good, but occasionally it's plain terrible, and often it's just \"off\" enough to keep it from being believable. The game is ambitious; it really tries for a lot of drama with developed characters and action and humor, and the acting really doesn't sell it. Admittedly, 14 years ago, it was probably pretty impressive. So the game throws you into the \"Journey\" with really little reason to be interested in it, largely because you're not sure what's supposed to be going on. Then soon enough things get weird, and you start getting a sense of the scope of all this weirdness, but it honestly feels pretty cheesy. For some reason it was enough to keep me coming back to playing TLJ again and again (it IS a long journey), and eventually the game lulled me into appreciating the depth of its story. I became numb to the games flaws and was left to contemplate how thorough a world was created here, particularly the many characters and their stories, and how they all together belong to something bigger. Still, it isn't fantastic, but it is something rather special. By the end, I was glad to have met them, awkward as some of them may have come across at first.\n\nThe Longest Journey was clearly a very ambitious adventure, and while it may not have aged so well, you can still sense the vision of the creators as something that is quite remarkable. The game's ending can be described as unsatisfying, but moreso than leaving a bad taste in my mouth it just left me wanting more. And, as it turns out, there is more.

It is easy to get frustrated with the pace of the game, however. Several people I know gave up after the first few chapters, and I almost fell into that trap, but it's well worth persevering through the endless *walking* (even with double-click or Escape to make her run, the protagonist seems agonisingly slow sometimes) and the extremely linear puzzles which sometimes have the oddest and most unlikely solutions.

But after a reaserch i made i found out that its an awsome game but if you havn't played \"The longest journy\" you'll be lost, and wont know whats it about.\n\nSo i remembered i had the game already, and started palying it from scratch, this time paying atention more closely to the story telling.\n\nThe actual review:\nSo the game has a very very rich story telling, The chracters in this game each have its own uniqe personality and history, which is manifested in very rich dialogs between the characters, the vocie acting is Holywood worthy, top notch voice acting. You get really sucked in to the story and conversations. the chracters really show personality, with their own humor, dilemas, downfalls and positives. This game is all about story telling. \nThe gameplay is very simple, and you have some very cool and excelently written puzzles which includes everything from solving \"code\" sequances, to manipulating people with object to, for example, go away from a place, or give you something. you also have dialog pussles where you have to make the right dialog to get something. \nBut it shines in story telling. everything is connected, and you actually find yourself rimembering parts of the story and understanding what is happening in the story. There is a clear line of story trouggout the game.\n\nShould you buy it? \nIf you want to buy Dreamfall:Chapters, this is than a MUST. since Chpaters builds uppon the first game.\nIf you would buy an Indie pixalated game for a few bucks, and you dont accept action but logics, than you should buy this game. It may have old graphics, but so do many indie games today and those are on purpose.\nAnd the main thing about this game, the story, the chracters and the voice acting, these all make you forget your playing a pixalated game (the game also has sound fx which really contribute to the atmosphere).\nIf your a fan of cyberpunk themes in games than you should also buy this game.\n\nFor an old game, this game deserves a very high score, since its really the 90's equivalent of \"Bioshock:infinite\" or \"Last of us\", that is story whise. So on my scale this game is a 9.5/10.\neven today its highly playable, and enjoyable and a must if you want Dreamfall:chapters.", "timestamp_created": 1417450373, "timestamp_updated": 1417450373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13113274": {"recommendationid": "13113274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010825816", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427977474}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe I'm becoming old but I find this game very boring.

I had read about it from the PC magazines in 1999/2000 when it came out and I've always found it quite interesting. Why it took so long for me to finally play the game? I don't know. But I'm really really glad I finally did play it!\n\nThe Longest Journey is a point-and-click adventure game in which the player takes control of an 18-year-old fine arts student April Ryan. The events of the game take place in the year 2209 and the futuristic city of Newport is quite believable. April suffers from strange nightmares and is stressed out to finish her artwork for an upcoming exhibition. Soon she is pulled into a dangerous adventure of fantasy and magic, and all her former petty teenager problems turn pretty meaningless, as a far larger destiny is waiting for her to be fulfilled.  I don't want to give away too much the story \u2014 less you know, more enjoyable it is.\n\nApril's is a likeable character. Luckily she's quite a mature gal for a 18-year-old! She can be a bit whiny and sarcastic sometimes, but mostly she's great and well-written. The pre-millenial 3D graphics don't add much for the character, but the voice-acting is superb. Sarah Hamilton does an outstanding performance as April. There are also many other memorable characters.\n\nAs mentioned, the 3D graphics haven't aged that well. Don't get me wrong, the game's still charming looking and all, but especially the 3D character models and some of the cutscenes are quite cringeworthy. They have the \"late nineties awkward 3D graphics look\". The voice-acting and overall sound are great.\n\nControls are basic point-and-click stuff and you cannot die or screw up \u2014 just the way I like my point-and-click adventure games. Some of the puzzles are kinda strange and \u201dout there\u201d. I had to check out a walkthrough a few times. It took me about 13 hours to beat the game.\n\nThe detail of the story and all the small things are quite baffling. April keeps a journal throughout the game's story and it really feels like it's written by a young girl. The journal is not necessary at all, but adds detail to this masterpiece and a lost player can find some clues while reading it.\n\nTl;dr: A fine quality point-and-click classic with a compelling story, a highly detailed world and great characters. The graphics are a bit dated. Some of the puzzles are ass.

However, although LucasArts certainly perfected the genre, and gave the world the SCUMM system, they by no means make the only good games.\n\nAll the way back to the Atari ST with games like Erebus, or Obitus, there have been some intriguing and wonderful games.  Even \"Scoop\" back on the Archimedes was fascinating in its own way.  But technology has moved on.  Branching story lines, throwaway disk space, FMV, voiceovers, you name it.       The main thing which more modern computers allows is for a variety of backgrounds, sounds and models.     This allows the game creators to generate a less homogenous world, giving you more of a sense of adventure.   How many old PaC games have spent their entire time wandering around the same desert island, or the same metallic city?\n\nThe Longest Journey isn't made by a mainstream distributor, like EA or LucasArts.  It snuck under the radar, and has sat on shelves in stores, or on Steam for a long time, with an unattractive, amateurish-looking advert.  the postive reviews, however, show that underneath a game that outwardly looks decidedly second or third-tier (like some of the \"hidden object\" games, is a compelling, almost-first-tier game.\n\nThe game starts off strange, and remains delightfully off-kilter all the way through.    It really leverages the universe that it's set in, to allow fast, interesting scene changes.   The artwork is luscious, and the voice acting is both hilarious, and excellent.  The music's pretty good too.  It's very satisfying to solve puzzles, and you get a genuine flow of story.  Solving a puzzle doesn't leave you thinking \"now what?\".  The in-game journal provides an amazing amount of back-story and hints.\n\nSo, why do I say it's only \"almost\" a first-tier game? Well, it has a few kinks.  Although it plays perfectly well on a Windows-7 PC, it is ageing.  The FMV is older-style \"3DSMax\" rendering, with high compression (Think Tomb Raider 2 FMV).    Also, it's short.  Don't let my playtime fool you, I had the game minimized for a lot of the time.  I actually finished it in about 6 or 7 hours.      But the length, and the slightly \"B-grade\" FMV isn't what knocks it off the top spot, it's the habit that the game has, of breaking its own rules.  I'll explain:-\n\nThe game is a series of \"compartments\", You finish everything that's within one compartment, using everything that's in that area, and then you move through to the next one.   This is pretty standard PaC fare, actually.  Early in the game, you get access to the \"Metro\", which allows simultaneous access to the the next compartment, while allowing access to previous ones.   9/10 times, re-visiting those older areas does you no good at all, you just go to the next 'opened up area'.\n\nHowever, there are a few times in the game where you hit a brick wall.  You're trying to \"use everything-on-everything\" (uEoE)  in the usual PaC way, but nothing's helping.  The only thing to do it backtrack to an earlier area, and do the uEoE approach again, in the hope that you get a different outcome.    Sometimes it makes a kind of sense... often you scratch your head and think \"uhh.. that makes NO sense, I could have easily done that THIS way, if the game had let me\".   \n\nTo attempt to reduce the futility, the game flashes objects when you hover them over each other, to show that it's a valid response to uEoE, but you're still dragging, clicking and right-clicking for literally HOURS until you find that (for example- changing the objects, but not the logic), using the \"PEPPER SPRAY\"  (obtained in area 5) on the \"DUCK\" (in area 3), will cause a door to open in Area 7. Why? Because eventually, after going through the door, you need to go back to where the duck was sitting to get the next piece of dialog, which is dependent on going through the door in area 5.  This is just after you have used the \"BREAD\" on the \"DUCK\", and have had a piece of dialog that says \"Ok, I better leave him alone then\".     Hmmm.  Why go back and bother the duck, when the game just told me not to.\n\nSo, I had to resort to the walkthrough a few times because i'd spent too long uEoE and the combinatorial complexity was teeing me off.   There is another puzzle where the hint just isn't good enough to let you know how to solve it, and the combinatorial complexity is something like  4x6x6x6x6  to just get it \"randomly\" right..  A futher hint which doesn't ruin the puzzle completely reduces this to just 2x2x2 (telephone puzzle).\n\nDespite this, I had a wonderful time exploring the interesting world.   For a \"indie\", this is amazingly well made.  The outtakes at the end are great too.   \n\nI totally recommend playing it if you like PaC games which focus a little more on the cyberpunk / fantasy / sci-fi realm.   It's not \"Blade Runner\" or \"The Dig\", but you'll really enjoy its humour and setting.

I saw the trailers for Dreamfall Chapters and wanted to play the first games to get caught up on the story. \n\nThe Longest Journey is definitely a \"classic\" adventure game. It has all the pixel hunting, item combining, and obscure puzzles that are the hallmark of the genre. I admit I don't particularly enjoy this aspect of adventure games, and am glad to see it mostly absent from more modern adventures. GameFAQs was my constant companion while playing this game, and thankfully kept it from becoming frustrating. The graphics are very... 640x480, and while I can usually look past dated graphics in older games, there were points where it was difficult to tell what an object was, or what was going on in a scene, simply from lack of resolution/polygons. \n\nI don't want to sound too hard on the game, because I actually loved it. Definitely the strongest point of the game (and why I think it's remembered so fondly) is the fantastic writing and memorable characters. April Ryan feels like a *real* person, and talks like a real person would. I loved talking to Burns Flipper or Captain Nebevay or Crow just to hear what they had to say. Admittedly sometimes people can be long-winded or launch into overlong explanations, but it never really detracted from the game. The story too, while at times dropping into fantasy cliches and being the Chosen One (TM) who can save the world, was still really interesting and mostly unique. \n\nThe Longest Journey is still a great game despite its technical/gameplay flaws, and if you're looking to get into the Longest Journey/Dreamfall series like I was, it's definitely worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1415767531, "timestamp_updated": 1415767531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726298", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12851195": {"recommendationid": "12851195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030149380", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415381579}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this I wanted to give it a really bad review.

The odds of it becoming a success were slim.\n\nHowever, writer Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist knows how to assemble a compelling, quirky and funny story that captures the hearts and minds of many gamers.  For this reason, TLJ has become one of the best adventure games of all time.  \n\nFemale characters in video games don't always have complexity, but April Ryan is one of the most interesting characters I have ever encountered.  It is a joy to observe her grow as a person as I play, from a woman unsure of her future and place in the world to a savior of the people.  \n\nAlso, I love how T\u00f8rnquist successfully blends both cyberpunk and fantasy elements together to create a unique narrative.  \n\nI don't recall encountering a nonsensical puzzle, either, which is a flaw that some adventure games have.\n\nUpdate:  It's still a wonderful game and I played through it again because I've been going through a TLJ binge, but I had some trouble getting the game to display correctly even though it had worked for me in the past.

Then and now the graphics don't hold up terribly well, but considering that it was launched in 2000 I'd say it's not that bad. However even now the voice acting, story and dialogue are still fantastic after all this time and it's in these areas that Longest Journey truly shines. Like a good book you can't put down, I was sucked into the story immediately and hardly noticed the time passing until looking at the clock to see that it was the middle of the night.

However, there are relatively few of these genre-related problems given how long ago this game was launched.\n\nThe one glaring problem that may make this game unplayable for some people is the graphics - if you can't stand fairly blocky character models and low-res textures then this may not be the game for you (just check out the screenshots on the store page to get a good idea). Out of all the re-make games coming out, this is a game that deserves an HD remake.

And thus begins a long journey (huehuehue) to keep the Balance between these worlds protected by finding and restoring the lost Guardian of said Balance.\n\nAdmittedly, the story isn't much of a contender for \"greatest ever\" - it is certainly [i]good[/i], and sure as hell kept me wanting to find out what was next, but many elements will stand out to you as having been done many times before, and possibly even a little annoying at times.\n\nNo, what really makes the game work are the characters. In particular, April herself, who is one of the best protagonists in the world of video gaming, demonstrating an impressive range of emotions and reactions to everything that happens. You are well-advised to query as much in this game as you can - every comment, every snark that April makes on examined people/objects is another glimpse at her personality, and few characters are so well developed as her.\n\nThe gameplay itself is generally well-done for point-and-click fare, although admittedly the story sometimes works against it - there were times when I wanted to find out badly what happened next and was immediately confronted with an annoying puzzle, eventually leading me to consult a guide for puzzle hints so as to minimize wasted time. If this happens to you as well, I wouldn't worry too much about it, and treat it as a compliment of the story engagement.\n\nWith regards to presentation, it is simply an unfortunate inevitability that the visuals do not hold up well today, although in most cases this shouldn't be too distracting. The music, when noticeable, is generally thematically appropriate, but by no means particularly memorable. Voice acting on the other hand...is generally very well-done.\n\nDefinitely an interesting and memorable game.

But upon doing so I have to tell you two things: This game aged pretty badly. And it hasn\u2019t got old one bit. These two sentences do not constitute a paradox. \n\nBack in the days, the art of TLJ was simply breathtaking, which nowadays clearly isn\u2019t the case. The 2d backgrounds are still impressive, but all the models are old and ugly. If you\u2019re going to play this game in modern times take my advice and override the display settings from your graphic card\u2019s control panel. TLJ really benefits from trilinear filtering.\n\nHaving said that, besides the models and somewhat clunky and dated controls ( though nothing really serious) TLJ remains the most complete adventure game experience I have ever played. The game skilfully balances between the hard dystopian sci-fi and magical fantasy, creating a truly uniqe and extensive storyline, the characters \u2013even these appearing for a few minutes \u2013 are charming and original, and the humor is clever and entertaining. Speaking of characters: the game\u2019s protagonist \u2013 April Ryan \u2013 is perhaps the most developed and unique character in gaming. And also, it should be noted that the game soon turns much more adult and dark than one should expect from a story about girl jumping back and forth between the worlds of magic and reason ( but then it swings back to cheerful fairytale just to get even more serious in the next chapters).\n\nThe voice acting is stunning. Actors do an unforgettable job, especially during the final chapters of the game. This may come up as a surprise since if you pay attention to credits, you will notice that one actor often voices three or four characters.  Furthermore, the dialogues are written in a truly brilliant way \u2013 even the shortest ones are witty and memorable. \n\nWhile it can be argued that after finishing there is nothing much to come back to (there is The Book of Secrets but obviously I won\u2019t tell you what\u2019s inside\u2026), a single playthrough took me 16 hours which is enough time for two point and click games. While the puzzles usually aren\u2019t that difficult (usually\u2026 the rubber ducky puzzle)and don\u2019t take that much time,still there is an INCREDIBLE amount of lore, and some dialogues can take few minutes while characters convey that information. Vestrum Tobias is particularly guilty of that, since he introduces April to the story of the world. Worlds. \n\nThe ending is perhaps the most fulfilled and satisfactory conclusion to a game I have ever seen, but it leaves a sense of melancholy. I will probably play this game in the next ten years just the way I tend to re-read certain books to measure them against the impact of years. This may be the only game in my entire Steam library that I would grade ten out of ten without hesitation. And in the meantime, I\u2019 ll be waiting for The Longest Journey Home\u2026   \n\nPolska recenzja: \n\nKo\u0144cz\u0105c Najd\u0142u\u017csz\u0105 Podr\u00f3\u017c na Steamie z\u0142ama\u0142em jedn\u0105 z najbardziej podstawowych zasad gamingu: Nie mo\u017cna tak po prostu wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do gry kt\u00f3r\u0105 kocha\u0142o si\u0119 wi\u0119cej ni\u017c 10 lat temu i oczekiwa\u0107 \u017ce do\u015bwiadczenie grania w ni\u0105 nie uleg\u0142o zmianie.

I remember playing Sierra's Torrin's Passage when I was a child, and this game hit me with an extra large dose of nostalgia. When it comes to point-and-clickers, The Longest Journey dominates the field and is a classic staple that all people interested in the genre should definitely check out.\n\nIf you like point-and-clickers, expansive storylines, and challenging puzzles, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good, but the graphics are very, very dated. Despite this, the environment and the examinable items (in your inventory) remain well-detailed.The character models are a bit lacking, and this is most evident during cutscenes. The music and ambient sounds are approporiate for the themes presented throughout the game, The story is slightly convulted, but also fairly easy to follow if you take the time to read/listen to the dialogue. Your character records her thoughts in a diary, and these can be helpful for summarizing key details and better understanding the story. Each interactable character provides a good amount of backstory and lore. The voice acting is great, but I personally find the main character's voice a bit irritating.\n\nThe controls are simple and typical of a pount-and-clicker. There is no tutorial - you are simply dropped into the game, however, it is easy to pick up how to play if you experiment for a few minutes. The learning curve id minimal to moderate - the most difficult thing so far being item combinations (a number of the possible item combos are not obvious). I've also picked up A LOT of items, but their value and use have not yet been determined in my playthough. \n\nThe game and story are very cool - the main theme centralizes around two worlds (the magic and non-magic worlds) that can be traversed through \"shifting,\" or moving through portals. At the end of each chapter, you are usually presented with a choice of two options, each potentially moving the story in a different direction. Much of the game involves you combining items and giving them to people, or using them to get more items. You can also \"look\" at certain items in your inventory, and experimenting with clicks on different areas may yield a new item added to your stash. \n\nYou can press \"x\" to show all the exits in an area, and this is useful if you don't want to scan with your mouse for different exit points. There is a metro train system, where you can travel to other unlocked areas freely.\n\nOverall, this game provides a very good point-and-click experience, and I suggest you give it a try if you are interested in that particular type of gameplay. The story is well-written and pretty expansive, so you will be spending a lot of time reading/listening to dialogue (all skippable).\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/djsfsroguereviews]@DJSF's Rogue Reviews[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1408561045, "timestamp_updated": 1408561045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11774205": {"recommendationid": "11774205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042597461", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408410002}, "language": "english", "review": "Very difficult, yet very fun adventure game.

Tablespoons of salt required as condiment to this review.\n\nTLJ is a slow-paced point-and-click RPG with a unique world concept and layered, realistic characters. The story is the primary draw, as it is both well written and executed with complimenting dialogue. You're put in the shoes of an accidental heroine with a personality to match her background as a struggling artist in a cyberpunk-age Venice. She, and many other characters in this game may not be immediately likeable, but are given genuine character devlopment throughout. Well-written characters, the lore and depth of the world are the crowning jewels of this game. It is rare to find such a profound world concept outside a game based on a traditional tabletop RPG system. While the physical exploration of the world is limited to relatively small, contained maps at a time, exploration is achieved hand-in-hand with the storytelling and puzzle-solving and not as an elaborate sidequest. Many secrets and hidden and revealed in dialogue and visuals, and there is more to the world than what April herself sees. You may want to take notes. \n\nIn terms of Roleplaying, you cannot change April's character. You're not entirely playing the game as her, either. The player is like a ghost looking over her shoulder, she will talk to herself more like she's talking to you, but never remark upon your presence.\n\nTo address the gameplay, this is stricthly a point-and-click adventure. You will not be engaged in active combat, you will need to find ways to circumvent conflict and bridge gaps in the road. The puzzles can at times be archaic and occasionally absurd, but if you're patient and put occam's razor to good use you will find your way. If you fail to do this, or simply cannot handle puzzle-solving games, following a guide and playing this game just for the story is still worth it. \n\nThe game's length is about 25-30 hours if you don't spend a lot of time solving the puzzles. This is enough time to unfold an epic cyberpunk/fantasy-hybrid tale in the pace that it deserves. This is a game where you do not start in medias res, and the ending is not rushed; everything happens in due time. \n\nI would recommend this game to lovers of good stories. I do not have enough experience with puzzle-games to remark upon the quality of TLJ as such, but I can say as a well-versed RPG player and bookworm that this is story worth experiencing. TLJ sets its' own expectations and fulfills them.

Trata-se de um adventure bem tradicional, com direito a puzzles muito sem no\u00e7\u00e3o, como o relativamente famoso Rubber Duck; eventual combina\u00e7\u00e3o de itens e in\u00fameras linhas de di\u00e1logo. Mas ele brilha na hist\u00f3ria e, principalmente, em seus personagens. O segundo t\u00edtulo da sequ\u00eancia chama-se Dreamfall (2006) o terceiro, Dreamfall Chapters (2014), atualmente lan\u00e7ado no mesmo formato epis\u00f3dico que a da Telltale.\n\nComecemos pela April Ryan, uma garota do interior que vive numa pousada localizada dentro de uma metr\u00f3pole do s\u00e9culo 23 e \u00e9 estudante de Artes Visuais (rolou at\u00e9 uma identifica\u00e7\u00e3ozinha aqui, hahaha). Para mim, ela \u00e9 uma das, sen\u00e3o a melhor e mais bem-escrita protagonista feminina j\u00e1 concebida para videogames. S\u00e9rio. Embora cada vez mais estejamos presenciando protagonistas incr\u00edveis nos \u00faltimos anos, como as boas surpresas da E3 deste ano, poucas chegam a receber uma profundidade t\u00e3o significativa de psiqu\u00ea e personalidade exploradas.\n\nEm menos de meia hora de gameplay, April faz a ponte necess\u00e1ria para o jogo tornar-se engajante, exprimindo muito de seu carisma e personalidade o qual se sustentar\u00e1 at\u00e9 o fim. H\u00e1 momentos divertid\u00edssimos em que ela faz algum coment\u00e1rio cheio de ironia ou espirituoso, mesmo em situa\u00e7\u00f5es um tanto s\u00e9rias. Ela \u00e9, sem d\u00favidas, uma jovem de 18 anos muito cr\u00edvel, do tipo que voc\u00ea gostaria de ter como amiga. E a qualidade da escrita fica mais foda ainda com a dublagem excepcional de Sarah Hamilton e a qual est\u00e1 participando na continua\u00e7\u00e3o, felizmente.\n\nQuase todo mundo com quem voc\u00ea interage, por mais secund\u00e1rio que seja, \u00e9 surpreendentemente carism\u00e1tico. Dentre eles, h\u00e1 dois dos melhores amigos de April, que frequentam a mesma faculdade: Charlie e Emma. Charlie \u00e9 um cara ador\u00e1vel e gentil que trabalha no The Fringe Caf\u00e9 como atendente e \u00e9 estudante de dan\u00e7a. J\u00e1 Emma \u00e9 especializada em \u201choloescultura\u201d e fica de altas fofocas com a April, al\u00e9m de flertar com frequ\u00eancia. Os tr\u00eas vivem juntos na mesma pousada, The Border House.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria por tr\u00e1s desse t\u00edtulo \u00e9 t\u00e3o bacana que merece um par\u00e1grafo \u00e0 parte. Fiona, dona do local e campe\u00e3 dos di\u00e1logos espirituosos, conta que ela e sua t\u00edmida namorada, Mickey, se inspiraram nas pousadas inglesas cl\u00e1ssicas do interior e decidiram adotar o formato. A ideia \u00e9 que ele serviria como ref\u00fagio pra jovens estudantes e artistas pobres, e o \u201cborda\u201d no nome se d\u00e1 tanto pela dicotomia esp\u00edrito/tecnologia quanto pela pousada estar entre Venice e Newport.\n\nContada como um enorme flashback, a hist\u00f3ria come\u00e7a quando o chamado \u201cguardi\u00e3o do Equil\u00edbrio\u201d some repentinamente do seu local. Em seguida, logo depois que April nos \u00e9 apresentada, ficamos sabendo que existem dois mundos interconectados e os quais come\u00e7am a passar por problemas justamente pela falta do recept\u00e1culo necess\u00e1rio pra manter o Equil\u00edbrio nos eixos. April, por sua vez, se envolve no problema a partir do momento que viaja involuntariamente para o mundo m\u00e1gico de Arcadia durante um sonho. Isso vai se intensificando com o tempo e mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o reveladas atrav\u00e9s de um homem exc\u00eantrico de sotaque carregado chamado Cortez.

Al\u00e9m de, \u00e9 claro, ser vista por muitos como a prov\u00e1vel nova guardi\u00e3 do Equil\u00edbrio, substitu\u00eddo a cada mil anos. A press\u00e3o vem praticamente de todos os lados.\n\nEssa descren\u00e7a diante de um mundo m\u00e1gico, o atrito entre \u201cci\u00eancia\u201d (no sentido do senso comum) e magia, somado ao destino de mundos nas m\u00e3os de uma \u00fanica pessoa pode soar bastante clich\u00ea (e soa mesmo). Mas confie em mim quando digo que o desenvolvimento da hist\u00f3ria vai muito al\u00e9m dessa humilde resenha, mostrando um lore riqu\u00edssimo para esse universo fant\u00e1stico.\n\nNessa (realmente) longa jornada, durando pelo menos umas 20 horas e dividido em 13 cap\u00edtulos, um monte de acontecimentos se desenrola no que equivale a cerca de uma semana no mundo de April. Mas \u00e9 tanta coisa uma atr\u00e1s da outra que eu, pelo menos, tive uma enorme dificuldade de acompanhar tudo =P o que eu escrevi aqui nada mais \u00e9 do que uma mera fra\u00e7\u00e3o do conte\u00fado do jogo.\n\nMesmo se a sua toler\u00e2ncia a adventures mec\u00e2nica e graficamente datados n\u00e3o for das maiores, ou at\u00e9 mesmo se adventures n\u00e3o for sua praia, pegue um guia e d\u00ea uma chance ao jogo.

The world building is amazing, the settings are gorgeous, the voice acting is Hollywood quality, and the story itself is one of the best I've ever seen. If you're like me, and drawn more towards the story in a game than the actual gameplay, buy this immediately. The game is visually stunning, even when you take into account the late-90's CGI characters. Their animations are a bit slow and clunky, but to me, the beautifully rendered 2-D backgrounds more than compensated. And the characters themselves were so well thought out and well-rounded, with stories and lives beyond the game, combined with top notch voice acting, that it makes me care a lot less about what they looked like.\n\nThat being said, I felt the gameplay was a little flat. Some of the puzzles were pretty obscure, and there was a lack of in-game hints (there were times I had absolutely no idea even what puzzle I was meant to solve; I think they really missed the opportunity to make April's diary more helpful in that respect). And, like most point-and-click games, there is no danger if you get things wrong-- the game just won't progress until you do them correctly-- and replay value is, unfortunately, nil. It dragged in a few places, either from the clunky character animations, or just too much dialogue, and I often felt more like a passive watcher of events than the main character out to save the world.\n\nStorywise, there's not many games out there that can compare to [i]The Longest Journey[/i], and in the end, the story is one of the most important aspects of a game to me. As it is, I'd rate this an 8.5/10.

The game shares more familiarities with a novel, having an extraordinary amount of dialogue to go through and numerous objects to click on and explore. Story felt refreshingly unique and flows well. It is split into thirteen Chapters of varying length and themes. The voice acting is brilliant \u2013 characters feel natural, not samey and often time\u2019s humorous (mature content).  \n\nPuzzles on reflection were mostly straight forward, logical and challenging \u2013 and only had to use a guide for small sections of the game that didn\u2019t make sense or where I forgot one piece of dialogue (you need to complete certain things in order to continue with the plot). Graphics and cut scenes look dated at first impression but soon becomes part of the games charm. Musical soundtrack does a fantastic job at conveying the different moods throughout the journey.\n\nChapter Three is the funniest, and cements the fact that this is now one of my favourite point and click games.

And plenty of instances where it will take you 15-20 seconds to run across a screen; and there's the option of walking it, too...\nPlus, the game is admittedly kind of hard to take seriously due to its datedness. The CGI cutscenes where you get close-ups on the characters' faces... the stiff animations... I found myself laughing at some of the most tense scenes in the game because of that.\nThe story itself is also kind of cliched, but that's kind of the point.

The story itself can be really intense at times and for the most part doesn't give in to jarring plot conveniences. The writing, brainchild of Ragnar Tornquist, is great as well. Usually protagonists, or characters in general, can be two extremes: really swell, or really annoying. If they fall inbetween they are bland. Tornquist's writing makes protagonist April Ryan annoyingly believable. Her mannerisms will constantly remind you that she's just a college student and not someone fit to save two worlds.\nSpec-wise, the game came out in '99, and to my knowledge there are no HD mods or anything, and if this bothers you, start to notice the scenery more. The backgrounds in this game are gorgeous and they really amplify the atmosphere. \nThe gameplay has some good puzzles. They aren't very hard, but they do the job. Also you can't die.

The cultures of two entire worlds are brought into conflict through April Ryan.\n\nApril is an art student in a slightly-dystopian, near future version of our world, a high-technology two-class society.  Magic doesn't exist there any more than it does in real life.  But April gets involved in a complicated plot that finds her being trapped in a parallel universe on a world called \"Arcadia,\" where magic is real, and technology is sparse.

You do have to put yourself into the Click and Point Adventure mindset however, as it is by no means, a fast paced game. It's more like an interactive book.\n\nThe game for me shined the most in its dialogue. Nearly every character has an incredibly natural enunciation rarely found in games. It gives you a stronger connection with them, and helps you believe every word.\n\nThe next best parts of the Longest Journey was its story and variety of characters. It takes place in the 23rd century Venice, and gives a fascinating perspective of the past, present, and future. With a story as interesting as this, that's all I can really say without spoiling anything.\nThe characters feature a wide range of tallent and personallity, which makes them so interesting to talk to. By the first sentence someone utters, you already know what kind of person he/she is, and how he/she is going to treat you, it really is that detailed.\n\nFor a game stuck in 640x480 resolution, it is full of very detailed and beautiful scenery. 3D objects are pretty pixelated and jaggy, and are probably the thing that aged the worst. Some up-resing would benefit The Longest Journey pretty well, but I quickly became lost in everything else it had to offer, that the quality rarely bothered me.\n\nThe puzzles as well can be pretty cryptic. I had to look up a guild many times to figure out what to do next.

Games about men with swords and false British accents fighting monsters and animals alongside Dwarves and Elves. Few are the games which can truly create a unique world full of unique creatures and characters, and a unique story to go along with it. The Longest Journey is proof that, if nothing else, those sword & Elf games are just being lazy.\n\nThe Longest Journey is a good title, I feel. There's plenty lot of plot, and it's pretty important. Seeing the plot through to its conclusion is also important. But in this game, I wouldn't hesistate for a moment to say that the journey is far more important than the destination. For all the characters, I can't think of one that I didn't like - hero, villain, or neutral. From an egotistical wizard, to a short-tempered and superstitious captain, to the duly unloved police force, to your ladies' bird sidekick, to Burns Flipper, they're all memorable in their own way. And all of the races you'll meet along the way - the complexly-named ones who sing to the soil, the tense-confused ones who experience their entire lives simultaneously and the flying ones who hold storytelling in one's own words to be integral to their culture, to name only a few - are so fascinating that for all the time spent learning about each of them, I'm a little bummed out that I couldn't learn more.\n\nThe places you go are as wonderful as they are mysterious, and are only made moreso by the clash between the two worlds - the technological world of Stark, and the magical world of Arcadia. When I first visited the Haven Age of Myst IV: Revelation, I was greeted with stormy skies, a rough ocean, and an upturned shipwreck, all looming ahead. Once I climbed the nearby rock and peered over the other side, I saw bright skies, and a colorful, inviting jungle. The sheer wonder of this clash stopped me solid in my tracks, leaving me to admire the sharply contrasting views for some time before finally moving on.\n\nThis is what The Longest Journey is like *all the time*. Just on a much larger scale.\n\nThe journey is indeed long, for an adventure game. It's not always entirely forgiving; there are one or two infamous moon logic-y puzzles that are sure to frustrate, but please don't let them dissuade you. Barring those moments, The Longest Journey is such a lovingly crafted adventure, full of twists and turns, technology and magic, characters and exploration, and Burns Flipper, and it's all held together by April Ryan, our caring but sarcastic protagonist. April Ryan is, in my own opinion, the best-written female character of any video game I've ever played. And it's a good thing too, given the sheer amount of dialogue she has, all vocalized perfectly by Sarah Hamilton.\n\nI play a lot of adventure games.

I was promised an experience, not any experience, but the ability to experience what is known as \"The Longest Journey\".\n\nI go back to their proficiency (or lack thereof!) in the name, because it's key to what makes this so special-- if not successful. What is shown by the game is far less engrossing than how they amplify that, sometimes excruciatingly, until the pointing, clicking, and adventuring is raised to a gale force bellow. You're pulled so close to the guts of the mouse that by the end you'll think you could build one yourself.\n\nThe first half of \"The Longest Journey\" simulates how it must feel to be eaten alive-- at least until the second half, when player one attempts to eschew the paradigm, drowning in it. But in the back half of the game, the storm ends and it = switches to a hush. \"The Longest Journey\" is ambient and gentle, almost absent-mindedly turning upbeat at the end, and \"The Longest Journey\" grows so static that it's not even a dirge: It's lovely to play but bereft of tension.\n\nWhich is why I'm so curious about whether it's actually \"good\", if \"good\" even has a meaning at all (it doesn't).  Like early Pink Floyd, it, (both player and game as a one-self 'playergame'^[1]^[2]) engaged in an exploration that was unrehearsed and maybe even na\u00efve. The game tried to become something other than the sum of its parts-- and by emerging from free and unrehearsed improvisation, the game resisted containers; the wails and ballads emerged organically, and their apparent goal-- of creating spontaneous, non-idiomatic, and exhilarating adventure-- was reached again and again, if only by proxy through existence.\n\nIt feels like the game wings itself in front of us-- thrilling us with new discoveries one minute, and the next, batting around ideas that go nowhere. Is the organ lineup here to stay? (Probably not) Is the pervasive melancholy a stylistic choice, a side effect of playing without truth, or an emotional reaction? Does \"The Longest Journey\" survive, evolve, or die?^[3] Whatever the future holds, this is some of the riskiest improv ever recorded: In every moment of the game, you just wish you actually went on the journey which was in fact, in the longest, but you just fucking don't.\n\nFootnotes:\n1: As put fourth by Charles Montagu Doughty in The Titans.\n\n2.

I personally encountered the \"No FMV/Cutscenes playing\" problem until i had to set my Power Options to \"High Performance\" which solved the issue. This solution may, or may not work for you.\n\nThis review may also contain minor puzzle spoilers.\n==================================================\n\nThe Longest Journey is a graphic adventure game that was released back in 1999 by Funcom. During its time, it was hailed as one of the best graphic adventure games ever made (which i never played. I was more interested in Lucasarts and Sierra games in those days).\n\nThe most important element for any good adventure game is a good story, and this game most certainly delivers, although sometimes abit too much. It starts off simple enough, about an 18-year old art student April Ryan, her daily frustrations about school and boys until she starts having strange dreams and visions. What follows next is a mind bending over-the-top story plot spanning 12 chapters that will involve parallel universes and saving the very essence of reality. This is a very complex story indeed but can sometimes be too complex due to the many story jargons it throws at you and may be kindda hard to follow at times.\n\nThe art style have not aged very well. While the background art still does somewhat holds up well enough although barely, the 3D character art looks extremely dated. The look is reminiscent of early 90s 1st generation attempts at 3D characters in a video game. While this may be passable in 1999, it definitely looks ancient now in 2013, though I certainly cannot fault it for that. The game also runs at at maximum of 640 x 480 resolution, so it will look extremely pixellated running at full screen on modern widescreens. Sadly, there was never any \"HD\" patch ever made.\n\nGameplay wise, it adheres to the \"Lucasarts\" gaming philosophy where you will never ever come to a premature Game Over screen just because you forgot to pick up a tiny crucial object 30 screens before. Thankfully it also does not have any timed action sequence QTEs, although there is a very insignificant one at one of the later chapters, which can be easily done. The player need only focus on the story and puzzle solving.\n\nAs with any adventure games, puzzles are always the meat of the game, and unfortunately some of the puzzles in this game can have very obscure solutions. (I'm looking at you \"Telephone Statue\" puzzle). More then once, i had to consult a walkthrough because some of the solutions are too cryptic. Alot of times, i also had to resort to the \"Use everything in my inventory until something works\" tactic.\n\nThe puzzles are also definitely anything but subtle so to speak, and are put there for no apparent reason other then to present a challenge for the player to solve instead of it having a functional and logical use in the world. Alot of puzzles don't make alot of sense in their solutions. (Eg: Minor Spoilers: Who in their right mind would go touch a digusting green gloop on the ground that probably looks radioactive? Or dance around like a mad loon just because they see a shadow telling them to dance?\" Basically don't use logic when you try to solve the puzzles, think \"out of the box\" instead.\n\nBefore wrapping up this review, theres something else that i'd like to add in that once you finished the game, you will unlock an extra option called \"Book of Secrets\" which is a collection of voice acting outtakes and unused/concept art that were used in the development of the game. This is considered to be quite a rare addition especially for a game released in 1999 where such bonus additions were rarely seen.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nFor old-school hardcore adventure gamers who appreciate a very complex story and don't mind tackling very obscure puzzles, this is definitely a game you should pick up. For younger gamers however, i'd recommend if you can watch a video preview before committing to it, as this game definitely shows its age now.", "timestamp_created": 1369503247, "timestamp_updated": 1369503247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2148296": {"recommendationid": "2148296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003039916", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1366700400}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein Klassiker des Point-and-Click-Adventures und ein hervorragendes Werk von Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist", "timestamp_created": 1368880884, "timestamp_updated": 1368880884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2203801": {"recommendationid": "2203801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003973336", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1343372400}, "language": "english", "review": "this game... the setting and story is SO COOL (magical realism! so good!) but it's also a victim of the time it was made: a time when adventure games require you to combine - I dunno - a grapefruit and a dog by using a piece of gum - but in a very specific order, because clearly doing it in a different order would just be ABSURD - to create some tool that lets you... do... something... even more inane...\n\njust keep Google handy, is all, and don't be embarrassed to use it. the \"puzzles\" in this game can be TERRIBLE.\n\nas an old game, it's also worth mentioning that the graphics are a little rough. still, it's aged better than a lot of games from its time.

I didn't know what to expect from this game, especially since I'm not a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games, but The Longest Journey is easily the best p-a-c game I've ever played, and is a highly worthwhile title for its story alone. The backgrounds are beautifully done, but the character models are quite dated; that said, that doesn't really matter, because the writing, world-building, and characterization are incredibly manufactured and suck you so deeply into this adventure you soon don't care about looking at a blocky April texture. Seriously, there are more memorable characters in this game than the last several games I've played *combined*. Crow, The Wheel Man, The Flipster, and especially April - she's an incredibly *real* character. I'm just flabbergasted how well Funcom has pulled her off. She seems just like an 18 year old girl would, and the rest (or most important) of the characters are equally deep and interesting. To add to this characterization, the voice acting is also outstanding (mostly, there were a few poor ones) and...I just really can't get over how real April was, I honestly feel like I know her, and the rest of the characters too - they're very dynamic and just so well done. There are also lots of dialogue choices to pick through that don't pertain to *immediate* story progression used to flesh out the worlds and the characters - this was much appreciated, and made the created universe feel large and dynamic. There were other nice features as well: the setting was very unique, there was a video replay option to view the FMVs, nicely done music...However, the downfall of any point and click adventure game are the puzzles. Some are very convoluted. I remember one where you had to make a fishing pole out of some kind of string, an inflateable duck, and a bandaide. It was just too much for me, I admit, I used a walkthrough. That said, I would recommend using a walkthrough if you get stuck in this game - it's definitely worth playing, even for a p-a-c adventure game. \n\nPros:\n\nExcellent (like really) characterization and world building\nMusic\nBackgrounds\nStoryline\n\nCons:\n\nConvoluted puzzles\nA little too much backtracking at times\n\nThis was a great adventure, after playing it I'm really excited to move on to Dreamfall and I've also kept my eye on the kickstarter for the new Chapters that's coming out. I'm now a bonafide TLJ fan. Even if point and click adventure games aren't for you, if you enjoy a wonderful story full of magic, rather adult themes (including child abuse), great writing, worldbuilding, and astounding characterization, pick up The Longest Journey and use a walkthrough if you need it. A-\n\nNote: Initially I didn't like the movement speed of the character - then I figured out you could double-click to run around. I also thought it was difficult to find where exits to different areas were on-screen - then I figured out if you press \"X\" it will show you. Keep that in mind while playing if you have the same difficulties I did. Also, as mentioned, the puzzles can be tough and not so obvious. The story, characterization, and world building are what makes this game great - don't let aggravating gameplay choices stop you from enjoying April's adventure, use a walkthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1363071063, "timestamp_updated": 1363071063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4082609": {"recommendationid": "4082609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031765203", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471930267}, "language": "english", "review": "The Longest Journey does not possess the best graphics ( it was produced in 1999) but I hope you can look past that because The Longest Journey is the real deal.

Hahaha. No. Okay, enough of that.\n\nThe best way to classify this game would probably have to be something like fantasy science fiction. A sort of Lord of the Rings meets Blade Runner. Lord of the Blade Runners. Yeah, sure.\n\nThe main protagonist, April Ryan, is caught between two worlds; a world of logic and science (Stark, Earth), and a world of magic (Arcadia). There is also another dimension containing all that is in between. It's an interesting premise but an all too familiar one, yet The Longest Journey executes it fairly well.\n\nThe introduction and conclusion to the story are very satisfying, but the main journey is quite empty and void of any depth. The characters are very one-dimensional and are lacking in personality and do not elicit any significant emotional connection. It's basically \"travel from point A to point B whilst saving an entire race of people. Now travel from point B to point C and do the same, over and over again.\"\n\nThere are very few strong supporting characters who you will meet along the way, the rest are very forgettable and are bid farewell as soon as they are met. There are some interesting characters, especially one in particular who seems to hold the power of omniscience, but their back story is not explored as much as I would have liked.\n\nApril Ryan's attitude, her denial of everything that is happening, is very grating. She comes off as a pretentious teeny bopper but I'm not exactly sure of her age. She has to be in her mid-20s at the very least, yet she acts like such an unenthusiastic, apathetic, ungrateful little shit. If I had the power to travel between dimensions my mind would be fucking blown and I would absolutely love it, but with April it's as if it is a burden. I can understand it from her point of view, but she never reconsiders just how important her task is, but rather complains about it right to the very end.\n\nHonestly, it's a long game. I actually had to force myself to finish because of how bored I was becoming near the end. It's a very slow and sluggish game. Everything, from character animations to voice acting, seems to purposefully artificially extend the game's length just by dragging them out as much as any single person can tolerate. Many, many, many voices are spoken at such a slow pace that it's far easier to rely on subtitles and read through the text, skipping their dialogue completely.\n\nThe pre-rendered backdrops are very beautiful and there is some fancy cinematography going on in a few areas, but the character models are ugly and honestly aren't much of a step up from Final Fantasy VII's blocky models. I preferred the sci-fi setting to the fantasy world, it just seemed so much more welcoming and familiar. Although the fantasy setting was sprawling with life, it became a pain to make friends and explain your predicament to every single person you came across. I kinda preferred exploring April's home town and speaking with her friends.\n\nThe Longest Journey could have been so much more brilliant had 3D point-and-clicks not taken over from their superior 2D counterparts. It's a shame it became such a huge fad in the late '90s and early '00s, point-and-clicks just don't work in a 3D environment as well as their 2D brethren.", "timestamp_created": 1359077061, "timestamp_updated": 1359077061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3576314": {"recommendationid": "3576314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024952102", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1358668800}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me tell you of The Longest Journey I have been on.

This game is considered to be a classic in the adventure genre, and I'm sure many would consider it to be an all time great . The aspects of this game that I loved were the art, story, dialogue, voice acting, humor, and music. Be aware that, as I'm guessing is the case with most point and click adventure games, this game is dialogue heavy and focuses on the story. The Longest Journey first came out in 1999 so some graphical aspects of the game are dated, like the 3D characters (which move around on a 2D background). You cannot die in this game and you cannot become permanently stuck, but it can definitely be challenging. I had no hesitation in looking at a walkthrough to help me out when I was stuck. Most of the puzzle challenges are workable if you are persistent.

On one hand, it nearly perfects the classic adventure formula (click stuff, talk to people, solve puzzles), the number of absurd puzzle solutions are minimal, and the story is well thought out. But on the other hand, the writing, while well-intended, sometimes comes off as amateurish. The script is also extremely verbose and really could have used some serious editing. The graphics, of course, are extremely dated, but that is easily forgiven. All in all, the spirit of the game holds up well, if not the technical side.

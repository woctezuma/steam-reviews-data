Haven't I heard this story somewhere before?\n\nYou play as Miss Fortune - 9 times a widow and as crafty as she is suspicious, it'll be your job to scour the mansion for clues when someone is murdered. What I love about this premise, is that you don't really care if justice is done, you just want to make sure no one pins the murder on you. I do think this concept could have been explored more as it is somewhat unique and exciting to an old genre... perhaps Miss Fortune will have to have another adventure for that one, as I don't think its explored to it's full potential in this one.\n\nI have to admit, the setting and premise for the story are often overdone within the mystery genre; however, sometimes when you write in a genre you write about what you know....and hoo boy, do mystery novel lovers know this setting. That being said, the game is enjoyable and I found it nice to use the \"pacing\" button to let the characters speak, and then just enjoy the delivery of the lines. The voice acting was particularly entertaining, and it paired nicely with the unobtrusive ambient music.\n\nI also couldn't help but feel that there was a little more planned for the story, and parts of it sort of wrapped up in the end. Something I struggled with was that the strength of the relationships of some of the characters. For example: [spoiler] A certain character is obviously very much in love with another, and I felt it was only given that they fancied them.

The script is good, and I was impressed that the entire game was voiced (and voiced well!). Each character had their own distinctive personality, mannerisms, and motives, which made the multiple endings -one for each potential killer- seem reasonable. I also loved that everyone had their own color scheme, since it reminded me of the iconic house party murder mystery game: Clue.\n\nThere were a few things I did not love about the gameplay, mostly with regard to skipping or redundancies. It was somewhat annoying that moving from room to room always had an unskippable panning shot of the room before you could interact with anything, and an option to skip dialogue you had heard previously would be nice. Additionally, interactables in the room were sometimes hard to find or repeated (did we really need the tables in the dining halls to have multiple click points when they all said the same thing?), especially in the dim lighting.\n\nOverall, I was entertained and would recommend it if you like snappy dialogue and murder mysteries that have a bit of humor to them. The price is a little high considering you can get all the endings by reloading a save from just before the accusation phase, but honestly I've paid more for games I've enjoyed less.

As the cast attempts to solve the mystery, a clock ticks down marking the time until the arrival of the police...\n\nThe presence of the timer definitely made the game tenser, but I often found myself skipping through the text quickly to finish collecting everything before time ran out. Thankfully, there is the option to disable the timer which allows you to absorb the atmosphere better. The characters are voiced well, and I was delighted to hear the wit of Miss Fortune, her interactions with the high-class Comtessa, and the banter with the rest of the cast.\n\nIt was a bit hard to suspend my disbelief at times. The clash of old and new technology felt jarring, and Lia felt out of place, being the only technically inclined person in a very old-fashioned setting. She was able to casually hack the phone company records to figure out who called the house, and would have preferred to hack their private emails if she needed extra information. Technical capability seemed to fluctuate as Miss Fortune seems clueless about wiring and electronics, yet she immediately identifies the timer device and implies that she was able to wire one up in school.\n\nThe gameplay was a bit clunky from time to time. Although the backgrounds were clear and conveyed the atmosphere well, some of the interact-able objects were a bit hard to distinguish from the background, further compounded by the fact that you can rotate 360 degrees. Transitioning between rooms takes a bit of time, especially when you go between rooms frequently. When replaying the game to achieve all the endings, I found myself wishing for an auto-skip feature. However, it was nice that the controls were explained clearly and concisely at the very start of the game.\n\nThe artstyle was charming, and each character is given a unique color for contrast. I'm not sure what's up with Comtessa's right hand, though. Perhaps she's an amputee from the elbow down.\n\nThe highlight of the game is definitely chapter 3, where you can blame anyone and justify it. If you mess up and have the tables turned on you, the game gives you some clues, some of which are misleading. These small hints are beautifully executed.\n\nDespite criticizing aspects of the game, I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys adventure mystery games.

Unfortunately, during the proceedings, their host is murdered, and she finds herself being framed for the murder. It's now up to you to search the locations, question the other characters, and either find the true culprit or lay the blame somewhere else, before the police arrive.\n\nThe handful of locations can all be searched for clues, but this is where things go a little wrong. All background graphics use a washed out style where individual items are hard to distinguish from each other. That would work fine if their sole purpose was to be backgrounds, but it becomes problematic when you have to search through them. While the hotspots are adequately sized, there is rarely anything to really distinguish them from the rest of the blurry background. It doesn't really help that the locations can be side scrolled for an even larger area to sweep your pointer over in the search of a new hotspot. Reaching the end and finding out that you missed a crucial item is painful, as you do not want to go through the bother of mousing over all the locations again.\n\nMeanwhile, interrogating the other charactres is largely delightful, due to good writing and mostly solid voice acting. Character sprites are overall well done, with enough different poses and expressions to keep things from getting too stale. While it is by no means a large game, it's still impressive that the entire thing is voice acted, and aside from one voice actress' delivery, I was impressed by the quality. There is a bit of intriguing world building going on, but it's really only hinted at, which is a shame, because it could have gone a long way towards explaining the vastly different accents of the characters. As it is, the accents come across more as an attempt to distinguish the characters from each other, which I believe could have been done more elegantly than forcing a foreign accent on certain characters.\n\nSo, is the murder mystery clever and hard to crack? Not really. As long as you find all those darn hotspots, Miss Fortune does rather well in solving most of the mystery herself. You are required to make a few crucial decisions and present evidence, but your character may reach conclusions based on that evidence that you hadn't quite figured out yourself. Regardless, the true culprit and method of murder is not that hard to figure out. Therefore, it is a rather pleasant surprise that you can reach different endings by framing each character for the murder, building up a false case against them. This is actually where most of the fun comes from.\n\nWhile the engine (unity) is adequate for the task, one thing that's really missing is a skip function. Going though the game again is laborious when you have to click your way through the initial dialogue. Thankfully, the save system automatically saves to different files, and there are a few auto saves to help you jump to key places, but a true skip function would have been appreciated.\n\nIn conclusion, for the price being asked, this is a good, but short murder mystery, marred by poor location searching, but impressive for its dialogue and voice acting. I imagine that with one character's delivery being re-recorded, you could sell this as an audio drama at the same price, but here you get an interesting little mystery game as well.", "timestamp_created": 1493798799, "timestamp_updated": 1493798799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721177", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31518038": {"recommendationid": "31518038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009037942", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493713554}, "language": "english", "review": "#TeamHeratio\n\nThis is a new take for me from a visual novel stand point, it was put together with great effort and it really shows from each character and voice for every line so far, its pulling me deeper and deeper into wanting to play more, and I will get to the bottom of this mystery if its the last thing... well probably not the LAST thing I do.\n\nWith great rendered scenes done in what seems like big screenshots, to moving mouths they tried to make sure every nook and cranny was grabbing your attention.

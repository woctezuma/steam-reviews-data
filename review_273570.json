It was one of the best games released in 1995. I'm happy to report that the DOS port here on Steam works perfectly. I played the first three levels and it all came back to me, a time trip 20 years to the past. But what a trip!\n\nFor some reason this game resonates with me. I was always able to navigate the topsy turvy 3D world with relative ease. You'll be going North, see, then you go down a tunnel and you completely reorient yourself to a new horizontal plane. I mean, imagine, your frame of reference is constantly changing. Sometimes you're right-side-up, sometimes you're upside-down, sometimes you're sideways. It's an amazing feeling. I can see why it would make some people feel dizzy though.\n\nFrom the main menu you can restart at any level you got up to but don't forget to save or you lose your upgrades. In-game, press F1 to get a help screen so you can see what other controls you have that aren't available for remapping. You'll see how to quick-save and quick-load, how to switch weapons, things like that.\n\nA joystick is a must, I think. My preferred control scheme is joystick for pitch and yaw, with A and D for strafe left and right, W and X for up and down, Q/E for roll, and S/Space for fore/back. I think this is the game I played that got me using ASD_Space for all the FPS's I played after that, while most other people use WASD. Yes, I played it that much! Ever since then, any game I play, I configure it to play like Descent wherever appropriate. I've been trying to remember where and how I started setting up my keys like that but playing this brought it all back, now I remember. It was Descent.\n\nSo I guess you could say this game changed my life. Yes, absolutely, definitely, must-buy. Yes the graphics are blocky, but they're good, and no worse than 50% of the New Releases here on Steam, with all their retro lo-fi pixel graphics. In fact, this game blows them all out of the water. I think it's the physics. Your ship, it doesn't just zig-zag around a 3D space like something out of Tron. It bounces, shifts, and drifts a little. You're going down a tunnel that looks like a dead-end but there's an opening at the top facing down, so you twist around, turn to face the wall, and strafe down with the opening in front of you, and there's something shooting at you!

Descent is a disorientating FPS where you could fly your ship at any angle or direction in a gravity free environment, where the levels are even more complex and confusing mazes  that become easier and easier to find yourself lost and trapped as you progress further through the game.\n\nThe gameplay is uniquely stunning, feeling like a limitless 'Doom', where enemies can fly and turn in any direction, will hunt you through rounded hallways  and open doors for themselves, and have an array of models, weapons, and fighting styles. You yourself control a spaceship completely free to fly any which direction. The controls allow you to tilt yourself as well as move directly up, down, forward, backward, left and right, as well as changing directions, which both allows you full flexibility and maneuverability and also makes navigation extremely difficult (in a good way of course!) As you progress, you will find upgrades for your ship's primary and secondary weapons, as well as temporary powerups like invisibility and invulnerability. Your ship, your primary energy-based weapons, and your flares run on energy, which can be found at power stations found in certain levels or are dropped by enemy ships. Your ship's protection is its shield levels, which can be boosted by finding blue shield orbs dropped by enemies and placed in levels.\n\nThe level design for Descent 1 and Descent 2 is unmatched by any other game; what better way to utilize a fully maneuverable ship as well designed as it is with levels  that include limitless doors, rooms and hallways that flip upside down, turn left, right, up and down, fork and loop and do anything possible. The best way I can think to describe it would to be to take a piece of paper and a pencil, close your eyes, and scribble like a mad man in circles and all directions for 5 seconds then stop and open your eyes. With the ability to pilot yourself essentially fully \"upside down\", on top of flying through a completely three dimensional maze makes for some of the best 'dungeon crawling' possible. With secret rooms on every level scattered throughout the levels, hostages and upgrades to find, if you aren't a long time veteran of this game, you will find something new every time you play.\n\nThe general goal of most missions is to find the enemy reactor on the level, destroy it, and find the exit before the self destruct sequence of the base hits 0. The reactor is found by progressing through a three tier series of doors, the blue, the yellow, and the red. You will find the blue key in the primary part of a level, which will unlock the blue door.. which leads to finding the yellow key in the blue door's section of the level... which leads to finding the red key in the yellow door's section of the level. With the sheer complexity of the maps, this can prove to be extremely challenging to a newcomer. Once the reactor is destroyed, the entire mission will start shaking, making it even harder to navigate as well as rattles your ship making it hard to pilot while you find the exit. The exceptions to killing the reactors are the boss levels, but I won't spoil that if you've never played the game before ;).\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game that was way, way ahead of its time. For the breakthroughs it made that had never been seen in gaming before, it deserved a lot more attention than it got. As a franchise, the second Descent, Descent II, was also very successful as it used the same style and mechanics as the first, in addition to adding more weapons to your arsenal, more unique enemies to fight, and way more complex and difficult levels. Unfortunately, Descent 3 took a turn in the wrong direction, experimenting with a new engine, level and gameplay style, and because of its blunder, the Descent series was discontinued. \n\nThis was in fact the very first game I ever played at 2 years old, and the first game I completed independently at 3. When my dad, brother and I got the second, it only got better, and some of my best memories as a kid are playing these games and using the map makers for my brother and I to build our own levels. \n\nBottom line, you need to look past the dated graphics and give this game a consideration.

Getting the DXX Rebirth source port is a must for more visual fidelity, mouse support, and a whole variety of options.\n\nIt's a fairly unique FPS that has you moving in all directions, pitching, sliding, and accelerating through tunnels and chambers while blowing up a variety of spaceships, rescuing hostages, grabbing keycards, destroying a core and getting out of there before the whole thing goes up in flames. As fun as it is, however, it's probably not for everyone. \n\nIf there's a game that can get you horribly motion sick, it's this one, though I myself experienced none. You'll also need to mess with rebinding the controls a fair bit to get a scheme you're comfortable with. And as much as it appears that the developers tried to make the different locations visually distinct, the texturework and myriad of tunnels make the environments borderline mazelike. By paying close attention to landmarks like power stations and exit tunnels, opening the automap often, and not spinning all over the place like an idiot, you should be able to get through just fine.\n\nSo, if you've got an interest in lazers, potential motion sickness, tunnels, and blowing shit up, go ahead and give it a go. You could probably find the shareware version online if you need a demo.\n\nMaxed Out Shields/10", "timestamp_created": 1410644186, "timestamp_updated": 1441958314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12086158": {"recommendationid": "12086158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002430361", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413954191}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute classic and one of, if not THE, earliest gaming experience i can recall.", "timestamp_created": 1410624910, "timestamp_updated": 1410624910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12069454": {"recommendationid": "12069454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095346880", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410672198}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442. \u043c\u0434\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435. \u0441\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438\u0438, \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u0449\u0430\u0441-\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e. \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435, \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435... \u0434\u0430, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f + \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0441. \u043d\u0438 \u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0434\u0430\u043f\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438. \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0430 640*480, \u043d\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434 dual-action. \u0436\u0430\u043b\u044c. \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u043e 84\u0440. \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u0432 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440.", "timestamp_created": 1410507138, "timestamp_updated": 1410507138, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607331", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12060479": {"recommendationid": "12060479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012566079", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490416630}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the first computer game I've ever owned - either this one or Jazz Jackrabbit (which, now that I think of it, sounds like a sex toy).

Even considering how far gaming technology has advanced, there are still very few games I have seen that feature this sort of three-dimensional movement. The game is kept interesting by a wide range of enemies, interesting weapons, and 30 different maze-like levels. The storyline is rather short and only presented in blurbs of text, but it is absolutely amazing (The ending blew my mind!) One of the best features of this game is the extremely wide range of difficulty settings. When playing on \u201cTrainee,\u201d the first few levels are easy enough to learn the game, but the later levels do get rather difficult. By contrast, I have never beaten the first level on \u201cInsane,\u201d so you should never have to worry about the game being too easy. I was, however, slightly disappointed in the Steam version for two reasons. First, it did not include the remixed soundtrack from the Mac version, which is by far the best non-orchestrated soundtrack I have ever heard in a game. Second, do not expect to use the mouse in your control set, as I have the mouse sensitivity cranked to the max, and my ship still turns too slowly to effectively follow the robots on my screen.

Much like the original Elite game's fame as the first to bring 3D vector models and sandbox gameplay to the personal computer, Descent was a pioneer in its own right on several levels.  \n\nFor starters, the only game that rivaled its level of controls complexity at the time of its release, it can be argued, was Mechwarrior 2.  Pretty much every game before 1995 that involved first-person flight or movement were restricted to three axes (turn up-down, turn left-right, and move forward-back).  The occasional lateral movement was included (slide left-right), and was far less common, but games such as Quake and Duke Nuke'Em come to mind.  They might or might not include jumping, and crouching started getting introduced, but the physics of the world they took place in also limited their control schemes.  Most space flight games of the age had no lateral movement either.  The original Elite had no slide left-right, but had roll instead.  Each scheme had its own challenges, but never gave you all the options in a single package.\n\nThen along comes Descent, a game with no gravity and no limits.  You could turn up-down-left-right, you could slide up-down-left-right, you could move forward-back, you could roll, you could look behind you, and you could afterburner for short boosts.  Not only that, but you could move in as many as three directions at once, and the speed benefits were additive, allowing you to perform what was then dubbed 'chording' for the greatest velocities.  Triple-chording was tricky, took skill to get right, and was sometimes dangerous (running into walls or lava), especially in the middle of dogfighting.  In the sense that EVE Online is the hardest MMO ever created by at least a couple orders of magnitude, Descent was harder than other first-person shooters by an equivalent amount.\n\nIt was also, along with Quake and Duke, one of the first few shooters you could play against other players.  All three originally supported only IPX protocols instead of TCP for network play, which meant you could only play against others on the same LAN, but services later started to appear (such as KaliDOS, Kali95, and Khan) that would do IPX-to-TCP translation and allow you to play against others across the internet through dial-up connections, ISDN, or eventually cable modems.  I have countless memories of LANfests and ladder matches in the early days of Descent and Descent 2 that, even to this day, have no equal because of Descent's no-direction-is-safe design.\n\n6DoF games have traditionally been a niche for the hardcore gamer, with very few other games in the genre released.  The original Descent had two more games released, of course, and there was also a direct competitor launched later called Forsaken which received decent support on its own (see ProjectX for details).  Much later, Jumpgate Evolution had aspirations of becoming the king's successor (and would have succeeded) before it was cancelled.  Not long ago, Miner Wars was released as an homage to this genre, but it fell short and was riddled with bugs.  The most recent inheritor of the throne, though moreso in control scheme than setting, has become Elite: Dangerous, and this makes me a happy camper.\n\nRegardless, Descent deserves a place in the history books as the grandfather to this playstyle all by itself.  Even if you discount the control scheme and ridiculously tricky and hilariously awesome multiplayer in its heyday, other aspects shine that were uncommon as well.  All of the original game takes place in the confined spaces of off-world mining facilities, with the layout of most of them painfully unfriendly to two-dimensional thinking.  Since there was no gravity and the mine traversed deep into the structure of the asteroid or planetoid it was carved into, there was also no reason to limit the level's layout to traditional gravity-based constraints.  It was a great deal easier to get lost if you weren't paying attention to all the options in all directions.  \n\nLastly (at least among the aspects of the game that deserve special mention) was the lack of blood and gore.  In an age where the amount of violence against living antagonists (whether NPCs or other players) was increasing exponentially, Descent was a nice alternative that gave parents a choice they could get behind instead of turning a blind eye to the scary biologicals of Quake or sexism and bloodied aliens of Duke.\n\nHaving typed this giant wall of text, you'd think acquiring a classic like Descent is a decision without flaws.  What's worthy of mention here is that this version is the original, and runs inside a DOSbox emulator.  Because of this and the fact that the game was coded from the ground up for much older hardware, before even the first 3DFX Voodoo cards came out, the original verison of Descent suffers from having some of its routines tied directly to the speed of the machine.  The ability for certain missiles to track you, in particular, are greatly augmented by faster clock speeds.  Whereas someone playing the game on a 486/33 machine back in 1995 could easily dodge deadly missiles with just a little practice, it's much harder now.\n\nLeveraging DOSbox in order to play this game today also brings other problems which can be avoided.  Two of the most well-known community efforts to resolve issues like those stated above are D1X-Rebirth (which endeavors to provide a fairly faithful recreation of the original) and D2X-XL (which has several features the original game doesn't, and lets you play both Descent 1 and Descent 2 inside the same engine), both of which are more than passing improvements to the DOSbox method.  If they're better than this Steam product, then why purchase the Steam version, you might ask?  Because they contain none of the copyrighted files necessary to play the original games.  There are what's called .PIG and .HOG files located in the original game's installation directory which contain all the data for the game, such as textures, creature models, and level designs, that can legally only be obtained except through purchase of the game created by Interplay.\n\nSo I strongly encourage you to try this game as it was originally crafted, through the DOSbox method provided here, and if some part of the DOSbox experience or the performance or behaviors of the robots and weapons frustrates you, try leveraging the results of the community and follow the installation instructions of D1X-Rebirth or D2X-XL to give it another spin.

When I say \u201crecommended\u201d I really just mean the game itself, not buying it on Steam. You can get this game and DESCENT 2 on GoodOldGames.com for $10. **\n\nDESCENT is basically classic DOOM in zero gravity. The space ship you fly and missiles you launch at robots might lead you to believe it\u2019s a space flight game, but it\u2019s really a straight-up mid 90\u2019s first person shooter in space (or rather underground on worlds all over the solar system). You explore labyrinthine levels collecting blue, yellow, and red keys to eventually reach the exit. The zero-g factor as well as a few other things though make DESCENT unlike most shooters released before or since. \nIf you\u2019ve ever played that game FORSAKEN from Acclaim, the levels are kind of like that. You progress trough them similarly to how you would in DOOM, but they are much more three-dimensional here, which makes navigating them a task in itself. Luckily, DESCENT gives you a 3D automap and a great deal of control over it compared to DOOM\u2019s automap, which you\u2019ll need to use if you don\u2019t want to get lost.\n\nNot only do you have to navigate DESCENT\u2019s mazes, but also plan what you do in them. Every level has hostages to rescue for extra points, but they die if you lose a life while carrying them. Also, after destroying the mainframe at the end of each level you have 45 seconds to find and escape through the exit, so it\u2019s usually best to grab the hostages right before facing the mainframe. This navigation and planning can make DESCENT surprisingly cerebral for an action game.\n\nUltimately what makes DESCENT challenging though is its large and unique gallery of enemies. The problem is with how the developers decided to place them in the levels, making DESCENT an unnecessarily hard game in some parts, even compared to DOOM.\n\nYou\u2019ve got your different varieties of enemy ships that shoot different weapons at you, but there are also enemies with interesting behaviors. One type does a pretty good job of flanking you if you let it; another simply watches you and enhances the AI of enemies around it. Eventually you discover different methods and maneuvers to use against each one. Thinking on your feet in DESCENT becomes intense in a new way when you\u2019re doing it in zero-g.\n\nWhere it get\u2019s annoying is when DESCENT sets up its many unfair ambushes. You\u2019ll enter rooms from the only entrance only to be immediately surrounded. Enemies sit behind doors ready to attack in ways that are unavoidable unless you know it\u2019s coming ahead of time from having reloaded the game. Worst of all is probably one particular enemy that, as soon as it becomes aware of you, almost instantly slices down your health with a chain gun while giving off a high-pitched pig-like scream.\n\nSome of this might actually be affected by the source ports that have been released for DESCENT and are pretty necessary for playing the game in modern resolutions and at high framerates. I used DXX Rebirth but I think there are others. The issue is that some parts of the enemy AI are tied to framerate, the biggest issue being homing missiles. On the DXX Rebirth, once fired they\u2019re almost impossible to dodge because they can turn on a dime.\n\nLastly, if you have a PC flightstick, DESCENT is supposed to be best played with them. I worked out a fine keyboard and mouse scheme. You might also want to try mapping out an Xbox 360 configuration too, which the source ports make possible.\n\nOverall, there really have been few games like DESCENT made before or since, other than its sequels. If you\u2019re into FPSs of its era it offers almost 30 levels of some of the most difficult FPS action this side of super-hardcore DOOM WADs.", "timestamp_created": 1394494444, "timestamp_updated": 1394494444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9387330": {"recommendationid": "9387330", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997211231", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498862239}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent game that has only been bettered by its sequel descent 2. \nIf you havent played this game buy it now!", "timestamp_created": 1394300107, "timestamp_updated": 1394300107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9386318": {"recommendationid": "9386318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023558365", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397999039}, "language": "english", "review": "My old Personal Favorite game!!\n\nThis is up there with doom and the other legends!!\n\nOnly Paralax software never went under. :(\n\nGET THIS GAME!! 10/10!!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1394295112, "timestamp_updated": 1394295112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9314165": {"recommendationid": "9314165", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972536364", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459137692}, "language": "english", "review": "The first game I ever played on a lan.

Man fliegt mit einem kleinen Raumgleiter durch Tunnelsysteme und muss darin Gegner bek\u00e4mpfen, Geiseln befreien und zum Schluss den Hauptreaktor (oder manchmal auch Endgegner) zerst\u00f6ren - dann aber auch noch durch den Notausgang entkommen, bevor man samt Tunnelsystem in die Luft gesprengt wird. F\u00fcr farbig markierte T\u00fcren muss man zuerst die entsprechenden Chips finden, um durchzukommen. Descent ist also bei Weitem nicht nur simples Geballere, man ben\u00f6tigt auch r\u00e4umliches Vorstellungsverm\u00f6gen (wobei die Gesetze der Schwerkraft \u00f6fters auch mal nicht gelten) und eine gute Orientierung, sonst verliert man sich in den immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer werdenden Levels! Damit einem auch nicht langweilig wird, kommen im Spielverlauf auch wieder neue Gegner hinzu.\nMan verf\u00fcgt zu Beginn \u00fcber 100 Punkte f\u00fcr Energie, die beim Schie\u00dfen und mit der Zeit durch Bewegung abnehmen, und 100 Punkte Schild, das Beschuss abfangen kann. Beide k\u00f6nnen auf 200 Punkte erh\u00f6ht werden, Sinkt der Wert des Schildes auf 0, wird man zerst\u00f6rt und hat verloren.\nAber auch die Bewaffnung bietet mit der Zeit immer mehr: Insgesamt f\u00fcnf Prim\u00e4r- und f\u00fcnf Sekund\u00e4rwaffen.\nPrim\u00e4rwaffen:\n1. Laser: Diese Waffe hat man bereits zu Beginn. Sie ist gleichzeitig die einzige, die man auf 4 Stufen erh\u00f6hen kann und auf 4-fach-Schuss (Quad-Laser) upgraden kann.\n2. Vulcan-Cannon: Entspricht einer Minigun. Sie ist die einzige, die keine Energie ben\u00f6tigt.\n3. Spread-Fire: Verschie\u00dft drei Energiekugeln in einer Reihe auf einmal, abwechselnd horizontal und vertikal.\n4. Plasma-Cannon: Verschie\u00dft gr\u00fcne Plasmakugeln.\n5. Fusion-Cannon: Kann als einzige aufgeladen werden! Dazu einfach die Feuertaste gedr\u00fcckt halten. Ein voll aufgeladener Schuss gen\u00fcgt meist, um den Hauptreaktor zu zerst\u00f6ren.\nSekund\u00e4rwaffen:\n1. Einfache Rakete: Fliegt beim Abfeuern geradeaus.\n2. Homing Missile: Zielsuchend, steuert also den n\u00e4chsten Gegner an. Sie kann allerdings keine engen Kurven fliegen!\n3. Bombe: L\u00e4sst man beim Fliegen hinter sich \"fallen\". Sie explodieren bei Kontakt oder Beschuss, also Vorsicht!\n4. Smart-Missile: Zielsuchend, verschie\u00dft bei Detonation zus\u00e4tzlich noch weitere Projektile kreisf\u00f6rmig.\n5.

It is a pity that the game doesn't come with some kind of IPX-to-TCP/IP adapter built-in; FPS Multiplayer was one of Descent's great features in a time when the concept was relatively new, and its absence (to all but the quite technically adept) greatly detracts from this version.\n\nEven for this version's shortcomings, the game is a solid piece of gameplay design, and should find many new players given its release on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1392569412, "timestamp_updated": 1392569412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9140880": {"recommendationid": "9140880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077627082", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392590688}, "language": "english", "review": "My favourite game when i was 9!

Namly a section for those that have not played the original descent and those that have respectivly.\n\nOverall Game Score: 8/10\n\n-----\n\nIf you have never played descent understand that it is a very old game, as of right now the game is 19 years old. For those of you lucky enough to play it as kids or even adults you know how great the original game was. At the time the graphics of descent were extremly advanced and even caused motion sickness in many of its players. The game is a first person ship shooter that takes place in our solar system. After many mining bases have fallen silent you are hired as a mercenary tasked with investigating these mining bases. You learn that the bases have been taken over by an alien AI. In order to stop this virus from spreading you are asked to go deep into the planets and moons of our solar system to destroy the Alien Computer Cores. You pilot an advanced fighter deep into the recesses of this deep beautiful game. You upgrade your ship, find new weapons and eventually destroy the Allien menace over 30 levels of well developed secret filled mines. Whether you are using the stupidly fast firing vulcan or the imobile but very power proximity mines you will find descent to be a solid and very fun game to play.\n\nFor those that have played the game, the steam version of descent does perfeectly well in emulating the original title on newer systems. For those of you who have tried to emulate the original descent, you know how problematic that can be. Its easy to remember the framerate issues and terrible crashes that were so common trying to get this game running under a newer operating system. I'll admit I presumptuaosly shut the game down after seeing the dosbox logo pop up, having remembered my frustration attempting to get the game to run in windows XP at the time. I'm glad I reopened it. In short whoever set it up did so masterfully, there are no issues present in running the game. It is exactly as I remember the title when it first came out.

It's really hard until you get the hang of it, and then you become basically unstoppable. The most scary part of the game for me was level 7, the first time I encountered the first boss. I went out into this big lava room and the boss made such a horrible scary sound when he appeared, and it killed me. Then I would hide inside the tunnel leading to the bosses' room, and it would appear nearby. My heart would nearly stop when I would hear the sound effect he would make, because then I knew he was nearby. The boss would fire missles into my tunnel I was hiding in, and the little green balls would lock onto my ship and destroy me. After trying countless times to beat him by shooting at him from inside my not-so-safe tunnel, I made a bold and daring move. I left the tunnel. And amazingly, even though I played only with the keyboard, my little fingers would move so fast I could slide up, down, right, left and spin in all kinds of crazy circles, the little green balls would try to lock onto my ship but I was able to dodge them all. The funnest part of this game for me was its built-in replay recording feature, which will record a replay of your game. Once I got good at beating the boss, I increased the difficulty level to \"insane\", and recorded countless epic replays of me beating the boss on insane. He would shoot missles  as fast as a machine gun on insane difficulty, and every one of those missles would explode into a cloud of green balls. Hundreds of green balls would be in the air at once. Shoulda been impossible for me to dodge them all. Even just one or two of them hitting me would destroy my ship at that level of difficulty. But I would dodge them all. I would do loop to loops around the boss, zig-zagging through all the green balls, all the while shootting at him and throwing his own green balls right back at him, destroying him with his own green balls!

The good old Descent delivers! Graphics are awesome for the 1995 release date and the gameplay is as addictive as I remember it. Downloaded it as soon as I saw it was available. Was looking for a long time for a descent like title. Very glad to get the original that can run on todays machines. The old descent game ran too fast. Would like to see it remade in HD resolution and updated to support modern mouse. Why isn't Descent 2 also on Steam?\nWell enough remembering and ranting... here is the review.\nThis was one of the first true 3d game on the market, together with Quake. Notice how when firing a flare along a corridor lights up the walls as it travels. That was an amazing performance at the time of the original release.\nAlso this game is one of the few even today that offers true freedom of movement. The original idea was that being in space had to deliver the atmosphere of lack of gravity and allowing you to turn on all axes delivers on that feeling. This also allows for doors to be placed on ceilling and floors.\nAnother way to get a good feeling is dodging those lasers being fired at you. With enough practice you can be invincible only using your skill alone. Very much like Dark souls.\nThe AI is good even by todays standards. Some bot types are aggresive when in numbers or retreat if alone or even run to get bigger bots. Playing on higher difficulties takes a lot of caution.

This game was an awesome experience back in the day. It was ahead of its time, as well, being the first 3D game (to my knowledge) to feature polygon entities instead of sprites. I used to play it keyboard only, and became so proficient at it that using a mouse for other games felt wrong. The atmosphere is really gripping, the sense of being alone in a hostile environment, the walls closing in on you, constantly on the alert for the sound of secret doors opening to unleash your foes behind your back... or above you, or below you. Yes, you need to think and act in all directions at once in Descent. \n\nPlayers today might wonder what all the fuss is about, but they need only look past the dated graphics, have their travel sickness pills handy, and dive in. The gameplay is taut, and very tactical. Running and gunning is not a good idea, you will often need to advance, take cover, watch your back... and watch out for those pesky rockets! It's also a great example of that seemingly lost art, the Hidden Areas (TM)! It's worth your while to really study your environment, as some of the best upgrades and ammo are hidden. \nThe enemy AI is surprisingly advanced, as robots will try to evade your fire, while keeping you in their sights at all times. You will soon learn to dread certain robots, and to be wary of superficially calm, spacious areas, because these tend to turn into intense battle arenas in the blink of an eye.\nThen, after all the rockets and laser blasts have ceased after another blistering fight, you'll breathe a heavy sigh of relief... and then try to get up the nerve to advance to the next area. \n\nThis is one of those classics that's dying for a modern version (that keeps the gameplay intact).

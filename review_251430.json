It was short (6-7 hours until completed), but longer than I expected from the first look.  \nWhile the characters seem simply illustrated, the world and background is in fact quite detailed and charming, while still making it simple enough to find all the objects you can interact with.\n\nThe game draws up its very own world with quirky characters and unique creatures. I was really drawn in by all the details and listened to almost all dialogs to get to know about them. The world and the story kept me immersed, captivated and engaged enough to play through in only a few sessions. The game has great humour in the dialogs and interaction, which makes it just so much more fun and worth exploring all the possible conversations. I had myself chuckling at the screen on so many occasions.\nAlso, the voice acting is great and well paced. While in other games I find myself skipping a lot of the dialog, I listened to most of it here, as it wasn't too slow or long and brings the characters to life in such a great way. If you wanted though, you could skip every dialog and cutscene. \n\nThe difficulty level isn't exactly easy, but the interactions and combinations mostly make sense (unlike other point & click adventures) and there's no need to randomly combine things. If you do get stuck, there's quite a good hint system that helps you out by giving you information in little pieces, trying not to spoil anything. \n\nI found the story interesting with a few surprises, not very obvious. That being said, I would have loved a more thorough ending.\nAlso, in conversations you can talk about a single topic several times. I clicked on all of them, because I wanted to explore all the conversation and not miss anything, but often they keep blabbering about the same topic without really giving more content. \n\nI also liked that you don't have too many scenes at once were you go looking for possible things to do, but I was annoyed at the loading screen between them, which made me really impatient. One scene in particular, where you have to go back and forth a lot had me waiting so often that it kinda took away from the fun.\n\nAlso, the achievements aren't very hard to get. If you read the descriptions, you could get almost all of them in a single playthrough. That might spoil some of the story though, so I wouldn't advise it.", "timestamp_created": 1514642949, "timestamp_updated": 1514643171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Just eminent. \n\nIt folds out again and again and all of the characters come to life. You really do believe in them as the story unfolds. \nAll characters matters. Good or evil.

The details may not have anything to do with the story, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\nBut this is how you can tell that the developers really cared. That the game really mattered to them in all those tiny details. And then it matters to you as well.\n\n\nBe in for a game with some nut-cracking puzzles \u2013 some of them may not make any sense at first, but we will figure it out sooner or later. \nAnd maybe we will not\u2026\n\nIf it is a problem, the game has an amazing hint system: You can ask for a hint \u2013 but only a little piece of hint little by little. It is unfolding to the length of your need. Nothing more...\nI have played a lot of games in the same genre on Steam and on other platforms, but this is truly the best way of helping the players if they are stuck.\n\n\nAs you can tell, I really enjoyed \u201cThe Inner World\u201d. \nNah: I was carried away to another world, and I wished I could stay there forever. It was one of my best game experiences ever.\n\nI will give it a 10/10, and I am going to play again and maybe again. I might have missed some obscure details\u2026 In fact: I know I have\u2026\n\nIf you like point and click, well-thought-of voiceovers (sorry I didn\u2019t mention those \u2013 they are terrific), lots of surprises, astonishing characters and a good length of a game, you should just buy it. It is AMAZING!\n\nI am looking forward to se more games from the indendant german studio Fizbin.", "timestamp_created": 1512996420, "timestamp_updated": 1512996660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38231684": {"recommendationid": "38231684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362807778", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512850422}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

The Linux port, which is the one I played, is unfortunately pretty awful, but in the end I'd recommend it even on that platform (though see below for specific complaints about the port, and be prepared to hit that Refund button if the workarounds aren't good enough for you).\n\nBack to positives, the puzzles are often quite inventive and unique, while also generally not being overly difficult.  There's some great pervasive humor throughout, a fairly touching (if predictable) story of personal discovery throughout, good background music, and great voice acting!  It's a very nicely self-contained story, and it's a world I'm excited to get back to in the forthcoming sequel.  My only real complaint storywise is that the main villian turns out to have one of those nonsensical \"let's just destroy everything for no adequate reason\" type motivations, but whatever.  The game is, IMO, well worth your time.\n\nThe Linux port, though!  Man.  It's rough.  I actually gave up on trying to play the game a few years ago because I couldn't for the life of me get any of the cutscenes to play, though recently (and on a different distro) I gave it another go and was able to get through the game.  I'm gonna enumerate the issues on the Linux version, so you can judge for yourself whether you're willing to fight through 'em:\n\n[b]1. Cutscene Problems[/b]\n\nEven now that cutscenes in general worked for me, there were many cutscenes which [i]wouldn't[/i] play.  Some of which included vital clues that you'd need to solve puzzles, too, so it wasn't just story you'd be missing out on.  I did figure out solutions for all but two of the game's cutscenes (and the two were pretty minor ones), though, so check out this post for workarounds for those: http://steamcommunity.com/app/251430/discussions/0/611701360817206606/?ctp=3#c1488861734110465332\n\nThis problem is, honestly, extremely galling because it gives the impression that the devs/publishers literally never played through the game to completion on Linux, despite offering a Linux version for sale.  It was pretty basic stuff.\n\n[b]2. No Steam Achievements or Playtime notification[/b]\n\nYou'll note that my playtime just says \"0.6 hours.\"  I promise you it's much more than that; I've solved the game.  It just doesn't generally talk to steam at all.  Interestingly, I think the only time it DOES record your time properly is when playing cutscenes, since I always get the Steam popup in the corner when one starts.  (The cutscenes, on Linux anyway, always play in a completely new window, which is why that's possible.)\n\n[b]3. Rather broken options menu[/b]\n\nAdjusting the volume sliders is a bizarre and unintuitive combination of frantically clicking around, hitting arrow keys, and occasionally seeing the sliders move around with seemingly little relation to what you're actually doing.\n\n[b]4. Sometimes similarly-broken UI in the game[/b]\n\nEarly in the game, for instance, you can climb up on a balcony overlooking the temple.  You have several interaction options up there, but only one of them actually accepts mouse clicks properly.  Later in the game, I noticed that inventory interactions would often choose \"Use\" when I clicked \"Look.\"  I encountered one place which would reliably seem to cause all game-related input to be ignored for a few tens of seconds before magically starting up again.  In general this didn't pop up too often, though, at least.\n\n[b]5. The bottom-screen inventory hovering doesn't work, nor does \"Escape\"[/b]\n\nThis, at least, has an easy workaround by hitting Tab, but still.  Lame.\n\n[b]6. Background music/noise stops playing if the game loses focus[/b]\n\nThis can be regained by hitting <Tab> and then the wrench icon, to bring up the options menu, and then returning to the game.  Sound will resume once you do that.  (It'll also come back on its own after you move to a new room or two.)\n\n[b]7. Sometimes dialog audio doesn't actually play[/b]\n\nI didn't take the time to pin this one down exactly, but there were many points in the game where a dialog line just wouldn't be spoken.  Not a huge deal since it was still onscreen, but still.\n\n[b]8. Cutscenes frequently seem to use the German versions, with German signage, even though the English versions definitely exist in the media dir[/b]\n\nNot a huge deal, obviously.\n\n[b]9. Other more minor bugs:[/b]\n\nThere's a weird bug where you can jump ahead to the third section of the game, when you'd just started it.  (Minor spoilers follow) [spoilers]The first time I hit the button on the paper airplane machine in the Root Forest, it showed cutscenes for all three directions and gave me the final result of the last cutscene (which was not the position the machine was in originally).  Also the guard keeping you from the Laboratory and Throne Room, in the Basylian factory hops about 100 pixels to the left after each interaction, sometimes reverting back to his original spot but more often ending up completely off the screen.[/spoilers]\n\n[b](That's all I'll list, I swear)[/b]\n\nAnyway, as you can see, it's [b]not[/b] a good port by any means.  The main problem which makes the game borderline-unplayable is the cutscene issue, which thankfully can be worked around by the methods I describe.  It's a measure of how much I enjoyed the game otherwise that I'm willing to recommend it on Linux [i]despite[/i] all the lack of polish on here.

Asposia runs on wind, but only wind fountain out of the original three in Asposia is still functioning, so the lights are going out and the residents will soon suffocate. Also, there are attacks from the wind gods, who petrify anyone deemed \"immoral.\" Robert gets unwillingly pulled along for the ride. It's a great story with some interesting puzzles.\n\nPros:\n+ Great story and worldbuilding. Very unique.\n+ Good humor. Robert is adorable and sheltered, leading to some hilarious situations like him not understanding sexual innuendo or is naive enough to believe a holy man when he claims that he's \"meditating\" while at a slot machine. There are lots of other fun characters, like helpless researchers and blockheaded guards.\n+ Decent music. Not super memorable, but good at setting a mood and not intrusive or annoying.\n\nNeutral:\n~ Generally fun puzzles, but there were a few that were annoying because they involve combining a bunch of non-related items to solve a puzzle, and it's not obvious what you're making until it's finished. Having the \"A-ha!\" moment AFTER you've built a thing is definitely the wrong order.\n\nCon:\n- Game is a bit buggy.

His adopted son - or should I better say \"slave\" - is the protagonist and by accident he stumbles out of the palace he has lived all his life and begins an adventure which will make him discover the outside world, love and some (ugly) truths.\n\nThis point & click adventure is easy to control and to understand. The way you select your items and go through dialogues (all displayed with symbols) is similar to \"Sam & Max: Hit the Road\" (thus also playable for illiterates by the way).\nSo your main task is to progress in the story by talking to characters, finding items and combining them with other things. You can't die in the game or get yourself into dead ends. \nThe difficulty level is fine, the puzzles aren't child friendly-easy but also not too hard. However, as in classics like several LucasArts adventures or \"Simon the Sorcerer\" you definitely need to think laterally a lot in order to progress. So it's still challenging here and there. If you're still stuck, there is an in-game help but I personally don't know if it's good (I never used it).\n\nWhat makes the game for me is this universe and its culture you're introduced to, the story and its main character. It's a game full of charme and a good dose of humour. However, the further you get the darker the story feels which is also pretty cool. Even though you can't die in the game you experience more and more traces of darkness, dictatorship, superstition and threats in this world. That's when the humour comes handy and brings extra charme to the game. And as for the characters, especially Robert is great here thanks to his naive but optimistic nature, his design and his English voice actor Mike McAlpine.\n\nSpeaking of, let's quickly talk about the graphics and sound.\nThe animations are or are like digital Flash animation. It's not glamourous graphics but the cartoon style is original and likeable, you can connect to those Asposians and the other creatures very well (at least I can). Original is also the character design. The backgrounds look more detailed and not only that, they look beautiful. Also despite of the cartoonish style it's never in too bright colours, the colours are actually quite subtle.\nThe soundtrack is very nice. So nice though that I purchased the soundtrack DLC after finishing the game. It's beautiful and serves a lot of the game's atmosphere. When it comes to voices you can choose between the German and the English language. Even though the game's from Germany and so am I, I personally prefer the English version. I just like chosen voices there better, especially Robert's voice (as mentioned before).\n\nAre there things I don't like in \"The Inner World\"? Just a few minor things that never seriously destroy the game. \nThere are little flaws in the animation (people who have created vector graphics in general or flash animation may know what I mean). Also I wished that the world of Asposia had at least more background characters. Most of the time it looks like you save a world that's barely populated at all (and yes, I know, why a certain amount of people are gone but still...).\n\nWhat about extras? Well, there's a \"Play Flute-Nose\" option in the main menu which allows you to play Robert's nose as a flute \u00e0 la \"Guitar Hero\" (react to the music by pressing certain buttons in the right moments). I haven't played this often because it's not that great for me but if you enjoy this kind of music game or a bonus mini game in general, you might like this.\nThere are also Steam achievements and trading cards. \n\nSo: Do I recommend \"The Inner World\"? Yes, definitely, if you enjoy adventure games.\nPersonally I enjoyed it very much. I don't consider this one of the greatest adventures ever but it's still very good and since I know that there's a sequel game coming in summer 2017, I'm so looking forward to it and can't wait to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1488304647, "timestamp_updated": 1488304647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30227732": {"recommendationid": "30227732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268582726", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486763696}, "language": "french", "review": "Jeu tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able, dr\u00f4le et po\u00e9tique.

Its [b]story[/b] is set in the fantasy world of Asposia. Asposia is a world surrounded by earth. Air is blown into Asposia through only a few large holes. Each of these holes is guarded by a wind monk. Robert lives in a wind monastery with one of the wind monks. He's treated like a doormat and has never left the monastery. By accident, he plunges through a garbage chute and finds himself in a world he knows very little of. What will he discover?\n\nThe [b]graphics[/b] of [i]The Inner World[/i] are hand-drawn and cartoonish in style. The world of Asposia looks pretty nice and full of life. The characters look ugly but that's a style the developers chose. I'm sure they didn't think they created the most beautiful animated characters ever, but they consciously chose a simple, cartoonish look for their characters, which fits the world and the story they wanted to show us.\n\nThe game is German in origin but the way it was transitioned to the English version is impressive. This shows in two major ways:\n[list]\n[*] The [b]voice acting[/b] is top-notch. The voice actor of Robert, the protagonist, manages to capture Robert's innocense and naivety perfectly.\n[*] The [b]humour[/b] did not get lost in translation, as is often the case. [i]The Inner World[/i] is even genuinely funny at times. It's not often that a computer game can make me laugh out loud a couple of times, and makes me giggle a few more times on top of that.\n[/list]\nThe [b]difficulty[/b] of [i]The Inner World[/i] is challenging enough but the solutions to the puzzles are always logical, so the game never becomes frustratingly hard and it never makes you want to look up a walkthrough. To help you play through the game more easily, you can hold the mouse button to see all the objects Robert can interact with. Should you find yourself stumped, you can open a help menu and get a hint on what to do next. If you still don't know how to proceed, you can ask to get another hint. And so on, until the solution is pretty much spelled out to you.\n\n[i]The Inner World[/i] has 7 [b]Steam Trading Cards[/b]. You'll get 4 while running the game. Of the 23 [b]Steam Achievements[/b] some are storybound and unmissable, but other achievements are optional and very much missable.

Dev team\u2019s first and so far only foray onto Steam. I\u2019d say they managed to offer an interesting game even if it never stands out really.\n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIt\u2019s a coming-of-age type of story, at least at it\u2019s very beginning. Inner World\u2019s protagonist, is a shy and rather na\u00efve little boy named Robert. He starts this adventure like most video game heroes do, fulfilling errands. A less common element would be that you start by working for the game\u2019s main antagonist. The game\u2019s world, Asposia is a rather intricate fantasy realm in which a force of nature (in our case, wind itself) is used as a leitmotif. For an adventure that is also addressed to younger audiences, Inner World contains satire and pop culture references that will amuse older gamers. As far as its storyline is concerned, this title won\u2019t disappoint. Especially if you\u2019re accustomed to 2D adventures and you can imagine just what sort of odd characters you shall interact with. The other almost classic features of the genre, such as the inventory system and dialogue options are under a familiar interface with the occasional mixing of two components, in order to create another one. \n\nWhat I found intriguing was that even wild combinations seem to work and even when they don\u2019t, you still receive an Achievement for trying. A nice touch indeed, from the developers. Story seems long enough, since I\u2019ve only seen a small part of the map so far. A minor complaint from me, would be related to the way all the in-game items you collect seem to blend in so well with the scenery. You really have to keep an eye out for them and click on every little nook and cranny.\n\nThe beautiful hand drawn locations and characters clearly show the efforts undertaken by the devs in order to separate from similar titles. And from the artwork perspective, I\u2019d say they accomplished that. Voice acting is more than decent, both in English and in the game\u2019s original language, German. I stuck with English dubs and subs and found no typos or mispronunciations so far. Worth mentioning as well, is the musical score which I found particularly soothing and proper.\n \n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Original storyline, filled with humor\n+ Intuitive puzzles and a comprehensive hint system\n+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- A few dialogues tend to drag on, thus slowing the story down\n- Items blend in too well with the scenery\n\n[h1]Result / Final thoughts[/h1]\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good fantasy adventure that won\u2019t strain you too much, you should give The Inner World a chance. Since it targets a large part of the gamer demographic, it\u2019s ideal even for a novice as well as a veteran of this genre. While I\u2019m not exactly okay with its pricing, I do realize that a lot of effort is being placed into such games, from concept art and down to the skilled voice actors.\n\n[b]Rating 7/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives]Elite Giveaways[/url], check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1478505550, "timestamp_updated": 1483474964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26243060": {"recommendationid": "26243060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037106824", "num_games_owned": 580, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469624689}, "language": "polish", "review": "Je\u017celi jeste\u015b fanem przygod\u00f3wek i gier typu point&click, nie zwlekaj!

Its immediately charming ambiance and art style lend a unique tone to the reasonably enjoyable story, where every detail is nicely executed but falls short of impressing.[/h1]\n\nYour character, Robert, is strangely charming in his naive and very literal approach to everything. He does not understand metaphors and is relatively dimwitted with a knack for stating the obvious. Your eventual partner has a far more confrontational and action-driven persona. Most characters you'll meet are actually quite original and rather silly.\n\nDecent writing and delightful vocal performances, with strangely slow-paced and very articulated dialogue, make the game actually sort of relaxing to hear. Coupled with the reassuring absence of failure, it is quite pleasant if somewhat unexciting.\n\nThe game behaves as you'd expect in a point-and-click, with an overall high level of polish, except in a few scenes where the audio sometimes cut abruptly at inappropriate times. Nice, clean interface, particularly with good iconography used for all dialog choices. Technically very stable.\n\n[h1]\"That's just a random guess, isn't it?\"[/h1]\n\nPuzzle requirements and solutions unfold naturally, except in the final chapter, which I found a bit more obtuse than the rest. Situations are all a bit absurd but nearly always made sense within the given context. My interest nevertheless progressively dwindled once the novelty wore off and the plot turned into a more conventional clich\u00e9.\n\nFunny achievements reward failed creative attempts or silly solutions. One of the better uses of achievements I've seen in any type of game, they complement the humour nicely.\n\nServiceable but unremarkable cutscenes are directly layered over the background panels for a nice, dynamic integration. The hand-drawn animation has style but the frame rate is not very smooth. Also, English signs do not match spoken dialogue and remain in German during cutscenes, but that's just nitpicking.\n\nIf this game were a meal, it'd be the sort that fills you up sufficiently to satisfy the hunger but would not cut the craving for truly delicious food. There's really nothing to dislike about The Inner World. It's a fun, simple game in the tradition of the genre, built on solid foundations that will hopefully spawn a better sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1476237474, "timestamp_updated": 1476237502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25834197": {"recommendationid": "25834197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198592779", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467313894}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a delightful game, with excellent cut scenes, voice acting and cute art style.

Their only hope lies in an evil mastermind who bargains with the wind gods daily. When his naive and unassuming apprentice, Robert, accidentally loses his master's pendant, he goes outside of the palace for the first time in his life to find it. What follows is a hilarious, fascinating, and clever point-and-click game about Robert and wanted criminal Laura trying to save the world.\n\nAll the basic polish is fanatstic; the music is great and suits the mood perfectly, the art style is superb and excellently captures the essence of the seedy underground you'll be exploring for most of the game. Every character is completely unique, with the exception of the guards, which are supposed to be carbon copies of each other, the dialogue is extremely well-written, and there are underlying themes throughout that are both morbidly fascinating and innocently interesting. The puzzles are extremely clever and intuitive, requiring you to think both outside and inside the box. You may need to collect an arrow not for a knife or weapon, but for the tail that can be used to clean out a pipe.\n\nThe games' biggest downfall is its length and pacing. There are only five chapters, and I beat the game in about eight hours with most of the achievments. The way it was set up, with the underlying mysteries, strange minds of the supporting cast, and overall themes, it felt like an adventure that should have lasted at least ten chapters, which would also have left room for some characters to be developed. You only get to play as Laura one time during the entire game, and her snarky comments and conversations were perfect for multiple uses during a game like this. In fact, it almost feels cut off; you accidentally land in the bad guy's lair after falling through a hole in the third chapter, which brings an anticlimactic feel to the whole experience, like you were cheated out of a longer game. Near the end, everything kind of plateaus out; the puzzles are suddenly rather easy, and the end comes up much more quickly than expected. It was, admittedly, a disappointing end to a great game, and makes me want to beg for a sequel where I can properly explore this fascinating world.\n\nIn the end, The Inner World is a brilliant little game with clever puzzles and an intriguing story that just ends a little too early.

It's vastly amusing, simple yet thoughtful, charming in its graphics and character voicing, and most importantly to me, the puzzles are LOGICAL. After playing Deponia, which was challenging even with a detailed walkthrough, the logical thought pattern of \"well, this doesn't hit the bad guy in the jaw like I was hoping, but it is going under his nose, and I happen to have knockout drops, therefore when it passes underneath he will fall unconscious onto the button\" is very refreshing. it's nice to be able to figure out some problems on my own before turning to the in-game hints. Those hints, by the way, are super nice because they'll not only give you pointers to the logical procession of seemingly unconnected tasks, but the hints are arranged in a way that you can click through a couple, just enough to get the idea without it expressly telling you, without feeling like you've totally given up on all problem solving on your own.\n\nRobert is a very sweet likeable character, though Laura was a bit of a drag at times. The plot was engaging, and had a few unexpected twists. Very rarely do I get engrossed enough in a game to feel worried or horrified for the characters, but this one sucked me in and I was genuinely rooting for Robert and Laura long before the end.\n\nThat being said, I would also recommend this game solely because of the hilarious progression of the Conrad puppet.\n\nA must-have game for those who like a casual point-and-click.

It's just a shame it's so damn short compared to the titles I remember from the older days.\n\n[h1]Highlights[/h1]\n\nThe writing, characters, world and art-style are all important things for Point & Clicks, and The Inner World gets all of them right. Due to the short length of the game the characters don't really develop, but they mostly have enough backstory and care of writing to have more than one dimension. They all have reasons for doing what they're doing and even short interactions like helping the character involve a motivation of some kind that you don't see written into too many games these days.\nThe world is rich and interesting and again, thought and care and good writing have gone hand in hand to create a diverse landscape with enough character to feel immersive. The art-style is friendly but layered enough to add time and history, and importance where it's due.\n\n[h1]Mistakes and Annoyances[/h1]\n\nMy biggest complaint with The Inner World is the short length and lack of content. Although it's well written and shines as an upbeat story, with only 3 memorable characters and a couple of protagonists and a handful of areas it just doesn't have enough content to explore and ultimately feels rather shallow. As a result it's good value for money when on sale, but is hard to recommend at full price because of the low level of content to explore.\n\nSome may find this far too easy, and at times I think it feels a little too casual, as though you're merely exploring an interactive artbook rather than solving puzzles and furthering the story with gameplay, but these moments are sparse and unless you have a hard time investing in the story or characters, or don't enjoy the writing then you'll find plenty of joy in just exploring what's here, nevermind solving the puzzles.\n\nOther than that The Inner World really doesn't have anything to criticise. There are a couple of sections where it's not particularly intuitive on how to progress, and the age old Point-and-Click problem of disjointed solutions becomes apparant, but these are mitigated by the wonderful hint system and become easy to overlook.\nPerhaps you could complain the small extra content game unlocked after playing isn't fun and essentially pointless, but that's hardly a compelling reason against buying the game.\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\n\nPriced on Steam at \u00a311.99/$14.99/13.99\u20ac, The Inner World clocks in at a typical 7-8 hours of gameplay, and has enough charm and dimensions to warrant an additional playthrough or two down the line. It's very fairly priced if you don't mind the short length and goes on sale for up to 85% off, which is a bloody bargain.\n\n* An animated series based on the game is/was planned, a demo of which is available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STsqPrG8L7E\n* Funding for a sequel, The Inner World 2 - The last Windmonk, seems to have been approved in 2015 as mentioned in [url=http://innovation.mfg.de/de/standort/kreativwirtschaft/games/digital-content-funding-ein-wiedersehen-mit-den-flotennasen-1.38522]this German press release[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1462496780, "timestamp_updated": 1462504595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22818047": {"recommendationid": "22818047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025161989", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403520888}, "language": "english", "review": "A surprisingly great game.

It's like that's something the game put in to fool you around :) But I like it really XD\n\nIn addition, the music and the voice actor casting are really GREAT. I also love the hand-drawn style artwork.

Ontop of this, items can sometimes be combined in the wrong way, which is making things unnecessarily confusing.\n\nOverall, this game was not a pleasant experience.

While it is polished enough to be worth your time, it hasn't enough charm or substance in the storytelling to keep you engrossed.\n\nA first stab at the adventure genre by the developers, they've told a story of a little boy who is a member of an underground civilization plagued by a number of problems, first are all these wind gods turning people into stone and the second being the absence of wind.  The world is foreign and interesting enough with its own history, culture, and physics that keep you guessing and interested in what is happening and what led up to the present sequence of events.  The story is, boy gets caught up in problem, meets anarchist girl, ends up in revolution, discovers past, bad stuff happens, uses past to save the world, live happily ever after.  The story is adventure game fodder and is not done exceptional enough to make it seem new or like something I haven't played already.\n\nThe dialogue was translated from German and it was done well enough save for some patchy words which made it into the localization, misnamed objects, odd sentences and the like.  As far as that goes, there is a LOT of dialogue.  Your mileage may vary if you consider this a good or bad thing.  It provides a lot of exposition, character development, and world building.  It also starts falling into the land of monotonous walls of text.  If you are having any issues with a dialogue puzzle, you can expect to see the same lines repeated several times.\n\nThe art is done to give the game its own style.  It's cartoony, imaginative, and contributes to the development of the story and world.  The only issue I had with it was it had so much drab and brown, but that's for my own tastes.\n\nThe puzzles, dialogue and inventory, are done well and help the pacing, which is all I can ask of puzzles in an adventure game.  They are well-made and don't require the use of LOL logic to figure out.  Their difficulty improves gradually over the game and helps immersion and pacing.  If you have problems, the game has an interactive hint book which can help push you in the right direction.  There's nothing really bad I can say about them other than the repetition you may face if you have issues with a dialogue puzzle.\n\nIn all, the game is ok and I had no real problems with it.  The only problem is, it exists in a genre swamped with better games and other games no better than this one.  If you are an adventure game fan, you can play this for something new.

The game reminds me of Daedalic Entertainment titles such as The Whispered World and The NIght of The Rabbit. Characters are well written and in my opinion voiced exceptionally well. The story is fairly unique and paced quite well. The dialouge hits serious and quirky/funny tones. It isn't a very long game, like most indie adventures, or even games like the Monkey Island Series, but that doesn't mean its not worth the price.\n\nThe art style is unique as well. I really enojyed the hand drawn aspect of the game and the colours really set the atmosphere. Cutscenes are well done and frequent. They are cool and help carry the store. Puzzles for the most part are pretty intuitive and fun to complete.\n\nIf you enjoyed The Whispered World, The Night of The Rabbit, Deponia Series, Monkey Island Series, Satinav/Memoria, etc. than you should definately pick this up.

This one might be a little long, sorry guys!\n\nI tend to be very on or off with point and clicks, It doesn't happen very often that i get into a game of this genre, don't get bored half way through, and actually manage to get to the end of it.\n\nThe tendency with this genre for me is that if they don't flow well enough, if i get stuck on obscure item combinations (which happens a lot with point and clicks) or if it's just not interesting enough, i'll give up and not bother going back to it. This is one point and click game however that i am happy to say that not only could i actually bare to get through it, but it's actually a really good game. It's been the best point and click game i have played since the Deponia series, which i adored.\n\nIn ways, this game reminded me a little of that series. I guess in just style and art. I was actually somewhat convinced whilst playing that it might be by Daedalic Entertainment, but alas it's not!\n\nAdmittedly when i first started playing this, i thought it was quite slow (maybe i was just in a particularly impatient mood that day?). The dialog seemed like it was paced too slowly and i was generally dreading the trek ahead to completing this game. Although I'm glad to say i changed my mind very quickly with that one.\n\nThe story is very inventive and i found it quite interesting. The game was fun to play through and the ending was definitely not disappointing. I think i can safely say that it's not the plot twist of the century, but it's not entirely predictable either. Either way it was great to see things unfold and i loved the creativity and humor involved.\n\nIn terms of characters, I love them. There are some very lovable characters in this game. Including our main star Robert. A well mannered, polite, silly and somewhat naive little Asposian. \n\nThe graphics are nice. It's very soft, light and nice on the eyes. A light-hearted, hand-drawn and cartoon-like style. With that said, i did have a few problems with crashing/freezing. Sometimes the loading screen between chapters just wouldn't load. It was usually fine because the game tends to autosave before the \"end of chapter\" cutscene. So you don't really lose anything, but it's still a minor annoyance having to reboot the game. \nI found that if you tended to not move or click anything whilst the cutscene was playing or it was trying to load, it'd usually load fine. If you pressed buttons and clicked your mouse, that's when it tended to have a hard time and freeze.\n\nThat being the only negative thing out of the way, back to the positive stuff!\nThe help system in this is quite good. I usually try not to use hints whenever i can, but being stuck on something for a long while gets a bit frustrating. I was quite impressed with the hint system, I wanted to see how many hints it would give you and how obvious they'd be. It gives you a few little nudges in the right direction before just spelling it out to you. Plus, you still don't get it? It'll spell it out to you even more blatantly. Literally to the point of \"Go pick this thing up over there, and use it on this\".\n\nLastly, achievements!\nThis one is pretty easy to complete 100% and i think my method for doing so was a decent way of doing it. \nI basically started a game file (it allows you up to 3), I played through a chapter, then went back to the main menu and started a second game for missed achievements throughout each chapter. Every time i would complete a chapter in my main save, i'd go back to the secondary save to complete it again whilst getting any missed achievements. \nThe chapters aren't too long and once you know what you are doing going back and getting the missables in a second game file isn't as tedious as it sounds. \nThere is one lonesome guide for this game that details \"missable achievements\" you can either read the names/descriptions and try to figure yourself how to get them, or you could just use the guide to know what to do. (In my opinion it's fairly easy to figure out how to get them just from reading the title or description)\nAlso, there are a few achievements that having two saves actually makes it easier. For example, there is one achievement for not using the guide at all and one for using the guide frequently. So either way really, you'd have to play it twice. \n\nAll in all i really loved this game and i'm glad i decided to have a go with it.

This one might be a little long, sorry guys!\n\nI tend to be very on or off with point and clicks, It doesn't happen very often that i get into a game of this genre, don't get bored half way through, and actually manage to get to the end of it.\n\nThe tendency with this genre for me is that if they don't flow well enough, if i get stuck on obscure item combinations (which happens a lot with point and clicks) or if it's just not interesting enough, i'll give up and not bother going back to it. This is one point and click game however that i am happy to say that not only could i actually bare to get through it, but it's actually a really good game. It's been the best point and click game i have played since the Deponia series, which i adored.\n\nIn ways, this game reminded me a little of that series. I guess in just style and art. I was actually somewhat convinced whilst playing that it might be by Daedalic Entertainment, but alas it's not!\n\nAdmittedly when i first started playing this, i thought it was quite slow (maybe i was just in a particularly impatient mood that day?). The dialog seemed like it was paced too slowly and i was generally dreading the trek ahead to completing this game. Although I'm glad to say i changed my mind very quickly with that one.\n\nThe story is very inventive and i found it quite interesting. The game was fun to play through and the ending was definitely not disappointing. I think i can safely say that it's not the plot twist of the century, but it's not entirely predictable either. Either way it was great to see things unfold and i loved the creativity and humor involved.\n\nIn terms of characters, I love them. There are some very lovable characters in this game. Including our main star Robert. A well mannered, polite, silly and somewhat naive little Asposian. \n\nThe graphics are nice. It's very soft, light and nice on the eyes. A light-hearted, hand-drawn and cartoon-like style. With that said, i did have a few problems with crashing/freezing. Sometimes the loading screen between chapters just wouldn't load. It was usually fine because the game tends to autosave before the \"end of chapter\" cutscene. So you don't really lose anything, but it's still a minor annoyance having to reboot the game. \nI found that if you tended to not move or click anything whilst the cutscene was playing or it was trying to load, it'd usually load fine. If you pressed buttons and clicked your mouse, that's when it tended to have a hard time and freeze.\n\nThat being the only negative thing out of the way, back to the positive stuff!\nThe help system in this  is quite good. I usually try not to use hints whenever i can, but being stuck on something for a long while gets a bit frustrating. I was quite impressed with the hint system, I wanted to see how many hints it would give you and how obvious they'd be. It gives you a few little nudges in the right direction before just spelling it out to you. Plus, you still don't get it? It'll spell it out to you even more blatantly. Literally to the point of \"Go pick this thing up over there, and use it on this\".\n\nLastly, achievements!\nThis one is pretty easy to complete 100% and i think my method for doing so was a decent way of doing it. \nI basically started a game file (it allows you up to 3), I played through a chapter, then went back to the main menu and started a second game for missed achievements throughout each chapter. Every time i would complete a chapter in my main save, i'd go back to the secondary save to complete it again whilst getting any missed achievements. \nThe chapters aren't too long and once you know what you are doing going back and getting the missables in a second game file isn't as tedious as it sounds. \nThere is one lonesome guide for this game that details \"missable achievements\" you can either read the names/descriptions and try to figure yourself how to get them, or you could just use the guide to know what to do. (In my opinion it's fairly easy to figure out how to get them just from reading the title or description)\nAlso, there are a few achievements that having two saves actually makes it easier. For example, there is one achievement for not using the guide at all and one for using the guide frequently. So either way really, you'd have to play it twice. \n\nAll in all i really loved this game and i'm glad i decided to have a go with it. If you're a fan of the genre i would definitely recommend it to you. \n\n\nTL;DR :  It's great, seriously. The story is inventive, it's fun and humorous. If you are a fan of the genre then definitely try it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1452734898, "timestamp_updated": 1452734898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643091", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20514611": {"recommendationid": "20514611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013698729", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452731110}, "language": "polish", "review": "\u015awietna przygod\u00f3wka.

Nee, aber fast so gut![/h1]\n\n\n\"Ein deutsches Point&Click-Adventure? Ganz klar, muss von Daedelic sein!\" - so oder so \u00e4hnlich ist wohl der erste Eindruck eines jeden Genreliebhabers, wenn er von \"The Inner World\" h\u00f6rt. Und wenn die zust\u00e4ndigen Entwickler Studio Fizbin ihr Logo nicht in den Ladebildschirm beim starten des Spiels gesetzt h\u00e4tten, man w\u00fcrde auch nach der sechs bis acht Stunden langen R\u00e4tselei davon ausgehen, dass Daedelic Entertainment hinter dem Titel stecken w\u00fcrde. Und das in vollkommen positiven Sinne.\n\nOb nun die stimmungsvolle Welt, die atmosph\u00e4rischen Schaupl\u00e4tze, die tolle Musik, die meist gut designten (und manchmal auch kreativen) R\u00e4tsel, oder die liebensw\u00fcrdigen und durchgeknallten Charaktere und deren Humor - vieles in \"The Inner World\" ist auf hohem Niveau umgesetzt und begeistert. Auch wenn es technisch teilweise nicht ganz gepolished wirkt (relativ wenig Schaupl\u00e4tze, lange Ladezeiten, teilweise unn\u00f6tige Umwege f\u00fcr manche R\u00e4tsel, hakelige Animationen, die aber nur selten vorkommen, da viel auch in tollen Videosequenzen erz\u00e4hlt wird, nicht ganz perfekte Betonung, vor allem bei Lauras Sprechrolle), st\u00f6ren diese Kritikpunkte das tolle Spielgef\u00fchl nicht.\n\nWohl aber die Bugs - das Spiel hat durchaus noch einige Fehler. Bei mir waren diese durch ein Neuladen des Spielstandes oder einen Neustart des Spiels zu beheben, es soll aber auch A-Bugs geben, die man nur mit einem von den Entwicklern zugesendeten Speicherstand umgehen kann. Das ist schade und frustrierend, auch wenn das Bem\u00fchen der Entwickler um Aushilfe l\u00f6blich ist und das ganze durch geringes Budget zu erkl\u00e4ren ist. Es w\u00e4re sch\u00f6n gewesen, wenn man verschiedenen Speicherst\u00e4nde pro Durchlauf anlegen k\u00f6nnte, so w\u00e4re zum Einen die Gefahr von A-Bugs verringert, zum anderen aber auch die Achievement-Jagd erleichtert (und die lohnen sich wirklich! Selten habe ich so kreative und lustige Errungenschaften gesehen. Es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall, die Beschreibung dieser im Steam-Profil noch einmal nachzulesen :D).\n\nAllgemein l\u00e4sst sich feststellen, wieviel M\u00fche und Hingabe in das Spiel geflossen ist. Das macht es wirklich zu einem sehr sch\u00f6nen Erlebnis. Da st\u00f6ren nur die R\u00e4tsel in Kapitel 3 ein wenig - finden die R\u00e4tsel meist genau die richtige Balance zwischen \"einfach nachvollziehbar\" und \"herausfordernde Knobelei\", gibt es in diesem Kapitel einige Frustmomente. Da hilft dann aber die tolle R\u00e4tselhilfe aus. Genau so sollte eine solche Funktion aussehen - kleine Hinweise und Gedankenanst\u00f6\u00dfe geben, ohne sofort die ganze R\u00e4tsell\u00f6sung vorweg zu nehmen, auch wenn das, wenn gew\u00fcnscht, m\u00f6glich ist - ganz gro\u00dfes Kompliment!\n\n\"The Inner World\" ist ein tolles Spiel - aber eben auch ein Erstlingswerk eines jungen, neuen deutschen Entwicklerstudios.

Il motore di gioco per qualche ragione non \u00e8 stabilissimo e potrebbe crashare durante alcuni filmati, ma a parte questo non gli trovo particolari difetti seri. \u00c8 un'AG molto carina con personaggi ben caratterizzati, e tanto basta per essere piacevole da giocare. \n", "timestamp_created": 1444914343, "timestamp_updated": 1444914343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18395444": {"recommendationid": "18395444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105299229", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444361038}, "language": "english", "review": "Great and fun game, couldnt stop playing!", "timestamp_created": 1444396551, "timestamp_updated": 1444396551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18380414": {"recommendationid": "18380414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156080930", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458365131}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e:). \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0439, \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0433\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c!)", "timestamp_created": 1444297112, "timestamp_updated": 1444297112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18349588": {"recommendationid": "18349588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210791491", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439559440}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ub2e4\ub978 \uc5b4\ub4dc\ubca4\ucc98 \uc7a5\ub974\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\ucc98\ub7fc ,\uc5ed\uc2dc \ud55c\uae00\uc774 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\uba74 \uc88b \uc815\ub9d0\ub85c \uc88b\uaca0\ub2e4 \ub77c\ub294 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubd84\uba85 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ub9d0\uc778\ub370.. \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub2c8.. \uc7ac\ubbf8\uac00 \ubc18\uac10\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc5ed\uc2dc \uba54\ub274\uc5bc\ub4f1\uc744 \ud558\ub098\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4 \ud588\ub2e4\uace0\ub294 \ub9d0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc..\n\uc0c1\ub2f9\ubd80\ubd84 \ub3c4\uc6c0 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c4\ud589\ud574 \uac08\uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc778\uacf5 \uc774\ub984\uc774 \ubb50\ub4dc\ub77c? \uc544\ubb34\ud2bc.. \uadf8\ub140\uc640\uc758 \uad00\uacc4 \uc9c4\uc804\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc784\uc5d0\ub294 \ud2c0\ub9bc \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1444101018, "timestamp_updated": 1444101018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18320544": {"recommendationid": "18320544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142734119", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443937176}, "language": "english", "review": "This isn't a bad game really? But it's not a particularly good game either honestably.  Some of the puzzles were just sort of weird but that's a complaint that i think ranges from the puzzle solving ability from person to person.  Things that I can say for sure were not great was the voice acting, some bugs and technical issues, and the story.  The voice acting is the most obvious flaw, with the actors frequently delivering their lines somewhat emotionlessly, and with strange awkward gaps of silence as they speak.  There are some slightly frustrating bugs, sometimes I just couldnt click on anything for a moment, and the load times are not god awful, but games work like movies, where their point is usually to try and draw you into whats unfolding on the screen, to suspend your disbelief and engage in the story, and the loading periods were long enough that it was sort of jarring in that sense.  The world was creative and interesting, the story showed promise in the beginning, but it played out with far too many lame cliches and flat characterizations.  The interaction with Gorfelina and Laura was just so tiring and tedious especially.  The art was cool, the premise was interesting, but right after the game took its first step it was just a strangely boring slow motion fall right onto its face.\n\nI'd give it a 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1443938141, "timestamp_updated": 1443938141, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18314352": {"recommendationid": "18314352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054374510", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443904780}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein wunderbares Adventure f\u00fcr Gro\u00df und Klein!

Phenomenal voice acting, cute characters, charming dialogue, good puzzles, and just an overall fun experience watching the characters try to save their people. \n\nWe begin with Robert, an orphaned boy who is being raised by a man named Conroy. Conroy is the ruler of this little world of Asposia, and right away, as you can in all animated tales, we realize that Conroy isn't the nicest of fellows. In fact, he seems like a downright meanie. :P One day while Robert is playing his flute nose (yes, I said flute nose) for Conroy in his favorite 1 note tune, a pigeon that Robert has been playing with as one of his only friends comes in and steals Conroy's necklace and flies off. Robert, being the ever dutiful 'son' goes after it and finds himself down in the city of Asposia with all the peasants for the first time outside the walls of Conroy's castle. His adventure is ready to begin...\n\nRobert soon meets residents of Asposia and quickly starts to realize that Conroy may not be the great hero that he was raised to believe he was. Most importantly he meets Laura. A wanted thief, general troublemaker, obvious anti-establishment hero, and the girl of Robert's dreams. Robert is incredibly naive, but falls in love with Laura at first site. She is more worldy and they play off one another fantastically as she teases him and he shows his innocence again and again as a kind and generous boy. Their conversations are great, and Robert is pretty funny no matter how innocent he is. \n\nI didn't find any issues with the game UI, or the puzzle mechanics. They are the standard hover over the bottom of the screen to pop up the item menu, with options to drag them to world objects, combine them, etc. Some of the puzzles are a bit strange and take some trial and error of jsut screwing aroudn finding what items interact with things, but overalll they aren't too illogical most of the time. The game has a few loading screens between areas that on my medium level PC took about 3 seconds to load wasn't a problem for me. \n\nI had no bugs in the game that I can recall. Certainly nothing that made me stop, although the save system is not one that is the type to be friendly for Achievement hunters. The game can be saved manually, or using auto-saves, BUT you don't have a choice about where you save other than picking a slot for your current game. So you have one save and if it auto-saves and you miss an Achievement you will have to start the game over. So...if 100% Achievements is your goal then you better take a look at some Achievements guides BEFORE starting. There are a few that are full game achievements and a couple of them contradict. One side is really easy and can be gotten with a quick restart early on, but the other requires the full game to be played a certain way so you want to make sure you understand these early on before finding out halfway through you will have to play all the way through again.  \n\nGame is probalby anywhere from 6-10 hours long. My playtime is longer because I left the game on for 12 hours one day. :)\n\nIf you are a fan of point and click adventure games, love games such as the ones made by Daedelic, love cute and adorable characters with phenomenal voice acting, then The Inner World is a fantastic game for you. While this is an Indie studio, and this is their first major game, I consider this adventure game to be as good as any of the Daedelic games I have played. It definitely could be considered as comparable in quality to those. I highly recommend it to any adventure fan. I loved the characters and would love to see more from this studio. \n\nBringing me to this...\n\nNOTE: While looking at videos for The Inner World on Youtube I noticed this trailer from 2013 that suggested there might be an animated cartoon coming called 'The Inner World', but I ahve found no other news about it. I would have definitely watched, but it gives you a pretty good idea about the voice acting in the game as it is similar to this cartoon. If anyone knows anything else about this animated series I would be interested. :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STsqPrG8L7E", "timestamp_created": 1441027263, "timestamp_updated": 1441027931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711279", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17741006": {"recommendationid": "17741006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128888892", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465644922}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b,\u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0435 85 \u0440\u0443\u0431,\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447 \u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430.\u0421\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430,\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u044f \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443,\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f,\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451-\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u044f \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c.\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e,\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f.\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0438\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c.\u0422\u0430\u043c \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0430\u0431\u0441\u0443\u0440\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b,\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b.\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c.\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0435,\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u044b \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435.\n\n\u041c\u043e\u044f \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430:9/10", "timestamp_created": 1440696283, "timestamp_updated": 1440696283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17505022": {"recommendationid": "17505022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037315023", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439389076}, "language": "english", "review": "A Truelly wonderful game \nI recommend it for everyone that like these kinds of games\n", "timestamp_created": 1439389208, "timestamp_updated": 1439389208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17480123": {"recommendationid": "17480123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025102926", "num_games_owned": 1137, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439225708}, "language": "german", "review": "Exzellent.

Once to complete and once again to get the achievements I'd missed. Second playthrough took about an hour and a half with me skipping all dialogue and cutscenes, the rest of the time was spent going through puzzles and watching loading screens. Actually that made me notice a lot of the puzzles had a lot of wandering back and forth between locations but that's a minor criticism. Otherwise the short playtime is to be expected when you already know the solutions to all the puzzles, so it shows there is a decent amount of content there. I'd estimate 6 to 10 hours depending on how quick you are on the uptake.\n\nFirst playthrough I completed with know guides or help from the hint system. I did scratch my head occasionally but it's not an exceptionally hard point and click adventure. The majority of the puzzles make logical sense and most the time you know what you want to do and the challenge is more in finding the right items to do it. If you are stuck it usually means you need to go back and talk to someone now you know more or you just missed and item in another area. Holding down the left mouse button shows all the hot spots for objects you can interact with on the screen so thankfully pixel hunting is not a barrier like the old days of P&C. If you do get stuck there's an in game help system that tells you what your goals are and can get successively more detailed hints on what to do next from, so you still wont need a guide to help you complete it.\n\nThe art style is styalised as you can see from the screenshots above. Appeal comes down to personal opinion. The quality of the art assets is adequate for what they are trying to convey. I didn't find myself not knowing what something was when I looked at it.\n\nSound wise the voice acting is decent enough, soundFX are adequate to indicate what they are and the music sets the mood without been noteworthy enough to get in the way of your attention. In otherwords it all serves it's purpose.\n\nThe story is well written and very original. There's a decent amount of lore to give depth to this unique universe and it is delivered with good pacing to keep the mysteries unfolding all the way to the end. Characters are well designed, you like and contempt them as appropriate and as such feel satisfied when they get what they deserve (good or bad). Dialogue is amusing whenever it's not supposed moving. I would say it's laugh out loud funny but I went through most the game with a bemused smile. \n\nThe emotional drama isn't exactly gripping, in spite of it's content it doesn't feel super dark and gripping or a tear jerker like some other games in the genre (try some deadalic titles like chains of satinav of whispered world for that). It's interesting, it walks a tight right where you do feel sympathy for the characters without been devastated by the tragedy constantly befalling them. In other worlds it's pretty light hearted if still a little grim at times. \n\nLoading times aside (they are short but still noticeable enough to annoy you when you realise you have to backtrack because you forgot something) my biggest criticism would have to be stability. Very occasionally the cut scene animations didn't play correctly when completing a puzzle (no impact on gameplay you just miss out on the visual) and the game would periodically crash, I'd say you can expect it to do so 3-5 times between the begging of the game and completion.

It is the kind of point \u2018n\u2019 click adventure that doesn\u2019t shy away from ludicrous puzzles, but gives you a really unique storytelling experience in return.\n\nIt takes place inside a world where natural laws differ greatly from ours. An alien planet which seems quite \u201chuman\u201d in some respects, but different enough to leave the door open for creativity, imagination, and overall good writing.\nYou play a very na\u00efve, shy hero, whose day starts off with a seemingly small accident, but he soon finds himself in a revolution against an oppressing religious dictator for the control of the most precious commodity: air. Don\u2019t expect the usual story development though, because the plot has a few clever tricks along the way.\nThe cast is quite small, but even the supporting members are enjoyably memorable. The voice actors do a decent job, but nothing spectacular.\n\nAs an adventure game, it is moderately difficult. The item usage follows a really weird and twisted logic, but it is not completely impossible. (Plus it has a step-by-step hint system as backup.)

Dans l'ensemble d'ailleurs, et pour le peu que j'en ai vu avant d'\u00eatre d\u00e9courag\u00e9 par un x i\u00e8me blocage sans raison, c'\u00e9tait plutot bien \u00e9crit, pas franchement rigolo ni m\u00eame int\u00e9ressant, mais cela passait plut\u00f4t bien.\n\nJe ne recommande pas ce jeu aux personnes peu indulgentes envers les erreurs de conception, mais si vous \u00eates du genre persistant, peut-\u00eatre pourra-t-il vous plaire.\n", "timestamp_created": 1434120244, "timestamp_updated": 1434120244, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

In this new world we meet Robert, the adopted son of the Wind Monk to the last remaining Wind Fountain. In this world, the Basylians, wind gods, are angry with the people of Asposia and have begun to rampage and turn people into stone. Conroy, the last active wind monk, is the pope like figure in control over all of Asposia trying to save the people of this world by pleasing the Basylians to not turn the citezens into stone.  The story starts off by Robert polishing Conroy's most precious medallion, a stray pidgeon appears and Robert befriends the pidgeon but shoo's the pidgeon away as Conroy finishes his speach. Robert fearful of Conroy hands him his medallion only for the medallion to get stolen by the pidgeon. Robert wanting to please Conroy chases after the pidgeon. This is where we meet Laura, the owner of the pidgeon and wanted by the state for a multitude of crime. Laura catches Robert trying to steal the pidgeon, which belongs to her, and she grabs the pidgeon, whos name is now known as Peck, and runs off. Thus beginning the story of The Inner World.\n\nThroughout the rest of the game you will meet interesting new characters each with thier own set of witty and humorous dialoges as well as an immensive world with many secrets to behold. Robert, being sheltered all his life enters this world much like the player giving a shared viewpoint through Robert. Robert, a very shy and honest character, has a magnetic personality that I found myself easily attaching myself to. His interactions with the world around him create humor at every corner. \n\nThe humor in this game goes beyond character to character interactions, the game does not take itself seriously. In a later part of the game there is a cooking book called \"Cooking for Posers by Gor Dun Ramsee\", when I found this book I nearly fell to the floor laughing due to the call back to reality the game pulled on me. The world is filled with hints and nods to pop culture and the game itself is highly meta in its own rights.\n\nWhile the story itself is nothing necessarily 'original' in story arc and plot points, the story is creative enough to work. The pacing of the story starts off very slow, but it gradually speeds up over time with some portions being slower than they should be. But the explosion of the storyline fits into the story arc of the game. Though the pacing fluxuated at certain points I was still enjoying the game due to the great story and the world of Asposia making me want more. The end of the story left me wanting more of this fantasy world that I fell in love with and I hope that in the future there could be a sequal or a storyline expansion to quench my thirst for more Asposia.\n\nTo add onto this amazing and humorous storyline and characters, the world itself is a beauty to look at. The animations are well crafted, though I did have some issues but that was only due to hardware problems, and it ties all of the story telling elements in to create an amazing fanasty world. \n\nI highly enjoyed playing through this entire game and I would play through it again to find the parts of the side story that I missed in my first playthrough. My only complaint is the games issues with AMD GPU's but that can be fixed by installing Adobe AIR. All in all this game is a very well rounded with an incredible story with meta humor splurged throughout the extraordinary world that is Asposia.\n\n[u]Individual Ratings[/u]\n\nStory:                                   8/10\nArtwork:                              10/10 \nGameplay:                          10/10\nMechanics:                           8/10\nBang for your buck:            10/10\n\n[b]Overall Score[/b]                 [u]92/100[/u]\n\n[b]Game In A Sentence:[/b]\nPoint and Click adventure with a creative and humorous story complimented by amazing artwork.", "timestamp_created": 1430695257, "timestamp_updated": 1430696715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15643776": {"recommendationid": "15643776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128244192", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432508268}, "language": "german", "review": "ich finds bis jetzt ganz gut", "timestamp_created": 1430516601, "timestamp_updated": 1430516601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15633434": {"recommendationid": "15633434", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998528153", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430679200}, "language": "english", "review": "An awesome throwback to games like Loom.

The point and click.\nIt is hard to find a game nowadays with quite as much charm as the PaC genre did. Characters were often very quirky and memorable, puzzles were often (OFTEN) quite logical and made you think about how your character would think around in the world. The enviroments were stunning and mystifing, and the music was very atmospheric.\n\nThe inner world, is no exception.\nThe hand drawn animations, may turn some people off, as it isnt utulising the hardware, and making the best possible visuals, but the art style is something that i have not seen before, and it fits the world around it like a glove. \n\nThe puzzles, while did have some symptoms of adventure game logic, still managed to appear solvable by anyone because everything you need is in the area. Only pixel hunt that i managed to find is an object, which is shown falling during a cutscene. If you still have trouble with a puzzle, the game offers a great hint system, which can either A: give you slight hints, to point you in the direction of what you are supposed to do, or after a fair number of these, B: Flat out give you the answer. \n\nThe characters in the world are very quirky, silly, and each have their own unique traits that make themselves memorable. You will find yourself getting the achievement \"Blabbermouth\" (talk to each NPC at least once) fairly easily. The characters, whilst not having a sweeping backstory which tells a vast ammount of detail to give the characters intresting stories, still manages to achieve this in the designs, and the dialoge. (Best example would be the barmaid, who can be seen in the second screenshot, is against the gods of the game, and sins often.) \n\nThe music is where the game becomes a bit weaker for me. Most of the tracks are fitting and add a lot to the atmosphere. However, there is nothing here that i would probably listen to outside of the game. However, the music is very charming and creative, like the rest of the game.\n\nThe story is also, a bit weaker than what i would have hoped. However, again it fits the world, the art style, and the gameplay well. For this i cant condemm it much further than i wish it were deeper behind the motives behind the main antagonist, and wish that i could learn a bit more about the world through hidden objects in the enviroments.\n\nAlso, this game is hilarious at points. The game allowes you to do things out of order, and not have the right answer straight away. For example, in most PaC, there is a solution, you need item X. To get item X, you combine X and Y, and use it on Z. In the Inner world, you combine X and Y, use it on story progresson before using it on Z, and you get a humerous clip showing what would happen. This is what most of the achievements in the game are for. The characters often have funny things to say, and the reactions that some characters have made me burst out laughing. \"please, stop crying...\" \n\"I CAN CRY WHENEVER I WANT! ):<\"\n\nAh, PaCs. Wish there were more of these. The inner world, reminded me of how good they are. If you have never played a PaC before, i implore you to pick this up. Don't try and play some of the old PaCs before this. They are still great, in every sence of the word, and some are better than this, but a modern gamer will be very confuzed, as there is a massive mind shift between traditional games today, and that of the past 2 decades. The inner world, did not have that problem. \n\nOverall, im not sure whether or not to give this game a score. If i compare it to the PaCs of yesteryear, it would not be a fair score, if i dont, im not being fair in judging it as a PaC. So, instead, im just going to say, buy the game. Its fairly cheap, and it will be a fun playthrough for you.\n\n\nAlso, i just wrote a wall of text.

I don't know what to say... I made it to chapter 2 and then had to Alt+F4 it to end this misery. \n\nI bought this game because people said it would be funny and cleverly written and just an all over nice Adventure Game. Now, after forcing myself through about 2 hours of this game, I sit here and can't believe I wasted a money on something that is rated positive. \n\nI don't even know where to start. \n\nLet's begin with the positives\n\n+ Nice graphics with a vector style look\n+ Good voice actors were used in the making of this thing. The game sounds quite great. \n\nThat's it. I can not say anything else positive. It may find a few moments as the game continues, but I can not see myself sitting there getting more and more annoyed.\n\nNow, what are my issues with this:\n\n- First and foremost the Game is still buggy. It came out in September 2013 and it still has problems. The first time I played it, I was stuck the same moment I entered the game. So I had to uninstall and re-install the game to get it to work. Once I got to chapter two, the game was stuck in loading screen and I had to restart it again. \n\n- Funny? People keep saying the game is funny. How is this game funny? I can't decide what's worse. The flat jokes or the incredible boring dialogues as well as sexist jokes along the way which are probably funny if you are 12 years old. Pseudo-funny sidecharacters make it even more unbearable. \n\n- The dialogues are not only not funny but also unnecessarily long and unimportant as well as non informative. \n\n- The main character is so annoyingly stupid that it makes me want to beat him. \n\n- Granted I did not see many puzzles and the ones I saw were okay. I guess some of them can be quite tricky, but it's not all too bad if you are used to adventure and puzzle games. \n\n- Random non-fitting noises. I don't know how it is in the rest of the game, but in the first chapter I was already bugged out by asking myself... WHY is there a continous \"page turning\" sound in the middle of the street where nobody reads a book or does something with books and WYH is there a register checkout sound near the jail?! \n\n- The story seems to be incredible weak. It has no tension, nothing exciting and even when it is supposed to have a adventorous turn, it ends in a boring loading screen which is so annoyingly long, that I ended up watching a video while waiting. The script of this Game is just as boring as the jokes...\n\nI watched one of the most popular German Streamers play this game and even then I could not find the humor in it. Where he was laughing, I was continously facepalming myself and forwarding because even watching it was unbearable. \n\nI think if you are around an age class (real age or mental age) of 8-15 you might find this game funny.", "timestamp_created": 1427317484, "timestamp_updated": 1427317832, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460646", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15043916": {"recommendationid": "15043916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007479208", "num_games_owned": 1181, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510709225}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely adored this game.

Unfortunately my heart was broken not too long after.\n\nThe good: main character is lovable and a great vehicle for humor; great artwork; original, quirky setting; adorable critters with criminally too little screentime, like Peck, and the Gorfs have a welcome Adams-esque touch; the voicework solid and the music very nice, although the wind theme is oddly reminiscent of Oldboy's waltz (not complaining); the built-in hint system is extensive (luckily!).\n\nThe bad: I'd be hard pressed to name another recent adventure game so badly affected by moon logic: the gameplay hardly ever takes off, probably an attempt to squeeze length out of the assets. It's a mobile port, mostly workable, but leaving a room/location brings up a loading screen which is unbelievably slow, like the transitions in the UI. The story is functional at best, giving most characters some sort of motive, but is ultimately weak. Playing as Laura, in Chapter 2, she's just so whingy! The animations are far from smooth and the cutscenes often are lacking in detail. The translation, by virtue of being generally of good quality, makes the dozen or so non sequiturs stand out.\n\nRecommended? tough call. On one side, it would have maybe worked better as a short animated film, for (too) much of my playing time I just wished I had watched a Let's Play instead.

The art is great, the sound is great and probably it's the most relaxing point and click I've ever played. Even comparing to Botanicula.\n\nWhat could be possibly improved: \n1) Although I think that highlighting interactive spots makes game much less challenging and should be presented as an option of \"easy\" mode. Same goes for detailed hints, which are absolutely great, but knowing you have them makes you use them :)\n2) Animations of combining things are almost useless, and probably should be presented as an option in settings.\n3) What upset me the most after I completed the game - there's absolutely no way to start a separate chapter, so if you want to get all of the achievements you'll need to do it in the first run or play it again from the beginning just making to the points where you know you'll get achievements (they are rather obvious when you complete the game).\n\nAnd while I liked this game a lot, I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price, though I can understand how much effort had been put in making it.

Sure, I wouldn't say it's on par with the likes of Secret of Monkey Island, but I think it is fun to play all the way through (not stretched out), great humor, fine music and graphics and the puzzles are not outright evil, and if you get stuck there's a nice incremental hint system, that can be used instead of switching back and forth between the game and a browser every once in a while for someone who plays the game more for story than figuring out every single puzzle. \n\nI am a bit tired of the \"humorous\" sexism though (humour is a typical excuse for discrimination), mainly directed at Laura, not the least when you play as her. Many of the characters she interacts with objectify her, one insisting she must be a maid and unintelligent too and another one focused only on sexual interest. Robert doesn't respect her either. At one point in the game there's also a kiss between a woman and a man that happens that's basically sexual assault, and the kisser is even confronted with it, and her rejection was basically disregarded and he even says he doesn't regret doing it. Not cool, Headup Games & Studio Fizbin!\n\nThe other irritating problem I found was that the game crashed or got stuck on me every once in a while (maybe 7 times when I played through the entire game including all possible dialogue), but nothing that ruined the save, so it's not terrible. What does make this issue somewhat scary is that the game only creates a single save, so if it was hypothetically corrupted, there'd be no option but to start all over. I think a good solution for this problem - other than fixing the bugs - would be to create a save at the start of each chapter besides the current save which saves during a chapter too. This way one wouldn't have to start all over, and furthermore these saves will make getting all the achievements less of a pain.\n\nFinally there's generally always two actions you can perform in the game, which for some reason are both mapped to a submenu when left-clicking, instead of mapping one to the left and right mouse button, which is a simple change that would definitely improve the UX in my opinion.\n\nTo sum up I definitely recommend this (mostly) very charming game!", "timestamp_created": 1408316781, "timestamp_updated": 1408352111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11496608": {"recommendationid": "11496608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104177230", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406405702}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel ist einfach nur s\u00fc\u00df!

And The Inner World did not disappoint.\n\nNice cartoony graphics show a world that adds its own wildlife and mythology to everyday adventuring.

Still the main characters develop some depth.\nPuzzles are mostly straightforward but if you sort of miss the beat it may take you a while to rediscover your puzzle-patterned mind set.\n\nI played on an older machine so loading times between \"rooms\" was rather long, usually upward from 30 seconds. If it weren't for that I'd say you can play through the game in an hour, that is if you know what you're doing. Which you will when you replay for achievements or in order to write a walkthrough etc.\nThis touches on something I'm missing in the game. The game has three slots to each hold one progress of one playthrough. So you can never go back from some situation in the game. If you want to know how another decision at some point in the game would have played out you need to play the game from start up to that point again. This going forward is alright for a single playthrough but after the first I'd like to be able to jump to one of the five chapters at least.\nOn my second playthrough I forgot to change the handling of a situation, then realized it and played through almost four of five chapters again because I couldn't turn back time 30 seconds.\n\nAnyway, the first playthrough makes for a number of enjoyable hours and I recommend The Inner World to players that want to spent some time on an easy-going, enchanting narrative about people, politics and impending doom ;)", "timestamp_created": 1401248239, "timestamp_updated": 1401248239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10233856": {"recommendationid": "10233856", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999515762", "num_games_owned": 1690, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402186536}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8-\uc564-\ud074\ub9ad\uc758 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ub290\ub084\uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n\uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uac00 \uc740\uadfc \uc62c\ub4dc\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \uace0\uc218\ud574\uc11c \uc57d\uac04 \ubd88\ud3b8\ud55c \uba74\uc774 \uc788\uc744\uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \uace0\uc218\ud588\uc744\ubfd0 \uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9c0\uc7a5\uc774 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub2e4\ub9cc \uc544\uc26c\uc6b4\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uc131\uc6b0 \uc5f0\uae30\ub825\uc774 \uad6d\uc5b4\ucc45\uc77d\ub294\ub4ef\ud55c \ub290\ub08c\uc774 \ub4e0 \uc815\ub3c4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ud2b9\ud788 \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\uc774 \uc81c\uc77c \ubb38\uc81c\uc778\ub370 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5 \uc131\uaca9 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uc18c\uc2ec\ud558\uace0 \ub098\uc57d\uc0c1\uc774\ub77c \uc77c\ubd80\ub7ec \uc5b4\ub9ac\uc219\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uae30\ud55c\uac70\ub77c\uace0 \ubcfc\uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\ub9cc \uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \uc5f0\uae30\ub97c \ubabb\ud558\ub124\uc694\n\n\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc704 \ub458 \uc678\uc5d0\ub294 \uaf64 \ub9cc\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n\uba54\ud0c0\uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4\uac00 72\uc810\uc774\ub77c\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubbff\uae30\ud798\ub4e4\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 80\uc810\ub300\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n\uc785\ubb38\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1401045746, "timestamp_updated": 1401045746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10097226": {"recommendationid": "10097226", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988012862", "num_games_owned": 3745, "num_reviews": 230, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450757616}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended.

Ich mag im Comic-Stil gezeichnete P&C-Adventures (wie \"Edna bricht aus\", \"Deponia\" usw. und nun auch \"The inner World\").\n\nEs gibt einige witzige und interessante Charaktere, die man im Laufe des Spiels kennenlernt. Leider finde ich, dass hier h\u00e4ufig das Potenzial nicht ausgsch\u00f6pft wurde, denn viele Charaktere h\u00e4tten einen etwas gr\u00f6\u00dferen Auftritt verdient.\n\nLeider ist das Spiel recht kurz und die Welt erscheint einem sehr klein. Wenn man ein neues Bild betritt l\u00e4dt das Spiel sehr lange, was echt nerven kann, wenn man \u00f6fters mal hin und herlaufen will/muss.\nEinige Parts in den Dialogen widerholen sich immer wieder und man redet h\u00e4ufig \u00fcber Dinge, die im weiteren Spielverlauf gar keine Bedeutung mehr haben, was ich sehr schade fand. Dennoch sind die Dialoge sehr sch\u00f6n geschrieben und haben einen netten Humor.\n\nEinige haben das Problem, dass Robert sehr langsam l\u00e4uft. Das Problem hatte ich auch. Eine Probleml\u00f6sung kann man hier im Forum finden.

I'm happy to have it in my library. The only bad thing is there was one, single puzzle that was impossible for me to solve, because I had already tried that combination of things, but not at the right exact time. Regular adventure game frustrations, you know? It could really have been fixed, I think, but it doesn't ruin the entire game. The thing is, once you talk to someone and they give you all the information they can, or they have said all there is to say in a conversation, that button gets grayed out. You can click it again, but throughout the entire game the character would just repeat the same thing over if you did so.

There weren't any major flaws, but most things in the game felt very average.\n\nThe graphic style is probably the best thing about the game. The backgrounds are very detailed, but the same can't be said about the characters. The characters don't quite seem to fit in the world. But that's a very minor thing compared to the other issues the game has.\n\nThe main character, Robert, is an apprentice to a wind monk. He is quite na\u00efve and goofy. The other character you get to play as is Laura, who is a thief. She seemed quite grumpy and had this \"whatever\" attitude. So they're not the most likable characters.\n\nThe game starts with some backstory of the world and events that lead to it's current state. After that Robert is seen polishing his master's amulet, which then gets stolen by pigeon called Peck. Peck escapes through a trash chute and Robert follows with the intention of catching Peck and getting the amulet back. The story then develops into a pretty normal point-and-click story about saving the world. After the first chapter I already knew what was going to happen in the end, because I'm pretty sure I've played game or watched a movie with a very similar plot. And it was really obvious how to story would go on after chapter 1.\n\nThe store page lists screamingly funny dialogues as a feature in the game, but I didn't find the dialogue funny. It was quite boring to be honest. Could be that the funny dialogue was lost in translation, since this is a German game and I played it in English. The dialogue certainly wasn't helped by the voice acting, which ranged from bad to decent. In the end there was this \"emotional\" part in the story and the voice acting seemed like the actors were just reading their lines out loud. There was no emotion whatsoever.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are also a mixed bag. Some were fairly easy to figure out while some were pretty illogical and basically required trying all possible items in order to solve them. Some items, that seemed fairly logical for solving the puzzles, didn't work and the item needed to solve the puzzle didn't always seem like they'd be a natural choice. The puzzles also required a bit of guessing. There is a hint system in the game, but it's optional and I didn't use it on my playthrough.\n\nI had a couple of weird glitches where the character would just walk to where I pointed him/her and stop and not complete the action he/she was supposed to do. After waiting for a minute or so, the character would finally do what it was supposed to do. On a second playthrough I did to get all the achievements I missed the game also crashed to desktop twice.\n\nTo sum it up, The Inner World is an average point-and-click adventure with not much going for it. I beat the game in 5-6 hours, so it isn't very long. Some of the puzzles are quite frustrating and require some guesswork. The story wasn't anything special or new either to make me recommend the game. Unless you're a big fan of point-and-clicks, I don't recommend playing this one, since there are better point-and-clicks out there.", "timestamp_created": 1386203346, "timestamp_updated": 1386203346, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7873073": {"recommendationid": "7873073", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969519712", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440166872}, "language": "english", "review": "Great point and click style adventure.

Bekannt ist vor allem \u201eK\u00e4pt\u2018n Blaub\u00e4r\u201c. In \u201eThe inner World\u201c trifft man auf zahlreiche, seltsame Gestalten. Robert ist der Hauptcharakter, ein unglaublich naiver, kleiner Bursche mit einer Fl\u00f6tennase. Er w\u00e4chst bei Conroy, einem Windm\u00f6nch auf, der \u00fcber Asposien herrscht. Die \u201einnere Welt\u201c wird von Basylen (eine Art \u201eDrache\u201c) bedroht, die ungehorsame Bewohner versteinern. Conroy ist der einzige der die Basylen beruhigen kann, das nutzt der Kerl f\u00fcr seinen Vorteil aus. Das Conroy Dreck am Stecken hat, ist sonnenklar. Au\u00dfer f\u00fcr Robert. Die fast schon unfassbare Naivit\u00e4t von Robert, wirkt aber nicht aufgesetzt, wie manche Magazine den Spiel rot ankreiden. Er ist halt in einem \u201eElfenbeinturm\u201c gro\u00df geworden und kennt nichts von der Welt. Gerade deshalb ist er als Hauptcharakter hervorragend geeignet, um den Spieler an diese wundersame Welt mit Wollm\u00e4usen, Schrofs, Fl\u00f6tennasen, Basylen, Fosfos und vielen mehr, heranzuf\u00fchren. \nDavon abgesehen sorgt seine naive Art und simple Denkweise, immer wieder f\u00fcr Lacher. Das Abenteuer kommt durch die Taube \u201eHack\u201c ins rollen, die ein Amulett von Conroy stiehlt. Robert f\u00fchlt sich verantwortlich und will das Amulett zur\u00fcckholen. Conroy passt das gar nicht, er kann ihn aber nicht mehr rechtzeitig stoppen. Auf der Suche nach der Taube, trifft Robert auf Laura, eine Rebellin. Im weiteren Spielverlauf darf man sie ebenfalls ab und zu steuern. Laura bildet hier einen sch\u00f6nen Kontrast zu Robert, sie ist n\u00e4mlich ganz sch\u00f6n \u201ezickig\u201c, daf\u00fcr aber wesentlich aufgekl\u00e4rter als Robert. \nSch\u00f6ne, hochaufgel\u00f6ste Hintergr\u00fcnde mit zahlreichen Animationen sorgen f\u00fcr eine stimmige Welt. Die Synchronisation ist spitze, ein Extra-Lob verdient hier der Sprecher vom Schrof (vor allem diese Lache). Ein bitte, was? Ein Schrof. Er ist das t\u00f6dlichste Tier in Asposien, da sein K\u00f6rper zu 96% aus Gift besteht. Meistens hockt er auf einen Stein, da er nicht \u00fcber den Boden laufen kann, da seine Krallen ansonsten alles weg \u00e4tzen w\u00fcrden. Was meistens dazu f\u00fchrt, das er stecken bleibt.\nDas einzige was noch giftiger ist als der Schrof, ist das Weibchen der Gattung. Eine Schrofline. Herrlich als sich Laura und eine Schrofline gegenseitig angiften und der arme Robert, zwischen die Fronten ger\u00e4t. Die Wollm\u00e4use sind wirklich niedlich und bestehen wie der Name schon sagt, haupts\u00e4chlich aus Wolle. Deshalb fliegen sie oft in der Gegend herum. Die Fosfos sind in Asposien wichtige Tiere, da sie Licht spenden. Im Erdinneren nicht gerade unwichtig. Sie sehen aus wie klassische Bettlaken-Gespenster. Doch es werden immer weniger. Der Wind, die wichtigste Energiequelle in Asposien ist ebenfalls fast verschwunden. Was geht hier vor? Was f\u00fcr eine Rolle spielen hier die Basylen? Und vor allem: Was hat Conroy angestellt? \u000bRobert und Laura gehen diesen Geheimnissen auf die Spur. Die R\u00e4tsel sind gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils klassisch. Sprich: Dialog und Kombinationsr\u00e4tsel. Die Logik wird dabei einige Male arg strapaziert. Geht aber im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen in Ordnung. Die Steuerung geht leicht von der Hand, klassisches Point&Click, wie man es liebt.\n\nFazit: Was f\u00fcr ein sch\u00f6nes Adventure. F\u00fcr Walther Moer Fans ein Muss. Der Rest darf aber auch gerne zugreifen. Mit Deponia das witzigste Adventure in diesem Jahr. Hochaufl\u00f6sende Hintergr\u00fcnde, einfaches Point&Click, keinerlei Bugs, gutes R\u00e4tseldesign und vor allem sehr liebenswerte Charaktere.

Al pari dei titoli di Daedalic e dei recenti punta e clicca del panorama videoludico, \u00e8 disponibile in sola lingua inglese su Steam, GOG e tramite sito web ufficiale.

Then find the time/money to get this game, period.\n\nThe Inner World combines a beautiful and intriguing graphical style with some wonderfully off the wall design, such as a world built on the inside of a sphere, not the outside like ours. This is all backed with a melodic and inquisitive musical score that binds it all together (I could happily listen to the opening menu music for quite some time). The human-like inhabitants all have stripey arms, legs and nose, apart from the main character Robert, who seems different from everyone else with his flute nose.\n\nThe adventure starts with Robert going on a quick errand to rescue a necklace stolen by a pesky pigeon but he quickly finds himself being sucked into an adventure to discover the many secrets of the Inner World; which is a lot as he's never left the castle before!\n\nThrough his journey you meet a wealth of very original characters and combined with the delightfully naive Robert lead to some great writing with a nice dry sense of humour. The voice acting and translation in itself is superb considering that the game was written in German and any slip ups are almost unnoticeable.\n\nThe mandatory puzzles are also top class, encouraging you to explore and use that point-n-click crazy logic to allow you to progress. Many of these give Robert and the other characters a great opportunity to make you smile, particularly Laura the female lead. There is also a robust hint system for those that find this kind of game a bit too much of a challenge so you never feel held back from enjoying the story.\n\nCompleted this in 7 or 8 hours or so but enjoyed every second.

It's not a mind-blowing experience by any means, but it's definitely not bad either. You play as a guy named Robert who finds himself thrust into a quest to save the world (naturally). Robert is a very naive and unassuming sort of fella, so a lot of the plot and humor centers around his clueless innocence. The story and dialogue is fairly good for the most part, in turns charming, funny and dark. The voice acting is hit or miss, though - mostly it is decent, but a few lines here and there are inexplicably bad (wrong pronunciations, improper emphasis of words, etc). Mechanically, the game also has its ups and downs. Being a point and click game, you would think that the pointing and clicking would be spot-on, but that's not always the case. Sometimes you can't click on things that you should be able to click (though it usually fixes itself in a second or two). Additionally, half of the achievements don't seem to be working properly. However, the developers have started to release patches to fix some of these problems, so a lot of these things may not be issues in the future. Regardless, none of these faults are deal breakers by any means, anyways. \n\nThe puzzles are fairly standard in adventure game terms. You basically just go around talking to people, picking up objects, and using those objects (or combinations thereof) to solve puzzles and progress further. Thankfully, none of the solutions are overly ridiculous or unintuitive (as is the case with many adventure games), though you will need to really think some stuff through from time to time. Apparently there is also a help system in place if you need it (which I didn't even realize until after finishing the game), so you probably won't ever get stuck for long, if you even get stuck at all. The game is divided into 5 chapters, each of which consists of a self-contained series of puzzles that take place on 3 or 4 \"screens\". Playtime is probably around 7-8 hours or so, give or take. So keep that in mind in terms of how much you are willing to pay. All in all, the game is pretty good. As I said earlier, it is nothing mind-blowing for the genre, but it's a nice experience while it lasts. Probably the worst thing I could say about it (aside from the minor glitches noted above) is that the pacing is very slow. The dialogue in particular seems like it takes foreeeeeeeever sometimes, especially with a main character who is so low-key and slow. The pace may test your patience at times. But if you don't mind that and are into classic adventure games, this is probably worth a look at some point.

Of all the point-and-click adventure games I've played in that time I will rank this second to Night of the Rabbit. You play as Robert, a young \"Asposian\" (with a flute for a nose) living in the Inner World (a sort of hollow Earth theory) and stuck in a sheltered life of lies and deception. His master Conroy has taken control of Asposia and kept Robert an unwitting prisoner. Naive and trusting, Robert sets off on his own to find out the real truth put and end to Conory's plot.\n\nWith lovely hand-drawn animation this video games feels like an 80s CITV show that you are in control of. Something about adventure games that usually bugs me is the constant going back and forth between long distances to reach new areas but the Inner World keeps everything tight and close.

The physical copy comes with the soundtrack in MP3 form on the disc as well as a postcard and a sticker of Peck (which I stuck to the side of my computer). There is another edition that features a lot more than this, but I believe it was limited and thus unavailable.\n\nIt seems that the game has been successful across all platforms and has spawned a sequel.

For example, our protagonist, Alicia\u2014who finally got more reasonable body proportions\u2014lost so much of her sass that she feels more like a generic late 90s adventure game heroine instead. Still, she is the only real character, because each member of the otherwise decent-sized supporting cast has too small roles and screen presence to make any impact.\n\nNot just Alicia feels like part of a traditional point \u2018n\u2019 click but the rest of the game as well.

Item combinations are sometimes hard to guess.\n- Important Tip for Chapter 1 and 2: to use stuff from the inventory on the scene, you have to drag it to the lower left corner in order to get back to the screen (the inventory will close itself).  At that point, the item can be dropped on the scene target to complete the action. This wasn't obvious to me and got stuck. I learned it thanks to a walkthrough.\n- Chapter 3 is the best and most mature part of the game. Has the best game design and mechanics. Can be played without a walkthrough. Very enjoyable.\n- I still recommend playing first two chapters first!  However, it is possible to skip those and watch a story summary provided in the Chapter 3 game menu.\n\nLONG REVIEW:\n\nThe Great Escape is the third chapter in this story. At the time of this writing, chapter 4 has not yet been released, but seems to be in the works as there is a reference to a fourth chapter in the story itself.\n\nI've played the first three chapters consecutively so I'm going to review them all in one shot to give a better idea of the whole. Note:  Chapter 1 and 2 are sold in a single package called \"AR-K\".\n\nSummary:\n\nThe story is set in the AR-K, a giant autonomous space station on which a utopic society lives.\n\nIn Chapter 1, we meet journalism student Alicia and her dog Ambar and follow her in an investigation surrounding odd deliveries around the university campus. We learn that she originally intended to become a cop like her father, but had to resign due to unfair charges regarding a mysterious ball. It is during this investigation that she will cross path again with people that have a serious interest in possessing that ball. The chapter ends when the investigation article is submitted to the teacher.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we learn that the teacher has published the article under his own name. Although this is clearly unethical from the teacher's part, this comes as an advantage since he becomes the victim of uncomfortable attention from those seeking the ball. Alicia will use this opportunity to continue her investigation and track down who's behind this. During this investigation, she will  uncover the existence of a society unknown to her called District 8 and she will eventually fall prey to a trap.\n\nIn Chapter 3, \"the great escape\", we uncover the harsh reality of District 8: it is a hidden part of the station where people live essentially as slaves so that the rest of the AR-K can live in utopia. As Alicia is forced into labor herself, she meets people that have been trapped there for a very long time. She will help them in order to gain their trust and will eventually escape District 8 with the intention of revealing its existence to the public living on the rest of the AR-K.\n\nChapter 4 has yet to be published, but I would expect a climax ending where Alicia finally reveals the truth to the world despite mass media manipulation by key members of the ruling class.\n\n\nGame review\n\nThe story itself is great! I think the summary I wrote above pretty much shows how it is neatly broken down and is building up some momentum. This is, for me, the most important part of a game.\n\nI think what I liked the most about the game storytelling mechanics was the cutscenes.  The game stands apart from many point-and-click titles that i've played by using cutscenes whenever something important happens rather than relying solely on textual dialogue. We get a much better feeling of our characters that way.\n\nAcross the chapters, I also found that the game has evolved in terms of user friendliness. For example, in Chapter 2, a fast travel terminal system was added as well as a narrator designed to help the player by providing some clues.   In Chapter 3, the inventory system has been reworked, dialogues can be skipped, a fast-travel map system has been added and the narrator has been replaced with a PDA. I think those were great improvements that were much needed. Chapter 3 has the best game design in my opinion.\n\n\nAlso in terms of design, I don't think I could have done Chapter 1 & 2 without using a walkthrough. I highly recommend playing those with a walkthrough. Chapter 3 was a lot easier to follow in my opinion. I still used a walkthrough but I didn't read it as much. I had fun walking on my own and trying the puzzles without peeking at the solution. My favourite part was the murder mystery we need to solve in order to get the trust of a District 8 policeman.\n\n\nAll in all, I think this was a great game and recommend it to everyone :)", "timestamp_created": 1466827734, "timestamp_updated": 1466827903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23708969": {"recommendationid": "23708969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073868433", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455505623}, "language": "german", "review": "The Great Escape \u00fcberrascht im Vergleich zu Episode 1 und 2 mit Full HD Grafik und minimalistischer Antwort Auswahl, anstatt ewiglange Antworttexte (die bei \u00dcbersetzungen gerne mal zu Problemen f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen) hat sich Gato Salvaje dazu entschieden die Antwortm\u00f6glichkeiten durch Bilder zu \u00fcbersetzen.

She somehow got herself stuck in some dump (which really happens to be an underground hidden sector of the AR-K universe - gasp!).\n\nHer trustworthy & dependable friend \"Franky\" also happens to be in the neighbourhood, and helps her along the way (through use of a PDA).\n\n\nCharacters:\n\nAlicia (the protagonist - a framed ex-cop & student of journalism - who finds herself stuck some place underground in this chapter)\n\nFranky (a walking & talking \"swagger\" bull - originally belonging to what is referred to as the \"Valerian race\" - used to run a burger joint, until he ended up underground along with Alicia)\n\nGrigor (lives underground, and ends up helping Alicia & Franky escape)\n\n\nUI/mechanics:\n\nPretty simple, point & click style navigation. Simplified inventory (click, drag, combine items), but runs awfully slow when actually clicked... and dragged. Feels like a total drag (unintentional pun right there...).\n\nThe game progression consists mostly of some intuitive play & trial & error, with some help from Franky (by clicking his portret first, and then point-clicking any interactable surface).\n\nThis game is most suited for players of a curious nature who like embarking on a journey without having to follow strict guidelines (the objectives are pretty blurry - there's no journal to keep track of progress or anything of the like).\n\nI often times had a vague idea of what needed to be done (due to hints dropped by the subcharacters), but wasn't quite sure how to reach a specific goal.\n\nSo players who prefer methodical, linear gameplay could potentially feel stressed by this, as you're dumped somewhere and expected to find out things on your own (with a weee bit of help from the sidekick, but that's about it!).\n\nThough there is a map button that helps you get where you need to be without having to run around (though, IMO - it's preferable if you do walk, because you might tend to overlook certain details otherwise).\n\n\nCharacter design & game graphics:\n\nAlicia's physical design is... annoying. Her body is okay, but the way they styled her is flat out irritating, because 99% of the time she appears to have her generously shaped bosom up in the air, right in your face, whenever she walks. And whatever she wears apparently HAS to be ultra thin, super clingy 100% spandex, juuust so every line & curve of her body is visible and up in your face!\n\nBecause there's no other type of fabric in the world, right? And Alicia is obviously very fond of super skinny size, which really has her looking cheap.\n\nIt's anything but flattering and simply annoying - BUT, definitely an improvement from what she looked like in chapter 1.\n\nRegardless of this, I do like her witty & acrid sense of humour (it is refreshing!).\n\nShe's quite headstrong & feisty and loves to explore. If she's told she can't do something, she'll go ahead and do it anyway.\n\nShe may appear obnoxious at first (especially in the first chapter), but overall, she's mostly an independent-natured girl who likes her freedom and is not afraid to enjoy herself. She's not exactly conservative ;).\n\nIt is heavily suggested that Alicia is very bright & smart, but her potential isn't really displayed in-game.\n\nThere were often 3D cinematic cutscenes after completion of puzzles, which unfortunately got the game to freeze up almost every single time (without crashing though). The cutscenes were mostly unnecessary, yet enticing at times. In the end I think it didn't really add that much value.\n\nThe game could have done without!\n\nDialogue:\n\nOh gee. Where do I start? Well, it's rather awkward & repetitive - almost always with a witty twist though. You just get a typical list of things to ask, and ask away till you're out of questions.\n\nThere are some spelling & grammatical mistakes though (it does help to know the developers are hispanic, and assuming their mother-tongue is different from English, this could explain the oddities - to a certain degree - in this regard).\n\nUnfortunately, dialogues sometimes felt erratic due to faulty scripting (I always play with subtitles, and at times the subtitles didn't match what was being said by the characters, or what was said didn't make sense at all).\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI dropped 1, skipped 2, but finished 3, because the game mechanics were simplified in this chapter (though still aggravating due to sluggishness, but playable nonetheless).\n\nThanks to the inclusion of a visual synopsis, I was able to catch up on what had formerly taken place in chapter 1 & 2 without having to play them.\n\nIf you're planning on playing the first 2 chapters, you'll want to keep a guide at hand though, just to avoid any unnecessary frustrations in regard to game progression and gameplay.\n\nFinally, I think AR-K does have a special endearing feel to it (story-wise), so in the end I liked it :).", "timestamp_created": 1459589302, "timestamp_updated": 1460182293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22036895": {"recommendationid": "22036895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060934212", "num_games_owned": 3227, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458887296}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not ARK: Survival Evolved.\n\nI know that, it's so funny to read those posts in the discussion...\nOk, back to the game.

This one is even better than the first. \n\nI like the way you select the dialog options.

To be honest, you could probably skip the first two episodes without much trouble and drop right in at The Great Escape and still have a great experience.\n\nThe story overall was interesting and had much more of a sense of direction to it. The story that the game is telling is nothing new in the sci-fi genre, but it's told well. Most of the characters are interesting and fun, and Alicia (the protagonist) is fleshing out to become a more likable character.\n\nVoice acting is mostly great, all actors deliver their lines with believable emotion. However, the actors could have used a bit more direction in terms of pronouncing names and made-up terms correctly (the name of Franky's species comes to mind) so that the world feels a little more real. Additionally, the humour sometimes gets a little too self-referential (the conversation with the little girl about \"female characters\", the guy who tells you to \"wait for Chapter Four\") and there was one kind of unnecessary joke where the punch line is a male character disguising himself as a woman that might bother some people.\n\nI enjoyed most of the puzzles a lot, particularly a great logic puzzle near the end (however the text in this puzzle could use a little native speaker proofreading).

While I enjoyed ar-k 1 and 2 and I do recommend those games to play first, this for me is a lot better - story, graphics, setting.  The writing was very good and if you didn't want to read everything, you didn't need to click on that character's bit of conversation but could come back to it if you wanted.  I liked the humour, and it was witty in parts.  It is the perfect balance of not just a good story which is vital in an adventure game but also good interactive gameplay.\n\nYou continue to play as Alicia and thankfully she is more likable.  In the first episode the OTT \"I am a sexy vixen\" coupled with a not nice attitude a lot of the times frankly put me off her and I didn't care what happened to her, but by the end of E1 this was mostly gone and here I actually cared and liked her.\n\nThe story continues from 1 & 2 and I loved how at the end of episodes there is just enough surprise or hook to keep you invested for the next epsiode, it is literally a cliffhanger ending (not resolved or tied up with bow) with all of them and this episode is the same.  \n\nI love the setting in this game (all new) and I got to solve a murder as well which was cool.  There is also a transporter map so you aren't wasting time walking everywhere.\n\nWhile you could play this on it's own I do think there would be too many unanswered questions (what is the sphere, why am I here etc) and I do think you need to play the first game (which has episodes 1& 2 in it) to know what is going on.  There is a video intro at the beginning which is supposed to recap what has happened but I don't know why but the clips seemed out of sequence, and they could have done a lot better job of a recap, seemed very disjointed.\n\nI loved the achievements in the first game, very imaginative and different but here it was mostly straightforward and some more unusual ones would have been fun.  There is one though which I didn't see the point of and will be a bit annoying to do (worker one,)  - so don't go by my final time re gameplay! \n\nThoroughly enjoyed it and I really look forward to the fourth and final episode.

If I did was becuse of the 73% discount, and I must say it was a great deal.\n\nAnyone can see the graphics are much better just comparing the screenshots, the gameplay was also improved (they took off that annoying inventory and made a better one), animations, [u]STORY[/u]... Everything is much better than the first episodes. They really learned something about how to make a point-and-click game.\n\nI'm really enjoying the story, in my opinion it's the most important part in a game like this. First chapters were too simple and a little boring, and the solution for a couple of puzzles was a real nonsense. This game is absolutely different, has a few characters that are GOLD (don't miss Phil the scientist, the little girl or Horn), balanced puzzles (some simpler and a few more complex) and a lot of hints about ARK that the first chapters lacked.\n\nThe game looks quite simple in the first scenes, but after the factory it brings a lot of different scenarios and interesting puzzles (I specially liked the murder). I would recomend the game even if you don't buy the first two chapters, this one alone is a great game (in fact, I would reccomend not to buy the first chapters).\n\nOf course, it's not perfect, has a few flaws:\n[list]\n[*]The \"previously\" video, that plays when you start the game is simply terrible. Long, boring and annoying. I think it's the heritance of the first part. The good news are that things can only go better from here.\n\n[*]The first screen has too many videos, the hospital has too much talking. After that the game finds the perfect balance, but I feel like these two scenes could be a little better.\n\n[*]Cardesians voices are soooo annoying!\n[/list]\n\nAnyway, these are just a few cons that can't make this game bad.

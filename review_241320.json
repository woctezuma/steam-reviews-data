Everything was terrible besides the art design with the lighthearted tone to it is a matter of preference so i give it a its just me. But everything else from controls, lag, enemy AI, puzzles and how its played in general is very rage inducing and annoying.\n\nThe puzzle elements are just simple puzzles that can be solved with thought but to no avail does the game reward you for doing so it trolls you with useless cards and such that you dont need. Compared to items you find along the main path which is gold and needed health scrap paper that you need anyways.\n\nThe problem lies on there is no indication of that chest is needed or not usually because it is present on the main path anyway with some side chamber most of the time you will probably be drawn to the frustrating puzzle element with the enemy placement over and over since the puzzles are usually prone to having dead ends if you mess up one step making you exit and enter the same roon having to fight the same enemies and taking hits till finally you have another shot at the frustrating puzzle until you succeed only to be slapped in the face as it was just a card.\n\nIts like trying to do an exam but with shit flying at you. Its not fun and the depth perception of the game is terrible to say the least. I can never tell if i can hit an enemy of the plane that i am at i only can hit them accurately from the sides as i always end up being to early on swinging downwards or upwards.\n\nThe enemy AI and combat is cheap too just by touching an enemy counts as a half a heart of damage and even so they move and change direction very suddenly even if they have just 1 or 2 health their patterns of their movement especially enemies with more health than 1 hit point is unacceptable as there is no pattern and they have a invincibility frame to stop chaining hits making your firepower essensially useless. \n\nThe hit detection is terrible its pinpoint for you as you have to be on the exact same plane as them and considering you only can face 4 directions and no diagionals its really stiff and outright unfair. For enemies its another story just by touching a single pixel of your body you will take a hit doesnt matter where if its the edge of the hair or foot it still counts to hurting you. The enemies should have an attack animation and pattern where it can be telegraphed to the player fairly so the player knows how to handle certain enemies instead of brute forcing and with a bit of luck they wont change direction to where you are.\n\nThe \"boss battles\" are not boss battles a boss battle in an adventure rpg is a boss with a health bar that does certain patterns telegraphed to the player fairly to an extent of whether it will be easy to hard depending on the player's equipment and position of the story. That will be a boss that should exist a boss that is fair on challenge and it penalizes you for getting hit from screwing up or not recognizing the openings.\nIn ittle dew nope it says fuck all that your weapon is useless its puzzle elements yes but its a endurance round of once again cheap tricks of throwing puzzle elements in a small opening which is timed while your struggling with the control scheme and other problems mentioned usually youll end up missing your opportunity to do damage as its so pinpoint and short along with game requiring the player to know the pattern at first while your getting your ass kicked trying to figure out what to do as hitting the boss doesnt work.\n\nYou hit the boss 1 or 2 times with something you find whether a bomb or teleporting their projectile into them but the gap is so small and there is no clear pattern with some of them that the cycle can repeat so many times due to you missing and getting hit that youll be frustrated over the game instead of having satisfaction doing damage to a boss.\n\nSome even attack really suddenly like the first boss which charges when you are in the x and y axis of the screen considering you are in harms way all the time and the bomb that you are supposed to harm him with takes long to explode usually he will charge at you and youll take a hit while the bomb does nothing with you repeating the same cycle again till the boss is dead.\n\nIt combines with worst of both worlds and i am really upset because i was fooled thinking i will have a swell singleplayer puzzle solving adventuring time in a game. But it misses core aspects with rewarding the player for hardwork, fair challenge, leveling system to scale with skill, proper enemies, fluid controls, fair hit detection, puzzle elements that can be reset easily without annoyance of losing progress and respawning enemies just to annoy the player, good boss battle fight sequence, currency system and intriguing adventure.\n\nIt completely missed everything making ittle dew itself a chore and a frustrating one at that to play due to the unmerited damage and deaths the player will be experiencing from bad elements that are abundantly present in this game.\n\nIts like if resident evil 4 had a bad control scheme, resets puzzles by sending you back to where the area begins with all the enemies back in their place, just touching an enemy hurts you for half you life bar, bosses have such a small opening backed up along with other enemies and cant be hurt by gunfire but be some obscure puzzle element that you wont even know what to do. enemies cant be knocked back considering that have an invincibility frame so if they are in midswing a shot to the face wont stun or stop the swing and you take a hit, chests with no purpose but looked important at first glance, enemies just magically poof away when they take enough damage and no progression in weaponry but only needed items for a certain puzzle element to make the game more of a chore instead of rewarding the player with new hard earned equipment, currency doesnt make sense and you need currency anyway to get past a certain point in the game where it introduces more puzzle elements along with the shit your juggling at once to make it more of a thought process in a shitstorm. Imagine playing an alternate version of RE4 with these features you will be PISSED. \n\nI know re4 was supposed to be hard in some ways as its survival horror but if you make it downright unfair and let the player take unmerited damage and impossible expectations everyone will be turned of by it and simply saying \"Its supposed to be hard\" is not a fair excuse when the gameplay is also unsatisfying in general.\n\nThats what this game is unsatisfying and rage inducing as it is nothing but an abomination of mixing the worst of puzzles and adventure rpg elemets.", "timestamp_created": 1512466623, "timestamp_updated": 1512466623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475020", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38059645": {"recommendationid": "38059645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067770020", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511721858}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u6210\u5c31\u6709\u8da3\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1512402687, "timestamp_updated": 1512402687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38047954": {"recommendationid": "38047954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154119852", "num_games_owned": 4347, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512353372}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc138\uc774\ube0c \uc548\ub418\ub294 \uac9c\uc774\ub124\uc694 \ubb34\uc870\uac74 \ucf20\uc655\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uac70 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\uc870\uae08\uc529\ub9cc \ud574\uc57c\ud558\ub294 \uc800\uc5d0\uac90 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc5c8\ub124\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1512353421, "timestamp_updated": 1512353421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526316", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37877841": {"recommendationid": "37877841", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993696939", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403895404}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc824\ub2e4\uc758 \uc804\uc124\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud37c\uc990 \uc5b4\ub4dc\ubca4\ucc98 \uac8c\uc784. \uc544\uc774\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub05d.", "timestamp_created": 1511873755, "timestamp_updated": 1511873755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37871815": {"recommendationid": "37871815", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983237900", "num_games_owned": 753, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511867705}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Sabe quando voc\u00ea encontra um jogo que quase ningu\u00e9m ouviu falar mas que \u00e9 t\u00e3o incr\u00edvel que d\u00e1 vontade de divulgar pro mundo todo?

They're great adventure, action games that any fan of the genre can appreciate. Ittle Dew takes inspiration from the top-down, 2D Zelda games to the point where if you reskinned Ittle Dew with the same textures as \"A Link to the Past\" you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. On the surface Ittle Dew appears to take more than inspiration, and I'm sure most would even call Ittle Dew a Zelda clone. You explore dungeons, get items from the dungeons, solve the dungeons' puzzles, defeat a boss, use the item from the dungeons to progess further into the game, and eventually it all ends with a final epic boss battle. There's hearts to replenish your life, a fairy-esque follower who guides you on your travels, old men giving you cryptic messages, statues resembling those from the original Zelda 1, hell, you even begin the game waking up from a deep sleep as Zelda games traditonally do. However, to label Ittle Dew simply as just a Zelda clone would be a diservice to this game, because Ittle Dew's puzzles are more intricate, creative, and difficult than any Zelda puzzle to date. Now I know that's a bold statement, but think for a moment, what was the last zelda puzzle that really made you think and put your puzzle solving skills to the test? I can think of only one, and anybody who played \"Twilight Princess\" will know exactly which puzzle I'm talking about. That's one puzzle.

I\u2019ve played several of your games now and they\u2019ll all good. Guess this means I\u2019m giving this a recommendation already but I still must explain the pros and cons of this game so let\u2019s begin.\n\nStory:\nIttle Dew and her buddy Tippsie were just relaxing on their raft when they get stranded on an island. After some exploring, the duo meet an item carver named Itan Carver who can make them a raft off the island but they must find an artefact in the nearby castle as payment so our adventurers must go find it.\n\nNot much to talk story wise as it\u2019s just an adventure so lets talk characters which isn\u2019t much but it\u2019s something. Ittle is an enjoyable little adventurer who\u2019s very blunt about things like eating what she find on the ground or admitting not understanding what someone said. And there\u2019s Tippsie, her flying fox buddy who gives tips with a tone of \u201cReally, do I have to help.\u201d. Together they make a fun duo, poking fun at the weird things on the island and each other.\n\nAnd some of the enemies have some personality even if some of them don\u2019t have an intro, like the stone heads who are afraid of heights. But my favourites are the Jennys  who each have a little personalty quark like the frog being laid back.\n\nGameplay:\nI\u2019ve never played a Legend of Zelda game before. Not even the new ones for handheld. Now that we got that out of the way lets talk about the game.\n\nThe first few minutes do a decent job of showing how the game works up to your first chest, like pushing blocks, lighting your stick to light bonfires, the different doors that open by defeat all enemies or turning on all switches, etc.  But in order to get to the dungeons, you need money from the castle and after the first chest, you free to do the first dungeon or explore to get more money. And that\u2019s one of the interesting things about this game which is the castle is non-linear as you only need to buy two items to get to the end.\n\nThe dungeons are really just tutorials on how the items you get work, and you temporary lose your other items you bought so it\u2019s like being thrown in the middle depth of the pool and have to use your head to get out. I like this as it teaches you how each items works and with all the other mechanics in each dungeon, can teach you how it works with the other items like freezing blocks to break them with you fire sword. And of course each dungeon ends with a boss fight and to be honest, only the forest boss and the final boss are good since they both are test of what you can do. The fire boss was very underwhelming with how you barely him and the ice boss was good but it uses one of the most important ice mechanics you weren\u2019t thought in the dungeon so I had to use a tip to figure it out.\n\nAnd besides the main dungeons, there are little dungeon rooms just outside them that can teach you more about your new items with it\u2019s cleaver puzzles and reward you with a health upgrade or a card that\u2019s just for flavour. And there\u2019s even a super optional dungeon that have some nasty puzzles, making you think outside the box and making you use ideas you didn\u2019t know you can do.\n\nThis is clearly a speed running game too as not only do you just have to do two dungeons but there are also shortcuts that are hard to unlock but can really cut a good chuck of time from the dungeon. But I did found one flaw where if you want to a particular run, it\u2019s very easy to screw yourself over. For me, I wanted to do the one where you don\u2019t kill any Jenny\u2019s and decided to get the fire sword first, but as I explore the castle I couldn\u2019t the chests I needed to get the ice wand so I had to start over. \n\nPresentation:\nThe music is a mix bag for me. While I like the music for the outside and the castle theme are good, I found the dungeon music to be pretty forgettable. \n\nI love the art in this game. Everything just looks so cute, from Ittle and Tippsie, to the Jenny\u2019s to the fishbuns to even the crystals and blocks. I think it looks really good.\n\nVerdict:\nI admit some puzzle were pretty hard but this is a good game.

Fire to break things, Ice to freeze things and portal to teleport things. Sounds simple enough? There are lots of puzzles in this game is anything but simple. I had a ton of trouble getting that last 100 gold to buy portal wand and I ended up finishing the game without it. It's a trust test of your IQ to see if you can solve everything quickly or not.\n\nMusic is well done with some interesting tone to fit every zone, Graphics are wobble hand drawn type and It's simple but lovable. Story is there but doesn't really matter much since it's very short anyways. Jokes fills the entire game in every conversation and you will chuckle over and over.\n\nAchievemnt hunter beware.. this game takes many run to get 100% as it require you to finish game with any combonation of 2 weapons or 3 weapons.\n\n9/10 well done indie and well deserved 9.

A clever streamlined parody of LoZ with heavier focus on puzzles.\n\nThematically it's a parody of classic top down Legend of Zelda. It has pretty funny writing, and I like the style. A lot of games with a similar silly aesthetic are also kinda gross, but this one thankfully isn't.\n\nOn the gameplay front it's very streamlined. For instance, to view signs or have your character comment on things, you just walk up to them. No pressing an interact button is needed, and it doesn't make you stop moving to read it. There are multiple routes you can take, but no backtracking is needed.

Wir pr\u00fcgeln uns durch niedliche Gegner, spielen mit Bomben und m\u00fcssen viele R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen. Hierbei sammeln wir im Schloss Gold, womit wir uns wiederum die drei Gegenst\u00e4nde im Laden kaufen k\u00f6nnen. Kaufen ist allerdings das falsche Wort, der H\u00e4ndler schickt uns n\u00e4mlich stattdessen zu einem der drei Dungeons, in denen wir unser neues Item erstmal ausprobieren k\u00f6nnen. Mit der neuen Ausr\u00fcstung kommen wir wiederum im Schloss weiter und n\u00e4hern uns so dem Boss und den sammelbaren Monsterkarten. Auch weitere Lebensherzen lassen sich in Form von kleinen Papierst\u00fccken sammeln und die Teleportstationen innerhalb des Schlosses finden. Besonders erw\u00e4hnenswert ist, dass man alle wichtigen R\u00e4tsel auch in beliebiger Kombination von nur 2 der 3 Items l\u00f6sen kann. Hat man alle 3, kann man noch die Meisterh\u00f6hle und den Kompostdungeon mit zus\u00e4tzlichen R\u00e4tseln aufsuchen.\n\nDas Spiel wirkt zwar kindlich, die R\u00e4tsel sind oft aber ziemlich knifflig, insbesondere mit nur 2 Gegenst\u00e4nden. Ich hatte auch im Kampf einige Schwierigkeiten und auch dabei, den richtigen Weg zu finden. Dabei ist es zus\u00e4tzlich anstrengend, dass die Gegner nach jedem Neubetreten respawnen. Da ich \"The Legend of Zelda\" nie intensiv gespielt habe, kann ich keinen direkten Vergleich anstellen, jedoch ist das Gameplay sehr fair und hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Man kann nichts verpassen und bekommt vom Spiel eine sehr gute Hilfstellung.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nDie Geschichte ist nicht besonders tiefgreifend. Ittle und ihre \"Fee\" Tippsie stranden auf einer Insel und suchen das Abenteuer. Der einzige andere Mensch auf der Insel, der H\u00e4ndler, bietet ihnen ein Flo\u00df gegen ein im Schloss verstecktes Artefakt. Weiterhin kommt es zu echt lustigen Dialogen zwischen der kindlichen Ittle und der Heiltranks\u00fcchtigen Tippsie, sowie auch zwischen Ittle und manchen Gegnern. Das Spiel hat durch die Charaktere seinen ganz eigenen Charm und hat mich des\u00f6fteren zum Grinsen gebracht.\n\n[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]\n\"Ittle Dew\" wirkt durchg\u00e4ngig wie gezeichnet. Die Gegner wirken sehr niedlich, lustig und generell wackeln viele Texturen, wodurch das Spiel wesentlich frischer und lebendiger wirkt. Auch ist das Spiel sehr, sehr farbenfroh.\n\nDie Melodie ist sehr heiter und passt sich der Umgebung gut an. Sie ist sehr simpel, aber passt einfach zum Gesamtspiel.\n\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nDas Spiel ist zwar in gewisser Weise eine Parodie, jedoch ist der Spielstil auch nach all den Jahren noch erfrischend und insbesondere in \"Ittle Dew\" gut umgesetzt. Die Grafik und Melodie laden zum Weiterspielen ein und generell ist das ganze Spiel einfach niedlich. Das Spiel badet in einer unschuldigen und kindgerechten Atmossph\u00e4re und genau das macht das Spiel besonders. \"Ittle Dew\" hat zu seinem Release gro\u00dfe Wellen in der Indiewelt geschlagen und ich kann dem positiven Feedback nur zustimmen. Dieses Spiel ist eine wahre Indieperle und bekommt von mir eine volle Empfehlung!\n\n\n\nWenn dir das Review gefallen hat, w\u00fcrde ich mich freuen, wenn du meiner Kuratorgruppe auf Steam folgst, um auch meine Reviews zu anderen Spielen zu bekommen: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool", "timestamp_created": 1496802605, "timestamp_updated": 1496802793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32164185": {"recommendationid": "32164185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135754699", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464284131}, "language": "english", "review": "Reminds me of the Legend of Zelda but this one is very heavy with puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1496534262, "timestamp_updated": 1496534262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577270", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32073543": {"recommendationid": "32073543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063492257", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479905819}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is surprisingly difficult at times, but it's not so bad!

Maybe \"homage\" is the wrong word, since many aesthetic elements are lifted straight from 'ALTTP'. A fact evident just by looking at 'Ittle Dew's' protagonist. It's a wonder Nintendo never sued. \n\nWhile 'A Link to the Past' was a classic, fun, robust game that could hook first-time adventurers for dozens of hours, though, the world of 'Ittle Dew' is strangely barren. There's pretty much no story to speak of, zero character development. Combat is uninspired and suffers from hit detection issues when using certain weapons. Add to that, I managed to complete the game with every collectible in 7 hours on my first playthrough (that's IN SPITE of challening the secret extra cave). No multiplayer or DLC to extend the game's replay value either. \n\nFunny thing is, 'Ittle Dew' seems to know it's lame, as the title is replete with self-aware, self-deprecating humor. So in summary:\n\nPros: \n- Handrawn art style beautiful in its simplicity\n- Ocassionally funny, self-aware dialogue\n\nCons:\n- Obscenely short length\n- No replay value (beyond a few Achievements)\n- No plot\n- Overeliance on block puzzles\n- Hit detection issues\n\nConclusion: 'Ittle Dew' started out as a free game made using 'Game Maker', and that's how it should've stayed.

I wanna talk about its writing.\n\nPlayed it just coming off of Yooka Laylee, which had one of the worst scripts I've ever encountered in a game, but Ittle Dew is comparably comedic, childish and meta-oriented, with 4th-wall breaking jokes coming out of sardonic, goofy characters. The degree to which Ittle Dew trounces Yooka Laylee in its execution, however, is startling.\n\nIttle Dew's writing has three things going for it that make the script not just lovable and silly, but exceptional:\n-A clever Double Act\n-Unobtrusiveness\n-A well-thought out balance of cynicism and heart.\n\nA good Double Act is always based on the chemistry between two disparate characters. Abbott and Costello: A no-nonsense straight-man and a clowny, intentionally-frustrating goof. The reason they bounce off each other is because they can create increasing comedic energy from the simple act of interaction.\nStraight man says a baseline for Goof to comment upon, which straight-man replies to with frustration, which goof replies to with knowing snark and back and forth, a consistent volley of energy that takes a decent amount of time to grow old because neither of characters ever venture into 'unlikeable'.\n\nThis disparate natures of Ittle and Tippsie are naive, curious energy and sarcastic, exhausted wit. Ittle can respond with curiosity, to which Tippsie responds with cynical resentment, to which Ittle responds with frustrated surprise, to which Tippsie responds with sarcastic acknowledgement, which is a funny volley over and over again, and because they're both characters who are, if not fleshed out, then at least well-established and full of interesting, fun characteristics.\n\nAs for unobtrusiveness: Ittle Dew's dialogue has a habit of appearing when a new enemy or concept is introduced and right before boss battles. Exceptions are rare. This means that dialogue only appears distinctly at moments when more information would be desirable and, very importantly, only while the game is continuing to be interesting. In the middle of a slow area, where frustration is high and concentration/patience is important, there is a 0% chance of dialogue interrupting anything or presenting itself as a time-waster.\n\nLastly: the game is very meta, but never at its own expense. It's a game who's storyline is \"We've arrived on Video Game Island, I wonder what's in store for us\", and while it makes a few cracks at typical genre conventions, it never accuses itself of not being fun (something that Yooka Laylee did fairly and unfortunately often), it takes as gospel the fact that the player has shown up to have fun and has a love for the genre, and thus mirrors the player's enthusiasm by taking loving jabs and a genuine enthusiasm for the premise and world and gameplay.\n\nThe ending is character-oriented, which may seem like a weird choice in a plot that's essentially non-existent, until you realize that without the formality of plot, the things we've grown to love over the game's runtime are the gameplay itself and the characters who were enjoying it.\n\nIt's a delightful game with a delightful story and it doesn't need to be any more than that.

The game's main castle is non-linear, and depending on where you go, you can get money, which you use to obtain one of three pieces of equipment.  The equipment can be used to advance further, get more equipment, and so on.  The non-linear design guarantees that everyone can approach the game in a variety of ways.  This brings a surprising amount of replayability to what would otherwise be a linear game.\n\nThe primary focus of the gameplay is in the puzzling.  The puzzles are well thought-out, and even if you know you have the right equipment to solve a particular room, it can require a clever approach and out of the box thinking to advance.  Most of them use elements of sliding block puzzling, but thanks to the unique elements of the game, they feel like much more.\n\nThe humor is great as well.  While the game is excellent from its level design and puzzles, the humor is the cherry on top that makes it a masterpiece.  The sound and art contribute to the theme, and I can't possibly recommend this game enough.\n\nIf you want puzzles, this game will scratch that itch.

Who keeps putting hearts into rocks, anyways?\n\nittle Dew never wastes time and is built as tight as a drum.  There\u2019s no sprawling overworld, no overly dramatic plot, and no tedious filler; it gets in, delivers the puzzles, and gets out before wearing out its welcome.  The game is comprised of three short item dungeons (which can be completed in any order), a dozen or so optional puzzle rooms, and a central non-linear castle that is revisited multiple times as the player gains more items.  A first run through the game is a casual five hours (more if going for all the secrets), and optional second-run challenges are also available for the minimalist and speedrunning players.\n\nThe puzzles are a masterwork in this game, relying only on simple tasks (i.e. push a block onto a button) with simple rules (i.e. ice blocks slide until they hit something) that are easy to understand but take careful planning to execute.  Puzzles squeeze every bit of use out of all the items and mechanics presented; rarely will a player encounter the same type of puzzle twice, keeping the game fresh and interesting.  However, a warning:  while the game does give vague hints, some of the more complex item mechanics are never explicitly explained, occasionally leading to seemingly impossible tasks until trial and error leads to a eureka moment.  Fortunately, the worst of these are confined to the Master Dungeon, an optional end-game challenge for people who LIKE impossible tasks.\n\nIf any nitpick could be made of the game, it would be that the enemies just feel sort of \u201cthere\u201d; a necessary construct of the game\u2019s Legend of Zelda roots, but ultimately little more than an annoyance that detract from the puzzle-solving focus of the game.  Common baddies move slowly, deal low damage, and are easily dispatched, while the three item dungeon bosses are largely uninspired, requiring simple puzzles to be solved while dodging their predictable attacks.  The final boss fortunately bucks this trend and is a frantic and satisfying exclamation point to the game.", "timestamp_created": 1487902232, "timestamp_updated": 1487902232, "voted_up": true,

I love that instead of being a silent character, Ittle has humorous insights and conversations with her equivalent to Link's Navi: Tippsie. It's also quite nice to see that the main character is female without it being an important feature or something that is overly emphasized to please a feminist audience, it's just a character that happens to be female who slays monsters and goes on adventures. Cool. Also, Tippsie offers advice when you want it rather than nagging you, which is a small but important detail.

It leans heavily into complex single-room puzzles with minimal combat. Contrast this with: Zelda's simpler, but multi-room puzzles, with casual-but-competent combat; and Darksiders' more refined combat and more focus on platforming.\n\nNovel and fresh take on an abused and neglected genre.\nSome highlights of particularly strong game design:\n* Each puzzle feels fresh. Particularly impressive given the amount of them\n* Comedic elements are light and witty, without trying to steal focus from the experience\n* Difficulty curve is smooth, with a good pacing of optional mini-puzzles along a parallel difficulty curve\n* At end of game, meaningful replay value in the form of multiple \"low %\" completion routes are made clear to the player\n* Optional end-dungeon \"Master Cave\" adds a new level of complexity to the fundamentals\n* Game intentionally avoids putting rewards in places that can be missed\n* No meaningful padding or filler, all content is quickly reachable from the center of the world\n* Death (though an extremely rare occurence as hazards are not the focus of the game) is not punishing, and just throws the player back at the start of the current room with minimal delay\n* I'll say it: better puzzle and dungeon design than any Zelda game.

Ittle Dew's feels clunky in comparison. Thankfully, combat is not a focus for the vast majority of the game. But...\n* Final boss has a very \"twitch action-game\" phase when compared to the rest of the game, and thus unfairly gates players to completion by requiring a skillset they didn't sign up for, and the game didn't ramp them up to\n* \"Master Cave\" boss is devoid of puzzle elements entirely, and REALLY feels out of place in the game as a result\n\nI would consider this game to be mandatory reference material for all developers in the \"puzzle dungeon\" genre.", "timestamp_created": 1486956150, "timestamp_updated": 1486956787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29733578": {"recommendationid": "29733578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113709377", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479264240}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr kurzweiliger, aber ziemlich guter Spa\u00df in Zelda Manier.\nDer Humor ist gut, die R\u00e4tsel sind fordernd genug, um nicht gelangweilt zu werden, aber nicht zu schwer, um dran zu verzweifeln.\nIch w\u00fcrde zum spielen allerdings einen Kontroller empfehlen, da die Steuerung mit Tastatur sehr gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig ist, sobald man mehrere Items besitzt (mit Kontroller jedoch einfach).", "timestamp_created": 1486348904, "timestamp_updated": 1486348904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29723476": {"recommendationid": "29723476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143262996", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486288040}, "language": "koreana", "review": "[h1]\uc778\ub514\uacc4 \uba85\ud488 \ud37c\uc990 \uac8c\uc784[/h1]\n\n\uae30\ubcf8 \uc904\uac70\ub9ac\ub294 \ube48\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \ubcf4\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uac04\ub3c4 \uc5bc\ub9c8 \uac78\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \ubcf4\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud2c0 \ub4c0\uc758 \ub9e4\ub825\uc740 \ubc14\ub85c [b]'\uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \ubcf4\ub294\uac00'[/b]\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n\uc774\ud2c0 \ub4c0\ub294 \ud558\ub098\ubd80\ud130 \uc5f4\uae4c\uc9c0 [b]\ud37c\uc990[/b]\uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \ud37c\uc990\uc744 \ud478\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 3\uac00\uc9c0\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c\ub3c4 \ub0b4\uac00 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \ud574\ubc95\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ubaa8\uc740 \ucc44 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \ud3b8\ud558\uac8c \ud37c\uc990\uc744 \ud480\uba70 \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \ubcf4\ub7ec \uac08 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0, \uc544\uc774\ud15c \uc77c\ubd80\ub9cc \uac00\uc9c4 \ucc44 \uc5d4\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\ud560 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubc18\uc601\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \ucd1d 4\uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \uc870\ud569 \uc911 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \ubcf4\ub294\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac01\uae30 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac19\uc740 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc88 \ubc18\ubcf5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc774\ud2c0 \ub4c0\ub294 \uac01 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc870\ud569\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \ud480\uc787\ubc95\uc774 \ubc14\ub00c\uba70 \uc5d4\ub529\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \ub8e8\ud2b8\ub3c4 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4.\n\n\ud37c\uc990\uc744 \ud480\uc5b4\uc57c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc9d1\ud488\ub4e4, \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc6a9 \uae38, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uac8c\uc774\uba38\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2ec\uc778\uc758 \ub3d9\uad74\uae4c\uc9c0. \uadf8\uc57c\ub9d0\ub85c \ud37c\uc990 \ubcf4\ub530\ub9ac\uac00 \ub530\ub85c \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ud37c\uc990 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc2eb\uc5b4\ud55c\ub2e4\uba74 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc0ac\uba74 \uc548 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud37c\uc990 \ub9c8\ub2c8\uc544\ub77c\uba74?

I am SO GLAD I ended up finally buying Itlle Dew! Totally has a Wind Waker vibe visually, and plays like the original legend of zelda with a top down view, grottos with treasure, dungeons with bosses and a handful of key weapons that you need to progress. The puzzles are a perfect ratio of frustrating:gratifying and, the game has no lives/game over system which, for me, was very motivating.

I have played it several times and I intend to come back to it more. It is well worth what you pay for it.[/b]\n\nIttle Dew is a single-player game which at first glance is very similar to the old NES and SNES Zelda games. That is accurate, but there is a lot more to it.\n\nIf you play for even a small amount of time, you will notice that Ittle Dew has a great irreverent style of humor which is enhanced by the lovable characters, and the mix of puzzle and combat gameplay suits it perfectly. There is very little fluff - by which I mean you will use the same puzzle elements over again, but in increasingly clever and novel ways. It is clear that the developers (Ludosity) took great care in crafting their game and distilling it down to a small, but densely packed experience that conveys constant quality.\n\nThere are five boss fights in the game, of which three, including the final boss, are required to beat the main story. A fourth is required to gain all of the items. Each of the three dungeon bosses have specific mechanics which require you to use your new dungeon item as you have learned in the preceding area, creating a diverse experience that never gets tedious. There is also a fifth (tough) boss that is completely optional.\n\nAside from the main story, there is an optional 'Master Cave' with twelve puzzles. They begin slightly more difficult than what you have done to beat the main story, but the difficulty ramps up quickly and some will leave you thinking for a long time before you can beat them. I was amazed at how clever some of the solutions were.\n\n[i]If you haven't already, I recommend watching the trailer on the Steam Page - it will show you a good sample of the humor and puzzles you can expect.[/i]\n\n__\n\nThe game also has a sequel, Ittle Dew 2. It's bigger and more combat-oriented, but it has a lot of what made this one great! I recommend both games.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/395620/Ittle_Dew_2/", "timestamp_created": 1480297370, "timestamp_updated": 1511390689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27897005": {"recommendationid": "27897005", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978760300", "num_games_owned": 1268, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396677090}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic little game that plays very much like 2D entries in the Legend of Zelda series.

(and I assume, ways to play the game)\n\n[h1]So now the standard game rating:[/h1][list]\n[*][b]Story: 9/10[/b] (it's silly, it's fun, it's the kind of story that doesnt take it'self too seriously and in general just a lighthearted approach, that said it doesnt have some deep engaging story to it so I can't give it some sort of perfect score comparing it to something like transistor.)\n[*][b]Gameplay: 10/10 + \ud83c\udfae + \ud83d\udcf1[/b] (Very smooth, very fun to master and I'd suggest using a controller, as it is an option and to me just feels right for this game.) (just so you know they also have this game as an app for smartphones, so if you feel like it you could check it out on that platform - it plays fine everywhere)\n[*][b]Presentation: 10/10[/b] (I'm absolutely in love with the art style that this game has, and I enjoy how all the main enemies are creative and fun and very jenny. you'll grow to love certain characters in ludosity's universe of games and you'll want to play some of their other games.)\n[*][b]Soundtrack: 10/10[/b] (It's honestly just good fitting music thats also memorable, and didn't get old. I loved it.)\n[*][b]Replayability: 9/10[/b] (Theres a certain point where you cannot do the game a different way, but thats an achievement on it's own to play the game out. I've seen people speed running this game, and I've seen people try taking really odd routes that seemed like fun overall, if you want to play it more you can, for a very long time.)", "timestamp_created": 1479945565, "timestamp_updated": 1479945565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522048", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26945160": {"recommendationid": "26945160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132388523", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479386282}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging puzzle Game in a  simplified style of Zelda", "timestamp_created": 1479943987, "timestamp_updated": 1479943987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26873393": {"recommendationid": "26873393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059425189", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1516128998}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um jogo simples que as vezes pode passar desapercebido assim como foi pra mim, eu peguei ele junto em uma bundle e achei que seria apenas 2 ou 3 horinhas no m\u00e1ximo e j\u00e1 desinstalaria e partindo pra outro game, mas n\u00e3o foi nem um pouco assim a hist\u00f3ria.\nJoguei por um bom tempo e sinceramente um \u00f3timo game com puzzle divertidos e legais e com uma bela dificuldade no final, conseguir entrar no hall do tempo, terminar o jogo em menos de 15 minutos, ora mim que gosto muito de speedrun foi maravilhoso.\nUm jogo que vale o pre\u00e7o e cumpre o que promete.\n\n5/5 F\u00c1CIL", "timestamp_created": 1479934135, "timestamp_updated": 1479934135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26849376": {"recommendationid": "26849376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044863287", "num_games_owned": 995, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479294941}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0438 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1479931875, "timestamp_updated": 1479931875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503181", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26838019": {"recommendationid": "26838019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137961134", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476622426}, "language": "french", "review": "Super jeu, je vous le conseille", "timestamp_created": 1479930909, "timestamp_updated": 1479930909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26826078": {"recommendationid": "26826078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003502384", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399035229}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little puzzle game, with a surprising amount of depth.

It claims to \"boil down the classic adventure formula until there is only fun left\" but I've realized no amount of boiling will get rid of the BS that goes straight to the very bones of this game and games in similar veins. I understand that there is a level of subjectivity involved, that maybe this genre is just not \"for me,\" but this is my review based on my experience of the game, most of which is negative. \n\nMechanically, nearly everything about this game is bad. It does not modernize or simplify (\"boil down\" to use the devs' words) any of the frustrations of old school Zelda, it literally rips the most infuriating aspects of those games out and reskins them. It manages to even add some of its own terrible ideas to the pile of garbage. I don't usually do this but I listed them down.\n\n1) Your weapon attack has no arc at all. You literally cannot damage something that is right next to you but diagonal despite  the sword having a visual arc and enemies being able to knock into you and kill you like every game. This isn't Final Fantasy Tactics, I don't understand what the problem is.\n2) The hearts mechanic. It's so pointless to make your HP into collectibles, I don't understand why you would even bother when there's nothing to gain from killing enemies that aren't linked to puzzles. You're more likely to lose hearts than gain them given how your attacks are bound to the four cardinal directions whilst enemies fill the rooms and spam them with projectiles and fast moving bodies. Then when you die, you just gain back all your hearts anyway. And this is a game that encourages speed running. It literally does this just to emulate Zelda, there's absolutely no mechanical reason for the game to have this archaic system.\n3) Respawning enemies. Again, just run past everything because even if you kill anything it only serves as a removal of a distraction anyway.\n4) Respawning enemies in puzzle rooms.  \n5) Undefeatable instant kill enemies. Yup, they stole Wallmasters. The most garbage enemy in all of the Zelda franchise and you decided to emulate that.\n6) UNDEFEATABLE INSTANT KILL ENEMIES IN PUZZLE ROOMS. Just go to hell and stay there, please.\n7) Puzzle bosses that have to be hit more than once. It's a puzzle right? The same puzzle three times over doesn't make it more difficult, it just makes it tedious.\n8) Dexterity tests. This is where I finally drew the line. I was having trouble with a puzzle in the Master Cave and finally gave in and looked up the solution and as it turned out the solution involved pushing a dozen buttons in the correct order in a very small window of time, which the game asks you for nowhere else. Someone asked about the same puzzle on the front page of the forums at the time of this review, and the devs literally reply \"Sorry not sorry.\" Are you kidding me.\n\nI'll give them props on two fronts: they don't make any of the collectibles missable despite having branching dungeon designs, and the worst parts of the game are optional. In fact, a lot of the game seems to be optional. Kind of makes me think they were aware that people would want to skip playing most of it.\n\nI'm being mean. This is probably a really good game for the genre, definitely compared to most of Steam. I also genuinely love the art style. But as I said at the start, I realized that this genre as a whole is just bad, the aspects of it that are considered its trademarks add nothing but artificial difficulties to a game which doesn't have a strong core of anything. If it's about the puzzles, why have all the enemies distracting you from them? If it's about beating things up or performing pro gamer moves, why are the mechanics all so wanky? It can't be about story, there's no story barring some snarky jabs at its predecessors.\n\nGames of this breed of \"action-adventure\", a kind of mix and match of everything, belong to another time period.

Sure, you have the usual mechanics of hacking and slashing monsters of increasing difficulty, you have powerups that let you solve harder puzzles, you have dungeons with bosses that are defeated by your most recent powerup, you have even the same kind of 2-D world, even down to the platforms and bridges. You've even got the same sliding of boxes to unlock doors and using bombs to unlock hidden passageways. But does Link get to MAKE his own boxes? Does he get to warp around within a single room of a dungeon? No, but Ittle Dew does (I think that's her name. Otherwise the title makes absolutely no sense and is completely arbitrary).\n\nThe main difference between this and Zelda is that there is much more block moving, as this is the main mechanic. You have four main powerups (fiery sword to light things on fire and break ice, portal blocks that act as weights, portal wand that targets things and sends them through where your portals are, and an ice wand that freezes blocks for easy pushing and douses flames.) The puzzles are based on combining all of these weapons to traverse a very Zelda-like dungeon. The difficulty increases as they put you in rooms that are supposed to be solvable but without explaining additional things that you can do with the powerups. (e.g. if you shoot ice on a wall, it makes it reflective, which means you can zap yourself with the portal gun. Took me a loooooong time to figure that out, and it was by accident.)\n\nIttle Dew also has some good meta-humor. It knows it's a Zelda clone, and has fun with it by poking at the various tropes along the way. For example, enemies drop hearts, which replenish your health, but they're actually fleshy hearts that flop to the ground with a sickening squelch, and the character actually eats them like an apple. There's a sidekick animal that is called Tippsie that always looks drunk on whine (though, you can see it's actually health potions).\n\nIt's not very long, so don't expect Zelda length playtime. Mine was a few hours, mostly because I spent a long time experimenting in just a few dungeons that were giving me trouble for dozens of minutes, whereas the average dungeon took about 2 minutes. The final boss is also a doozy, but mostly because there are 7 stages and it's not clear what you have to do. Fortunately, there are checkpoints after every stage for the boss, and in normal levels, you just go back to the nearest door (not the entrance to the dungeon, as in Zelda, a plus for Ittle Dew!)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it. Probably won't play it again, although there are \"Professional shortcuts\" scattered all around for repeat players who already know some of the advanced move combinations and want to speedrun through. I think for under $5 it's worth it. I got it in a Humble Bundle with, like, six other games, so I definitely got my money's worth in that case.

Each item is functionally very different from the others, so puzzles that are easy when you have the teleport wand may be really challenging without it.\n\nThere are also two levels in the world that only exist to offer more challenging puzzles to those that want them. I found them to be really enjoyable, but I'm happy that they are optional.\n\nThe game's art is simple yet clear, and it gives the game's characters plenty of personality.

The gameplay is similar to a 2D Zelda in many regards in that you explore, fight, and solve puzzles using your trusty stick/sword and items that you gain throughout your adventure. So yes, there are a lot of familiar elements here if you like these kinds of games.\n\nThat said, it doesn't PLAY like a Zelda game. That's not necessarily a bad thing depending on why you enjoy these games in the first place. Whereas Zelda has very tight, simple combat and excellent monster design, it becomes apparent soon after starting this game that combat is not the main focus. Ittle's stick has a short range and some enemies do not suffer knockback when hit. There are also not many enemies with unique weaknesses. Most of them are a simple hack n' slash affair.\n\nWhere this game truly shines is in the puzzle department. I would even say that this game is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game, because the world is compact and filled to the brim with puzzles. Many of them are actually challenging! I literally spent hours in the Master Cave, an optional dungeon filled with the toughest puzzles that this game has to offer, because the puzzles were so difficult and I was determined to solve them without a guide. Though I felt like ripping my hair out at the time, solving these complex puzzles was a rewarding experience in and of itself, unlike in Zelda dungeons where it sometimes feels like puzzles are just there to pad the game out.\n\nThis is a short game, and there are only three items (besides the default stick) that you can obtain. The twist is that these items work together to help you solve puzzles and traverse the main dungeon. For instance, you can combine the portal wand and the ice rod to create an ice block that warps you to the other side of the room. This part of the game was handled ingeniously. There are so many things you can do with these three items and the objects in your environment. There are also multiple ways that you can beat the game, and you don't even need all of the items to do it. Pretty cool!\n\nAs mentioned, this game is short. If you skipped the Master Cave, it would likely take you about 3-5 hours on your first attempt. The replay value comes from finding out different ways to beat the game using different combinations of items. The game is also uniformly hilarious and aware of its genre. Even the credit sequence is funny.\n\nTL;DR - This is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game.

It's a short game that you can finish in a 'less than 3 hours session'. You mainly progress via completing puzzles and opening doors. The game is really user-friendly: it is filled with tips everywhere. There are enemies to fight but the gameplay is mostly centered around puzzles. The bosses are all cool to fight though. There is a bit of a story too but it's nothing really crazy, it is funny sometimes.\n\nEven if the game is short, it has replayability value. Like every dungeons you go has secret paths. You have to complete puzzles to get through those too. They can be pretty hard sometimes. The point of those paths is to speedup your playthrough. I think it's cool that a big part of the game was built around speedrunning it. There is a steam achievement for completing it under 15 minutes. If you want more challenge the game offers it too: 2 optional zones with hard stuff in it.\n\nYou liked the Zelda games? Like puzzles? Like cute games? Want to laugh a bit? Well get you your wallet and start to play as this pretty female protagonist named Ittle Dew :)\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1455395419, "timestamp_updated": 1455395800, "voted_up": true,

There's an optional \"dungeon\" full of super hard puzzles for the aditional challenge\n- 60fps goodness, runs so smooth\n\nCONS\n- All the puzzles in game revolve around box pushing mechanics.

While the inspiration is clear, Ittle Dew focuses almost completely on the puzzle aspects, and completely outdoes Zelda in this regard. In the game, there are only three items. One item burns things, one item freezes things, and one item moves things. All of these items interact with each other, and create interesting puzzles as a result. The game is beatable with all three items, or with any two. The items can be acquired in any order. This actually dramatically changes the way you'll progress through the game, as well as the puzzles you will encounter. There is also a sort of modular difficulty, in that many puzzles are solvable with only one or two of the items, but are difficult. If you come back more fully equipped, it usually makes the puzzles much easier.\n\nThat's all I have to say mechanically, which I think is the primary draw of the game. However, it also oozes charm. It uses a Home Movies-esque Squigglevision style animation which lets you immediately understand what is interactable on the screen. It has a lot of cute dialogue. The characters are one-note, but they do what they need to, and have some pretty funny jokes involved with them.\n\nI think this is easily in my top 10 games.

The duo crashes their raft against an island with a castle, and they do as adventurers do. They explore that shit hard.\n\nIttle Dew was a lot of fun, despite its very short length. It has the look and feel of a Zelda clone, but it leans a bit harder into the puzzles than Zelda games tend to. That's definitely a good thing, considering how interesting the puzzles can be. You use a small set of three items to solve a decent variety of puzzles ranging from incredibly easy to fairly difficult. I doubt you'll be pulling your hair out with many of them. \n\nIt was smart for Ittle Dew to focus more on puzzles than combat, because the hit detection is sloppy with a capital S. You'll often find your sword passing through enemies while you often get hit from incredibly awkward angles. On top of that, later rooms can be filled with projectile launching enemies. Thankfully, the only consequence for death is a room restart, so it never gets to be too frustrating.\n\nI spent just over 2 hours in my playthrough of Ittle Dew (2 hours, 1 minute, 5 seconds according to the in game timer). A 100% completion run could easily see 1-2 more hours added onto that. While this is definitely short, it's certainly a very enjoyable experience. Ittle Dew's leaderboards also challenge you to compete with others in speedruns of a few different categories. \n\nAll that said, $10 may seem to be a fair price, or it may seem to be a bit too much. If you really enjoy 2D Zelda games and their imitators, and if you really enjoy speedruns and replaying games, grab this one at full price. If any of those three previous qualifiers don't apply to you, but you still want to check this one out, maybe wait for a sale.\n\nFor those who like score numbers, I'll take the score straight from Ittle Dew's mouth.

Aber um dies zu schaffen muss sie dem H\u00e4ndler Itan der Ihr ein Floss bauen will eine Item bringen um an das Item heran zu kommen muss sie 3 Dungeons und eine Hauptdungeon schaffen. Die Dungeons sind wie alles in dem Spiel alle recht klein gehalten aber dennoch sch\u00f6n gemacht. Die Waffen sind nur wenige aber immer so dass sie vielseitig einsetzbar sind im verschieden Gegner auf verschiedene Weis zu t\u00f6ten. Die Waffen werden auch zum L\u00f6sen der vielen schiebe R\u00e4tsel ben\u00f6tigt die auf der ganzen Karte und Tempeln verstreut sind. Leider gibt es f\u00fcr die R\u00e4tsel die man nebenbei l\u00f6st nie etwas Wichtiges f\u00fcr den Spielablauf, meistens nur Sammelkarten oder ab und an etwas um ein neues Herz f\u00fcr seine Energie leiste zu bekommen. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGrafik:\n\nDie Grafik ist sehr gut, gibt\u2019s nichts zu mekkern.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusik:\n\nDie Musik ist auch Super passt einfach zum ganzen Spiel..\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteuerung:\n\nDie Steuerung ist mit dem Gamepad einfach klasse. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPro/Contra:\n\n+ deutsche \u00dcbersetzung\n+ viele Witz und Humor\n+ schwere R\u00e4tsel\n- manchmal R\u00e4tsel zu schwer ^^\n- nur Schiebe R\u00e4tsel\n- etwas zu kurz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFazit:\n\nIttle Dew ist meiner Meinung nach KEIN ZELDA, daf\u00fcr ist es einfach zu wenig an Tiefgang und Abwechslung. Die Geschichte ist einfach und zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig gehalten, aber die Dialoge von den Figuren sind wirklich SUPER. Wer Zelda gespielt hat wird hier \u00f6fter mal lachen, da viele kleine Anspielungen zu finden sind. Wer auf Schieber\u00e4tsel ala Zelda steht wird hier nicht zu kurz kommen, wer Schieber\u00e4tsel schon bei Zelda nicht m\u00f6chte sollte wohl eher die Finger von lassen.

Don't be fooled by the simplistic graphics, the adventure tag or the RPG liked screen shots. Ittle Dew is a game with minimalist and nonsensicle plot with a little exploring with tonnes of puzzle.\n\nIn this game, you need to explore dungeon and progress by solving puzzles and unlocking doors. Each area may consists of 1 to several puzzles that you need to solve with the aid of certain weapons. They can be more than 1 approach to solving the puzzle. Each room is reset when you leave the area and coming back. Solving the puzzle will then unlock the doors permanently.\n\nThe puzzles can be challenging especially the optional ones. The mechanics can be simply but the logic can be tricky. If you longed for greater challenge, you can always visit the master dungeon (which is optional), but be warned as you might need to juice the brain a little.\n\nThe boss fights can be tough as there are no hint on how you should approach or tackle them.

I had always meant to play this game but only now did I ever give it the chance. \n\nMaybe it was the Adventure Time style and humor that put me off, leading me to believe this game would be a nonsensical game without any logic. It is nosensical, in a good way, but the puzzles and gameplay are finely crafted with various solutions in an otherwise illogical adventure.\n\n[h1] Wake up, Adventurer. [/h1]\n\nThe story for Ittle Dew is simple: Beat things up and solve puzzles. And then you have weirdo, meta characters and conversations that take slight jabs at the game itself. The interactions with Tippsie (the flying fox) and Ittle are my favorite bits in the game, mostly because of how cynical and arrogant Tippsie comes off. \n\nIf you do like the wierdness humor of Adventure Time or Regular Show, then you'll probably find the other characters entertaining. I had one or two laughs as I liked the small world of the game, but I didn't find anything too interesting or memorable.\n\n[h1]What Can You Dew?[/h1]\n\nWhere the story and the characters were lacking, the puzzle/adventuring aspects of the game were what sold me on the game itself. And not on my first playthrough but my third one as well.\n\nYou are given a stick to start with that can temporarily be set on fire. You later can get a Flame Scimitar (like the stick but stronger and always on fire), the Portal Wand that can create blocks and teleport things, and a Freeze Wand. Some items have some synnergy between them that becomes useful when solving a room when you only have two items.\n\nIn order to beat the game, you only require two out of three items; however, on your first playthrough, you will want to collect all three items to 100% the game. Not only would you want to do this for achievements, but after each item-boss, there are extra dungeons that teach you more in-game mechanics through smaller, harder puzzles.\n\nThe only reward  worth caring about is the heart-notes for extra lives; the cards are added in for flavor, but it's the practice of familiarizing yourself with the mechanics and experimenting with your tools are the real rewards for the challenge. They're all centered on the item you bought and they're all completely optional, so the puzzles are a great method of teaching the player how to play the game better.\n\nOnce you have all three items, and you think you're smart enough, you can then tackle the Master Cave. You might think these challenges begin fairly simple (for the first four or five rooms), but the later challenges will test your reflexes as much as your puzzle-solving skills, sometimes in really convuluted ways. \n\nI'll admit I had to use a guide because some solutions were so specific to the millisecond I wouldn't be able to figure it out on my own. Although the payoff for completing the twelve hardest puzzles of the game is anticlimatic (as well as the boss-fight), this part of the game will teach you skills you were not even aware of you had all the time with a given tool (or combination of the two).\n\nA complete playthrough, on a (mostly) blind run, will take you about four to seven in-game hours depending on how stubborn you are to avoid a guide. The real fun of the game comes on your next three playthroughs.\n\n[h1]A Task Against Familiarity[/h1]\n\nAs mentioned before, the game is designed for you to complete the game with two out of three items. Backtracking for the items is less tedious as you'll most likely be able to solve the professional shortcuts after the Master Cave. Navigating through the Castle with a limited amount of items is the real challenge.\n\nThe game forces you to tackle certain rooms for enough loot for what you need while also figuring out how to reach the final boss-room. The final boss fight is tailored to whatever items you have, although the fight is much shorter as a result. \n\nUnfortunately, as a result of not having enough items to do everything, your playthrough from 4 to six hours goes down to less than fifteen minutes to three hours at most as a result of handicaping yourself. \n\nThese shorter runs are still worthwhile because the game takes previous challenges and does a new spin on them, and some rooms are probably impossible (but you wont' know until you try), so these playthroughs are not worthless. \n\nI just wish there was some way to still 100% ALL rooms with these limitations. No run will match the first one in length or for completion, and they freel tailored for speedrunners alone. (I'm not a fan of speedrunning my games; I prefer to take my time and relax). \n\n[h1]\"Eh, 3 out of 5 at best.\"[/h1]\n\nThis isn't my score of the game, but I think that line quite sums up my thoughts.

That impression proved to be largely inaccurate.  They share some superficial similarity... a tope-down perspective, a sandy haired protatgonist clad in green, some hack and slash gameplay, bombs, wands, and puzzle solving...  But Ittle Dew is much more oriented toward the puzzle solving.  The controls are quite firm-feeling, and are not well-suited to extensive swordplay, but the level design doesn't push a lot of hack'n'slash action.  Most rooms have puzzles to be solved, and the game is mostly non-linear.  In fact, it offers built in challenge modes by purchasingonly 2 of the 3 items offered for the completion of the game's puzzles, with semi-secret alternate routes to accommodate those that choose the handicap.  It also has some extra challenge rooms at the end of the game, after all the items are unlocked.

As a puzzle game it's surprisingly challenging and the different mechanics work well together and lend to some interesting stages. The design of the puzzles actually reminds me a lot of Portal in how they're constructed and the lateral thinking that you have to apply sometimes (and not just because there's a portal wand in the game).\n\n However the game is pretty short, I was able to get the achievement for beating it in 3 hours on my first playthrough and I thought I was taking it slow. There's replay value in that puzzles that are easy with say the portal wand are much much harder when you try to brute force it using just the ice wand, and doing the Wanderer achievement was very difficult and at times I had to use a walkthrough which is something I never do. The collectables are entirely pointless (they even say so in the game), the bosses and combat in general is frustrating and not fun at all, and the entire game can feel shallow but there's fun to be had. I got it for nearly nothing on the humble bundle and I wouldn't recommend paying much more than $5 for it based on its length but if you like puzzle games you'll probably have a lot of fun with it. I just wish they focused more on the puzzles and took out the combat parts of it entirely, since they serve no purpose and will end up pissing you off more than anything.\n\nEDIT: I forgot one of the most important aspects for me which is linux support (if you're running on Windows you can just skip over this). This game does support linux and plays great on it compared to other ports on steam, with fully working achievements unlike say Postal 2 (which still bothers me to this day). HOWEVER the controller support is wonky. The first time I ever started the game I calibrated my controller, and everything worked perfectly. I close the game, restart it, and the controls for the analog stick are completely broken, the character will walk when I dont press anything, will go in the opposite direction of what I tell it to, and generally it's unplayable with the stick now even though it worked perfectly the first time, and recalibration did nothing to fix it. Thankfully I was able to map movement to the dpad instead which was fine, but since I'm using a ps3 controller and the dualshock 3's dpad is garbage it was pretty annoying to control like that, though everything else worked perfectly.", "timestamp_created": 1434592486, "timestamp_updated": 1434593130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16442601": {"recommendationid": "16442601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035365250", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433000633}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu a un bon sc\u00e9nario, une bonne rejouabilit\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce aux succ\u00e8s.\nLes \u00e9nigmes sont assez complexes avec une difficult\u00e9 croissante.", "timestamp_created": 1434459072, "timestamp_updated": 1434459072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16434200": {"recommendationid": "16434200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000111057", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418947405}, "language": "english", "review": "zelda puzzle", "timestamp_created": 1434424908, "timestamp_updated": 1434424908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16348647": {"recommendationid": "16348647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025028109", "num_games_owned": 1091, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434653111}, "language": "english", "review": "A cute and funny Zelda-like game.

The main storyline puzzles are fairly simple to figure out, while the side-mission 'trading card' puzzles will probably require you actually sit there and think a bit. Then there's the Master Cave that will likely require most people to devote a rather hefty amount of time to get through those 12 puzzles, as they tend to push the limitations of your items as far as possible. \n\nBut where the puzzles shine, the combat falls completely flat. Your attacks lack any sort of knock back so unless you are backpedaling they will simply walk over you, which is exacerbated by the fact that your sword lacks any reach or arc to its swing, meaning that you will likely be trading hearts with your foes until you perfect the distance. But this isn't a huge flaw as enemies aren't a huge threat and even boss fights are usually more based around item gimmicks than fighting. Usually...\n\nThe one, ONE, huge glaring flaw in the game is that the Master Cave I mentioned before, the optional end game with the 12 most difficult, mindbreaking, walkthrough inducing, puzzles in the game... ends in a boss that is nothing more than a button mashing lesson in rage and futility. Your items do nothing. The skills and techniques you've worked on through 4+ hours of gameplay are useless. You are stuck using only the shoddy sword combat mechanics, and praying to every deity under the sun that it will bug out and stop attacking so you can kill it sometime this millenia. A massive black spot on an otherwise great puzzle game. I solved every puzzle, collected every card, but due to stupidly dodgy combat mechanics, a lack of luck, and a lack of perfect precision manual dexterity on my part, I couldn't beat it after a full hour of trying. I've no desire to ever try again, and likely will never play this game again because of that stupid boss.

I expected something at least decent but what I got was a great and clever puzzle game with high replayability and amusing dialogue/parody. \n\nThe core puzzle gameplay is based around sliding block puzzles, yes, but with interesting mechanics I've not seen done before, especially not all together in the way this game does. Every puzzle feels unique and fresh, and they range from the simple to the mind-numbingly difficult (though I admit that I looked up solutions to a few in the master cave... the harder ones there are also kind of the weakest, lots of secret mechanic stuff you need to know :s )\n\nOn top of that, there are four different ways to complete the game. You can get all three items or any combination of the two, and the paths you can take through the castle are quite different for each 2-combination. I quite enjoyed working out the different ways to make it through to the end, it kept replays fresh and interesting. The achievement set is also pretty great; a few bonus dungeons, 100% collection, and an added challenge to one of the routes for beating the game without harming a few specific enemy types (only possible via one of the four routes, sadly, and there's a bit of a dick move possible right after the final boss if you don't set up the castle properly... but ehh!)\n\nThe writing is also amusing, toying with lots of RPG tropes (especially Zelda tropes, which is this game's closest comparison to begin with) but not going overboard.

It's an entirely lighthearted affair filled with charming characters, whimsical creatures, and colorful sights to behold, and the writing, while a bit too self-aware at times, does a good job at poking fun at the conventions of a typical top-down adventure.\n\nGameplay, as should be clear by now, is like a condensed 2D Zelda. There's a small overworld to explore with caves to spelunk, three main dungeons, two bonus dungeons, and the island's castle, a sprawling, two-story locale which Ittle can only conquer in multiple trips, somewhat like the Tower of Spirits in Spirit Tracks. A variety of enemies roam the island, though it's usually not necessary to kill them because they can only drop hearts, and there are boss battles at the end of each dungeon, including one of the best bonus bosses ever conceived. Treasure comes in the form of Paper Scraps (Heart Pieces), Collectible Cards, and Lunch Money, which Ittle can use at the shop to buy the game's three weapons.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting about the game is how it offers a lot of choices. The main dungeons can be completed in any order, and they as well as the castle have multiple paths to take through them, the shorter ones \u2014 \"Professional Shortcuts\" \u2014 being tougher to traverse. Astoundingly, the adventure can be finished with either all weapons or any combination of two of them, meaning there are four different ways to beat the game; the game even records players' best times for each combination! \n\nOf course, a Zelda parody wouldn't be complete without puzzles. There are TONS of puzzles in this game, involving familiar concepts like block pushing, switches, mirrors and the like. The mandatory ones generally don't require too much thought, but the aforementioned Professional Shortcuts as well as the overworld caves contain puzzles that tended to take me a good five minutes to solve. One of the bonus dungeons, the Master Cave, is made of twelve incredibly difficult puzzles that really stretched the limits on how Ittle's weapons could interact with each other and the environment; some of them were so devious that I resorted to a guide and I was truly flabbergasted by their solutions. Suffice to say, the puzzles were the highlight of the game for me.\n\nThe only iffy part about the gameplay is the combat, specifically Ittle's basic attack. In most 2D Zelda titles, Link swings his sword in a wide arc, but Ittle only swings in a short line directly in front of her. There were several occasions where I would attack only to miss due to the small hitbox, which usually resulted in me taking damage. Thankfully, enemies aren't that tough to take down regardless, and dying only sends Ittle back to the start of the room.\n\nIf you haven't watched the trailer for the game on its store page yet, you should do so now because the graphical style of the game is delightful. In addition to being bright and vibrant, the game uses squiggly outlines for characters and moving objects; it reminds me a lot of Ed, Edd n Eddy, which is basically my favorite cartoon to this day.

It's weird, but it's very nice to see how almost every aspect of this game seems to just fit it and provide a great experience, despite its apparent simplicity!\n\n[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]\nUndoubtedly, one of its strongest aspects, especially at first. The cartoon-y [b]artstyle[/b] is very well done, with a pleasant color scheme, very clean, with added lighting effects modernising its look, somewhat. The highlight here for me, though, is the character design. Everyone looks unique, is a clumsy and silly way, and with their own backstory to support them. It's pretty good! \nAnother detail I liked is how every line moves slightly, making everything seem more alive.\n\nThe [b]music[/b] and [b]sound-effects[/b] didn't standout out too much for me, but fit nicely with the rest of the presentation, and it wasn't bad by any means! Just didn't seem to carry the experience, for me.\n\nI also found the [b]writting[/b] to be funny at times, and it just gave the game a very light-hearted and self-aware tone the whole way through. Ranging from the dialogues with your health-potion drunk companion, to the enemies' entrances and the mocking signposts spread around, everything had something to make fun of.\n\n\n[b][u]How's the game structured?[/u][/b]\nVery much like a Zelda game, actually. You have an island to explore, and go through several dungeons to beat it. There is also some exploration done outside the main and tutorial dungeons.\n\nNear the beginning of the game, you'll find a shop. The shopkeeper tells you he can give you a raft to escape the island, if you get him the artifact in the castle. And off you go. He also has 3 items to sell. You'll find the gold for it in the castle. The game's puzzles revolve around these 3 items: you'll have to combine their abilities in very varied ways to solve the puzzles.\n\nThe castle has many shortcuts, that you can take by solving much harder puzzles. If you're stuck, you may as well try another way, or go buy another item. There are many different ways of making progress, too!\nThe castle puzzles are pretty straighforward, though, so anyone can safely play it without fearing getting frustrated.\n\nOutside the castle, though, there are other smaller dungeon, with harder puzzles. These usually contain Cards with the game's characters. These are merely collectibles, but they're pretty charming too. The puzzles there can also hint at some mechanics you may have not learned throw the tutorial puzzles. \n\nAs a segue, when you have enough gold, you can take one of several portals spread around the castle to fast travel. When you buy an item, you'll be catapulted into another part of the island. These are the tutorial areas. Your items are all stored near the shop, and you'll have to beat the dungeon only with your newfound item. With this, you'll learn how the item works well enough, and do that through play! I think it's a nice way of doing it.\n\nThese dungeons also contain several paths and shortcuts. One important thing is that you'll never be able to leave the cave while missing important items. When you leave the dungeon, it will be sealed, but you can rest assured that you haven't missed anything important. This is also told to you after your first dungeon, in a sign post. \n[i]The placing of that was very elegant[/i]: since there are multiple paths, it's very likely that you'll miss part of the map, and become worried after leaving the dungeon. Right when you're worrying about it, the signpost clarifies it for you.\nThere are many places like this in the game, making tutorialisation nicely paced. [i]Information is often delivered at the right moment![/i]\n\nI think that about covers it.\n\n[b][u]General Mechanics[/u][/b]\nThis game has both combat and puzzles, although the focus is mainly on the puzzles. There are also some Boss Fights, most of which are more puzzle-driven than combat, although both blend rather nicely, items being multi-purposed.\n\nThe combat is very straightforward. Your basic attack attacks the tile in front of you. There are also projectiles attacks. There are several different enemies, some that attack only in front of them, some have projectiles, etc. Different enemies require different approaches. Also, they'll respawn each time you enter the room, but it's never a problem as they're easy to avoid. Some puzzles also reset, but only when the initial conditions are necessary for you to solve another puzzle in the room (or perhaps to use a shortcut).\n\nThe only problem I've had with the combat, is how the movement is a bit [b]floaty[/b], and there's a [b]lack of knock-back[/b] with some enemies. The enemies often drop hearts to replenish your health, and the game is overall not punishing in the least, so it's not too big of an issue. \n\n[b][i]Lack of Punishment[/i][/b]\nThat's mostly a good thing, but it sometimes holds the player's hand too much. For example, Boss fights have 3-5 phases, and there's usually a checkpoint between each. I've found that mostly unnecessary, taking the little challenge that they provided. I think boss fights should still be a threat!\nOn the other hand, each time you die, you'll simply reset the room, but never lose progress, or collectibles at all. That's a very welcome thing! It's always annoying to do 4-5 rooms again when you die, or lose progress over a simple miss-step.\n\n\nThe [b]puzzles[/b] are basically Sokoban, with a few twists. You have 3 items: a Flaming Sword, a Freezing Wand, and a Teleporting Wand.\nThe sword can set bombs on fire, to explode after a few seconds. The Freezing Wand can freeze enemies and blocks (making them very slippery when you push them, and also breakable), and can also freeze a wall, making it reflective.\nThe Teleporting Wand can create a Green block anywhere. If you hit bombs or enemies with the projectile, they'll teleport over to that block. This is basically all you need to know.\nYou combine these techniques with some more subtle quirks to the tiles and timing, and you can be faced with some evil difficult puzzles.\n\n\nDifficulty.\n[b][i]Ittle Dew sets its casual from its hardcore puzzles[/i][/b]\nUsually, to beat the game, you have some fairly easy puzzles. To collect the cards, it's a different matter (although mostly doable). There's a final dungeon with 12 puzzles however, that is really hard! At least for someone inexperienced in Sokoban. I often had to peek into a walkthrough, and was constantly surprised with a new way of combining my items.\n\n[i]Precision and Perfection rather than simply solving a puzzle[/i]\nThe problem is that some of these puzzles required extremely precise timing, with the game's controls don't provide very well, in my opinion. Also, these puzzles constantly made you restart at every wrong move. A time rewinding mechanic would be welcome, even if just on this cave. I had to restart these puzzles many times, making it a bit too frustrating. It wasn't just a puzzle to solve, it was something that heavily relied on execution, which I'm not a fan of.\n\nThen again, these were completely optional! And the game warned you that they were hard. If you complete it, you'll get some more cards, and also Development info, which is very cool!\n\nH.Mention: The castle can be solved with ANY combination of 2 items. I'm very impressed with this! The castle is so nicely designed that you can beat it with any combination of the two items, and the game aknowledges that with achievements. Also for cards, speed, etc.\nThere are many ways of playing Ittle Dew, which is why I think it's a neatly designed game. Many ways that tie together brilliantly!\nFull Recommendation.

Basically, it's like a 2D Legend of Zelda game with a heavy focus on the puzzles. You're washed up on a mysterious island and, as any good adventurer does, you start to adventure. It's pretty straightforward in terms of adventuring. You go from dungeon to dungeon as they become available to you, work on puzzles with the dungeons in order to complete them, and then receive items to help you progress further. Upon getting an item, you generally are sent to a new area without the other items, forcing you to get acquainted with the new item and its uses before being able to combine the uses of all your items. There are a few optional shortcuts and slightly hidden puzzles you can go after, which is nice for even more puzzle solving. It is also entire possible to complete the game without getting all of the items. You can beat it with a few combinations of a few items. These are reflected in the achivements, but... I'll be honest, I had enough trouble with the main game using everything. There's also some funny little dialogues going on in parts of the game which give it some life and keep things from getting too harsh on your brain. Almost like little rewards for continuing. And there are boss fights which will give some action to your problem solving skills. A nice blend for the game.\n\nThere are a few downsides though, as all games have. One is that the game is rather short. Most of the playtime here will be from getting stuck on tricky puzzles. There's not much adventuring, as most of the places you go to are rather straightforward and without missable secrets. Even the optional puzzles are pretty easy to find. So I guess there could've been more adventure for my taste. Also, the combat is a little rough. It just feels a bit stiff and non responsive. There's less focus on it, but still, a little more fluidity might have been nice. Not a big deal, though. You can adjust. There were some pretty interesting puzzles, some involving good timing, but the game doesn't do a great job of teaching you the timing based techniques used later in the game. Also, there's an awful lot of block puzzles, so... if you don't like those... stay away.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool game. Is it worth the ten dollar price tag? Well, if you're a Zelda fan or a puzzle fan, yes. It's definitely worth checking out. For others? Possibly wait for a sale, or just give it a shot. It's a decent price for what you get. It has some neat sound and a fun art style. The music went well the the mood. It's definitely something anyone could enjoy, but recommended for only the Zelda fans or puzzle crowd, I'd say. If you're looking for more adventure, it may not be your cup of tea. And I must say that, even though it is a bit on the short side, it doesn't FEEL short. It feels like a full game, and that's where it counts. I'd give Ittle Dew 7/10.

Shh!) and I think he came to the island to find his hat because its missing.\n\nThis is the weirdest Zelda yet because Zelda never finds any rupees and all the enemies are From Where the Wild Things Are and they all have the same name.\n\nI am now going to spoil the entire game for you...\n\nThe enemies are all named Jenny Rich because its a play on the word generic.\n\ngood Zelda game would buy again.", "timestamp_created": 1419790540, "timestamp_updated": 1419834109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13656671": {"recommendationid": "13656671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165383615", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420273593}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u70b9\u8d39\u8111\u7ec6\u80de\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1419747574, "timestamp_updated": 1419747574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13637647": {"recommendationid": "13637647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101015763", "num_games_owned": 1327, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431138180}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Must have!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1419690101, "timestamp_updated": 1419690101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13632526": {"recommendationid": "13632526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036407061", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420005761}, "language": "english", "review": "Meh, it'll do.\n\nKidding, this game is the shiz!

It was like a time warp.  \n\nAnyways, lets quit the drama and let me present you with a Short, sweet review just like the game.  \n\nPros:\n+ Amazing gameplay. It's downright fun.\n+ Cleverly designed puzzles.\n...+ The puzzles are not super hard niether are they super easy.\n...+ It's a perfect mixture of hard yet non-frustating puzzle. Exactly what I look for in a VIDEO GAME.\n+ Short and nice story. It's not bland like other puzzle games.\n+ It's not serious either, the mood is quite humours and vibrant.\n+ The game does not overstay it's welcome.\n...+ Fun fact: You can finish the game in under 15 minutes.\n+ It offers pretty good replaybility.\n...+ It's highly likely that you won't solve all the puzzles in your first playthrough.\n...+ There are 3 different ways to play this game. (Each of which grants a different achievement too)\n\nCons:\n- There was only exactly ONE situation where I thought the game/floor/level design could have been better. \n- And that's an extremely low number for a puzzle game. (or any game tbh)\n\nI got this game as a gift from a friend who bought it from humble bundle for $1.00 along with a couple of other games.

One of my favorite moments in Ittle Dew was the time I discovered how to launch enemies into the heavens by accident. These tools also add variety to the combat with their different applications.\n\nThe combat seems okay for the most part. A certain few enemy types are not easily dispatched which can be annoying if you're stuck in a room with four of them. For some reason, there's some awkwardness when using the stick/sword for fighting. I tend to bump into enemies a lot before striking, but the game is forgiving with death (and failed puzzles) and only resets the room.\n\nThe art design is clean and cutesy. I do enjoy how the trees are very animated. The colors are well chosen. I have no complaints here.\n\nIttle Dew will provide quite a bit of entertainment depending on your skill level with its puzzles. You'll probably have a good time and if you're stuck, call on Tippsie or refer to a guide if even Tippsie can't help you. I highly recommend collecting the in-game card collectibles as you play.

Ocarina Of Time is still widely accepted as the best game ever made, but that in itself implies that its creation was not a trivial task. There have been attempts to copy the formula, from early titles like Golden Axe Warrior through to Alundra, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and \u014ckami, but not only are these efforts rare but they\u2019ve generally been commercial failures.\n\nThat is likely to be the real reason for the lack of similar games, but such market realities are not something that indie developers generally worry about. Which is good because, despite a few caveats, Ittle Dew is one of the most enjoyable Zelda-a-likes we\u2019ve played in years.\n\nDespite what it may look like Ittle Dew is not a straight clone, but it does have perhaps the most legitimate excuse for copying another game: comedy. Ittle Dew isn\u2019t just a love letter to the Zelda games it\u2019s also a parody of them, and its spunky heroine Ittle and her Navi stand-in Tippsie (a wonderfully cynical magic fox) gently poke fun at the series\u2019 specific peculiarities and those of gaming in general.\n\nTippsie in particular is hilarious, as she reacts with varying degrees of disgust to ordinary Zelda tropes, such as Ittle eating a heart to get more health to her quaffing potions when she\u2019s not looking. Joking about smashing pots and what enemies do all day as they stand around in lonely dungeons may seem like obvious targets, but as we\u2019ve often lamented games are strangely reticent to ever poke fun at their sillier traditions.\n\nThe jovial mood is enhanced further by the wonderful visuals, but despite the art style being very different from any official Zelda game overall Ittle Dew still ends up looking lawyer-worryingly similar. The game is scheduled for release on Wii U later in the year though so we assume that Nintendo gets the joke as well.\n\nIttle has a much more mercenary approach to her explorations than Link, happily stuffing her pockets with treasure as she goes about adventuring. Even the artefact she\u2019s trying to obtain from a nearby castle is only to bribe a shopkeeper to build her a ship to get home. Although he does at least offer to sell her three items vital to her mission: a fire sword, an ice wand, and a portal-creating magic wand.\n\nUnusually for a Zelda game these are the only three items in the whole game, which is certainly a bold choice. But despite all the puzzles being solved using only one or more of the items it\u2019s disappointing that the meat of most of them still revolves around pushing blocks and hitting switches. In the traditional manner there are torches and bombs to be lit, pressure pads to stand on, and doors to unlock. \n\nThe puzzles might not be very imaginative but they are well designed and often have multiple solutions. You can even beat the entire game using any random combination of just two of the items. Some of the puzzles are very hard but the game isn\u2019t interested in punishing you, only challenging you, and there\u2019s a wide range of helpful hints given out by Tippsie.\n\nThe dungeon-like areas are very much the focus of the game and although there are overworld areas they\u2019re smaller and less interactive than real Zelda games. The combat is also significantly less interesting, being barely any more nuanced than the original NES game and offering zero reward beyond extra health. The bosses are a mostly decent bunch though and also get some of the best lines.\n\nIttle Dew is rather short, at around three to four hours, although you\u2019ll need much longer to collect everything and beat the optional Master Cave (the only truly difficult challenge in the whole thing). But for only a tenner you get a download that is not only fun but funny \u2013 a game that is amusingly self-aware but uses this as a means to enhance the experience and not just make excuses for it.\n\n[h1][b]Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1417142276, "timestamp_updated": 1485061343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620553", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13110659": {"recommendationid": "13110659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057657273", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418236097}, "language": "english", "review": "It`s ZEEEEEEEEEELDA!\nNot really but this game still kicks ass!", "timestamp_created": 1417118027, "timestamp_updated": 1417118027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13073787": {"recommendationid": "13073787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027869739", "num_games_owned": 1051, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442068312}, "language": "german", "review": "AAAAAAAAAAAAR!", "timestamp_created": 1416880022, "timestamp_updated": 1416880022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13058580": {"recommendationid": "13058580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964134137", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 289, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403415252}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad game.

It's all puzzles and your enjoyment of them will make or break the game for you.\n\nThere are three items used in puzzles: fire sword, ice wand and portal blocks/teleportation.  This isn't anywhere as limiting as it may seem and the game's puzzle design is very tight and well-done.  Ittle Dew gets a lot of mileage with the different ways it incorporates using the tools together to solve puzzles.  I didn't realize until after I finished it that you can beat the game by only collecting two of the three items and with any combination of the two.   It adds a ton of replay value for future playthroughs.  The game also has \"shortcut paths\", basically hard puzzles that you can use to skip chunks of the game and beat it in less than twenty minutes if you know what to do.  Stuff like beating the game with different combos of items and the shortcut puzzles are cool mechanics/design decisions and I like to seeing them even if I don't necessary plan on ever using them myself.\n\nThe cartoony art is very nice and vivid.  The UI is simple and efficient.  You don't have to walk out of a room to reset a failed puzzle, you can just hit start and hit reset room to save yourself the needless back and forth you'd find in similar games.  The game lets you know how many items are in each area and most collectible item rooms will let you know if you have the correct item to solve the puzzle so you don't spend time beating your head against the wall trying to solve a puzzle you don't have the right item for.  There's just a lot of little things the game does to make playing it a non-aggravating experience.\n\nIn short, if you're down with games that heavily involve pushing blocks and solving puzzles, you'll probably have a solid time with Ittle Dew.

I do list a few nitpicks below, but they don't wreck the game.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\nFirst, the positive: This game is cleverly designed, adorable, and a lot of fun.  I enjoyed playing it, and I hope to see a sequel someday.  The puzzles were very well-presented, giving you opportunities to learn the tools before being thrown into a terrifying challenge.  You're always ready, but the puzzles always stretch you and I, for one, walked away feeling satisfied with my accomplishments.\n\nThere are only 3 tools, and yet... the ways they're used are magnificent.  You don't have a bag of gimmicky gadgets to fumble through; instead each puzzle uses one, two or three tools in really clever ways, and I often felt brilliant when I completed them.\n\nThe main game can be defeated when you have all three tools... but you don't need all three.  You can also beat the game with any combination of only two tools, which just warps my mind.  The puzzles felt so tight and so tough, and I was amazed to discover I could complete them with even less.  There's also various side dungeons where you can pick up more health, or collect optional cards.  The real reward is the feeling of victory and the wild ego boost that comes with completing them all by yourself, simply for fun.\n\nFor a really steep challenge, there's also an optional master dungeon that requires all three tools and some really clever thinking.  I strongly recommend it.\n\nThe characters and story are adorable and funny.  I liked them.  The animations are excellent, and I loved the look and feel of Ittle's world.  I also liked Ittle herself... she's charming, if devious.  Her little flying helper is also fun.  They do a good job of making fun of their genre, while adding a lot of their own character as well (which is more important than the parody, and done well).\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nA few minor niggles include:\n-A bit of unclarity in hitboxes and figuring out whether an attack will hit.  It's not a huge deal, since combat is secondary to the puzzles and even this issue doesn't make the combat unfun at all.\n-On a couple occasions, the master dungeon pulled some unwarranted tricks, like requiring incredibly fast movement (down to the millisecond) to be in position in time to act or stop a block, which felt like a deviation from the formula that makes the game good (clever puzzle solving, not brutal platforming skill)\n\nBut the major issue?\n\nI was intensely offended by the optional side-boss fight.  Instead of having you employ all the great tricks you've learned just to reach him, he throws ALL of that away... he is instead just a standard run & stab boss battle, and a brutally unfair one at that (I eventually gave up).  Only your sword matters; you will not use the other tools at all (trying will get you killed repeatedly).  The best strategies I've read for beating him were simply to have lots of health and be fast.  It requires incredibly tight controls, which this game doesn't have, so a lot of it is luck and cheesing bugs and quirks in the AI and movement.  This was not a good climax to the otherwise brilliantly designed master dungeon; instead it was a malicious slap in the face, and god it hurt.\n\nIt still leaves me a bit grumpy, even after all these months.  >:(\n\nBut does this ruin the game?  NO!  It felt anti-climactic and I did feel betrayed and put upon by the developers, but the rest of the game is so good, that this just fades into background noise in comparison.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n9/10.  This is a fantastic game.  Yes, I'm still intensely bitter about the optional boss (RAAAAGE!!!!), but that doesn't destroy the pure, unfiltered joy that is the rest of this game.  Everything in the main game and optional dungeons, save for that side boss, is excellent.  I still look back with extreme fondness!  I'm looking forward to playing the free Halloween update soon, which was a really cool thing for them to add.", "timestamp_created": 1413318989, "timestamp_updated": 1413319374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12432194": {"recommendationid": "12432194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098098839", "num_games_owned": 2443, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413132563}, "language": "english", "review": "Ittle Dew overall is a really good game, it is a funny game but it will make you laugh and cry, the first thing that comes to mind is Zelda, but after playing you realize that it has its own soul, it's completely different from Zelda and will joke about it too!\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "timestamp_created": 1412925209, "timestamp_updated": 1432119949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503112", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12429161": {"recommendationid": "12429161", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980090131", "num_games_owned": 1305, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412701605}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is full of cleverly designed puzzles and a great hint system, with very few puzzles feeling like they were unnecessary. The game is a little short, but at this pricepoint it does achieve a respectable 3-4 hours on average the first time, but obviously in less time if you don't do the treasure puzzles. It also has a good amount of replay value. Loads of puzzles can be solved in several ways and there are plenty of shortcuts that require some serious thinking to get through. You can buy the 3 main items in whatever order you want (buying the Ice Wand - the most expensive item - first makes the game significantly harder), you can even reach and beat the last boss without all the items and there are even achievements for doing so; there are 4 separate last boss fights depending on which items you have.\nThen there's also speed-running functionality built into the game. You can apparently finish the game in 15minutes somehow... I could barely do it under an hour when I tried (without memorizing all the puzzles tho).\n\nAnd let's not forget the lovely graphics and funny dialogue. The \"wobble\" graphics are very unique, quite unlike anything I've ever seen. Kind of like a comic-book game in movement? That's probably the best way I can describe it.\n\nThe game does have one pretty poor part though: the combat. It's just clunky and kind of serves more as a way to add variation between puzzles.

I did not expect to like this game all that much; I had picked it up in a bundle this was one of the lesser reasons for me to want to pick up the bundle; at the time. After having played it to completion at least once; I can safely say that it feels like a more puzzily version of an old Legend of Zelda game, which is nice. \n\nPros\n\nThe Art Style - I really enjoyed the art style. It's very comically utitilized throughout the game, and suited the mood perfectly throughout.\n\nThe Difficulty - I felt the difficulty was really well realized. I rarely ran into puzzles or situations that gave me any significant trouble; there were a few times I felt challenged but overall the balance was well realized.\n\nThe Music - I liked the music. It was ominous where necessary, as well as jaunty where needed. Could get rather old if stuck on a puzzle, but otherwise it was utilized effectively.\n\nCons\n\nThe Gameplay - This is more a subjective gripe than anything else; I felt that the gameplay could be rather clunky at times. I think my major issue was more often related to the hit box of the character; there were times, especially when dealing with projectiles, where I would get hit and not feel like it was well represented. It was not common, but happened enough to be annoying. I think the perspective is what complicated it further at times.\n\nThe Puzzles - Once again, subjective gripe. I don't like puzzles. This game has them in spades. They're all right, but some were complicated enough to frustrate me and pull me out of the experience.\n\nThe Price Point - I hate bringing it up, but the \"cost-per-hour\" price point is rather lackluster here. True, you can always replay through the game and try to do so differently than before; but I personally don't have much motivation to do so. That said, if you don't mind the price point, you will be in for a good short experience; unless you're even worse at puzzles than I am, in which case you'll likely get your money's worth.\n\nAt the end of the day I do enjoy this game. It's surprising too given my lack of mirth for puzzle games as a whole, but at the right price point it's a nice experience. I wouldn't recommend this game over many others; but if you find it for cheap enough during a sale I wouldn't recommend against it.

Zelda with puzzle-heavy top-down rooms and palace-like dungeons for each tool you acquire. The tools are very different from what you'll find in Zelda games, though, and there's a lot of focus on having them interact with each other - one puzzle may have you freeze a block to let it slide across that spike wall and then freeze and teleport a bomb so its detonation syncs with you lighting a brazier.\n\nBe aware that it doesn't take long to finish the game, but its replay value is high because the path through the castle is nonlinear, there's a lot of optional treasure/puzzles, and extra-hard shortcuts encourage challenge and speedruns.

Its on here and the Wii U eshop for$9.99. Its hella nice. Yeah go get it. Unless you don't like any of those, then keep moving and ignore this review.\n\nAlright, I'll actually talk about the game. So you're an adventurer named Ittle Dew and her sidekick Tippsie are on a raft when they bump into a rock and crash on the shore of an island. After going through a short tutorial cave, there's a big castle you come across filled with weird inhabitants who wear suits and tend to be wacky. Outside the castle is Itan, who runs a shop. You can find treasure chests in the castle with coins and you use those to go towards getting items from the shop. Well, you pay Itan and he launches you to a dungeon that the item is at (a fire sword in a fire cave/volcano, an ice wand in an ice cave/dungeon, and a portal wand in the woods). Each dungeon contains a shortcut that can help you get to the boss faster (most likely than not you're gonna use these if you're speedrunning but they do help you finish the dungeons faster supposing you can figure out the puzzle for each shortcut). Depending on the combination of the items you collect (you need at least 2 to get through the castle to the final boss), you can take different routes through the castle to get to the end.\n\nAside from the items I previously mentioned, there are also collectible cards you can find in chests throughout the game that have a picture of a character or enemy in the game along with info on them (they go towards an achievement) and you can find scraps of paper in chests as well that go towards increasing your heart count (4 pieces make a new heart a la Legend of Zelda heart containers, this is also for an achievement if you find them all).\n\nThis game will test you and your thinking skills. Sometimes puzzles are simple like press all the switches or kill all the enemies or hit switches. Other times, you might take a while to solve a puzzle only to be stumped by the next one. Two optional bonus dungeons (The Master Cave and, as of October 31, 2013, the Compost Crypt) contain even tougher brain scratchers and while not necessary or important to the plot (I did say optional, after all), you do get an achievement, one per dungeon upon completing them and there's cards in the Master Dungeon so you'd have to complete it if you were gunning for all the cards. Think of them as advanced puzzles, more or less.\n\nLastly, the dialouge is quite humorous. All the characters have a self-aware feel to them when they speak, like they know they're in a video game. There's even call backs/shout outs to older 2D Zelda games like A Link to the Past or Zelda 1. It knows what its doing and you just go with it cause why not. Even the art style is appealing to the eyes.\n\nI've probably harped on long enough but maybe this will convince you to at least check out Ittle Dew. Look, if you like the old school 2D Zelda games or know someone that does, then this game might be for you/them. Hopefully I've said more than enough to peak your interest B^)", "timestamp_created": 1404285744, "timestamp_updated": 1404285744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11013330": {"recommendationid": "11013330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051255745", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469389401}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun for my seven year old daughter and I.

The makers said the game is designed in a way to allow speed running and it shows, with best times going as low as 10 minutes. This allows many modes of play, adding variety to playthroughs. The items you recieve can be gotten in any order, and you don't even need all of them to complete the story, although catching them all surely helps solving some puzzles. The bosses aren't really given much backstory, as any other character really, but this may have been necessary, seeing as having loads of story in a game this short would detract from the gameplay. However, tidbits of information are scattered throughout the game and reading them adds some depth to the world of Ittle Dew. Some of the harder puzzles can be a little tricky to solve since the game doesn't tell you a couple of abilities one of your items has, nothing that a little thinking wouldn't solve, but seeing each new skill having a small tutorial, one could get a slightly confused.

Playing as a blonde in a green tunic with a sword (or stick), stuck on an island with a flying friend and top down gameplay doesn't help make it not look like a Zelda clone. That's the flavor of the game. Is it Zelda? No, but it'll do (Ittle Do). This game is slightly different than a Zelda clone because it is a push block puzzle game with a few enemies and deviations from push block puzzles. \n\nThere are a few items and you start with a stick that you can use to light on fire, then melt ice blocks, set off bombs and so on. Eventually you'll move to a flaming sword to do what a flaming stick can, a magical teleportation wand that allows you to set a block, use the wand and have the enemy or object appear where you set the block. Finally, you'll get an ice wand to freeze enemies, blocks, put out fire and even make walls reflect projectiles like your teleportation staff. You can tell a lot of work went into making the items as not just items to solve puzzles, but combat items as well. You can use the teleporation block to set a block under you, step off and if an enemy is on it, the enemy will fly off screen. You can set a block, push it onto spikes, then use the teleportation wand to teleport the enemy into the block on the spikes, killing them that way. Even though it is disguised as Zelda, I feel like the game could have been made in RPG Maker.\n\nAll of the items and weapons are bound to buttons on the X-Box controller which is nice, you can use everything at once without having to visit a menu. There are no deaths in this game, so much as there are room restarts. When you die, you just reset whatever room you were in with full health. Rooms including sections of the overworld map. There is no consequence, making it a very easy for kids game. Each room has a hint sign or two and if you need even more help, you can hit the left button to have your fluttering fox friend give you a hint. There is even a nice little map too showing you where treasures and doors are (unlocked and locked).\n\nThis is an enjoyable game even if its quick and simple when compared to Zelda. There is a good diverse array of enemies with different ways to take them out. The art style is charming, there is plenty of exploration and a slightly open world go where you want feel. The art style, happy nature, hints and ease of puzzles makes me feel this game is better for kids. Give it a go, its fun for a few brief hours until you complete it in one or two sittings. The game is so brief, there are achievements for beating it under 3 hours and completing it under 15 minutes.\n\nIttle Dew is a good stepping stone for this developer to make a grander Zelda like game.", "timestamp_created": 1402421599, "timestamp_updated": 1402580069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10418658": {"recommendationid": "10418658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067460853", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421309698}, "language": "english", "review": "If you grew up in the 80s or early 90s you probably remember the classic exploring adventure games, such as Zelda.

I started it up expecting to hate it after a few minutes and then just let it idle for the cards, but boy was I wrong. This game is really good. Probably among the most fun puzzle game I've played. Easy 8/10. \n\nSo in this game you play as an adventurer. Not much is known about your character aside from the fact that she's totally a girl. I mean, I didn't pay too much attention to the story, but that's basically all I know about it having completed the game.\n\nYou're off to get 3 magical items to help you solve progressively more complicated puzzles, a fire sword, a portal wand, and a ice wand thing. Different objects on the screen interact differently (or not at all) with each magical item. Conveniently, a local shopkeeper sells them and you're able to purchase them from him. Only, when you do, you're put into a puzzle series cave where you have to show somewhat of a mastery of the item to get out. \n\nSome of the puzzles are really solid, making you somewhat frustrated after not getting them within the first 10 tries. Of course, there's also the others that are super obvious and take maybe 1 attempt, 2 if you pressed the wrong button. Good variety and the later stages of the puzzles make you think with portals. \n\nCombat is pretty dull in the game. Though, admittedly, I totally died to a pancake out of recklessness more than a few times. Valv pls fix. You press x to do the damage, or you can be fancy and try to teleport mobs into spikes or something. \n\nThe controls either weren't given out in the game (I had to press every key on my keyboard to figure out how to use the stick to attack for a while), or I totally didn't pay attention to the tutorial. There is a 2 level tutorial. \n\nOh, I forgot to mention, the puzzles vary between push blocks into pressure plates, clear all enemies on the map, light all the things that need lighting, or burn out all the things that shouldn't be on fire. You might think that's pretty lame and hardly fun, but the quickness of the game definitely makes thing way less awful than they would be. Trust me.\n\nAside from combat, which really isn't even a big deal because the game isn't driven to encourage you to fight everything on the map except in a few area where you need to to open a door, the only real upset with the game is how fast you can complete it. Keep in mind, I had intended to just get all the cards in the game and then back out. I was sucked in and before I knew it, I finished the game. I mean, sure, I didn't 100% it, but I cleared the final boss. I didn't expect to because a certain key item given out at the end led me to believe that there would be some other areas to access, but that wasn't the case. In my first blind run, I finished the game in three and a half hours. I mean, sure, that's actually a pretty reasonable time for a game to take in a campaign mode anyway, but I really really wanted more. I guess that's a good thing, though.\n\nSo after getting here this far, you probably know that I'm going to rate this game pretty highly. I would put Antichamber and Portal above this game in terms of similar games that are more fun, but this game isn't too far behind! Easy eight out of ten. I would only dock points for not doing anything groundbreakingly new (which would push it over the top and is basically a requirement to get a 10. Fuck people who give every game 10s), and being exceptionally short. Though, the latter is likely not an issue because this game can be played on your phone.\n\nOh yes\n\nyou heard me\n\nyou can play it on your phone. \n\nI would encourage anyone with even a mild interest in puzzle games to give this one a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1401847268, "timestamp_updated": 1401847268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10339211": {"recommendationid": "10339211", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989435196", "num_games_owned": 877, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420836240}, "language": "english", "review": "you set things on fire and there are platypi. if this isn't enough for you YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE", "timestamp_created": 1401837493, "timestamp_updated": 1401837493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10337126": {"recommendationid": "10337126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002128350", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402314163}, "language": "french", "review": "Excellent clone de Zelda, avec beaucoup d'humour", "timestamp_created": 1401822952, "timestamp_updated": 1401822952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10334736": {"recommendationid": "10334736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030579904", "num_games_owned": 1434, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401807820}, "language": "german", "review": "Witziges kleines Indie-Game f\u00fcr zwischendurch.\n\nDie R\u00e4tsel sind nicht enorm anspruchsvoll, aber meist gut durchdacht.

The top down adventure makes for some creative puzzle situations and hugely detailed maps. After many years of tinkering with the formula, Nintendo is finally returning to their heritage with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.\n\nWhat are gamers to do in the meantime, though? If one is not a fan of the 3D games or the DS titles, what kind of game will fill the void? Enter Ittle Dew, a top down adventure game from indie dev Ludosity. What the game lacks in innovative puzzle and world design, it more than makes up for with charm and game feel.\n\nThe plotline for Ittle Dew is incredibly simple. Your character washes up on the shore of an island and wants to get off. The caretaker of a shop will build you a raft as long as you go through some dungeons he has set up. You also need to pay him for the items he sells, so there is a main hub dungeon that will let you accrue some cash.\n\nThis is probably the weakest element of the game. While the original Zelda game did not really possess a story of any kind, forgoing a narrative in today\u2019s age is a curious decision. One can personally believe that gameplay speaks above all else, but without a strong desire to continue, some gamers may not even be bother to check Ittle Dew out.\n\nThankfully, the puzzle designs in Ittle Dew are fairly strong. Stripping down the Zelda formula to its basics, Ittle Dew gives players very limited commands to deal with. Controls are essentially walking with the joystick, the four face buttons used for specific items and two shoulders buttons for a map and hint screen.\n\nThe hint screen is very nicely done, too. Instead of spelling out solutions or talking in cryptic riddles, the game uses the humorous character of Tippsie to lightly insult the player while giving some key hints. Things like, \u201cYou\u2019ll only need your fire sword for this room,\u201d are better tests of skill than detailing exactly where to swing your item.\n\nThe specific items collected are a teleport rod, a fire sword and an ice rod. In an interesting twist, there is no proper order of progression in the game. The best aspect of is how non-linear the design is. Upon completing the journey, I was under the belief that any player would have to acquire all three of the weapons to finish their quest. That actually isn\u2019t the case. Some of the dungeons even have shortcuts direct to the boss rooms.\n\nAlong with shortcuts and paths for skipping items, the game also has hidden dungeons for collecting extra health and cards. The cards don\u2019t really offer any purpose to the game, but their rooms have some insidiously obtuse puzzle designs. I was stumped in one room for a solid 20 minutes before stumbling upon the answer.\n\nWhen you are transported to any dungeon for a specific item, you only need your wits to get through. No puzzles require another objects or skills you do not possess. This alleviates a lot of frustration from the proceedings.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much in the way of challenge, however. If you die, the game simply restarts you in the exact same room with full health. Other than how the sword\u2019s arc doesn\u2019t fully surround your character, the only time one will get annoyed is when they cannot solve a puzzle quickly.\n\nA good mention must go to the writing behind Ittle Dew. Everything is very self-referential and parody laden. Genre tropes like collecting hearts and destroying pots all make some kind of appearance. Even the nonsensical nature of enemy placement gets mentioned for being so pointless.\n\nYour main character revels in eating hearts and even wishes to just smack things around. The bosses utter some ridiculously incomprehensible catch phrases and then admit to not even knowing what they were talking about. One cannot help but crack a smile while playing.\n\nEven the ending is funny. While a rather obvious plot twist occurs, when the final battle comes to a close, the game pokes fun at how most final bosses just kind of give up or don\u2019t take a more obvious approach.\n\nSadly, while Ittle Dew might be great at questioning why adventure games follow specific mechanics, the game really does nothing to spice them up. One shouldn\u2019t be displeased with a fairly high quality Zelda-\nlike game, but a lack of innovation really does hurt the final product.\n\nThere are some texture designs on the world map that are misleading, as well. For the most part, you cannot walk behind any of the trees in the game. Some of the hidden dungeons are behind them, though. Enemies also disappear behind the trees and are completely invisible to the player.\n\nFor that matter, the world map doesn\u2019t really serve any purpose other than to move you from point A to point B. Hiding extraneous items behind puzzles is a great incentive for replay value, but giving players some other reason to explore would go a long way to creating a believable world.\n\nThere is a bonus dungeon hidden in the fields. This acts as the penultimate test of your skills, requiring every item in the game to fully complete. There are 12 rooms and each one gets progressively more challenging in skill. This serves as a nice little bonus to an otherwise very short game.\n\nTo sum everything up, while Ittle Dew might not be the second coming of adventure gaming or a masterpiece of epic proportions, the game provides plenty of wit and humor along with some decently mind bending puzzles. The game also controls nicely.\n\nFor $14, one could do much worse. Ludosity certainly does not get points for creativity, but their craftsmanship is noble. This game may not be Zelda, but Ittle Dew.

I liked it, it was somewhat enjoyable for me, especially during the dialogue sections, they were funny and very well written.\n\nAn equally significant aspect of the game was its art style, It was a pleasure looking at the vibrant art during my playthrough which made this game one of the best presented block puzzle game ever.\n\nDespite the great art style and clever writing, this game did had some problems, for ex. its length, I was able to beat this game in less than 4 hours, I know it might turn some people off but I have realized that in some cases this is not a disadvantage but in this case, well, it was but one of the recent examples where the short game can be successful is the game called Gone Home made by The Fullbright Company which could be completed in 2 hours but Gone Home is a completely different game and again in Ittle Dew, It just wasn\u2019t enough, to be honest I wanted more.\n\nIn the end, Ittle Dew is an adorable block puzzle game, with a decent gameplay and a crafty writing. For this price, you won\u2019t be disappointed, just don\u2019t expect it to be a Zelda clone because it pretty much makes fun of this game which sometimes can be very entertaining.", "timestamp_created": 1394426186, "timestamp_updated": 1394426186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9337591": {"recommendationid": "9337591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042324050", "num_games_owned": 745, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1381026917}, "language": "english", "review": "It'll do.", "timestamp_created": 1393904425, "timestamp_updated": 1393904425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 51, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581278", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9326941": {"recommendationid": "9326941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010201020", "num_games_owned": 1063, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393206723}, "language": "english", "review": "Ittle Dew is an action-adventure game heavily inspired by the Zelda games with heavy emphasis on replayability and speed-running. Mechanically, Ittle Dew works just about as well as you'd expect. You can walk around, hit enemies, but the real fun comes from the various puzzles. Like a Zelda game, Ittle Dew has an assortment of items that you'll utilize to solve puzzles. However, unlike a Zelda game, where you'll usually find yourself with 7-8 unique items, Ittle Dew only has. This isn't a major issue, for two reasons. Ittle Dew is a shorter game than Zelda games, and two the way that item's works together creates a large amount of replayabilty, due the game's design allowing for puzzles to be solved in multiple different ways. Ittle Dew's three items are a fire sword, which should be fairly self-explanatory, you hit things and light them on fire, a Portal Wand, which allows you to create blocks and teleport objects around and a Ice Wand which allows you to freeze objects. A large portion of the games puzzles are solvable in multiple different ways using any number of the game's items. Even beating the game only requires 2/3 of the items, this encourages exploration in the game world and experimentation with the game's mechanics as you figure out how to get to the end with a limited toolset, and I found doing so to be very compelling. There is also a fair amount of optional content, from hidden collectibles that require optional puzzles to be found, to a couple of optional dungeons. Competetive players will also enjoy trying to figure out optimal routes through the game in order to beat the game quickly.\nWhile I can prise Ittle Dew puzzle solving mechanics and overall design, it's not a perfect game. There's some combat throughout Ittle Dew, and frankly it's not very fun. More often than not, I found that having to kill the enemies in a room detracted from the fun puzzles that I should be solving in the room. There's also bosses, but they're mostly one-trick ponies. You'll figure out how to defeat them quite quickly, and they rarely pose a threat. The combat is a minor part of the game, but I can't help but think it could of been more deeply intergrated into the best parts of the game, the puzzle solving.", "timestamp_created": 1393823112, "timestamp_updated": 1393823112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9317079": {"recommendationid": "9317079", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978442541", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394135168}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, clever puzzles, charming world, and entertaining dialogue to guide you through it all.\n\nThe is also a large amount of optional extra challenges to pick from if you completed the game normally and want more.\n\nYou like puzzle games?

The puzzels start off really easy but they are nearly impossible at the end (for me). You start off with just a stick and get more weapons/magick as for progres. A few times you lose all your stuff just to get you to use the new weapon/magick. This might seem annoying but you get it back soon enough. I like the fact that the world is pretty much open. Once you encounter a puzzle you can't figur out, you just continue somewhere else. Then you get a new item and suddenly the puzzle makes sense. The little jokes in between are funny, and the storyline is ok. The only negative about this game are the little graphical and audio problems. In the little rooms where the crazy old man was tied up, the foor was just black. I think the texture tiles were missing. And some tiles didn't fit perfectly, leaving a small green line at the side. And I didn't have any sound. I played this on Linux, so I might miss some dependencies.

What sets Ittle Dew apart from Nintendo's classic franchise are a willingness to make fun of itself and extremely streamlined gameplay. It's so streamlined, in fact, that you can easily beat the game in only a handful of hours. There is a deck of character cards scattered throughout the world that could potentially extend your play time, but they aren't very rewarding to collect. Plus if you wait until you are fully equipped, many of these optional puzzles are easier than they were intended to be. Speaking of equipment, Ittle Dew's arsenal would leave Link green with envy. The portal wand especially introduces some very unique puzzles that elevate the game above standard-fare LoZ block pushing and flip switching.

type game. You go through dungeons mostly solving puzzles, but there is a combat element to the game also. The combat is pretty basic, but you can freeze and teleport enemies in addition to slashing them with your sword. The puzzles are nicely balanced. Nothing was too hard to feel like giving up on and nothing was too easy to get bored on. The only thing I didn't like was the optional Master Cave dungeon. You basically needed a walkthrough to get through most of these. The solution to a lot of the puzzles require doing things that you never did during the main game, but are expected to know about somehow in this dungeon. A few of the puzzles also require fast reflexes instead of just puzzle solving like the rest of the game. It just all felt out of place to me. Overall though, the game was very enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone that likes the puzzle solving in something like The Legend of Zelda games.

The rest of the game on the other hand, was almost made up entirely of puzzles revolving around 3 items. A flaming sword, an ice wand, and a teleportation wand. The items can actually be aquired in any order if you know what you are doing, but it does a decent job of explaining each individually. By the end of the game, you have to use all of these items in conjuction with eachother. You can drop a teleportation block, freeze it, kick it across a spike pit, and then freeze the wall to shoot a teleportation beam that bounces back and hits yourself, sending you to where the frozen block landed. Now that probably sounds really complicated, but the way you are gradually led into single items and then combinations of two or all 3, you really get the hang of it by the end.\n\nAll of the rooms reset every time you go in except doors that have unlocked, so this cancels any possibility of brining things between the rooms, which makes it easier to work out the puzzles. The levels are very well designed. I felt that it was always introducing new mechanics, concepts, and ways to use the items together. I actually never had a single instance where I got stuck to where I couldn't get out of a certain spot. Although if that were to happen, there is a reset room in the pause menu. There are no consumable items of any kind, not even potions. I feel as if carryable items aside from the sword and two wands would complicate the puzzles and the game, so it is great that they aren't there. The checkpoint system is great in my opinion. If you die, you come back in just as you entered the room, with no penalties of any kind. It's really not an RPG, its more of a sliding block and combat puzzle adventure, it is only really styled after Zelda visually and thematically.\n\nI encountered only a single glitch, and it was in the final boss stage. An enemy froze in its dying animation and stayed in place for a minute or so.\n\nOverall I think this is a quirky, enjoyable, and decently challenging puzzle game, with tons of references to zelda, and a cute/unique art style. The game felt a little unfinished in a few areas. There didn't seem to be any music at all while the conversation with the final boss was going on, and it just wasn't as fleshed out as it could have been. It's not a must-play title by any means, but it will challenge you and give you a few good laughs. The puzzles can seem daunting or even impossible at times, but I urge you to keep at it. A bit of trial and error, and you'll figure them out. If you aren't willing to take a minute and think about things, you might not have such a great time...", "timestamp_created": 1386311082, "timestamp_updated": 1386311387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7930107": {"recommendationid": "7930107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998925028", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386160646}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet.

franchise. Ittle Dew features an amazing amount of well thought and tricky puzzles. A huge amount of time and love went into crafting and polishing this game.\n\nSide note: Ittle Dew was actually submitted as an idea to Nintendo as a Zelda spinoff, but they turned it down. Which is really too bad for them as this would have fit in with any of the Wind Waker style of Zelda games.\n\nProbably for the best really, a lot of the charm of Ittle Dew comes from the aesthetic as a Zelda parody, from poking fun at the goofy statues to the over the top silly monsters.\n\nReally, the only thing I'd want out of Ittle Dew is a little more content, your first playthrough will top out at 90 to 150 minutes of play. However, there are multiple ways to finish the game, which can lead to a lot of replay value.\n\nBut that said, Ittle Dew is very much worth your time and money if you are a fan of puzzle games.\n\nThanks.", "timestamp_created": 1385964437, "timestamp_updated": 1385964437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669620", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7872418": {"recommendationid": "7872418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073972814", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394905169}, "language": "english", "review": "Short game but worth playing.

Your goal is to explore the castle and use the riches you find to enter other dungeons and find tools that help you progress farther in the castle.\n\nThis game has two key strengths. The first is that the items are very interesting, and they each combine in interesting ways. The second is that this game has amazing replay value. You get three items, and you can use all three to win, but you only need two. For a challenge, try beating the game with each combination of two weapons. This game is also built for speed-running, and it will take a lot of planning to figure out how to get the speed run achievements.\n\nI'd say this game's main weakness is the bosses. It's a big difficulty spike, and the method for defeating them is never straightforward. The hints help a lot, but the battles can still be tough even when you know what to do. That leads to the other weakness: the controls. They're not terrible, and you'll get used to them as you play, but there were too many times when I died in combat because I wasn't moving the way I wanted to, and many enemies aren't knocked back when hit.\n\nA few other things to mention: the puzzles can get pretty tough, the death penalty is that you have to restart the room at full health (which isn't even a penalty most of the time), and the game has little story, but the humor was a lot better than I had expected from the previews. Also, the first playthrough will last around 3-5 hours.\n\nSo, despite this game's rather stupid name, I enjoyed it, and I'd say it's worth picking up if you enjoy Zelda-style games (try out the 2D Zeldas first if you're not familiar with them).

You'll spend nearly your entire stay on the island pushing, freezing, and teleporting blocks and enemies around, flipping switches and ultimately opening a ton of chests and doors on your quest for treasure. As the sole focus of the adventure the quality of the puzzles is paramount, and fortunately they happen to be supremely well designed and satisfying to solve, rarely crossing the line into overly hard nor easy. They provide an entertaining challenge as well as a bit of replayability with several different paths available for completing the game, something that's rarely seen in this genre.\n\nAll of this combined with the clever boss fights, tongue in cheek humor, and outstanding presentation add up to a very short but (technical hiccups aside) immensely enjoyable game from start to finish.

It took me less than 3 hours to finish it and get a majority of cards and other things, and I\u2019ve spent over an hour after that finishing the collection. Haven\u2019t decided if I should take the rest of the achievements yet or not, could be a fun challenge though. All in all I\u2019ve spent about 5 hours on it and there\u2019s still things for me to do, but mostly in the interest of completing the game without all weapons unlocked or speedrunning.\n\nI have to say that its quite funny written, the characters and how they behave make fun of retro concepts, like eating hearts that fall on the ground. It doesn\u2019t take itself very serious, which fits nicely into everything else.\n\nSo, gameplay! You solve puzzles by either hitting things, putting things on plates or killing things. Basically, if you have no items, you are limited to pushing blocks and finding fireplaces to light your stick on fire. But if you have a firesword you don\u2019t need to find fireplaces, and if you have the icestaff and the firesword you can freeze blocks and then shatter them with your firesword. If you have the portal wand, you can solve even more puzzles, etc. Not only that, you can combine most of the tools in very, very interesting ways that wasn\u2019t expected at all by me.\n\nThis works very well and the puzzles range from crazy obvious to \"bweh?\u201d making you feel very stupid when you don\u2019t get them, and extremely clever when you finally do. In many cases you can leave it for later.\n\nEvery dungeon have a boss and they are ok most of the time. Personally I really disliked the last boss and the boss in the master dungeon (which were the only place where I eventually looked for help in solving the rooms). The last boss being annoying and the master dungeon boss being both hard and showing a lot of gameplay fallacies I dislike in 2D top-down games. Still the game is about solving puzzles first and the bosses come as a break that can be quite welcome.\n\nIt\u2019s super pretty and animated in a way that completely fits the style. It very simply borrows a lot from Zelda games in how the graphics look, but have its own way of drawing it, which makes it more of a homage.\n\nAnyway, if you like puzzle games and solving rooms zelda-style, get it!\nIf you want something more action-heavy, then you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nHave a good day! :)", "timestamp_created": 1375742837, "timestamp_updated": 1385415410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "396229": {"recommendationid": "396229", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970342369", "num_games_owned": 612, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1376016827}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming, cute, and funny Zelda-ish game that is *heavy* on the puzzles, and multiple ways to progress depending on how good you are at them.

I really don't. It is not something I am proud though. But in this case there is a burning sensation in me to write something about how a brilliant game has the weirdest reward system I've ever seen.\n\nBefore I start, I want to say the classical tone, music, visuals, smoothness are really great and the story is ok. I am looking forward to buy Shadowhand when its hype gets a little lower as I don't like paying that much to casual games.\n\nOk. Pardon my english. Here I go:\n\n1. You can finish the game by pressing next card and doing nothing else.\nNow this is insane. As the developers thought casual players get frustrated and downvote a game when they couldn't beat a level in a very short time (which I think is not true) they made Normal mode with every goal as optional. I am not a fan of Hard Difficulty levels but in this game I had to choose it. Otherwise you can just pass every goal and there is no indication on the map that a level's goals are passed. \n\n2. You can change difficulty during game.\nYou can start with playing Hard, got stuck in a level, change the difficulty to Normal, skip the level and go back to Hard. I really don't get it. This game is the only instance in a video game that I see is difficulty level is about fundamentals of reward system which I think is a pillar of gaming. It really should be about more jokers, less locks and it definitely should be unchangable after a new game started, so that you can know which difficulty you finished a game on. \n\n3. Some goals are really confusing.\nI hated the level sets with goals of money. There is absolutely no way you can know how much you can gain in the next levels in a given set. So you can't plan, you can't save your jokers, you just don't know what will happen. \n\n4. When you press \"quit hand\" and come back, there is a surprise.\nWhen you do this all the skill bars and jokers you get in that unfinished level come with you. Which mean you can quit and come back many times to make a full set of jokers to make it a perfect level \n\n5. The multipliers and perfect hand rewards are ridiculous.\nEven if you make like a 20 combo you will get a multiplier of 2.2 - 2.7 which also doesn't multiply the perfect or good hand bonus of 250/500. So you can only multiply your money in a given hand which is 90-100 tops. You start a hand with 1.2 bonus with powerups. So 80x1.2=96, 80x2.5=200. You can see when you make a big combo there is only a difference of 100 gold when the money goals are usually 5000. Which means the only reason you might want a big combo is because it is in the goals. \n\nAlso I like to add, when you need to make a big combo as most of the cards are upside down usually, you wouldn't know if starting using your jokers and skills is a good idea. Sometimes you finish a full set of jokers and couldn't make a 2.2.. It is just luck and I can understand that. But again maybe NOT setting goals of combos will help and the luck factor will still stay but with less frustration.\n\nOne last thing: I really wished the goals are level spesific and not for the whole chapter. That is also insane. When a chapter asks you to make 7 perfect hands, or a given amount of money, you really don't know when to start doing that or when to go relaxed for a hand. You can finish your goals in the first 6-7 hands and sit through 3-4 which is not so good. Also you can start relaxed and get really panicked in the last two. \n\nDevelopers, well done. But seriously you should study game concepts. I hope in Shadowhand it is better. I will see. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515764529, "timestamp_updated": 1515764529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39238353": {"recommendationid": "39238353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028137544", "num_games_owned": 4650, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "last_played": 1515608218}, "language": "polish", "review": "Regency Solitaire - ah pasjansik, kocham pasjanse a ten tutaj jest wyj\u0105tkowo udany i jeden z lepszych w jakie gra\u0142em na stimie, ma te wszystkie klasyczne mechanizmy stimowych pasjans\u00f3w a zarazem nie jest hardcorowo trudny jest raczej easy-medium przez co mo\u017cna si\u0119 przy nim zrelaksowa\u0107 a nie kln\u0105\u0107 pod nosem \u017ce p\u00f3\u0142 godziny post\u0119pu posz\u0142o na marne jak to ma miejsce w innych tego typu grach na stimku.\nCa\u0142o\u015b\u0107 zaj\u0119\u0142a mi oko\u0142o 8 godzin, jedynie ostatnie dwa acziwki za tryb \"hardcore\" i uzbieranie combo 35card wymaga\u0142y sztucznego mini-grindu joker\u00f3w ale to chwila moment i og\u00f3lnie wszystkie acziwki wbijaj\u0105 si\u0119 wraz z post\u0119pami w grze.\nJak kto\u015b ma chrapke na \u0142atwe 100% to polecam.", "timestamp_created": 1515611090, "timestamp_updated": 1515611090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39137965": {"recommendationid": "39137965", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973084271", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 476, "last_played": 1516396054}, "language": "english", "review": "The first non-Windows solitaire I played and enjoyed (outside of everything put out by Tinytouchtales, but those are more solitaire-style than actual solitaire) was SOLITAIRICA.

background to what is basically what the second part of the title says, solitaire. There are different layouts to the card placement which spices up variety and you gain access to various special abilities that allow you to do things such as randomly rearrange the stacks on the table, choose cards to discard from from the tops of face up piles, randomly remove a few cards etc. Getting consectutive matches without having to draw from the drawpile increase your combo counter, giving you bonue points depending on how long a run you can achieve. Wild cards can be picked up as you play either featuring a number or face value or a joker. You can play these at any time in order to keep a run going or get you out of a tricky spot. Each level also has various challenges guidlines you have to meet over the course of the 10 hands that compose each level. As the game goes on other twists will be thrown in, such as padlocks which lock down a pile until you can uncover the key to open it. At the end of each hand you are given a number of stars and a cash reward depending on how well you did that hand combo wise and whether you cleared the table. \n\nAt the end of each level a story scene will play out and you can then spend your earned cash on upgrades for your ball room at home. Each upgrade increases the splendour of the ball room, but also adds to the power of your special abilities, making them recharge quicker or making them more effective when you use them.\n\nSound and music are quite pleasant.  The story cribs heavilly from Pride and Prejudice so don't expect too many surpises that way but it's still an ok distraction and the solitaire itself is fun enough that the story and presentation are just a pleasant icing on top of what is a solid solitaire game.\n\nThis is good casual fun and one of those good coffee break games. Playing a hand is only short so it's a nice way to unwind but also enganging enough if you want a distraction for an hour or two.\n\nOverall, pleasant.\n\n7 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1506137664, "timestamp_updated": 1506137901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34920666": {"recommendationid": "34920666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017350811", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505312068}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra na pierwszy rzut oka mnie zniech\u0119ci\u0142a do siebie, ale jak w\u0142\u0105czy\u0142em j\u0105 od czasu do czasu i przeszed\u0142em j\u0105 po jednym poziomie na raz to musz\u0119 przyzna\u0107 \u017ce nawet mi si\u0119 podoba\u0142a.

Puis dans un coin \u00e0 part, on remonte ensuite les cartes par ordre croissant et par enseigne \u00e0 partir des As.\n\nRegency Solitaire fonctionne diff\u00e9remment.\n\n\u27a4 Ici, on d\u00e9gage les cartes d\u00e9finitivement \u00e0 chaque correspondance valide : on oublie donc la s\u00e9quence de \"tri\" finale \u00e0 partir des As. Le but restant d'\u00e9vacuer toutes les cartes du tableau.\n\u27a4 Pour ce faire, le jeu autorise de descendre [u]ou remonter[/u] sur une carte, [u]sans tenir compte de son enseigne ni m\u00eame de sa couleur[/u]. [i](Sur un 5 rouge, on pourra donc placer un 4 noir comme un 6 rouge par exemple...)[/i]\n\u27a4 Les cartes sont dispos\u00e9es, empil\u00e9es, et donc \"bloqu\u00e9es\" les unes sous les autres de fa\u00e7ons vari\u00e9es et plus ou moins alambiqu\u00e9es selon les niveaux. De plus certaines sont retourn\u00e9es \"face visible\", afin d'\u00e9ventuellement int\u00e9grer un zeste de strat\u00e9gie dans les \u00e9ventuels \"combos\" que vous \u00e9chafauderez lors de vos suites de d\u00e9blocages de cartes.\nCar Regency Solitaire est bien un jeu \u00e0 combos, o\u00f9 pass\u00e9 5 cartes sans piocher dans le talon, un multiplicateurs de score augmentera en fonction de votre cha\u00eene de cartes d\u00e9truites.\n\u27a4 Contrairement au solitaire basique o\u00f9 on retourne ind\u00e9finiment le talon lorsqu'on finit par en voir le bout, Regeny Solitaire ne propose [u]qu'un seul[/u] \u00e9grainage du talon, et vous indique son nombre de cartes restantes. Quand elles sont \u00e9puis\u00e9es la manche est termin\u00e9e, et le jeu attribuera votre score et vos \u00e9toiles en fonction des cartes que vous avez (ou n'avez pas) supprim\u00e9es:\n\n\u2718 Aucune \u00e9toile gagn\u00e9e au del\u00e0 de 2 cartes restantes\n\u2605 2 cartes restantes \"Good\"\n\u2605\u2605 1 carte restante \"Great\"\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 0 carte restante \"Perfect\"\n\n\u27a4 Au del\u00e0 de ces qualit\u00e9s de r\u00e9ussites motivantes, chaque partie vous rapportera de l'argent, qui permettra d'acheter les divers objets apparemment n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019ascension sociale de \"Bella\". (Le sc\u00e9nario d'une niaiserie \u00e9difiante ravira \u00e9ventuellement les fillettes en plein trip \"bal\" et \"prince charmant\" - pour les autres, un bouton \"Skip Story\" permet heureusement de couper court \u00e0 cette intrigue particuli\u00e8rement navrante - mais qui fait l'effort d'exister dirons-nous.)\n\u27a4 Chacun des 20 niveaux propose un joli d\u00e9cor diff\u00e9rent, ainsi que des \"objectifs\", comme par exemple gagner un certain nombre d'\u00e9toiles, trouver un objet cach\u00e9 sous des groupes de cartes, gagner une certaine somme d'argent, etc... (sachant que chacun de ces niveau demandera de disputer plusieurs parties : \u00e0 parir du niveau 4 on en joue 10 d'affil\u00e9e).\n\u27a4 Des cam\u00e9es de \"pouvoirs\" \u00e0 cooldown apparaissent au fil du jeu, permettant par exemple de d\u00e9truire une carte, ou de m\u00e9langer le jeu pour \u00e9ventuellement obtenir de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s de combinaisons. Les objets achet\u00e9s ont \u00e9galement divers effets concrets sur le jeu (r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les cartes sp\u00e9ciales avec le curseur, augmenter l'efficacit\u00e9 d'un cam\u00e9e, r\u00e9duire les prix, etc)\n\u27a4 Le jeu contient des cartes sp\u00e9ciales, comme les cartes \"serrures\", qui bien sur, ne s'ouvrent qu'avec les cartes \"cl\u00e9\". Des cartes \"jumel\u00e9es\" qu'il faudra toucher deux fois pour qu'elles disparaissent... Mais on trouve \u00e9galement des cartes bonus, conservables dans l'\u00e9ventail pour les jouer n'importe quand. [i](Des jokers, mais aussi des cartes de \"d\u00e9pannage\", (genre un 5 , jouable quand bon nous semble, mais SANS briser la pr\u00e9cieuse cha\u00eene de combo).[/i]\n\nConcernant les \u00e9ventuels reproches que je pourrais lui adresser (en dehors du sc\u00e9nar tout cucul dont j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9), je dirai que le menu d'option est particuli\u00e8rement rachitique, au point de ne m\u00eame pas proposer de choix de r\u00e9solution. On se retrouve d'ailleurs avec du 4:3 m\u00eame sur un \u00e9cran 16:9 avec deux bandes noires.\nLe n\u0153ud de dentelle mauve sur les cartes \"jumel\u00e9es\" est un peu trop discret : rageant de foirer une chaine de combo \u00e0 cause de \u00e7a!\nEnfin, les textes sont uniquement en anglais, mais difficile de lui reprocher \u00e7a, vu que \u00e7a ne nuit heureusement pas \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension tr\u00e8s intuitive des principes de jeux.\n\nBref, au del\u00e0 de simplement proposer un tr\u00e8s bel habillage visuel et sonore, Regency Solitaire insuffle quelques nouveaut\u00e9s amusantes et bienvenues au jeu initial, lui donnant un petit c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"arcade\" (un peu dans la m\u00eame ambiance que les \"Montezuma\" ou les jeux \"King\") carr\u00e9ment attrayant et addictif !\nSi l'interface a clairement des relents de tablette, elle est franchement fonctionnelle et agr\u00e9able \u00e0 parcourir. Le jeu est hyper relaxant, les parties s\u2019encha\u00eenent vite, et les nouvelles r\u00e8gles s'harmonisent tr\u00e8s bien.\nTout comme le syst\u00e8me de bonus et de \"cam\u00e9es de pouvoirs\", suffisamment bien foutus pour \u00eatre puissants, mais sans non plus d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibrer tout le jeu. De plus, le contenu est assez cons\u00e9quent: en venir \u00e0 bout prendra entre 12 et 15h ( si vous voulez du \"perfect\" partout + tous les succ\u00e8s).\n\nPersonnellement, je trouve que \u00e7a peut valoir le coup d'y mettre 4 ou 5\u20ac si votre solitaire windows vous semble un peu trop d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 et aust\u00e8re, mais de l\u00e0 \u00e0 y mettre 10 balles, \u00e7a me parait quand m\u00eame sur\u00e9valu\u00e9...\nC'est clairement un gentil petit jeu apaisant et distrayant, mais qu'il me semble nettement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de choper bien sold\u00e9 ou en bundle.

However it is nothing like spider or klondike (typically found in Windows, Gnome, KDE).\n\nThe game has a story. It's about a girl from the regency era that wants to be in high class parties and meet a suitable husband. Her family was rich but her brother inherited all the good and blew it up, so it's up to you to restore the prestige of the family and get the most handsome guy in town.\n\nThe game is basically a very simple solitaire. It's so simple that basically my strategy is clicking all cards until the level is over. Sometimes I win, others I do not. Either way it is easy to get a perfect score for every level by retrying enough. I'm sure there's a strategy to this game but honestly I don't even think, I just click every card because it's easier. It's a game with no real objective, you never really lose. Eventually you get powers that let your level finish faster. My strategy is to stock all those powers to finish the most difficult levels. The graphics are smooth and the music is okay but can get annoying. You can buy things to keep you stuck to the game. It's a nice addition.\n\nThe thing is I don't really know who the game is for.

The scenery, themes, characters and dialog feel like they're straight out of Pride & Prejudice or Mansfield Park, down to the use of the word \"beau\" (for a good looking bachelor).\n\nI hadn't played solitaire before, but it's easy to pick up with this game and there's some tricks which you can unlock such as being able to take away the top card of a stack taking a peek at what's below the top card of your deck. The animations, backgrounds and portraits are done well. Can't say much about the music because I mostly listened to my own during my playthrough but the little I heard sounded very fitting.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game is that each stage simply takes too long. Playing 5 instead of 10 rounds at each stage would have kept the experience less monotonous. The objectives don't really help here since they are mostly stuff that you'll be doing anyways and complement each other. I had also purchased all the upgrades and was floating lots of gold near the end. As you can see I spend around 9 hours completing the story line, but doing so in 4 would have felt less tiring.\n\nMy other complaint is that the story is too much straight forward in the sense that there isn't really any internal struggle for any of the characters. Bella's (main character) friends and relatives even encourage her to engage with the right guy. I disliked the puny and descriptive names like \"Mr Bleakly\". The idea of gathering accessoires to furnish up your room fits very well thematically though.\n\nFortunately the game doesn't fall into the trap of having the story make up all kind of excuses to play solitaire. It would have been really lame if every other scenario was along the lines of \"Fine, you'll get to have your ball on our premises, *but only if you can handle 5 perfect rounds of solitaire\". Instead the devs wisely decided to separate gameplay and story in this point.\n\nAll in all a pleasant experience. As long as you know what you're going into you should be fine. If you've never read Jane Austen than all the references will be mostly lost on you.

Then again, this title is far more than a simple solitaire game with a Regency Era (1795 \u2013 1837) skin placed over it. Regency Solitaire is here to tell a story, one which isn\u2019t half bad if you\u2019re into Jane Austen\u2019s style of writing (also known as \u201cnovels of manners\u201d). Before I delve deeper into the card gameplay itself, I would like to point out that the beautifully drawn locations and characters would have surely benefited from some level of voice acting, which sadly isn\u2019t present. That is the game\u2019s sole con, as the rest of it is most pleasing given the small file-size. I admit that I seldom play cards and even less frequent have been my incursions into solitaire. I have to say, the game is wrongfully perceived by some as the bureaucratic time waster of choice. Regency Solitaire convinced me that there\u2019s more to this card game than meets the eye.

It is a relaxing little card-game which actually bothered to tell a story, looks good enough and has a great soundtrack. Sadly, it relies way too much on RNG and the gameplay itself is far too simplicistic too enjoy.[/i]\n\nWhen you load up Regency Soiltaire for the first time, you will be almost overwhelmed by all the kitsch that literally slaps you in the face. It's not bad, however; it grows on you in a weird way and after the first few levels you won't mind the shamelessly ridiculous baroque atmosphere anymore. It's similar with the story - god, it's so simple, conciously archetypical and still you can't help to feel a weird sympathy for what's unfolding on your screen. You probably need to like the trashy kitsch-atmosphere or really love baroque, or you won't feel the same. Maybe it's just Stockholm Syndrome. All in all, it's not too bad and everyone purchasing this should already know what to expect after taking a short glance at the storefront.\n\nDon't get fooled by the name - Regency Solitaire is not really Solitaire how you know it from your Windows-installations or Linux-repositories. There is no stacking of cards. Instead, you take cards from into your hand by clicking on it, but only if the card is exactly one value higheror lower than the current card on top of your hand. If there is no such card on the field, you draw one from a stack of cards. The game ends once the field or the stack is empty, the former is preferred. There a three abilities with a recharge and some special types of cards which bring a little bit of variety. Between sessions you spend the money you have earned while playing cards for powerups. \n\nAll of this is really relaxing, because you just click, and click and click without having much to worry about. Most of the time the next step to take is absolutely clear, it is very rare that you have actually a hard time deciding between two options. That is my main gripe with the game: You have almost no influence over what outcome the round will have. As I have said, you almost never have a real choice. If you win or not, is mostly a question of what cards are in your stack and on the field. There are games in which it is almost impossible to win, then you hit the retry-button and make it in two minutes. Three powerups bring a little bit of spice in the game, but they reload so slow that you can use them only once per round anyway, so they don't matter too much. In the end, it's just a game against your own time, when you hit the retry-button for so long until you got a good result. [b]If I am missing some tactical depth here, let me know! I'd love to give it another try.[/b]\n\n[i]tl;dr: Music is good, art is okay, plot and atmosphere are charming in a trashy way, but the gameplay is simple and relies so hard on sheer luck that I can not recommend it, especially for 10 bucks.[/i]\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472651288, "timestamp_updated": 1472651288, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548928", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25261696": {"recommendationid": "25261696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009394778", "num_games_owned": 608, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473382432}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo divertido e viciante.

Until I got that combo, the chapter was a mess of grinding wild cards (power ups that spawn randomly), resetting, and near-misses. It's for this reason alone that I didn't recommend the game at first.\n\nIf you do decide to get this game and decide to play it on hard, wait until the last hand to get the combo in chapter 10.

After Faerie Solitaire and Chef Solitaire, this is the third game I'm playing that bears the name 'Solitaire' and is actually a variation on Pyramid Solitaire with power-ups. I don't know which came first (probably yet another game?), and in casual games it's common to re-use proven techniques, but I'm still not comfortable with that. Okay, it's a 'husband & wife game', even though they credit a ton of Russian artists for the (admittedly beautiful) graphics, so I won't complain too much. At least the game has the decency to be twice shorter than the excrutiating Chef Solitaire.\n\nIt doesn't have voice acting though, which would have been nice, if only to make the story slightly more interesting. I'm very much full of love for Jane Austen's novels (okay, a couple movie/TV adaptations of Sense & Sensibility and Persuasion, and I've also watched Austenland... Does that count?), but I couldn't help but roll my eyes with all the clich\u00e9s I found in the script. Well, at least it's not about a reality-TV-cook-show, which is always a plus.\n\nI didn't care much for the music either. Repetitive, uninspired, only one level (halfway through the game) has a seemingly original track that's more pleasing to the ears. The graphics, as I said, are beautiful. The heroine reminds me of an ex, I don't know if that was a plus or a minus for me, but I'm not going to take that into account for my recommendation. (Yes, I'm a serious man with a serious recommendation system. That probably explains why I have so few friends.)\n\nWhat else, then..? I think that the 'pyramid solitaire with power-ups' system is great, but all three games I played suffered from similar flaws:\n\n- Very, very long, with the game divided into chapters that require specific results to move on to the next chapter. Failing to reach these goals forces you to restart the chapter from the start (usually 10 levels, which can be finished in less than half an hour... Still, you don't want to restart that, do you?) Really, that's tedious. Why can't I select a specific level to redo inside a chapter? Only Chef Solitaire allowed me to do that, IIRC.\n\n- Boring story! Don't blame me, this matters to most people of taste. Otherwise, don't bother to add a story, thank you very much.\n\n- Ungrounded love for card combos. Yes, they're cool. But requiring people to achieve a certain amount of combos in each chapter is tedious, because it removes the fun of solving a game and forces you to be careful about one more thing. Plus, there are levels where it's easier to make a combo, but the game doesn't tell you that.\n\n- In fact it doesn't tell you much... There's a would-be tutorial, but it never explains plenty of things, such as: what if you fail one of your goals? Do you have to restart from scratch? How are score multipliers calculated? Some requirements involve reaching a certain multiplier, but doing multiple small combos seems to increase it randomly (or even not at all). That's just an example. The game basically assumes that you've played this kind of game for years already, and that you don't need rules. Yes, you do. Not everyone is a pyramid solitaire veteran. Me, personally, I'm a Spider Solitaire veteran. Perhaps tens of thousands of hours on the record. Yet I'm not expecting everyone to know every possible strategy to win a game.\n\n- A complete and utter disregard for balancing difficulty. Solitaire games are random by nature, so the difficulty level is determined by the card layout. Some layouts are just hard to read (upside down cards, really?), or even just tricky (multiple cards on top of one another without any visual clues, thank you very much), but what really happens is that hands are so randomized, the final chapter was by far the easiest to me -- I didn't have to redo any levels in my first playthrough, or maybe just one, as opposed to at least 5 or 6 out of 10 in previous chapters. I retried it in normal mode, which only lowers requirements to pass a chapter, and had to restart 3 or 4 levels in order to get a perfect score (which I wanted everywhere). Still easier than previous chapters, but really, it shouldn't be harder than hard mode now, should it?\n\nOkay, I'm done with the complaints.\nOverall I did finish the game, and enjoyed it a lot more than Chef Solitaire, so I'm giving it a thumb up. But please guys, if you ever make another one... How about trying to give a story mode with predetermined cards, and then a 'free-roam' mode where you get random layouts and random card orders?

The devs got everything right in this game, so let's go down the list.\n\nDesign: The gameplay is rock-solid. You've got the scattered piles of cards that you clear by matching cards either up one or down one in the hierarchy. (i.e. if you have to clear a ten, use a jack or a nine.) You make chains for combos and multipliers to your score, and that's all simple enough. The game mixes things up by adding wildcards (you can have more than one in stock, too!) and three powers. There's the cupid (remove a card), the shuffle (as it sounds), and the phoenix (remove two cards). You're at the mercy of the RNG for a good layout in a given hand, so these tools help get you out of those situations, and getting through hard levels often just means hoarding them so you can use them at strategic moments. There are additional upgrades you can purchase throughout the game, for extra undos or a power-up that will randomly remove extra cards at the beginning of a hand.\n\nAlso, there are locks on the piles - you need to clear royalty cards to get rid of them, or find keys in the cards to undo them. I love this! Adds a little more complexity to the game without making it taxing.\n\nThe game is structured so you play ten hands in a level, and the challenge comes from trying to meet chapter goals, like getting two perfect hands or a combo of ten cards. Standard fare for this genre, competently done.\n\nVisuals/Sound: It's all in theme with the Regency style. Everything looks good, everything sounds appropriately Regency-era. No complaints here at all.\n\nPlot: It's presented in a visual novel style, with little scenes playing between levels. It's a bit thin, but amusing to watch the tale of the young lady trying to woo her beloved while her brother gambles the family fortune away.\n\nEssentially this is a fantastic game to use for unwinding, with a gentle plot and sumptuous visuals and gameplay that's simple but addictive. There are oodles and oodles of levels, a normal and hard mode, and it's a lot of bang for your buck.

Reminds me a lot of Fairie Solitaire, though I haven't played that in a while. Story is mediocre, graphics and music are decent. You play as a daughter of a Victorian family and your brother Edward gambled away your family's money and you're also arranged to marry an unliked neighbor. Your story goes through how you marry upwards. It allows you to skip the story (via a button in cut scenes) if you prefer.\n\nIt uses the standard solitaire rule (you can only take cards from the playing area/tableau that are next in sequence to the one drawn from the stock/hand pile). Colors/suits don't matter. For example, if there's a 10 on top of the pile, you can only take a 9 or a jack. If there's an ace, you can only take a king or a 2. If you can't remove everything from the playing area before your deck/stock pile runs out, you lose.\n\nThere are two special blockers that stop you from interacting with piles in the playing area. Some piles have a lock card on top which you can't access until you find the key card (located somewhere in the playing area) and use it on the lock. There's a regal lock which can only be removed by taking a certain amount of J/Q/K cards off the playing area.\n\nAnd sometimes cards in the playing area are tagged with a blue bow that show they need to be used twice to be removed from the board. The first usage removes the bow and the second usage removes it from the board as usual.\n\nThere are three special skills you unlock that can be used on a cooldown. One lets you remove a selected card, another shuffles the playing board, and the last randomly removes cards.\n\nWildcards are the 'Get Out of Jail Free' card of the game that allow you to brute force the game and combat bad RNG. You can randomly find them instead of regular cards while playing and then put them into your wildcard area (can store up to 11 for future use). When you use them, they take place of the active card on your deck/stock pile. So instead of waiting to draw the right card from the stock pile, you can use the wildcard to immediately start removing cards from the playing area. Since wildcards aren't refunded for retries you have to learn when it's better to go all-in for the high combo, when it's not worth using and when to cut your losses.\n\nThere are twenty levels. Each level has up to 10 stages and each stage is one 'game' of solitaire. You earn a maximum of three stars per stage for clearing all cards in a stage. You also earn gold based on how well you do that can be spent on items that make the game easier (better chance of finding wildcards, more undos, upgrading skills, etc.).\n\nGoals for each level are to uncover an item (which is underneath cards on one of the stages), earn enough stars/perfect hands (max 3 stars per stage, 3 stars is a perfect hand), earn enough gold (based on how well you do & combo meter), and get a high enough combo/multiplier (which are linked). It's very forgiving because it allows you to redo stages so bad card RNG isn't so frustrating. If you take your time to clear every stage, the only difficulty is in getting a high combo which depends on card luck and usage of wildcards you've saved. There are little tricks you can do to make it easier to get a high combo (like going for it on stages with more exposed cards and setting up a long combo by intentionally removing/keeping certain cards on the board).\n\nThere are a couple quirks:\n[list]\n[*] Beating the game on Hard mode doesn't also give the achievement for Normal mode but you can replay the final level on Normal since you can switch difficulties at any time.\n[*] From what I can tell, you can't see the 'How to Play' explanation from the main menu, you need to get into an actual level and then access the menu from there.\n[/list]\n\nI found it to be a decent time sink that wasn't very mind-intensive. Because it's very forgiving in retries it's not especially challenging.

The game was made by Grey Alien Games from Dorset, UK, and it is also set in England taking place at various locations such as London, Brighton, and Bath. There are 20 chapters, with 180 unique levels to play through. \n\nThe game can be played in Normal or Hard mode. I'd personally recommend playing through in Normal mode first, before then playing through in Hard Mode. As you play through the game, you unlock certain things which make game-play easier, such as losing a card or two at the start of each level; being able to undo turns if you realise you've made a mistake; being able to shoot down cards that you can't match together with anything. \n\nTo play the game you simply match a lower or higher card number onto your drawn card, so for example an Ace can be matched with a Two or a King; a Nine can be matched with a Ten or an Eight. \n\nEach chapter has a set list criteria to meet in order to progress onto the next chapter, such as having 6 'perfect hands' out of the 10 levels in the chapter, or getting a combo of 15 cards played at one time, etc. The upgrades that you get for the ballroom, which you buy using gold that you earn for completing a level, makes achieving these criteria much more straight forward, particularly in later levels. During play, you also find 'wildcards' that can be stored and played if you are struggling to make matches, or if you can see that just having that one additional card in play would enable you to make a bigger combo. \n\nThe art style and music in the game really set the tone and style that the developer was going for, and it's very charming and faithful to the period in which the game is set. The storyline is a little cheesy certainly, but I found it rather charming and engaging and I actually wanted to know how the story developed and played out as I was playing. \n\nI finished this game doing a full play-through in Normal mode, then a full play-through in Hard mode in just under 15 1/2 hours. I managed to get all 17 of the achievements for the game in Steam also. I have heard a rumour to get the \"Sumptuous Solitaire: Beat the game in Hard mode.\" achievement you only need to finish the last level on Hard instead of playing through the full game, but what fun is that!? \n\nThis game is a charming and challenging solitaire game which I thought was a delight to play from start to finish.

She's into period pieces and Solitaire; seems like it'd just her cup of tea. And boy, was it. She rather enjoyed the game and after watching her play a few hands, I bought it for myself.\n\nThe game play is pretty classic Solitaire: in that you chain together cards in consecutive sequence in either ascending or descending fashion with the objective being to clear the board of cards. But unlike MS Solitaire, however, suit and color doesn't matter; all you need is the next card up or down. That is to say, a 4 or 6 can be place on a 5, Queen or Ace can be put on a King and so on. You play until you either clear the board or run out of cards in the deck.\n\nAlso unlike MS Solitaire, Regency Solitaire does not simply arrange its board into 7 columns increasing in size, but rather, the game arranges its cards into some very intricate stacks that definitely require a bit of thought and strategy. Not to mention, some of the arrangements are rather pretty in and of themselves. The game also provides you with power-ups and helper cards in the form of Jokers and wildcards. All of which can be unlocked via normal gameplay. They are unlocked using in-game currency earned simply by playing the game and are priced reasonably enough that you shouldn't have to grind chapters to save up enough cash. You can get through the game with nothing more than a little patience as failing to clear a hand has no penalty other than you not making any progress towards chapter goals. In fact, you can retry hands completely free and without penalty. The lavish settings combined with this unpunishing gameplay makes for a great way to unwind after a long day. In addition, the game is suprisingly well-polished with appropriate music, sound effects, and graphical effects in addition to the tight gameplay.\n\nThe complaints I can raise about the game are few and minor, in that they don't really affect the core gameplay at all. I do wish there was a way to view what static buffs you have after buying the item that provides it. I also found it odd that the little Eye icon in Bella's House does not really do anything... seems like it would have been a great place to add in a way to see what buffs you have purchased via a tooltip or something that appears when hovering over the particular item. I also think a way to turn them on and off would make for a nice, sort-of DIY difficutly slider, in addition to simply Easy and Hard. If expanded a little more, a bit more strategic depth could be added by limiting how many perks Bella could use at a time. but that might just be me trying to inject unnecessary mechanics into a game designed with ease and simplicity of gameplay in mind. The other thing I would have liked is if the chapters had more variety to their lengths. Each one being 10 hands after the third or so chapter gets a bit tedious towards the end. \n\nAll said, definitely worth the sale price, but I would still recommend at the full price. It's well designed and well developed with tight and smooth gameplay.

Set in the beginning of the Regency Period of England (1812) follow Belle through a matrimonial based societal season as she is pursued by one man but pursues her own dream of finding love and happiness with another man.  These short story breaks in the gameplay offer tidbits of what life was like during this period of history and the common places those of society went.  Bright and colorful artwork of each place added during gameplay as wallpapers.\n\nGameplay: Starts at three hands and increases to ten hands per place invited.  Every hand can be repeated, using retry, if the gamer wishes to achieve or needs to achieve a better score to reach the \"local\" goals. (Note: once the player moves on previous hands can not be repeated unless the player restarts that level.)   This particular retry feature comes in very handy when trying to achieve the 35 card combo, which as far as I can tell can only by achieved in two places (last chapter Belle's Ball, hand 7 or 10).  My best combo before Belle's Ball was 34 and I ran out of cards. So sad.\n\nThe player can have up to 11 \"wild cards\" and jokers can be used as any card which makes getting that elusive 35 card combo possible.  There are three \"power-ups\". 1) Cupid who shoots an arrow (2 when upgraded) to eliminate a single card on the playing field. 2) A fan used to shuffle the cards, and shuffle includes both the cards of the playing field and those remaining in stack.  Can be useful.  3) A fire phoenix that burns 2 (3 when upgraded) random playable cards of the playing field.  (Note: I do not recommend using any power-up when trying for the 35 combo since at most there are only 37 cards on the playing field.)\n\nJust a few words on the card hands, some are very, very challenging.  One of the hardest hands I had only had about 16 cards on the playing field and about 28 cards in the stack.  The way the playing field cards were laid out overlapping one another and having multiple cards with ribbons (ribbons mean the player had to use that card twice) was quite the challenge to clear, and power-ups were certainly handy to have.\n\nOverall, an addicting card game, that moves along rapidly though the levels, and becomes more challenging as the player moves through the story.", "timestamp_created": 1455574550, "timestamp_updated": 1461900957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647129", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21220315": {"recommendationid": "21220315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082084745", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487183416}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

I'm not going to bother describing the game, since its gameplay is obvious from the trailer and from other reviews.   I'll just list some positives and negatives.\n\nIts core gameplay is similar to Fairway Solitaire's (originally made by Big Fish Games, but the PC version was made by Grey Alien Games, who also developed Regency Solitaire).  The addition of on-demand powers like the bow and arrow provide some strategic options lacking in Fairway Solitaire.   On the other hand, some mini-games like Fairway Solitaire's would have been nice.  However, I think it was a good decision by the developer to add powers instead of mini-games.  Mini-games did not add to the core gameplay of Fairway Solitaire.\n\nThere's something very addictive about finding long runs and continuing them with powers and saved cards.  \n\nIt has a good amount of replayability because it has multiple difficulty levels and the items you acquire can change the way you play.\n\nI liked the wide variety of scenic backgrounds, but I do prefer shorter scenes: having to play up to 10 rounds just to see a few lines of dialogue sometimes did not feel very rewarding. \n\nI would have liked to see a way to compare scores with other Steam members, but I understand that this game is not just for Steam users. \n", "timestamp_created": 1440964411, "timestamp_updated": 1440964411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17789024": {"recommendationid": "17789024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035563971", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512915871}, "language": "english", "review": "Story: Charming!\nArtwork: Beautiful!\nEase/Difficulty Levels: Nicely Balanced\nGotta-Do-One-More-Turn Factor: They Nailed It!  :D\n\nThis little game turned out to be one of the most addicitive games I've tried this year.

The Regency era is noted for its elegance, fine arts, and architecture. It also encompasses a time of social, political, and economic change.  This all is very nicely reflected in the game itself.\n\nThe game is centered upon a particular family within the Regency era, what each family member's role is, and how they handle, or mishandle, said role.  As the storyline continues throughout the game, the player learns a bit more about each family member.  \n\nThe artwork is absolutely gorgeous!!!  The music very pleasant and reminiscent of that time era.  You do have the capability to turn off the music, if it distracts you.  There are two different settings, normal and hard. You can go back and forth if you like. If a level is too difficult, you can change the setting to normal ... or vice versa if you feel you want a more challenging game. Two of the Steam achievements involve finishing the game on the Normal setting and also the Hard setting.  [Note: If you do not want to play the entire game over on Hard when you have already played it on Normal, you can click on the last 'pearl' of the game and just play that last level on hard to get that particular achievement.]\n\nThis is not your typical Solitaire game. This game involves the playing of cards in an ascending and descending order on top of the faceup card to be played off of ... until all of the cards have been removed from the tableau (the board).  Within each level, there are specific challenges/goals you work toward achieving. By achieving those goals, you earn money to purchase power-ups, and to also decorate the main character's home.  They go hand in hand. Further clarifying that, each power-up has it's place as a decorative piece within the home of Bella (the main character), and also becomes integrated into the card game itself for the player to use when needed. The power-ups replenish over time -- not by the clock but by subsequent cards played. There are also random 'wild cards' that, once found, are kept in Bella's fan in the lower right corner, to be played when needed. The power-ups and wild cards carry over from level to level if not used. \n\nIf wild cards are used, you will come upon them again by continued play. Bella's fan can hold up to 11 wild cards -- from 'Jokers wild' to a specific card itself. There are no time restrictions, nor penalties.  The player plays at his/her own pace. For instance, if the player cannot complete the hand, has utilized the power-ups, and has used all the 'wild cards' they can use to keep that 'run' going, but cannot remove all the cards from the board by level end -- you earn no money, no achievements, but you are given an opportunity to retry that hand as many times as you like.  You also do not lose the power-ups, they simply replenish over time by each subsequent card played. However, if used, the 'wild cards' must be found again and will be displayed in Bella's fan for play.  The 'wild cards' are placed randomly throughout each hand.\n\nThere are several interesting additions in this game that I have not come across in other Solitaire games, which makes it that much more unique, challenging, and fun.  For example, some cards have big blue bows on them. What that means is that there are 'two' of that particular card on the board, right on top of each other and secured by that bow.  Sometimes, you will find that there are several sets of 'bowed' cards scattered about the board.  By clicking on the first bowed card in an ascending or descending order to be played off of the faceup card, that will utilize that particular card, leaving its double still on the board to be played when the opportunity presents itself ... but no longer 'bowed'. It has become its own singular card to be played. There is also a set of cards whereby one is a 'lock' and the other is a 'key'.  The player will find the key card through gameplay, click on it, drag it over to the lock, which then disposes of the 'lock and key' altogether, which in turn opens up that part of the board that was once blocked by the 'lock' card. Finally, there are also what is referred to as 'hidden cards' which I found even more challenging but fun, not a distraction at all! What happens is that on some of the boards, there is a card amongst the cards to be played whereby the player cannot tell if that is a 'stack' of cards or a 'singular' card on its own until it is clicked on to be played off of the face up card. \n\nIf you've played 'Golf Solitaire' -- this game is similar to that.  You play in an ascending and descending order off the faceup card.  It's the additional goals, types of cards, etc., that makes this game so unique and so much fun!!  Please remember, there is no time limit nor penalties.  You can take as long as you like to study the board and play accordingly.  If it doesn't work to your advantage, the devs have integrated a 'retry' capability ... again, with no time limits nor penalties.  This game does not have to be rushed through or become stressful. In fact, it is quite enjoyable!  \n\nAnd, yes ... the devs, Grey Alien Games, have also implemented Steam achievements and card drops!!!\n\nI highly, highly recommend Regency Solitaire!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1440201832, "timestamp_updated": 1440201832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628725", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17628513": {"recommendationid": "17628513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025403989", "num_games_owned": 1970, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443027335}, "language": "italian", "review": "Faerie Solitaire senza uova.\n\nUn punticino in meno rispetto a quello, solo perch\u00e8 la storia \u00e8 di livello femminucciesco.

A variation on the golf solitaire play style, this fast-paced version of the classic game will have you addicted before you can say \"tea and biscuits!\"\n\nGolf solitaire involves playing cards in ascending or descending order until all have been removed from the board.  There's a bit more to it than that, but it's a very easy to learn version of the game that will appeal to those looking for a more relaxing experience.  While there is indeed some thought needed in play, once you get the hang of things you'll be a solitaire pro in no time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=486910736\nThe game is divided into 20 chapters in which you have between 3 and 10 tableaus (boards) to complete a set of objectives.  These objectives get progressively harder with each chapter, but are never unfair in their requirements.  As you successfully complete each tableau, you'll earn money to purchase power-ups that will help you clear cards much easier.  You may also bank up to 11 wild cards which can be used to extend combos.  Chaining combos is the meat of the game play as bigger chains increase your score multiplier, thus rewarding even more money at the end of each chapter.  Of course, luck will play a factor in the draw, with particularly bad layouts often requiring several retries if you don't have enough power-ups or wild cards to get through them.  But that comes with the territory in solitaire.  At least there are ways to overcome it here.\n\nWhile there are several different versions of solitaire out there, this is the first Regency era themed game I have come across, and it's absolutely charming.  Everything in the presentation has an air of gentility to it, from the beautiful hand-painted artwork to the elegant music and charming character dialogue.  The simple yet enjoyable story that plays out between each chapter feels as if it was pulled right from a Jane Austen novel, which is a compliment in its own right.  Altogether, it's a pleasant experience that  will transport you to early 1800's England when elegance and sophistication was prized above all else.\n\nIf you are a fan of solitaire, I cannot recommend Regency Solitaire enough.  Between the enjoyable game play, amusing story and lovely presentation, there's very little I can complain about here.  I only wish it were a bit longer, as playing through Bella's tale of courtship was an absolute joy that didn't last nearly as long as I'd have liked.    \n\nBottom Line: Recommended to all solitaire and casual gaming fans.", "timestamp_created": 1438376084, "timestamp_updated": 1438431922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842283", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17267253": {"recommendationid": "17267253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094709762", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490210018}, "language": "english", "review": "Update: I recommend watching [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw1L2yKhzZY]MsCarsonelle's video[/url] to get the feeling of the game :)\n\nA really addictive puzzle-ish card game. The objective is to get rid of (ideally all) cards on the desk, all of which are faced down except for those on the top. To do it, you start with a deck of cards from which you can draw. With the currently drawn card, you can collect a card from the desk that has one lower/higher value, making that your current card. By continuing collecting cards, you get combo multipliers and hence bigger score. The chain gets interrupted once you draw another card from the deck. Some levels also have special obstacles - locks for which you need to find a key-card on the desk, or royal-locks which require you to collect certain amount of Jack/Queen/King cards in order to unlock.\nSimple enough to play in the morning, complex enough to wake you up :)\n\nEach level consists of several desks you need to clear and has special goals. Those can be getting X perfect hands (leaving no cards on the desk), reaching a certain combo (chain of collected cards), getting high-enough multiplier (can be reached by multiple smaller combos), uncovering an item hidden under cards or getting enough starts throughout the level (3 stars for cleared desk, 2 stars for 1 card left, 1 star for 2 cards left, 0 stars otherwise).\n\nTo help with the goals, you can buy items. Those unlock by progressing the game, while you can buy them for your score. The bonuses vary from revealing certain cards on the desk to increasing the amount of Undo's to special abilities and upgrades. Special abilities consist of target-destroy (up to two) desk cards on top, shuffle all the cards and random-destroy (up to three desk cards on top).\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that there are also special blue cards, which you can collect and store. Those don't have any requirements to be collected nor played. You can use them in order to continue your collecting chain.\n\nThere're also two tiers of levels, easy and hard mode, where hard mode has higher challenges through the goals.\n\nThe art is nice and fitting, though the full-screen mode only stretches the game, making it feel... awkward.\n\nThere were some bugs forcing you to quit the game (and restart the hand), but I'm glad to say that those have been already fixed, and I didn't have to restart the game since. :)", "timestamp_created": 1438097397, "timestamp_updated": 1438449160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525692", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17258374": {"recommendationid": "17258374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034636336", "num_games_owned": 2169, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440363608}, "language": "english", "review": "TL,DR: If you like Faerie Solitaire, there's not a lot of reasons why you shouldn't like Regency Solitaire. There's a bit of difference between the two, RS has power moves. The difficulty is, at least on hard mode, higher than FS. Other than that, it comes down to length (RS is much, much shorter and doesn't have side stuff like eggs) and setting/plot, which involves a young girl finding love with a fancy man. If you've been through Faerie Solitaire and want more hot solitaire action, this is a perfectly fine place to get it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe year is 1812, the place is England. Great Britain is once again at war with America. I don't believe this ever mentioned. Maybe it was. Whatever. If you want war talk, go play the Downton Abbey solitaire game, you ungrateful monster.\n\nThis is a game where you play as Bella, an ugly boy in drag who wants to marry a fancy man. Your brother somehow gambled away all of the family's money, I guess because your father fronted him his inheritance. There is a neighbor man who is interested in you despite the fact that you have no money and are an unattractive boy. You're not interested in this man because he is boring and you are unfamiliar with the saying \"beggars can't be choosers.\" You go to stay with your Godmother who is at a places where balls are. Dancing balls. And man balls. This is a game about finding love, after all. You also have an Uncle George, who looks very old-timey British.\n\nYou are in love with Henry, a man who loves ugly boys. Your brother continues to be garbage. You have a sister, Charlotte, who is much more attractive than you, but every one is too polite to mention this. Gameplay is seamless integrated with the plot. Someone will say something like, \"We should throw a ball for Bella!\" and then you are playing solitaire. Upgrades come in the form of decorations for your body (clothes) and for your ballroom that seems to travel with you. No one thinks that maybe the family's money issues could be solved by maybe not building a mobile ballroom and maybe not hiring piano and harp players because #yolo.\n\nIn all seriousness, if you like Faerie Solitaire (the gold standard of solitaire games that you're kind of embarassed to play) you'll most likely enjoy Regency Solitaire as well. It's basically the same game. You have a card and you need to click on a card that's higher or lower. You want to clear the board or come as close to it as possible. Each chapter has a set of goals you must achiever. Like in Faerie Solitaire, you can get wild number cards (however, you may not collect one of each, but you can get face cards and there are true wild cards which can act as any card), you can purchase upgrades and you can build up combos.\n\nWhat's different? Levels have star ratings. A perfect is three stars, but if you're close you might get one or two stars. When a combo is over it is added to a gold multiplier that last the whole level (but not the chapter). You have three power-ups that do various things and are recharged by making matches. Also, in Regency Solitaire the cards are often at goofy angles like sideways or upside down. I'm sure this is a metaphor for emotions, but it's kind of annoying, especially with that whole 6 and 9 thing.\n\nA great thing is in Regency Solitaire, you can retry individual hands without restarting the chapter. However, if you're OCD and feel compelled to get a perfect on every level you will have to find a way to cope with the shame of seeing the \"NO STARS\" ranking. Otherwise, you will be forever retrying and you will be trapped in the insidious Venus flytrap that is this game\n\nAnother noticeable different feature is that if you skip over a card that can be played, the card you could have used on the board will shake. This happens even on hard mode. It's kind of nice, but if you bought Regency Solitaire hoping for a hardcore challenge, then. . .I don't. . .maybe talk to a doctor, because you might be having a stroke.\n\nIf you like Faerie Solitaire and you're not ashamed to be playing an ugly boy-centric prequel to Downton Abbey, it's a fine game.

Not only that, but it's historically correct with research behind it as well which is always a big plus in my book. The characters are fun and interesting, as well as the plot, even though they fall into stereotypes. The music is relaxing and doesn't get repetitive to me personally and the game play itself feels very smooth and not clunky or heavy like some solitaire games can feel.  I personally enjoy earning currency in-game to buy skills and skill-upgrades with, especially when they are story-related, and earning achievements which the Steam version of this game has. Two difficulty levels Normal and Hard which is great.\n\nSome parts of the game might feel repetitive since there are a lot of levels, but there are at the same time a lot of different level designs going on which helps to dispel that feeling. In some of these levels cards can be rotated fairly close to up side down, at least 45 degrees, which can be a bit confusing and makes it extra hard sometimes. Or extra challenging depending on how you see it. Overall levels designs are interesting and helps make the game feel non-repetitive.\n\nOverall a relaxing game with an enjoyable plot, characters, music and game play. And it might be classified as a casual game, but trying to get all perfect scores in hard-mode, and/or getting the big combos, can take a few tries and requires some strategy and thinking.\n\nPersonally in love with this game <3", "timestamp_created": 1432050334, "timestamp_updated": 1432557925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15889589": {"recommendationid": "15889589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057341505", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460340930}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and relaxing, with enough light-strategic options to keep the gameplay interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1431976689, "timestamp_updated": 1431976689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485249", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15888859": {"recommendationid": "15888859", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969087711", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431973196}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent Game.

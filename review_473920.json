However, Corinne Cross's Dead & Breakfast got my attention from the moment I saw it. I'm an aesthetic person. If I don't like the graphics, chances are I won't be playing. I'm picky about my games, especially if I'm going to play them long-term. Bad Chalk did a marvelous job with engaging yet casual gameplay, beautiful artwork and graphics (naturally, the Steam cards are gorgeous as well!), and an intriguing storyline.\n\nThe game is short, but that's only because I always want more of the story. Bad Chalk delivers well-rounded characters and an imaginative plot in such a short span that, as a fan of stories, I become addicted to replaying the game. I'll be starting on my 3rd play thought soon and I have yet to dare myself to try the New Game+ option. I will say that as both a writer and aspiring substantive editor, the story might be short, but it does give a very satisfying ending each time. It wraps up sub-plots beautifully whether you get the best happy ending or not.

I loved the look of it from the very first time I found it. I \"saved\" it on my steam wishlist, and actually forgot about it for awhile. Steam will never let you forget, and when the game got updated, it came back on my front page reminding me that this game existed - I bought it right away. \n\nCCDB is about a girl named Corinne who just lost a friend. Her mom made her house-sit the friend's moms house - Because the mom got sick and went to the hospital. She quickly found out that this isn't an ordinary house, well - and It's actually also an Bed and breakfast - And for a week she needs to keep it all together. \nShe learns that she isn't an ordinary girl either. \n\n\nThis game was so beautiful and sweet. The style is great and the story is really nice. It's short, yes, and it could be longer - But I liked every day that went buy in-game. I would rather play a short neat game like this, than watch most movies. It was a great experience. \n\nI actually liked the game a lot more after reading a bit about the dev. It's (as far as I know) made by only one person - Cecilia Bishton - a computer game development student. It's so well done, and I'm really looking forward to try out her other games she is working on when they get released! \n\nIf you are fan of the small story-driven adventure genre, and loves to play indie games, go check out this game!", "timestamp_created": 1511129247, "timestamp_updated": 1511129247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456341", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36437036": {"recommendationid": "36437036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152864968", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510369417}, "language": "english", "review": "Corinne Cross\u2019s Dead and Breakfast is such a sweet and lovely game.

I was really impressed with how polished it was too; other than two teensy typos throughout the entire game, there were absolutely no issues. That's amazing since I believe it was the first game from a very small studio! \n\nIn total, getting all of the achievements through two playthroughs (one in regular mode, one in New Game+ mode) took me about 5 hours. The second game mode disappointed me slightly because I thought it would be sort of an epilogue picking up after the end of the game, with new characters. I'm not positive where I got that idea from, but it's actually the same story over again but with some fun variants and additional scenes. And just maybe a couple little secrets. ;) Once I settled into what it actually was though it was really quite fun, and added replay value. \n\nIf you are in the mood for a cute text-based game with lovely art, simple but fun gameplay and a touching, hope-filled story about death (and life) that oozes charm...then I am happy to tell you, you have come to the right place.", "timestamp_created": 1509069564, "timestamp_updated": 1509069564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35784375": {"recommendationid": "35784375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023402290", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508202909}, "language": "english", "review": "Corinne cross's Dead & breakfast, a super sweet, charming little home.

The art is cute, the gameplay is minimal but charming and the music is lovely but what really stands out is the writing.  As someone who has lost a few people in my life (some closer than others), I found the way this story dealt with death and mourning to be really realistic.  From the \"sad\" messages on instaface, an in-game social media website to the really heavy stuff like a mother mourning her child, each facet was handled with wisdom, heart, and humor that I found really enjoyable.  On top of the deft handling of such heavy themes, the characters were all interesting and I was happy to get a chance to talk to them every chance I could.  I have to admit I cried a lot at certain points of this game but that just speaks to how well-written it was and how much the creator had made me care.\n\nThe only slight complaint I could possibly make about this game is that you can't check the recipes you know to figure out what you need to buy without interacting with the stove which uses up some of your energy for the day.  At some points, especially in the second playthrough, you don't really have energy to spare so it's a bit of an inconvience but one that can be worked around easily if you just make sure to write down the recipes as you learn them on a pad of paper.\n\nAside from this small thing though, Corinne Cross's Dead & Breakfast is a charming game and a genuinely impressive piece of work for what seems to be a basically one person studio.

I beat this entire game with nothing to show for it even though I should have gotten close to all of them except the [spoiler] \"10 flower pot\"[/spoiler]  achievment. This, was very upsetting for me as someone who enjoys unlocking achiemvents to show for their hard work... Achivmenets validate all the time I waste gaming lol. This was upsetting enough to where I probably wont do the harder mode play through.\n-The controls kinda suck and you cannot change them around to fit what works for you. I have a gaming laptop and was physically uncomfortable for a lot of it. BUT, after a while i did adjust/just got used to it.\n-If you press f12 the FREAKING STEAM SCREENSHOT BUTTON FOR ALL GAMES, it exits the game without asking first and without saving.

This game was simpe devine and amazingly adorable!! I had a huge grin on my face when I was playing the game the whole time. The characters are all simply adorable or likeable in their own ways and there is cute humor throughout the game. Its had some cute messages and fun and easy mini games. I was able to finish with the best ending and all the objectives on the first go. The save point is easy to find and you can do a small bit of cooking and gardening in the game.\n\nThe player runs on energy and once you deplet it there is no way for her to get more unless she sleeps and starts the next day/night. Dont worry though if she runs out of energy she doesnt collapse or anything she just cant cook or garden. Walking or running desnt use energy. You have two cycles in the game where you are awake in the morning and can go to the florist, hospital, or groccer and then the night comes where you can see the ghosts and interact with them.\n\nFor details on the art, the style is amazingly cute for an rpg game and its not pixelated or anything. she can visably walk around. The only ganky part is thats there will be an oject in the background and forground of the character, that you can interact wth and the only way you can interact with them is by using the back key on your keyboard to look behind you or the foward key to look in front of you. Other then that the game uses the left and right key to move around.\n\nThe ending is a bit sad if you choose the correct answer to finish the game but once you finish the game you can unlock a hard mode of the game where you can go though the whole game again from start to finish but everything is harder to do and takes more engery to do it etc. \n\nOverall the game is simple and adorable and well worth the money. Th developer did a fantastic job with the game. I dont believe there are going to be any updates or add ons to the game so what you see is what you get but I was happy with what i recieved from the game and the art style was what really sold the game for me.

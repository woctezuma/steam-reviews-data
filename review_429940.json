It's well-paced, written in very good prose and the story content is complimented by rather beautiful visual assets and music.

Released in 2016, this is a yuri casual adventure game, that's been rated very positive since it's release to Steam. Seeing it, I decided to give it a go and see what it was like.\n\nToma Andrews, aged 14, has always felt like an outsider. She enjoys spending time in graveyards, and feels more comfortable among the dead than the living. \nThat is, until Toma meets a strange girl in her local graveyard who might be a real ghost. \nThe girl asks Toma if she will stay for a while and listen to a story. A story about a girl called Emmeline Burns, who died a tragic death back in 1851. \nToma is compelled to listen, but at the same time, she feels uneasy. After all, what can she do? How could she ever hope to help somebody who has already died?\n\nAfter reading this summary on Steam, I was really intrigued after downloading it, even more so than I already was, and had to jump in.\n\nI admit, I was a little bit disappointed. There wasn't much to this game other than a story. The story itself got a little boring at times, and it was a struggle to get through. However, the artwork was absolutely beautiful. I was shaken by just how much obvious work had gone into character and background designs. The artists did so much work on this short game and it has definitely paid off. I was expecting some choices in the game, but came across none, which was part of my disappointment, but the rest of the game definitely made up for it.\n\nThe achievements are all story related and are extremely easy to get, so it's definitely a good one for achievement hunters to pick up an extra 83 TSA points. It's a quick game, 0-1 hours for completion, and I think it's definitely an hour well spent.\n\nI love this so much, and I cannot wait to see what else ebi-hime develop. I recommend this to anyone who enjoy anime and/or visual novels, and people with an interest in artwork in games.\n\nThis was stunning.

This VN is a short story of a lesbian romance between two girls. A teenager called Toma Andrews, the main character, have a graveyard obsession and a shaky sense of her own identity (in every way), found a girl in a cemetery in oddly period clothes, who tells her the story of a young lady named Emmeline Burns, who died back in 1851. The story itself is fairly straightforward and in general is sad, as title says.\n\nThe game is a poorly done storyline about tragedy and love, it hasn't gameplay, no choices to be had. The writing, for example, is replete with poorly constructed sentences and tone problems. And at times, the handful of characters we see look less like beautiful young maidens than they do Victorian Era dolls. All achievements unlocked in 2 minutes.\n\n[quote][h1]Positive points.

You're brought into the story, at the parts that are relevant to the story itself. You're brought in to discover Emmeline and Toma and everyone else involved. To learn what you SHOULD about them. You get pieces that fit well together to make the story work and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nBut in all honesty you should get this for yourself. It's free!

In particular emmeline burns reminded me of this girl I used to know back in middle school. We sat next to eachother in art class and we both had birthdays in september. Anyway we always talked in class and I felt like I had a lot in common with her. She was just so great, like there was this thing about her, that made her stick out from the crowd, like she was special. I used to dream about her every night and so eventually I got the courage to ask her out, and she said that she liked me but she couldn't have a relationship because her mom would be angry with her if she did. But like this game really reminded me of that girl from my art class and what we could have been together. All around I rate this game really well.

That game was a piece of sh**.\n\nThe Sad Story of Emmeline Burns is about an Angsty Story of Toma, a girl who doesn't like her name and is troubled with thoughts of death and has remained shy her whole life. That is, until, she meets a strange girl named Emily in a graveyard who tells her the story of the deceased Emmeline Burns... and then the sad story kicks in!\n\nThe Sad Story of Emmeline Burns is a sad story about a girl named Emmeline Burns who is a lesbian in the 1800's (I think) and then she dies. So sad.\n\nI won't spoil anything major, but both stories aren't that particularly well-written or presented. It's all about finding confidence in yourself and coming of age and blah-dee-blah-dee-blah, but the progressive \"choose who you want to love, no matter if they're your gender or not\" edge did make me a little more keen to support something like this.... If there were some actual g****** conflict in it.\n\nSee, the idea of the story is interesting. A lesbian couple in the 1800's! How do they get away with it? Do their parents find out? Does the whole town find out and punish them? No. They just go off and make out. There's nothing at stake with anything that happens in the story. Even the cause of Emmeline's death seems very sudden and forced (Seriously, those motivations are very weak. No spoilers. Just saying.), and Toma's frame narrative is equally as uninteresting. She doesn't like her name. She goes to a grave. She hears a ghost tell a story. And then she feels better about herself. She's not a very interesting character and, again, nothing is at stake for her because there is no conflict.\n\nThere is a little something towards the end (after the credits of all times) when things look up for Toma but it's too short and too late for me to care anymore. It's after the f***ing credits! Why should I care?\n\nPresentation is also pretty low, but that's what I've come to expect from these interactive novels. Still images poorly animate and low-quality sound effects play over some stock music the developer found for free. But they have the protagonist as one of the still images... and they have both characters (including the protagonist) looking towards YOU the player, which makes no sense. I'm supposed to be Toma, right? She's my insert into this story, isn't she? So why is she looking at me in these conversations? It's a very unusual choice and I don't think it helps the story in any way, shape, or form.\n\nI think Emmeline Burns has got some heart deep down inside. There are certainly qualities in it that I like... but it's bogged down by some lousy writing and some low presentation quality. That and the story is pretty linear. There's no replay value because the game takes about an hour to beat and you make no choices throughout the whole story. So why should I go back and play again? Because I loved the \"deep\" and \"compelling\" characters? Thanks but no thanks. I'm giving The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns a 4/10.

that I very, very rarely write reviews for games- even the ones I thoroughly enjoy- but this game inspired something in me. This game, simply put, is absolutely beautiful. I was weary at first, seeing as I am not particularly a fan of visual novels. But this one was different. And, since it was free, I decided to give it a chance. It is not a 'choose your own path' kind of visual novel. Instead, this visual novel is simply an experience. It requires no effort to play other than simple clicking to progress dialogue. The story and beautiful illustrations, coupled with a great soundtrack (My favorite song is 'Her Song') make this an experience that everyone should enjoy. The cherry on top of the cake though, for me, was that the storyline centers around a story between two young (female) friends who fall in love with each other. As someone who is a member of the LGBT community, I was profoundly touched by this. In my opinion, there need to be more games like this. \n10/10, would play and love it (and probs cry) again.\nP.S.

A tearjerking visual novel game that tells the story of a little girl. For a free game, this exceeded my expectations!\n\nGraphics:\nThe drawings in this game were pretty unique! It was a combination of regular artwork with a little anime touch to them. It is bright, colorful, and cheery.\n\nStory:\nThis is the story of Toma Andrews, who is a socially awkward girl. She feels her name has no meaning whatsoever and believes she is nothing. There is one weird thing that her and her mom have in common: they love to visit the graveyard and love talking about their ancestors. One day though, she skipped school and hung out at the graveyard again. This is where she comes across a peculiar girl named Emmeline Burns.\n\nAnd...I stop there for spoiler purposes. All I can say about the story is OH MY GOD THE FEELS!!! I actually cried during the end of the game and for the characters of the story. The story is just...downright beautiful and tear-jerking.\n\nMusic:\nI loved the piano pieces in this game. It fits perfectly with the story and the graphics. It was a combination of relaxing, bittersweet happiness, and sadness. I could get absorbed into this soundtrack.\n\nGameplay:\nVisual Novel. You know the drill. Oh...it does have extras though! A music box, a gallery, and an extra scene when you complete the game!\n\nOverall:\nThe Sad Story of Emmeline Burns pulls your heartstrings with tragedy, happiness, and bittersweetness. This is one of those games where everything comes together. The beautiful piano music, the bright and beautiful unique artwork, and the bittersweet tearjerking story.--Okay. Why is this game free to play? Seriously, if I known it would be this good, I'd fork over my money without waiting for a sale(yes I'm that cheap). Ahem...right. As I said before, this game exceeded my expectations. Normally, you see reviews \"Eh...it's my money's worth.\" or \"Another crappy free-to-play game.\" However, this is different.

Don't read if you don't like spoilers !\n\nIt has been a really long time since I've read such a great visual novel. I'm usually not into free games since there isn't much work on them and they have really poor stories , drawing style etc but this one got my attention by just randomly seeing it. First i had doubts i mean the drawing looked so good , really girlish design but then i was wondering about the content in this game if it was satisfying enough. Well why not giving it a try? After i downloaded it and started it i already fell in love with the beautiful main menu ! Those soft girlish pastel colours , style of drawing...top top top! \n\nWhen the game started i was feeling like im reading a story about myself..a life story to be honest. The main Heroine in this game ( Toma ) is really in a lot of ways like me even tho its just a game..i couldn't believe how this is similar to me like i was talking to the creator of this game and he made a game out of me with a few changes . Since i had the similar thing as Toma with the name chosen by her mother which wasn't supposed to be Toma but Amelia, i remembered how my mother told me something long long time ago. \n\nIt feels really creepy if you play a game and its like you can look into a mirror ..see yourself . The more i was reading, i could replace myself with Toma .. being different then others seems really annoying and you want to change yourself etc i guess its just us people in this world who can't be happy with what we are or what we have. I guess another reason why i got attached to this game is that im interested in History,Victorian history..just old things that not everyone cares to talk about or do researches and this game has this \" old \" style. I love how this game is made so realistic and it has a rich story which i didn't read for a long time as mentioned.\n\nWell the game is not really long and you can finish it between 1-2 hours but i personally didn't feel like to just read fast and see what happens. The story made me feel like im experiencing it in real life and i wanted to understand or better to say \" feel \" the story. Since im a sensitive person, to be honest i cried a few times while reading .. wonderful music , art , in game atmosphere.\nMaybe im hyping it to much but i think this game deserves to become a Movie. I would even pay money for the game because in my opinion it shouldn't be a free game its way better than just a free game actually .\n\nAfter finishing it i got the strength to love myself the way i am even more and appreciate it . I learned that being the unique \" yourself\" is better than wanting being someone different and that every single person has their own story . We live for reasons and out of each single person there will be some day a different story..beautiful story, happy story , sad story  etc . This is a \"game\" with quality after all it teaches the person who is playing it something really valuable which you don't see in other games . Another thing which you can learn is that a game doesn't need to be famous or hyped to have quality.\n\nAt all i highly really highly recommend it ! For me its one of my favorite games till now . I think you really should try it out ! Don't read the story fast and try to focus on the speech of the characters im sure you will experience the game different then just fast clicking it away. \n\nMerci for reading\n

Or the father of your grandfather, smiling the same peculiar way that you do according to your mother? Looking back beyond our own lives and limited lifespans, we cannot help but wonder about our own families - the roots that we came from. Men and women before us, and many others before them consist of the roots of a tree or veins in a whole body, connected to one another to serve a magnificent whole. Metaphors aside, we get to wonder about the notion of a bloodline. A bloodline - aside being a definitive biological function, serves as roots for people. Tracing them back to ages before, we get the fundamental feeling that a part of us has always been travelling in between times through our ancestors before us and will keep travelling after us through our own offspring. Considering the poetry of lineage, one does also wonder whether the same souls would be travelling in the same bloodline, waking into new lives in new generations...\n\n[i]The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns[/i] is a story about ancestry and the third visual novel coming from Ebi-Hime, after [i]The Way we All Go[/i] and [i]Asphyxia[/i]. It is also the first of Ebi-Hime's games that I've come to play yet. Aside being a bit short, I must confess that it is incredibly well-done for a freeware, both with the narrative content and art work. As a side notice, this is a Yuri title, containing female/female romance with exceedingly beautiful and elegant depiction.\n\nOur heroine is Toma Andrews, a young girl of age 15 living in Barrowby, England. Toma, growing up with her mother and her peculiar obsession about family history has come to develop a certain affinity for graveyards. Considering her shy and introverted personality, this wouldn't be the weirdest thing about Toma though. She is a sensitive young girl with a vast inner world - always an outsider to most of her coevals. One day, she decides to skip the school and take a walk in the nearby cemetery, only to meet a strange young girl named Emily. Exchanging stories with her, Emily comes to tell her the sad story of Emmeline Burns - full of vibrant beauty and a shocking tragedy.\n\nThe art in the game comes from SillySelly - who also illustrated various other games for Ebi-Hime - and her style is incredibly beautiful with pastel colors, fleeting images and a rich environment. Characters look like as if they've been taken out of a Renaissance poem; with flowing hair, shiny eyes and blushing cheeks. This ideal beauty - Donna Angelicata - serves to be a striking contrast with the dark tone of the story. This kind of Petrarchan idealization in visuals coming together with the melancholic narrative creates a sense of eeriness, wrapping the setting in a Byronesque air with strong impulses and an impending darkness hidden behind the vibrant colors.\n\nThe narrative uses countless literary references - especially centering on English poetry and some nuances from Gothic literature. Descriptions are always elegant, yet point on with the intended feeling, engulfing you before you'd be aware of its effect. The Yuri part is more of an undertone rather than the aim, arranging a fittingly immaterial nature to the storyline and all its characters, depicted almost spiritual.\n\nOverall, I loved [i]The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns[/i]. Even though short lived, it presented a beautiful impact and a lesson that anyone can benefit from in the end: life is fragile and very valuable. The notion especially becomes wondrously sacred and meaningful if it were to be thought as a whole, rather than a single life. A lineage is a being, and a whole with the rest, throughout history. As one of the most elegant and surprisingly Gothic declarations of \"Memento Mori\", I strongly recommend the game.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1462185054, "timestamp_updated": 1462360292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831161", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22734510": {"recommendationid": "22734510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048204095", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462069254}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty arts\nMany feels\nGay lesbeans\n\nGo for it (;~;)b", "timestamp_created": 1462068695, "timestamp_updated": 1462068695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22729694": {"recommendationid": "22729694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125494484", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462046219}, "language": "english", "review": "it's gay and sad, i love it\n[spoiler]10/10 would kiss a girl again[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1462046481, "timestamp_updated": 1462046481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22696191": {"recommendationid": "22696191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155617851", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509747371}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a beautifully made Visual Novel, i would recommend!

She enjoys spending time in graveyards, and feels more comfortable among the dead than the living. That is, until Toma meets a strange girl in her local graveyard who might be a real ghost.

It begins with a girl named [i]Toma[/i], whose story is also a bit sad, as she's a girl struggling with her [strike]teens[/strike] identity. She takes the role of both narrator and protagonist.\n\nShe meets a coeval girl, Emily, who recites her story to her. While Emily is not exactly the protagonist, she's still given a major role in the novel, hardly surprising given the title of the novel. The plot involves romance (in that poetic sense) between girls.\n\nI found the story not exactly tear-inducingly sad but rather melancholic or depressing instead. That said, it isn't a bad story and it ends with a happy or at least hopeful tone. Perspective alternates between Toma and Emily.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous (I liked the detailed artstyle) and characters have many facial and bodily expressions, even if not everything described is shown visually. There is no voice acting. The background music consists of beautiful, yet melancholic piano tunes.\n\nI read it in about 75 minutes. The overall quality is good, and I detected only a couple of typos. It's also free and has a bunch of achievements, got for reading the thing through.

In one of her usual haunts she encounters another girl who tells her the titular sad story of the young Emmeline Burns. It's a tragic and emotional tale, but don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom.\n\nWhile the story is fairly straightforward, it's well written and engaging, and the characters are fleshed out well in the short playtime. The pastel-toned art work is gorgeous, the music is nice and atmospheric, and the whole game has a gothic tone to it that somehow blends perfectly with the sugary visuals. The only downside is some dodgy sound effects that only pop up briefly.\n\nAnd the best part - it's free!

Thanks, Lily!)\n\nSo, achievements of a free game led me to another adventure into another free yuri visual novel.  This one has some parallels with [i]Written in the Sky[/i], so expect quite a few comments between the two.\n\nThe first few minutes of this visual, I found myself very bored, yet intrigued with the question of \"Where is this going?\".  Surely other reviews were over-confident glorification that you see on Steam.   Though as the story went on, I found myself wanting to know more about where the story was going and who Emmeline Burns was.\n\nWe begin our story with a  girl who complains about the name she was given at birth (as someone with a peculiar name, I can relate with this).   She claims her original name was stolen by her aunt before she was born and she inherited the surname of her father, who vanished before she was born.  That must bite.\n\nShe skips school one day and meets a mysterious girl in a graveyard  (Unlike Azure from [i]Written in the Sky[/i], she isn't a chronic truant and actually cares about where she came from.  Though Toma may seem a little boring, she's more believable in her logic and behavior).  Upon meeting this strange girl, she learns that the girl is a ghost after hearing [i]The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns[/i].  The tale of a lesbian who passed away long ago on the same night as her parents.  She tells a tale of her tender love for her best friend, while at the same time, [spoiler]her father's descent into madness through severe depression.  She later has her life snuffed out by her own loving father[/spoiler].   That said, I feel the true sorrow of the sad story comes from two parts:  [spoiler]Emmeline's premature death without saying goodbye to her love.  Emmeline's father's depression turning him into a monster who kills his own family before slitting his own throat due to sudden poverty...doesn't help that his mother always called him useless. [/spoiler]\n\nAfter Emmeline's Sad Story is told, you get a very touching revelation that makes for a very feel-good moment.  A moment of love.  A moment of acceptance.  A moment of closure.   The credits roll and you're met with an epilogue (which is nice, but feels unneccesary).  The bonus side-story is also very cute.\n\n\nPROS:\n+ A very cute story involving lesbians (though the ending may be a tad cliche)\n+ A pleasant musical score for the experience\n+ Beautiful backgrounds\n+ Nice character design (it took a while to grow on me)\n+ Free\n+ Achievements \n\nCONS:\n- There are a few grammatical errors here and there\n- Advanced vocabulary will have you pausing to look up some terms\n- Beginning drags its feet and ending feels a tad cliche\n- No nudity (Not important, though I know that's a main issue involving other users' interests including my own.  It's nice without it, though...but it's just a personal preference.   Again, not important.)\n- Last kiss not shown.\n\nThe game is relatively short, but it all depends on your reading speed.   For me, it took 3.3 hours for the main story and 0.4 hours for the bonus side-story.  Total playtime on my end due to being a slow reader was approximatley 3.7 hours, though most may say it's 1-2.5 hours long.  Fair warning if you're considering playing it.\n\n\nFor the first part of the game, I felt bored...but as the story picked up, I felt it was a nice experience.   Didn't cry (as many say they did, though I can imagine where they may), but I did get wistful during the story at particular moments...kinda' the same, right?\n\n8/10   (A cute story about forbidden romance, sadness, revelations, and acceptance)", "timestamp_created": 1452901403, "timestamp_updated": 1454306015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522570", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20548836": {"recommendationid": "20548836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209916711", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458453609}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked this VN.

Not to be confused with a visual novel, in which you make choices to decide where the story will go. It's a KINETIC NOVEL, essentially a story book in the form of a game which you can't make choices or choose your own adventure.\n\nThis is my first true KINETIC novel. And it was a free kinetic novel on Steam and the art was gorgeous, so i decided to give it a read. I didnt' learn it was a kinetic novel until after i started playing. Even going through the options menu there's a 'skip after choice' option, but there are no choices in this game to make to redirect the story.\n\nFor a kinetic novel, the story should be paramount. So let's get onto the bulk of the review:\n\nThere are sort of 2 stories in 1, but as the title suggests, what's mostly focused on is the Sad Story of Emmeline Burns. Her story is set in Victorian England with her best friend as they discover they have lesbian feelings toward one another and we see them have somewhat of a secret love affair over their shared summer.  There are a few mentions of each girl's family: Emmeline's father always having to prove himself to everyone in the world, Cornelia's strict mother who is very well meaning. We don't see them, but they are mentioned. This story is told to us by Emmeline herself to Toma, who is supposed to be the actual protagonist. How Toma met Emmeline is that she wandered to a graveyard in order to get away from the world and sulk a bit and Toma herself has a friend named Hattie, who is one of her only friends who she's growing lesbian feelings for as well...\n\nThat's the non-spoiler version... But you can probably guess what happens...\n\nHonestly i thought this game was going to be a lot different than the title suggested. The title suggested this was going to be somewhat of a murder mystery revolved around a dead girl [spoiler]namely Emmeline Burns[/spoiler]. Instead you got a story within a story and apperently Toma was supposed to be the protagonist... There's no mystery. There's no suspence. You can pretty much figure out what's going to happen ahead of time...\n\nSo needless to say, story wise, I am dissapointed and left wanting more. There's a lot of lost potential here:\n- Toma is set up as a really interesting protagonist. She doesn't like her name, she was raised by a single mom who has this bitchy sounding sister who stole the name she was originally going to give to Toma while she was pregnant, Toma's mother loves going to grave yards and she's OBSESSED with history and ancestry! There's this whole family drama that could be focused on, but it's surprisingly absent! It's all talked about in the intro, but we're not shown anything else related to this drama!\n\n- Toma is an interesting character, but you honestly could've scrapped her from the game entirely! Her subplot is so minescule that it probably would've worked better as it's own game than lumped into this game that wants to focus on these 2 lesbian girls in the Victorian era! This applies to Hattie as well. She's supposed to be Toma's only friend, but she just appears toward the end after the story within the story is told... Like Toma, she could've been scrapped out of the game entirely. If you really want to use these characters, the game should've been a murder mystery with Hattie and Toma having the detective's perspective OR they should just have their own game...\n\n-Emmeline and Cornelia could've been delved into more as characters. Why not show us their families? How they live in Victorian society! Emmeline brings up at one point that there was a boy who tried to hit on her but she denied him! That could've been interesting to see for ourselves! How could Emmeline and Cornelia handle being lesbians in such a conservative period? I would've loved to see that! The romance between them is sweet, but if you wanna go full drama, why not show us what they're like when their apart? Show us their lives apart from eachother, show us what has driven them to love eachother, show us more of their families who are important to them [spoiler] and to some of the 'plot'[/spoiler].\n\n- The overall 'plot' is just sort of 'meh'... Toma is supposed to be our heroine, but the game so desperately wants to focus on Emmeline that i forget whether or not there is an actual plot...\n\nAs you can probably tell, i have a lot more complaints about the story than i do good points... But even though i do have these gripes at all this missing potential, there are some minor good things about the game:\n\n1. THE ART IS GORGEOUS. It really sets the mood and it's like looking at a painting in a museum. It also contributes to the atmosphere and really puts you in this sort of 'quiet summer time of happiness' sort of feeling where you feel like you're in those (very few) environments. Even the 4 CGs they have are beautifully drawn. I only wish i could learn to draw like that!\n\n2. The music is great and also contributes to the atmosphere of the game.\n\n3. The achievements are easy to get. This is a kinetic novel, so to get all of the achievements, just keep left clicking, after you finish up the main story, go to the main menu, click on the powder puff thing on top of the drawer, get your extra scene and boom - PERFECT GAME FOR ALL OF THE ACHIEVEMENT HUNTERS OUT THERE!\n\n4. IT'S FREE!\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nI wish Steam would impliment a 'maybe' option for 'Do you recommend this game?\". For the plot and story, it's ok, but there is so much missed potential that this game ended up being dissapointing to me despite the cuteness... But other than the story, the enviornment it puts you in and the story of Emmeline that's being told (even though i have complaints about it) is really nice and you can tell the writer wanted to focus on this little summer love affair story and put a lot of nice little touches in there to make Emmeline and Cornelia a believable loving couple despite their age...\n\nUltimately it is a FREE kinetic novel.

It was oddly paced and made for poor connection with the characters.\n\nOn a nit-pickier note, I felt like they were perhaps a bit too verbose for 14 year olds. I get that it's the 1800's, but something about the way Emmeline and Cornelia spoke really didn't fit with the fact they were 14. For some reason I just don't feel like 14 year olds, even in the 1800's, spoke quite so poetically.\n\nThe sound effects are truly abysmal and ear-piercing. They completely ruin the soundtrack when they play.\n\nThis all being said, I realize this was made for a game jam, and perhaps the story would have been improved had there been more time sown into it. (Or even just certain aspects- less time on the buildup with Toma and more time on Emmeline's story.)\n\nBut... based on the great reviews, I was expecting something pretty noteworthy, something that would tug at my gay little heartstrings. What I got was just a mediocre and predictable story that I didn't feel focused as much on lesbian love as it advertises. \n\nIf you're looking for something great that is saturated with LGBT goodness (like I was), I would say you might want to look elsewhere. If you're looking for a quick (and quickly done) yuri story, well... here it is. It's alright for a free one-shot, but frankly I was so disappointed with the story that I don't think I could recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1452498250, "timestamp_updated": 1452498250, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557051", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20464314": {"recommendationid": "20464314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103501177", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452496165}, "language": "english", "review": "i actually liked the story :o", "timestamp_created": 1452495895, "timestamp_updated": 1452495895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20463991": {"recommendationid": "20463991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266372386", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452493557}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6cb3\u5357\u5357\u9633\u54ea\u4e00\u5929\u8981t", "timestamp_created": 1452493593, "timestamp_updated": 1452493593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20461348": {"recommendationid": "20461348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030512928", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452477860}, "language": "english", "review": "The Story of Emmeline Burns is a nice little story.

From there a story is told about one of the graves dating back to 1851. Telling the story about two young girls and their innocent love. \n\nThe story gets a bit dark at one point, but thats what makes it even more emotional. The game is free. So, if you are love VN's you should certainly take a chance with this game. It'll only take a couple hours of your life. This game has a lovely soundtrack and art. The story is short and good.

I mean stretching it any further would probably ruin the story but all the same I did not want this to end. \n\nCreated by the same team behind Asphyxia, this short story is far lighter than the previous title and yet still just as powerful from an emotional perspective, maybe even more so. It keeps the same style, even including an extra scene that references the characters from Asphyxia, but utilises a smaller cast and location to tell a tightly-woven story that works beautifully. The first character we meet is Toma, a young girl who enjoys going around graveyards and learning about the stories of those buried there (something that I relate too, quite a bit). She meets an old-fashioned girl named Emily who tells her the story of Emmeline Burns, how she had a romantic relationship with her best friend Cornelia and how a problem with her father\u2019s business led to her untimely death. I found myself drawn to these characters instantly, and actually felt more invested than I was in Asphyxia. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s got a lighter tone (which is weird considering I\u2019m naturally drawn to darker stories as a rule) or maybe I\u2019m just a sucker for Yuri romances (which I am) but either way it shows the talent of the creator in their ability to construct a story. After all this is a charming tale with a tragic touch, as well as taking a surprising look at the theme of identity that I wasn\u2019t initially expecting. It\u2019s simple yet effective, enough to give The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns a permanent place in my heart. \n\nI do not have enough recommendations to give, check this out to experience beautiful art, lovely music and an utterly emotional tale that will tug at your heartstrings incessantly. And if you enjoyed Asphyxia then you'll enjoy seeing more of that teams' amazing talent on display.\n\nAnd all of this for free.

Each of these environments have completely different looks and play styles.\n\nThe TrackMania series has always been a reference in the gaming world thanks to its extremely skill-based gameplay. It's all about getting that little millisecond of advantage over the best player of the server. If you like competitive racing, this might be the game you're searching for.\n\nAnd even after almost 10 years, the game is still active thanks to its great community and its customization abilities. You can make your own tracks, change the model of your cars and paint them, make movies out of your best replays... You can even mod your favorite environments and make them have a totally different appearance!\n\nIf you want to have fun while pushing your limits, you've got to play TrackMania.", "timestamp_created": 1515191585, "timestamp_updated": 1515191585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39098536": {"recommendationid": "39098536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064463362", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498175681}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game, abeit with some technical issues in the Steam version, as it is less up to date (I believe) than the non-Steam version. If you have Windows 7 or below you should be fine, but anyone above that should use the following guide to fix these issues: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1256902715 \nPast these issues however, the game is simply awesome. All the cars offer unique driving styles and environments to drive in. With mods you can mix these cars and other environments and get really creative. You can even import community made models and tracks to play with. It's a shame it never got updated after the release of Windows 10, as many players are left unable to play as a result of lack of communication about issues and their resolutions. Steam workshop would've been a no-brainer as well. Perhaps some day it will be ironed out, but for now we're left as is.\n\nStill, I reccomend the game for what it is. It's a much more solid and cost efficient package for anyone looking to get into it compared to its successors, which currently seem to be in an ever-lasting early access in many respects. I'd say this game is especially worth it on sale, though off sale still offers a large value proposition, considering the opportunity for infinite content that the game provides.\n\nEdit: in case you were wondering why I have zero hours in this game on Steam, its because I own this outside Steam. I purchased the Steam version at one time, unaware of these issues or how to fix them and refunded it.

Le truc en plus c'est que ils sont rajouter des block et les circuits sont mieux fait.\nLa campagne solo est tres bien remplis avec la campagne nation (gratuit mais que Stadium) avec un total de 65 courses avec une autre campagne United avec le style : \"Courses\",\"Stunts\",\"Puzzle\" et \"Plateformes\" et l\u00e0 avec tout ensemble ca fait un total de +400 circuits (je pense que je ne me trompe pas) par contre niveau course le d\u00e9faut c'est que il y a 21 circuits d'un seul environnement et je trouve que c'est pas assez puis l'autre d\u00e9faut partie Plateformes (les deux autres pas assez jouer parce-que j'aime pas c'est mode de jeux) il n'y a que 3 ou 4 environnement jouable sur Plateformes et je trouve ca degeulasse meme si avec certain environnement c'est pas trop possible bah il aurait pu quand m\u00eame essayer, tant pis :/ Puis une autre campagne qui est Star Edition donc encore meme chose que la campagne United (sauf que il y a que des courses) mais fait pas des personnes choisis par Nadeo et pour finir vous pouvez faire votre propre campagne mais ca c'est pour le fun. Donc une des campagnes LES PLUS REMPLIS !\nEt maintenant l'editeurs... alors vite fait ca depend de vous, soit vous etes un joueurs, soit un mappeurs soit les deux donc l'editeurs et l'endroit qui peut vous interreser. Alors l'editeurs a ELLE aussi utiliser par Nadeo donc vous avez TOUT les outils et donc tous les environnements a votre disposition et vous pouvez meme rajouter des blocs ou images pour les panneaux (trouvable sur Internet) par contre il y a des \u00e9diteurs plus compliquer que d'autre mais bon c'est juste a prendre en main c'est tout.\nD'ailleur le multi est bien remplis mais l'environnement le plus jouer est Stadium, c'est plus difficile de trouver des serveurs United, avec d'autre environnements\nEt un probleme sur celui-l\u00e0 c'est un bug qui s'apelle \"Landing Bug\" c'est al\u00e9atoire et parfois en atterisant vous aurez la meme vitesse ou vous en aurez perdu puis pafois sur Stadium en touchant vers les bord vous pouvez rebondir. Bug non resolu mais moins present sur les TrackMania\u00b2\n\n2nd Partie :\nPositives :\n7 environnement donc 7 gameplay different.\nLes anciens environnement sont remis \u00e0 neuf\nUne campagne solo ENORME !\nUn \u00e9diteur remplis et possible d'en rajouter\nUn multi toujours present et avec beaucoup de joueurs\n\nDefauts :\nPeu de courses\nPas assez de serveur United donc souvent Stadium\n\"Landing Bug\" assez enervant quand on try hard\nLes voitures reste toujours dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat, elle peut se prendre des murs a toute vitesse, la voiture reste intact (je ne demande que elle va moins vite mais juste voire la voiture un peu deformer mais bon c'est juste visuelle)\n\n3rd Partie :\nLe MEILLEUR TRACKMANIA, le plus remplis malgres les graphisme moins beau. Et le Landing Bug assez enervant. Le jeux a un prix pas cher pour ce qu'il propose (mon avis) donc si vous aimez les courses et que il est en promo SAUTEZ DESSUS par contre si vous hesiter prenez Nations et si vous voulez voir plus achetez celui-ci (si vous ADORER Stadium bah acheter TrackMania\u00b2 Stadium)\nPar contre j'ai sauter des choses comme faire des intros a vos course, modifier vos voitures et autres mais bon il est TELLEMENT complet mais plein de truc qui n'ai pas vraiment le coeur du jeux.

You can do it in 2 ways, 1. Paint and add colours to a preset car model OR 2. get some goofy ass car off the Explorer for like 55 coppers, oh yeah coppers is the currency to get skins, tracks, mods and stuff. You get them from either playing online or doing \"Official Races\" which just records your time and gives ya money for it, but what i hate is that is a one way ticket so if you fuck up and have to restart you gotta pay up to go again... it sucks.\n\nIs this game alive?: No... not in america at least.

If I had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life this would be my choice.\n\nTrackmania United Forever is an arcade racing game. Check out the free version Trackmania Nations Forever, to see if it fits your style before you buy this. In the free version you can only play in the Stadium environment, where you drive a F1 like car in a stadium.\n\nTrackmania United Forever combines all environments from old Trackmania games, like Trackmania Original, Trackmania Sunrise and Trackmania Nations.\nThis game has 7 environments in total with every one of them having a different car, with different physics. Every environment has an own editor as well, to create your own tracks to race on them, this is what keeps the game alive.\nThe environments are:\n\nStadium - F1 like car with a lot of grip and high speed, this environment has the most potential because of the high amount of track pieces. This is the most famous and beloved environment.\n\nBay - A SUV style car, with a lot of grip and high speed taking place in a city-like setting.\n\nIsland - A super sports car, which easily loses traction at high speed and starts drifting. This takes place on an island like the name already says. There are a lot of track pieces you place on the water here.\n\nCoast - A relatively slow car with ultra low grip, you drift all the time if you don't know how to control this car. This takes place in an old village setting far away from big cities, with old asphalt roads.\n\nDesert - A very slim car with high speed. This car has the tendency to only drive on 2 wheels in turns. Takes place in an american desert setting with old roads.\n\nSnow - A pickup car with high speed and a lot of traction. Takes place in a snowy environment with a lot of snow-covered track pieces.\n\nRally - An offroad-rally car with slow speed compared to the other environments. You drive offroad a lot with not much traction. Takes place in a green countryside.\n\nEach environments has its own \"physics\", which makes this game very interesting. There are different types of gamemodes:\n\nRace - you just try to get a good time on a track\nStunt - you try to get as much stunt points as possible by performing cool chained stunts\nPlatform - you try to finish the track without respawning at a checkpoint, usually hard-trial-like tracks\nPuzzle - you have to complete an already existing track with a limited amount of track pieces, you have to create the fastest route from start to finish and then drive it yourself.\n\nThe editor, where you can create your own tracks is amazing and very easy to handle.\n\n\nTMUF (TrackMania United Forever) is not like other racing games, it's really arcade and you don't collide with other players, everything is about getting the best time on a track not beating the other players in a race like in most other racing games.\n\nUnfortunately the game doesn't have that many players anymore and the once you are going to encounter are probably very good at the game. There is still a very nice community of very good players who build and race together. This game probably has the best and friendliest community of all games I played.\n\n\nThis game is worth a try if you like fast arcade-like racing games.\n\nThank you Nadeo for bringing so much fun to my life.

Trackmania United is a great game but to me it feels as it was the right buy after my Trackmania (2004) game stopped working for my PC and I can play the Original, Sunrise, and Stadium cars. As much as I don't really play this game a lot, I wouldn't regret not buying it. Trackmania (2004 before the Original update) was literally MY favorite racing game on the computer. I've enjoyed the simple straight-forward gameplay, no vehicle collision, the tracks and AI. At the time from the AI being so tough I always felt obliged to beat them, which was one of the reasons why I loved the game. Also the 'Create your own track' was and IS a great idea. Basically in short, this game Trackmania United brings back that nostalgia and great memories from me playing the game so much back then.\n\nThere's no downsides I could state in this game. The only thing I would have prefered Nadeo to bring back was the old BGM/OST music from the 2004 Trackmania. I mean despite that we now have Steam Web Browser and Steam Music, I think it would've been nice if it was selectable to choose from the current Trackmania United music.\n\nIn conclusion, great game no doubt. Like, I'm very glad I bought this game. I'm also even glad it was being sold on Steam, instead of me buying the disc version from Ebay like how I did with my 2004 Trackmania game. :]", "timestamp_created": 1501701352, "timestamp_updated": 1501701352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540823", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33804516": {"recommendationid": "33804516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049883684", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501060482}, "language": "finnish", "review": "i have been a fan of trackmania ever since the original TMNations, with that being said it hurts me to write this\nbut for some reason, even after trying to change the resolution and all sorts of video settings, the visuals have been completely ruined, the game still sounds and plays just fine\nhttp://prntscr.com/g0fg3a\nbut when the game looks like this, who cares?\nwhen i first bought the game years ago, the game looked exactly how its supposed to, the graphics never looked this horrid before, and i have no clue what caused it, or how to fix it, i tried the \"Update\" option from the launcher and its said that its already up to date\ni'm starting to think that they need to remake the original series, my computer has a GTX1080 and an i5-6400 processor, therefore i refuse to believe the problem is with my computer", "timestamp_created": 1501060100, "timestamp_updated": 1501060621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33708223": {"recommendationid": "33708223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047744822", "num_games_owned": 1991, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 93678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500679207}, "language": "french", "review": "Trackmania United est pour moi, le meilleur jeu de voiture toutes plates-formes confondues, d\u00e9passant de loin tous les autres jeux du studio Nadeo.\n\nPremi\u00e8rement, les multiples environnements disponibles qui diff\u00e8rent de l'environnement classique \u00e0 la \"formule 1\", le stadium, avec l'arriv\u00e9e du Snow, Rally, Desert, Coast, Bay et Island.

Il y a en plus de \u00e7a quelques modes diff\u00e9rents mais qui, pour la plupart, ne se trouvent quasiment que dans le solo vu leur impopularit\u00e9.\n\nComme je viens de le dire, il y a une partie en solo, o\u00f9 le but est de remporter toutes les m\u00e9dailles disponibles (4 par circuit) ou d'essayer d'inscrire un score officiel qui sera affich\u00e9 dans un classement mondial, national et r\u00e9gional. Malheureusement, pour faire un score en officiel, il faut payer avec l'argent du jeu, les coopers, et ceux-ci vous seront vite \u00e9coul\u00e9s. Puis il y a la partie multijoueur, en ligne ou en local, qui permet d'h\u00e9berger des serveurs et que les autres joueurs les rejoignent sur des modes diff\u00e9rents avec des styles de map diff\u00e9rents (des maps courtes, avec beaucoup de vitesse, de la technique, etc). La communaut\u00e9 y est alors assez peu nombreuse depuis le temps mais reste une des plus amicales et bienveillantes qui restera toujours soud\u00e9e.\n\nVient alors la personnalisation, vous pouvez choisir la couleur de votre voiture gr\u00e2ce aux voitures de bases mises \u00e0 disposition, qui repr\u00e9sente des pays (91 pour \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis). Vous pouvez aussi cr\u00e9er vos skins si vous \u00eates un artiste, en acheter avec l'argent du jeu ou bien en les t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeant. Puis vient l'\u00e9diteur de map qui vous permet de cr\u00e9er sur n'importe quel mode et environnement.

Has ALL content from previous games and MORE. Including stuff other than tracks. Does not include content from newer titles which means all of Trackmania 2 Enviroments and Trackmania Turbo.\n\n(Trackmania Turbo and Trackmania 2 have same enviroments but Trackmania 2 sells them seperate and they have standard visuals while Trackmania Turbo has that arcady twist on visuals, worse track editor and no Dedimania)\n\nIt has dated graphics while Trackmania 2 and Turbo have amazing visuals for their time which look very good today and get updated. Trackmania United forever however does not recieve updates. TMUF also doesn't have the new Lagoon, Canyon and Valley enviroments which are in Tm2 and Tm Turbo. But it does have the Stadium one which all of Trackmania games on steam have. \n\nTMUF enviroments: Stadium, Island, Coast, Bay, Rally, Desert & Snow\n\nTMUF Stadium enviroment has normal tracks like other enviroments but also has all tracks from the free 2 play Trackmania Nations.\nTMUF also had an update which added \"Star\" tracks for all enviroments which makes this game have the most content out of all TrackMania games by far.\n\n\nTrackmania 2 and Turbo enviroments: Stadium, Canyon, Valley & Lagoon\n\nThese verions have completely new tracks excluding the ones from all previous titles and also have completely diffrent tracks from eachother.\n\n\nLet me describe the TM2 & TM Turbo enviroments using enviroments from TMUF:\n\nStadium speaks for itself. It's the same exact thing with better graphics, slightly different visuals (example: boost now makes blue fire come out of your exhaust) and a few textures changed (other than being higher resolution obviously).\n\nCanyon is a mixture of desert, island and coast.\nIt has a Desert-ish enviroment.\nCars can tip over sometims like in Desert even though they look like badass muscle cars.\nIt's mostly about precise drifting which makes it comparable to Coast but in this case it's at very high speeds, the drifting is very controllable and precise compared to Coast.\nAnd last but not least it's comparable to Island because it can have very high speed tracks that make you go over huge distances in a short time, huge ramps, jumps, loops etc.\n\nValley is like a spiritual successor to rally but it's much more engaging, beautiful and harder.\nSimilar types of track but driving on the road has much more understeer, dirt makes you drift and oversteer. It also has mud/water roads which slow you down.\n\nLagoon is like Bay + Island.\nHigh speeds, very controllable and grippy cars. Very similar enviroment to Bay but it also has magnetic tracks. \n\nHope this helped.", "timestamp_created": 1496943220, "timestamp_updated": 1496943220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32129447": {"recommendationid": "32129447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313197135", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "last_played": 1515792586}, "language": "french", "review": "c'est cool", "timestamp_created": 1496411298, "timestamp_updated": 1496411298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31968066": {"recommendationid": "31968066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060826484", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510033981}, "language": "english", "review": "+Doesnt have game breaking DRM like trackmania 2\n+Cheaper\n+Has more content\n+Huge modding community", "timestamp_created": 1495786587, "timestamp_updated": 1495786587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31941310": {"recommendationid": "31941310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001395471", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502403868}, "language": "french", "review": "le jeu est bien mais apres quelque course impossible de jouer je passe en mode spectateur alors je recrete un peu l'achat de la cle", "timestamp_created": 1495660037, "timestamp_updated": 1495660037, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.346670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31879465": {"recommendationid": "31879465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260835536", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498324011}, "language": "italian", "review": "wow   me lo aspettsvo molto meglio... deluso\n", "timestamp_created": 1495361505, "timestamp_updated": 1495361505, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31831397": {"recommendationid": "31831397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009559138", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 123027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1439, "last_played": 1516411580}, "language": "english", "review": "So much customization,so much fun.It is a very fun game.I highly recommend it although there are very few players left unfortunately.So the price is really high for 2017.Wish I can go back to 2009 and play this awesome game again.", "timestamp_created": 1495151768, "timestamp_updated": 1495151768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31771469": {"recommendationid": "31771469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063488893", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "last_played": 1516230622}, "language": "english", "review": "Plays exceptionally well on low end graphics cards (Mine is an Intel 4600 or something and it plays 1080p/60fps) and is great for people who enjoy arcade type games.

You do a track, do it again, do it again, and do it again until you've mastered it. Then you move on to the next track. The crazy roller-coaster tracks you need to navigate keep this cycle of repetition more interesting than any other racing / time-attack game I can think of. There's also a lot of variety in the types of cars you race, which keep it fresh. One drives like a F1, another like a hotwheels on bath salts and meth with butter for wheels, and another that has more in common with a topheavy aardvark than a car. Not to mention the different modes of Race, Platform, and Stunt that operate on a different scoring system than each other, which just adds to the replayability.\n\nThere's a shit tonne of customization (trackmania-carpark.com) and fan-made levels, which pretty much makes this game immortal; it'll never get old. And even 9 years later I'd say the graphics hold up pretty well, too.\n\nThere aren't a lot of things that fuck with me in this game, save for the fact that the camera occasionally switches positions mid-race, which will no doubt fuck you up. Usually it's not a very big problem and just adds to the challenge of memorizing a track's quirks and little traps, but sometimes it can result in some game-breaking situations like not being able to see where you're going right before a massive jump and you just end up plummeting into the sea or slamming into some rock-hard palm trees.\n\nThere's not a lot of up-to-date content on the in-game browser, so you're way better off just ignoring the in-game currency of 'coppers' and just download shit online.\n\nThis game's totally worth it, though.

that is, do u know how lame and pathetic of a behavior that is btw, well mostly its american's who sudden comes with something with the Bit*h and Fa**ot and more, its pathetic and low and therefore i require a refund simply because u are selling this as a game and not as a tool., because the 6 min's u have to roll through the map without a hint starter like a intro for maps showing, this game is all minus, seriously stop acting like high and mighty wookies when u have won a game its fine to act mighty or something but seriously ppl keep u assaulting word to your self,, it only shows how low

Ich habe das Spiel im letzten Sale gekauft, da es sehr schwer ist an einen United Schl\u00fcssel zu kommen. Daher auch die kaum vorhandene Spielzeit. Tats\u00e4chlich bin ich aber mit diesesm Spiel aufgewachsen und Spiele TMNF seit Release (TMUF ist f\u00fcr mich quasie dasselbe da ich United nur aus den Freezone Gr\u00fcnden besitze). Vermutlich habe ich \u00fcber all die Jahre eine Gesamtstunden zahl im Bereich zwischen 5 und 7 Tausend aufgebaut... Achja die guten alten Tage an denen die Schule geschw\u00e4nzt wurde da Freunde aus der ganzen Welt auf dem selben Server Rekorde jagten...\n\nLeider sind sehr sehr viele Spieler mit der Zeit abgesprungen oder auf die neuen meiner Meihnung nach schlechteren Titel, welche in Zusammenarbeit mit Ubisoft entstanden sind, umgestiegen.

My friend's cousin was playing a free demo of it and my friend thought I might enjoy it. I did, a bit too much.\n\nSo what is TrackMania? As you can probably tell, it's a racing game. However, it is much different from most other racing games. Let's start with what it doesn't do: it doesn't use real-life cars, it doesn't simulate accurate physics, it doesn't aim to bring real courses to life, and it doesn't even let you collide with other cars.\n\nSo it's an arcade racer, then? Yes, but not in the traditional sense. There's no items to speak of, most courses aren't lapped, multiplayer is generally asynchronous, and courses are 100% static.\n\nThat might not sound like a lot of fun, but that's the baseline for what fuels this racer to be all fun. In most cases, you won't be driving on bland tracks. No ovals here; you get twisting loops, skybound jumps, and even ridiculous wallrides. No collisions means that you just need to worry about taking the track as fast as possible. Remember those jumps I mentioned? You don't get a lot of room for error sometimes, so a slight tap could throw you hurdling off into no-man's land.\n\nThis also sets the stage for pure skill. In all courses, you are already given the car to drive. You just need to deliver it to the end as fast as you can. No items and no collisions means no meddling with others, so all you have to blame for a poor time is yourself. When thing's come down to split seconds, you'll be glad you just need to worry about hitting the drift at the right time and not if you'll ram into some poor sap trying to pass.\n\nSpeaking of cars, TrackMania United is split into 7 different environments (one of which is featured in the free demo I mentioned earlier). From the slow and slippery Coast car to the ludicrously fast Island car, that's 7 unique vehicles to master. They never feel like tweaked copies, either. The Desert car tilts when turning, the Snow car is great at keeping speed but terrible at accelerating, and the Stadium car has so many tricks you'll be hard pressed to find them yourself.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, Nadeo decided \"Hey, let's just let the players make whatever they want.\" With the already amazing gameplay you also get a bunch of editors to suit your needs; make your own courses to blast through, paint your cars in your own patterns, and shoot videos of your best runs (or fails). And if you have the know-how, you can even make your own car models (which don't affect driving) and reskin your courses to use completely different textures.\n\nHonestly, the map editor is what keeps me coming back the the TrackMania titles. While the default maps (of which there are hundreds of) are certainly fun to play, the game really shines when you take a look at some of the creations players have made. Heck, there's even a [url=http://www.tm-exchange.com/]map sharing database[/url] with its own [url=https://united.tm-exchange.com/main.aspx?action=forumshow&id=16#auto]monthly map making contest[/url]!\n\nI know it shows its age, but I can promise you that this is some of the most fun you'll ever have in a racing game.\n\nYou can try out the demo here, which is basically the full game but just featuring one of the seven environments:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/", "timestamp_created": 1479931426, "timestamp_updated": 1479931450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26827742": {"recommendationid": "26827742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165148954", "num_games_owned": 783, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1516288539}, "language": "czech", "review": "best racing game 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1479930090, "timestamp_updated": 1479930090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505410", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26752506": {"recommendationid": "26752506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237497626", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 578, "last_played": 1516053474}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "JOGO MENOS CHATO DE TIME ATTACK(Na minha opini\u00e3o)\n\nEu estou tentando ser o melhor aqui do sul :)\nN\u00e3o vejo a hora de chegar as f\u00e9rias!!!\n\nRecomendo muito, os 50 reais que mais valeram a pena na minha vida.\n\nMusicas super boas (So n\u00e3o gosto da do coast)\nInfinitas possibilidades de pistas.\nEditor facil de replays e pistas.\nE MUITO MAIS!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1479846569, "timestamp_updated": 1479846569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26735975": {"recommendationid": "26735975", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973168678", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 50126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478462739}, "language": "english", "review": "It's alright", "timestamp_created": 1479756279, "timestamp_updated": 1479756279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26592627": {"recommendationid": "26592627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274774201", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479523944}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is really fun, however, only pick it up at a discounted price.

Trackmania has its own things that makes it a special racing game - the physics for time attacking.\nYou can ride with cars over nice maps build by Nadeo, or a community on 7 different environments. Collect medals by improving your time. Chase your friends to see who's better driver. Build your own maps and share your maps with others, for example on tm-exchange.com. There's a lot of stuff you can do related to cars.\nTrue, you can do all of this in Nations, but United is another big expirience of driving with different cars and enjoying their unique environments. Please don't waste your money on this game because of Coppers support, it's stupid.\n\nNow my review:\n\nGameplay (6 points max):\nThere are no car collisions, which is the biggest thing that makes this a time attacking game.  Simple to understand, drive from start to finish in a fastest time, or drive multiple laps on multilap track. That's all you need to know. Car physics itself are REALLY good. 7 enviroments with different cars means 7 different car physics. The car react just as you press the key and it's possible to understand how the car works. Obviously you need to play for some time to be good at driving. Hard to tell if it's good idea to spend some months to skill yourself for such a dead game, because there are no competitions atm, but you can still rank up in official rankings of Solo tracks.\nBecause cars are sometimes buggy and time attack can result some unlucky moments, I'm rating it [b]5.5/6[/b].\n\nGraphics (3 points max):\nGraphics. They're old for sure, but quite good on it's release date. Anyways it isnt really close to today game's graphics. When you look at the game, it's a game where environment (not gameplay environment) really matters.\nHard to decide, but I'm rating it [b]1.75/3[/b].\n\nAtmosphere (1 point max):\nThis game has it's own atmosphere, like most of the games. But this one brings memories of older games like 2004-2008 - their graphics bugs, simple design, gameplay. If you played older versions of Trackmania like Sunrise or Original, then you'll understand the feeling. :D Anyway I think it deserves clean [b]1 point[/b]. It isn't messy game with all kinds of things that don't fit together.\n\n[b]So my rating is (5.5 + 1.75 + 1): 8.25/10[/b]\nI'll say it simply, this game is awesome. This rating comparing to today games is very very good on 2008 game.\n\nCommunity is very VERY friendly. Trackmania has one of the friendliest communities ever. From my expirience, I have no doubt of that. :D United community is dying (actually it's pretty dead now), but you can still meet some players around the servers and things.\n\nYou want to decide if to buy this game for 30 bucks or stay at Nations. It's simple: Do you want to try something new in a game you know? For myself I really enjoyed playing all of these enviroments and I'm still enjoying that! But if you're not really into trying other 6 environments for this amount of money (I understand, it's a lot), then don't go for it.\n\nOverall I of course recommend this game. Absolutely no doubts about that. If you're trying to find a solid multienvironmental racing game rather for singleplayer purposes, this can be a good choice for you. :)", "timestamp_created": 1467926162, "timestamp_updated": 1475003221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609788", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24162107": {"recommendationid": "24162107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153715854", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467542210}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1467913005, "timestamp_updated": 1467913005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499319", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24118648": {"recommendationid": "24118648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035603060", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468287165}, "language": "english", "review": "A racer in the purest sense of the word.

That's it, that's all you need to know to be able to play this game.\nEach type of track is absolutely unique along with the cars that come with it, each car controls completely different so you will find that some are just for you whilst others might seem difficult to master.\nOf course the game does have some issues, just like any other game.\nThe first issue (albeit not a big one) is the sheer amount of information given to you in the online menu screens... there is a TON of stuff and it takes a while to figure out what is what, there are at least 5 different rankings showing at one time then there's all the other stuff going on. It's confusing at first but eventually it starts to make sense, this was one game where I would have wanted an instruction manual to go with it.\nAnother issue is the online community.\nNo, they're not jerks, the issue here is that there are a lot of players online... but exclusively on the stadium tracks (the formula 1 tracks) and if you like playing with the f1 cars then that's great for you but if you like playing with other cars on other tracks you will find it very difficult to find a server with other people on it (there are a few but they have a minimum skill requirement so if you've just started the game then they're off-limits to you)\n\nOverall, this game is great, simple to pick up and play on the go, it suppoerts local coop and it also has a system where you take turns doing a lap and the one with the shortest time wins, but if you prefer head to head racing you can always make a local lan game with your friends who have the game.\nYour friends don't have the game? no problem, Trackmania nations is essentially a free demo of this game, it contains exclusively the stadium tracks (this explains why everyone is always on the stadium tracks online) and it supports online play, so fire up that game and the demos and have fun.\n\n8/10 due to those few issues", "timestamp_created": 1467625300, "timestamp_updated": 1467625300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24036292": {"recommendationid": "24036292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045085647", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467528224}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u6b61\u6a02\u7684\u8cfd\u9053", "timestamp_created": 1467517284, "timestamp_updated": 1467517284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24015044": {"recommendationid": "24015044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124935999", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499784980}, "language": "french", "review": "Super, apr\u00e8s avoir jou\u00e9 \u00e0 TMNF durant des ann\u00e9es j'ai enfin achet\u00e9 TMUF et je ne regrette pas du tout :D", "timestamp_created": 1467463599, "timestamp_updated": 1467463599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23953545": {"recommendationid": "23953545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079905789", "num_games_owned": 718, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447291257}, "language": "english", "review": "good :D", "timestamp_created": 1467289900, "timestamp_updated": 1467289900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23940318": {"recommendationid": "23940318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012543569", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 13298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467280056}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best, maybe even the best game on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1467245705, "timestamp_updated": 1467245705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23913989": {"recommendationid": "23913989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051211571", "num_games_owned": 725, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467233060}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start off by saying that the Trackmania games were my childhood. Me and my cousin spent hours racing, building tracks, and competing for the quickest times across the original game. Then Trackmania Sunrise came out, and the magic seemed to happen all over again. Eventually we got older, began to hang out less (We lived a good distance away), and started to move on with our lives. A few years ago, we found Trackmania Nations. It didn't quite feel the same, but it was almost a return. \nJust recently I purchased Trackmania United Forever Star Edition (TU), as I realized that it seemed to have the vehicles and environments from the original games! I eagerly downloaded it, watching as the percentage slowly inched up. When it finally finished, I quickly hit play, loaded into the game, and got myself into a race in the desert environment of the original Trackmania.\n\"Wow, I could have sworn it looked better when I was a kid.\" I told myself upon being greeted by incredibly bad graphics.  Whatever, my nostalgia for the game made me see it better than it was. That's my fault.\nBut wait. It wasn't my fault. The game's screenshots showed it looking a lot better! Even the Stadium environment looked much worse on United than on Nations! \n\"Trackmania United blurry textures\" were the words I fed into Google. Well, I started to. The term was already one of the suggested search terms, along with several other versions of the phrase, reworded in various ways. This was a problem all across the community! I began to follow whatever guides I found, hoping I could fix my game and get back to my childhood. Nadeo held a place in my heart, so I was pretty forgiving.\nNone of them worked! I tried adjusting the Distro and installing a patch! I tried all the methods people suggested. But none of them worked.\n\nI still can't find a solution. I've validated the files, deleted and reinstalled, tried every guide I could find.\nUltimately, this is why I'm leaving a negative review. This glitch has been around for years.

There's no collision detection between you and other drivers, there's no difficulty levels, no physics settings, no slow motion crashes, no random hazards, none of that. There's you. There's the clock. And there's the never-ending pursuit of the perfect line. Trackmania United is, simply put, the definitive example of a racing game in it's purest form.\n\nThis is one of the only games I have ever played in recent history where the one and only factor that determines your success is your skill. You can't blame anything on other cars getting in your way, moving track pieces, or not having enough nitro to shoot you past the competition. Barring things beyond your control such as real-life distractions or equipment malfunction, whether you win or lose is entirely determinate on how skillful you are. That's [i]it.[/i] This alone makes Trackmania United an ideal game for those who can do without more conventional elements found in other racing games; the people who are satisfied with the honor and glory of simply being more skillful than somebody else.\n\nTrackmania United is somewhat of a compilation of all the games that came before it, and when compared to the latter games in the series (the fractured release of Trackmania 2 and the console port of Trackmania Turbo) it arguably has the most content. TM2 has 3 enviornments (soon to be 4), TMT has the same 4 enviornments (reskinned as a spinoff), and TMU has 7. There's tons of tracks for each and they all have their own unique physics:\n\n-Stadium: One of the best-feeling envoirnments in the game. Stadium cars are quick, grippy, and honestly feel more grounded in reality than any of the other enviornments in the game. Not to say that I'm looking for realism in an arcade racer, just sayin. Stadium tracks demand precision, and merely grazing a wall is almost always a guarantee that you'll get a silver medal or lower.\n-Island: One of my personal favorites, Island cars are blazing fast and extremely drifty at high speeds. The tracks are wide with long turns to compensate, resulting in an enviornment that's a blast to drive in. Bonus, load up your favorite Ferrari skin and play Splash Wave or something in the background for some mock-OutRun fun.\n-Bay: Another one of my favorites, Bay cars are like a compromise between Stadium and Island. They demand the automotive dexterity of Stadium while still being almost as fast as Island. Also a lot of fun.\n-Snow: Snow cars are extremely grippy and can practically turn on a dime. These tracks tend to twist and snake around; don't expect a lot of straightaways, and always try to keep your eyes one corner ahead.\n-Rally: With scenery inspired by old rural Europe (I guess?), Rally cars are a little on the slow side and very easy to handle, and are actually a little grippier than you'd think on dirt surfaces. This is fine; you're still gonna have to pay attention to your line in order to nab those gold medals.\n-Desert: One of the less enjoyable enviornments in my opinion (but that's just me), Desert cars are a little awkward to get used to. You will get used to them, though, and they teach you to manage your speed as you corner, lest you lose traction and therefore valuable momentum.\n-Coast: My least favorite enviornment at first, Coast eventually grew on me. They're the slowest cars in the game, yet some of the hardest to control. Take a corner too fast or try to turn too hard and you start sliding, which will most likely result in that gold medal ghost cruising right past you. Where other enviornments teach you how to respond at high speeds, Coast demands patience and subtlety.\n\nTrackmania United's price tag can be a little steep when you consider it's age, but you ARE getting a ton of content. If you want to try it out first, the Stadium enviornment is available as a standalone game for free (Trackmania Nations), with a fully fleshed out singleplayer campaign, the powerful track editor, full mod support, and unlimited multiplayer. There's people out there that have logged hundreds and even thousands of hours in the free version of Stadium alone. Try that out, and if you want more, then buy United, which will give you full access to all of these features in the other 6 enviornments. United also features extra modes for a change of pace. There's the Platform mode that puts you on much more technical tracks where time isn't a factor; medals are awarded based on how many times you have to reset your car to get to the end. When was the last time you played a racing game as a platformer? It sounds gimmicky but it's actually really interesting. There's also Stunt mode, which gives you a time limit to do flips and spins to get as many points as you can, and Puzzle mode, where the game gives you an unfinished track and gives you a limited number of extra track pieces, and you have to figure out how to arange them to make the track doable. All of this, combined with the track editor, the thousands of player-created tracks to download and enjoy, and both local and online multiplayer modes makes Trackmania United one of the most expansive racing games you will ever play. You can play it how you want; turn off the opponent cars and casually try to make it to the end of a track, shoot for gold or even Nadeo medals, or even compete in asynchronous multiplayer on the singleplayer tracks by doing official races to submit your best time to the global leaderboards. You can treat United like you'd treat Nations by spending all of your time exploring the wealth of content in your favorite enviornment, or become a jack of all trades and master every car's unique driving style. There's something for everybody. I've had the game for 3 days and I've already logged over 10 hours. I know I'm gonna sink many more into this game.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nTrackmania United is purely a time trial game at heart. When judged by those standards, in my opinion it is one of the only games I would ever award the title of \"flawless\" to. If you want a time trial game, or even if you're just looking for the best Trackmania game, look no further.

If you're thinking about buying United, but you're on the fence, play Nations Forever first. The real question worth answering is: [i]should I upgrade to this game, or just stick with Nations Forever?[/i]\n\nIn short, get it if:\n[list]\n    [*]You want to avoid the multiplayer limitations in TMNF\n    [*]You want more single-player tracks\n    [*]You want to become more competitive in multiplayer, or in single-player time trial\n    [*]You don't mind the bugs in TMNF\n[/list]\n\n[u]multiplayer limitations in Nations Forever[/u]\nIn Nations Forever, there are a few multiplayer limitations added to the game that incentivise players to upgrade - the most obvious being: you can only go on FreeZone servers; car skins are not visible to other players; and every fifth track you will be relegated to being a spectator.\n\nSpectating every fifth track can be pretty annoying, especially if you were hoping to play a specific track but need to sit out. Also, the chat is disabled when you are 'FreeZoned', which is unnecessary and frustrating. If you are into the multiplayer, this will probably be the biggest advantage that United has over Nations Forever.\n\n[u]single-player tracks[/u]\nUnited adds a boat load more single-player tracks over Nations Forever (which still has quite a lot)! It also adds some legacy environments to the game, which are probably familiar to the player of older TM games (Sunrise, woo!). Bear in mind that the cars handle really differently in the other environments, so it can be a little jarring to play them.\n\n[u]on competitiveness[/u]\nI don't really play competitive, but the single-player leaderboard system is really expanded in United, showing (as in the later games) your placement among your peers. Of course, if you play multiplayer, the far more important aspect is that you can join any server rather that those in the FreeZone.\n\n[u]bugs[/u]\nThis game is really old. And it includes content from games older still. If you find bugs in TMNF, don't expect them to be fixed in United.\n\nAll in all, it is a great game, and whether you get United, stick with Nations Forever, or buy a newer Trackmania, you'll still get a great and addictive racing game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1460829200, "timestamp_updated": 1460829200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22433854": {"recommendationid": "22433854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073797085", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446940157}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid racing game.

You'll go fast. You'll get over 800 km/h sometimes.\n\nThere's a reason why 97 % people recommened this game. It's just that good. You can play in 7 enviroments that feel completely different. Each enviroment also has their own vehicle which you can paint to your liking. You have over 400 races, platforms, stunts, and puzzles to beat.\nThe game may seem really hard at first, but you'll get used to it quite fast. Some tracks are fairy easy, while others provide extreme challange, and to get golden medal (highest reward you can get for each track), you'll need to play it litterally 50 times to get beat golden medal requirements.\n\nWhile graphics do look outdated compared to modern games, the gameplay is perfect, and could hardly be any better, so don't worry too much about that.\nIf you are into making your own tracks, this is the best game out there to do so. You can make tracks for all 7 enviroments. There is simple editor to get used to basics, and once you get used to it, there is very, very complex editor that allows you to everything with all objects in the game.\nMultiplayer is still active. It offers tons of superb custom made tracks that will provide additional challange.\n\nThe specs for the game are very, very low for nowadays PC gaming standards, and don't worry about compatibility. The game runs great on Windows 10 (I play it on 10 myself).\n\nIf you have never played Trackmania game, you should try this one even if you don't like racing. It's really fun game to play. If you have already played other Trackmania games, you should buy it too because it's currently the best one you can get. It offers so much content, that even though it's almost 10 years old, it's still worth the asking price.\n\nThe only people that shouldn't buy this game, are people who have played Trackmania games before, and didn't enjoy them. It's unlikely that you will like this one, if you didn't like the other ones.\n\nYou can try how game feels for free, as stadium enviroment is available for free here:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/\n\nHave fun and get gut.", "timestamp_created": 1459102395, "timestamp_updated": 1459276619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22085221": {"recommendationid": "22085221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189824983", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463168349}, "language": "german", "review": "richtig nice", "timestamp_created": 1459087723, "timestamp_updated": 1459087723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22041372": {"recommendationid": "22041372", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985466857", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1337410800}, "language": "english", "review": "The Counter-Strike of racing games.

It was great fun. I also played Trackmania Sunrise as well, and had even more fun.\n\nTrackmania United Forever is the complete package of what I would call the 'First Generation' of Trackmania games. United puts all the previous games together into one package: Trackmania, the original game with its desert, snow and grassland biomes, Sunrise, with the Island, Coast and Bay biomes, and Nations, the Free-2-Play version of the game with the single Stadium biome. This game is the one you get if you want everything in one place.\n\nThe multiplayer is still incredibly active, and as it's a Time-attack mode, there is no lag on your side. You will see other players bundle together and teleport across the map like the worst lag you'll imagine, but since it's technically asynchronous, and you're racing for the fastest time as opposed to all at once, the lag has zero effect on gameplay.\n\nOne critique that I would offer is that multiplayer gameplay does have a higher framerate issues, which will effect gameplay. You may need to mess with graphics settings in order to get the game running as smooth as possible.\n\nBut the main appeal of the game is the level editor. Now, I'm not the most into level editing, but I do enjoy playing other people's levels, and with the multiplayer mode, there is essentially an unlimited amount of levels to play after you finish the official levels of the single-player campaigns, of which there is more than enough.\n\nSo yes, I do recommend this game, but what about the later titles in the franchise, you may be wondering?\n\nWell, to be honest, I don't know. Trackmania 2 is incredibly fragmented, as someone decided it would be a good idea to sell each biome separately, and I haven't played Turbo, the newest installment, but reviews are looking like it's more dumbed down than prior versions. I do like the idea of the randomly-generated levels Turbo has to offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough of a selling point.\n\nOverall, Trackmania is a great racing game for your arcade-y needs. It's not a simulator of any sort, it's more of a fantasy stunt racer.", "timestamp_created": 1458879085, "timestamp_updated": 1458879085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22034362": {"recommendationid": "22034362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114363914", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 23019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511692071}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76ee\u524d\u56fd\u670d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e09\n10\u5e74\u524d\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u4e70\u8fc7\u6700\u503c\u5f97\u7684\u6b63\u7248\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u9650\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\uff0c\u5728\u56fd\u5185\u73a9\u7f51\u901f\u6162\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6015\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u73a9\u56fe\u591a\u591a\uff0c\u6c38\u8fdc\u73a9\u4e0d\u73a9\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u662f\u6240\u6709\u7cfb\u5217\u91cc\u9762\u6700\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff01\u5165\u5b83\u6ca1\u9519\uff01\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\uff01 \n\nstaduim2\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u662fstaduim\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7248\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u73a9\u6216\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u65b0\u5730\u56fe\n\u5ce1\u8c37\u6bd4\u8f83\u53e6\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e5f\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\nValley\u5c31\u611f\u89c9\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u80fd\u73a9\n\nTurbo\u4e00\u51fa\u5c31\u4e70\u4e86\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u7248\u672c\u5df2\u7ecf\u201c\u88ab\u80b2\u78a7\u201d\u4e86\uff0c\u65b0\u7248\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\u6e23\u5230\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u878d\u5165\u4e0d\u5230\u573a\u666f\u91cc\u53bb\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6cd5\u73a9\uff0c\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u5dee\uff0c\u6f02\u79fb\u4e00\u70b9\u90fd\u4e0d\u5e26\u611f\uff0c\u914d\u97f3\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u683c\u683c\u4e0d\u5165\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6700\u5dee\u7684\u914d\u97f3\u4e86\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u5982\u6b64\u5e73\u6ed1\u987a\u7545\u7684\u8d5b\u8f66\u6e38\u620f\u4f60\u7ed9\u914d\u4e2a\u5927\u70ae\u7684\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u58f0\u97f3\uff1f\u2014\u2014\uff01\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5c31\u662f\u539f\u7248\u7684United\u5185\u6838\uff08NADEO\u5185\u6838\u8fd9\u91cc\u5fc5\u987b\u7ed9\u6ee1\u5206\uff09\u52a0\u4e0aUBI\u7684\u201c\u534e\u4e3d\u5305\u88c5\u201d\uff08\u5fc5\u987b\u7ed90\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u65b0\u8d5b\u9053\u4ee5\u5916\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u65b0\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u94c1\u6746\u8d5b\u9053\u72c2\u98d9\u7c89\u4e1d\u7684\u6211\u90fd\u89c9\u5f97\u4e70Turbo\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u540e\u6094\uff01\n", "timestamp_created": 1458872767, "timestamp_updated": 1458872767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22020486": {"recommendationid": "22020486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272575499", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497712068}, "language": "german", "review": "Super Spiel kann man auch mal 2 Stunden lang spielen ohne Langweile\n\n10/10 Realismus\n\n9/10 Community\n\n8/10 Maps/Kreativit\u00e4t der Community\n\n9/10 Online Modus\n\n7/10 \u00dcbersicht", "timestamp_created": 1458817166, "timestamp_updated": 1458817166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21957132": {"recommendationid": "21957132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047196009", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502074675}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 realism", "timestamp_created": 1458524198, "timestamp_updated": 1458524198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21892285": {"recommendationid": "21892285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034616686", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 983, "last_played": 1516379140}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430!

The track editor is powerful but extremely easy to use, which means that creating complex, professional tracks takes almost no time at all. It's a lot of fun to just mess around until something coherent comes together (story of my life :P). The livery editor is nice, but it could definitely use a few more features, like the ability to move the brush pixel by pixel instead of just moving it around with the cursor, as well as the ability to rotate the brush and stickers (putting stickers on your car can be exasperating as FRICK lol). That said, you can still make a lot of cool designs in the livery editor.\n\nThe controls are tight and beautifully responsive, and using a keyboard is just as good as using a controller (I actually prefer the keyboard to the controller when it comes to this game).\n\nAs if tight controls and a fantastic track editor weren't enough, TrackMania United Forever Super Special Star Iloominarty Gaben Edition is one of those games that can run on a potato, which means you'll be able to at least run it on crappy specced PCs, and you'll be able to crank the graphics settings and not have to worry about the framerate at all on even mid-range PCs.\n\nOverall, I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good racing game on PC. And if you're not sure if you'll like it, TrackMania United is FREE (it's the full game with only the Stadium car and track style to choose from).\n\n\n This game easily gets 9 Gabens out of 10!", "timestamp_created": 1457797763, "timestamp_updated": 1457797763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21790780": {"recommendationid": "21790780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046488537", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 9906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513131390}, "language": "english", "review": "real physics?

Off the bat, TM: United is an arcade racing game, where you build tracks, perform loop-de-loops, crazy stunts, jumps, and tricks. This game houses several environments to race in (with Stadium being the most popular), and different cars for each environment (some cars may have better handling than overs, however most often the cars are tuned to the environment's racing style). The game's racing action is fairly solid, so handling and steering shouldn't be an issue (except on Coast, if you aren't familiar with rally racing). \n\nThe track editor is also very intensive and detailed (if you click the Advanced editor anyway). The track pieces pretty much go together like lego bricks, so the only way you can mess up a track is if you happen to forget a track piece to add in, or perhaps overshoot/undershoot your car's speed for jumps or sideways tracks. Believe me though, if you spend enough time in that editor, you can pretty well make some very challenging maps.\n\nIn addition to making your own maps, you can even set times on them. You can race your own creations, and try to set the best time, so other people can try to beat your time on your track. You can also choose to share your maps either via TMX (a website that specializes in maps for all the TrackMania titles), or via a Manialink (an in-game, hub store where users can upload their creations and buy them with in-game currency called credits (you cannot buy credits by the way, you earn them through logging in daily or by winning bets on the servers). \n\nThe other thing about TrackMania is that there is a paint option, so you can pain your cars very extravagantly and make them unique. Optionally, there's also user-made skins on TrackMania Carpark and on several Manialinks you can download. So if you feel like that old Stadium car is looking boring, you can download a BMW Z4 or a Mario Kart, or even one of the vehicles from F-Zero and race that instead.\n\nFinally, the community of the game. I will admit off hand, I have logged a good lot of time into this game (was even playing its freeware version TrackMania Nations before I bought United), and in that time, it's tough to find good people there. To sum it up, you might not be that happy if you are a North American player, since the North American community (which is VERY small), tends to rank up on the global leaderboards in the top 10,000-100,000 range. While this may seem intimidating, there's also the EU community (which is VERY large), which can be ranked anywhere from the top 100,000-12 million range. Due to the wider range in the EU community, you might have better odds at placing in events on the EU servers over the North American ones (since the NA servers are few and far inbetween). On the upside though, your car doesn't crash into other players, so the only way you'll end up crashing is by human error.\n\nHowever, if you don't quite want to roll with the multiplayer crowd, there is still the singleplayer, time trial maps you can play to earn medals (which do boost your ranking to some degree). Some of them can get very hard to beat, but it's still a good challenge if you feel like doing those sorts of games. \n\nAll in all, the game can be praised for it's creative prowess in regards to track building and racing, as well as the graphics too (which are still incredibly good despite the game's age).

It's literally the Counter-Strike of racing games - highly competitive, yet welcoming to casual players. In order to be good, you need to be very skilfull as the game basically revolves around time trials and replaying levels over and over in order to get the best time. But if the competitive side is not for you, don't worry, because you can still play this game at a casual level and have a blast!\n\nThe visuals hold up really well considering the game's age. It is partly a compilation of the original Trackmania, Trackmania Sunrise, and Nations Forever (which is free and brings Stadium into the mix). I would recommend playing with a controller as the controls can be a bit twitchy for some car types - of which there are seven: Rally, Snow, Desert, Bay, Coast, Island, and Stadium. The sounds are decent, and the music isn't terrible, but I personally prefer playing with the music off and my own music playing instead.\n\nIn terms of what there is to offer, you can go straight into the multiplayer or you can start out on the Singleplayer levels. These come in a variety of forms, such as races on any of the environments or stunt, platforming, and puzzle events in the Stadium (you can also race in Stadium). As I said, these are based around getting the best time possible, so there is a lot of replayability in these levels! Apart from that you have a bunch more Stadium tracks and also some \"Star Edition\" tracks to add to the already-considerably-large amount of tracks in the game. And if that doesn't top it off, there is an in-game track editor that allows for you to create your own tracks or even play other people's!! (You can also download custom skins for your cars off the web if you're interested...)\n\nThe multiplayer is great fun too as it can be very competitive or really entertaining to spectate others playing the game. Overall it's a fantastic game and one of the best racers on PC, so if that's what you're into then this is a must-buy for you!\n\nEnjoy! :D", "timestamp_created": 1437808178, "timestamp_updated": 1437808178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17163746": {"recommendationid": "17163746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086049982", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508676068}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Multiplayer racing Game ever!

This game is amazing, and totally worth every penny considering the huge amount of content you get for it. With the Forever Star Edition, you get to race in 7 environments, compared to just the one Stadium environment in Nations. Each environment has its own style of tracks and its own vehicle, which all handle very differently. For example, the Stadium racecar handles decently and can go pretty fast, while the Snow truck has barely any acceleration at all, but has huge handling capability. With this game, you get everything in the free Nations version (which has at least 100 or so tracks if I recall correctly), along with the United expansion, containing a metric ton of tracks from the 6 other environments it adds (Island, Desert, Snow, Rally, Coast, and Bay) in a variety of gamemodes. And Trackmania just isn't Trackmania without the Track Builder. It does take a little getting used to, but once you've figured it out, it's very fun to make your own tracks and publish them to the community via Manialinks. If making tracks wasn't enough, you can also make custom paintjobs for your cars as well. Online racing is very fun, and there's always a bunch of servers with people playing. The online servers might have a lot of UI that might look like a bit much to take in, but you can customize it if you like. The community is friendly for the most part, too, which is a huge plus considering the state of some communities nowadays. All in all, this is a great game for casuals and competitive types alike.

But if you look under the shell and start probing deeper you shall see that TrackMania is in fact many things and it isn't in fact simple, but rather simplistic.\n\nDo you like hardcore racing where you need to hunt for tenths and hundredths of a second, and even a small concentration lapse can result in a crash when you are on a world record pace? Come on in, there's plenty of that. Do you like to build maps for others to race at? It's easy to do that with a built in editor. Maybe you prefer doing various stunts, such as backflips, barrel rolls, driving through loops or just riding the walls in a car? TM is a perfect choice for you. Just in case you like puzzles, there's a game mode for you where you have to build a fastest way between start, finish and a few checkpoints using a limited amount of blocks. Then again you can just challenge your brain and your very self to try and seek for outrageous shortcuts in others' tracks, as nobody can dictate you the order in which the checkpoints must be driven.\n\nAnd there's definitely more to this game than I mentioned above, feel free to discover your favourite bit of the game.\n\nOne of the best things is of course the community. People are usually friendly, helpful and positive in every way.\n\nLast word from me: http://united.tm-exchange.com/ - check out this website, and the quick links.

If you're looking for a serious racing game, this isn't it... but if you've already beaten plants vs. zombies and peggle and are looking for something mindless to do while listening to audio books, this will fit the bill perfectly.\n\nThe only multiplayer mode is concurrent time trials, which works quite well. Since you're mainly racing the clock, you can restart the race at any time and won't be unduly affected by lag or cheats. However, the lack of variety means the game itself won't hold your interest for long unless you're playing with friends or also listening to podcasts at the same time.\n\nAll cars in a given race mode handle exactly the same. There is no car customization outside of your car's paint and model, but that's quite fun in itself. No plot. None of the annoying interruptions that are so common in other racing games such as cutscenes, slow menus, and crash cams. You can jump directly from one lap to the next. There is a 1 minute delay between races every time the server switches tracks, but otherwise the fun is uninterrupted.\n\nThere is a huge number of tracks but all are constructed from the same set of sections, so the variety is limited. Most tracks can be driven fairly close to top speed for most of the race - late braking isn't a part of the game. The game is mainly about finding the shortest path through the track that doesn't result in a crash.\n\nThe free version requires spectating every few races but otherwise gets access to most of the content. This isn't pay-to-win. Free players don't play at a disadvantage. I paid for the full version and I found it to be worth the price in order to play uninterrupted. Paid players also get access to several other modes including many tracks, different track types, and a new type of car for each track type. Unfortunately, the paid servers are normally empty so you'll still spend most of your time racing the same tracks as the free players.\n\nIf you think of this as a casual game, you'll get some fun out of it. If you're looking for a realistic driving sim, look elsewhere.\n", "timestamp_created": 1422526779, "timestamp_updated": 1422526779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14156372": {"recommendationid": "14156372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023714806", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 106268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3074, "last_played": 1516390183}, "language": "english", "review": "guud game. guud fun. guud frenz. guud times", "timestamp_created": 1422164352, "timestamp_updated": 1511706627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465351", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14099546": {"recommendationid": "14099546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160825893", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482365326}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics are good , it would be bad if they were better lel\nGame never crashed or caused any errors\nAnd i LOVE the ghost system <3\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1421861006, "timestamp_updated": 1421861006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14032700": {"recommendationid": "14032700", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991785696", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 163144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "last_played": 1516306687}, "language": "english", "review": "Seems ok so far", "timestamp_created": 1421511308, "timestamp_updated": 1421511308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 223, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754911", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13932972": {"recommendationid": "13932972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076350561", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 34324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1515462987}, "language": "english", "review": "Top game, much better than Need for Speed or something like this.

And if I didn't, I bet I would have never touched the series. Out of sheer awe from the quality of the game, I bought Trackmania: Sunrise Xtreme off of Ebay years later. And now, I found that there was a steam version of the game, Trackmania: United Forever, which luckily enough, is a full-functioning combination of everything in the Original TM and Sunrise Xtreme TM into one super-game with content updated for both games and new content for both to officially mash the two together on an updated playfield.\n\nFor people new to the series, Trackmania is mostly a racing game.

And being that the races are a 'ghost' style event, you don't have to worry about poor AI opponents or finding other people to play with as the people's races on the same course are recorded to be your 'ghost' opponent. In fact, you can turn off the 'ghost' opponent entirely and just race against your own time if that's how you want to go.\n\nThe only time I ever have a problem with the game's community is when I find myself forced to play somebody's extreme track that takes half an hour to complete because some people are certain their creations are the s**t.\n\nPlease, give this game a chance.

There are no setup options, no manual shifting, it's just stop or go.\n\nMost tracks are start here, finish there (A to B) rather than having laps like a normal racing game. The stunts are cool, but most races are over in less than 2 minutes so you don't really get to enjoy the driving that much, unless you're trying to get a gold medal, then you're just going to be repeating the same short run over and over. All opponents (AI or players) are ghost cars. To unlock the higher tier tracks require you to get at least Gold on the previous, but because the controls are so touchy and jerky, it can be a pretty tall order.\n\nI don't get why this game is so popular. It's expensive for being so old and simplistic. It would be nice to have a good stunt car game on Steam. There really hasn't been one since Stunts or Stunt Driver, so I guess this (or the sequels) would be it. You can make your own tracks and paint your cars, so that's a plus.\n\nIt's a good game if you're looking for something simple and over the top. It's just racing - no cops, no boosts, no setups or car tuning, no cockpit view (just two chase and one bumper cam). Not all tracks have jumps and loops, but most do.

One of the main selling points in my honest opinion is being in a game that people often congratulate each other after races whenever they get high records or just for the sake of a good round. I gotta say, this is a breath of fresh air in online communities and a very nice atmosphere to be a part of in a competitive game like this one.\n\n[h1]GAME MODES[/h1]\n\nThere's 7 other modes available in the United version including Stadium, the \"generic\" one.\nIt's kinda hard to find dedicated serves of anything other than Stadium and maybe Coast. After you reach 80k+ LP you might be able to join mixed servers with lots of Island, Rally and the other modes tracks. Anyway, I'll briefly describe them for ya:\n\n[*] [b]Stadium[/b] is the go-to mode for this game. High octane racing and sometimes even technical. Arcade Trackmania, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n[*] [b]Coast[/b] is my favorite mode. It's slowpaced in comparison to Stadium and you can feel the weight of your car really well. You drive on mainly offroad tracks and they're all amazing. Lots of memories playing Coast. Shout out to Coast players out there. You guys are rad.\n\n[*] [b]Island[/b] is pretty insane. Speed demons! Island is quite challenging and frustrating as well. Handling those speedsters is no easy task.\n\n[*] [b]Desert[/b] is like being in Dukes of Hazzard. Watch out for corners, otherwise you're gonna find yourself upside down at the end of every turn. \n\n[*] [b]Rally[/b] is iffy to say the least. One of the modes nobody actually cares about it, or even knows it exist. You \"control\" a tiny car that doesn't understand the concept of balance. It'll take you patience to handle those devilspawns.\n\n[*] [b]Snow[/b] can be pretty damn fun and challenging as well. It's mostly a mixture of Rally and Desert. Once you figure out how to get around corners with these bobcats you're good to go!\n\n[*] [b]Bay[/b] rocks! Acceleration is the name of the game. I love how these cars handle, and it's so good once you're nailing every corner going faster than the speed of sound.\n\n[h1]NEGATIVE POINT. YES, ONLY ONE POINT[/h1]\n\n\nI'll be honest with you - the only one negative point of TrackMania nowadays is its popularity. \nUnited used to be full of players, but right now things aren't going so well. \n\nWhat happened? Well, you see, there's a free version of this game called Nations. In Nations you can only play Stadium. Fair, right? Yes, but Nadeo didn't think so. A few years ago Nadeo had a great idea. \n\n[i]\"What if we implemented a FreeZone system, which basically restrict every free player of playing 1 or 2 tracks in a row and pushes them into a queue, waiting a round to play again?\" \n\n\"Genius!\"[/i]\n(TrackMania Nations only, if you own United you're good to go.)\n\nThis FreeZone bollocks almost killed this game, but the players found a way around that and trust me - this game is a LOT of fun, with tor without the United license. Give it a shot on sale. \n\nTrackmania Turbo is okay too, but, United is where Trackmania really shines.", "timestamp_created": 1395011368, "timestamp_updated": 1480824751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9487908": {"recommendationid": "9487908", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960331521", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486484070}, "language": "czech", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1394889711, "timestamp_updated": 1394889711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9466617": {"recommendationid": "9466617", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993772877", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472827514}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like a chill car game, where you can sit in school, or just play casual with your friends, this is it. \nAnd there is diferent types of races! s0 that pretty cool :)", "timestamp_created": 1394809185, "timestamp_updated": 1394809185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9310239": {"recommendationid": "9310239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007400318", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510775430}, "language": "english", "review": "nice :)", "timestamp_created": 1393712876, "timestamp_updated": 1393712876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9250688": {"recommendationid": "9250688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065855850", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449359316}, "language": "english", "review": "coming from trackmania 2 (stadium/valley/canyon), this game is still amazingly fun.\n\nranks, skins, fullspeed, lolmaps, short maps, rounds, it's all fun\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1393277195, "timestamp_updated": 1393277195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9248918": {"recommendationid": "9248918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006240934", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1516384963}, "language": "english", "review": "The Best creative racing game out there!

It has a very active community with lost of servers to choose from and they also have a ton of Servers that are Freezone, which allows you to play with all of the people who have Nations Forever. The controls feel really solid, especially since each car type has its own unique handling style that plays into the environments that you play on.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much Trials-esque where you are trying to get from start to finish with the fastest time possible. This is where the game, in my opinion, is the most addicting, as I always find myself trying to shave milliseconds off of my best time. This is VERY TRUE IN THE MULTIPLAYER! You play the game like you would in single player, except you see other players racing at the same time. This makes the game a lot more competetive as you can see how you are in the live standings and see how other players are running the course. \n\nThe best thing about the game, though, would have to be the user generated content. That right there is definitely why I LOVE THIS GAME! If you ever get bored with the tracks that are premade, you can make your own tracks and share them, or get tracks that other users have made. Most of the multiplayer severs that I have played on have custom tracks that are cycled through, which adds to the variety of the game. \n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the Trials games, as it is pretty much the same concept, but executed in a different way that still holds the replay value of a game like this.

See, I'm one of those weirdos that actually liked Black and White, flaws and all. I even liked its sequel. I've been dying for a honest to goodness god sim for years and years and only Dominions 5 has come close. Though I'd more closely compare it to the Disciples franchise. \n\nBe warned. There's a reason I stopped playing this game. It is very, VERY complex. Each faction in the game features unlimited customization when it comes to your deity. And I do mean UNLIMITED. There's like twenty some odd factions in three different ages. Each of them has their own unique talents that lend better to certain types of builds. The game is ultimately a numbers crunch, calculating the pros and cons of this stat and that magic ability. \n\nWhat's most overwhelming to me and most people is the sheer number of options. I like how every faction is a representation of nearly EVERY SINGLE MYTHOLOGY THERE EVER WAS, including the Cthulhu mythos. They even managed to invent a few new ones. That is this game's greatest strength I think. My favorite was leading an army of centaurs and naked women with The Lord of The Wild. \n\nWhen it comes to the mathmatical computations needed to fully optimize your playing experience, I'm a dumb dumb.

For instance, age is tracked for every single unit, and this has impact on one's strategy. [b]Second off, it is very rich in its thematic, historical and mythological storytelling, with a focus on simulation, emergent and indirect storytelling[/b]; while there are no campaigns or the like, there are many different nations, spells and creatures, to a very large degree based on real-world nations, mythologies, religion and religious hiearchy, traditions, culture, etc. (there are some nations that are mostly based on fantasy and the like, but it is limited; for instance, there are no orcs or elves here (there are some of the mythologies and creatures from which elves are inspired from, however, like Vanheim with Vanir and Tir na n'Og with Tuatha, Nemedians and Sidhe)). And a lot of the storytelling is given through unit descriptions and unit statistics. And the creators of the game clearly know a lot about ancient real world nations and mythologies, for you can frequently encounter something curious, search on it online, and find that it is a real world part of mythology or history. The Vestal Virgins, for instance, were very important to real-world Rome, and Ermor (read: inspired by early Rome) in the Early Age shows the conflict and change between the old faith and the New Faith, including in which units are available and where, with the Flamen and the Pontifex of the old faith relegated to being recruited in provinces with no major fortifications. Furthermore, the nations change over time in the 3 ages, frequently inspired by or based on how their real-world inspirations changed over time, and this is reflected in the units, spells, abilities etc. that are available as well as in other ways. For instance, T'ien Ch'i (inspired by Ancient China) in the Middle Age is an Imperial Bureaucracy with Celestial Masters, eunuchs, religious ministers and mages of the Way of the Five Elements (and several of their mages are very long-lived based on internal alchemy from Taoism, which can be very helpful), while T'ien Ch'i in the Late Age has been conquered by barbarians and now ruled by them with ancestor worship replacing the mages of the earlier Bureaucracy.\n\nFor those that [b]have not played the Dominions series before[/b], I think you may well end up loving this game if [b]extreme complexity is not something that scares you off[/b] (in regards to learning it, there are several different approaches and options, including video tutorials; I liked the Let's Play of an earlier version of the game, found here: https://lparchive.org/Dominions-3/). If you furthermore like learning about real world history and mythology, or like story telling that can be \"emergent\" and somewhat \"simulationist\", this is a very nice bonus. [b]If extreme complexity and a steep learning curve can be an issue, I would recommend the series Conquest of Elysium instead[/b] which is also developed by Illwinter. The Conquest of Elysium series shares many traits of the Dominions series but is much lighter on complexity, usually takes much less time and effort to learn and play, and while having some strategic depth is also much more accessible for a wider audience (possibly family-friendly, it is more light-hearted and have a fair bit of humor). Conquest of Elysium also has its own simulationist aspects (different factions need and use different 'biomes' quite differently), and it also has some more RPGish aspects.\n\nFor those [b]that have played Dominions 4 and am wondering whether to buy Dominions 5[/b], I would recommend it; there are many smaller and large improvements, the Warriors of the Faith part is only one (though major) aspect: The global map movement system has been changed and revamped fundamentally (for instance, a friendly farmland province with roads and summer-time weather costs 4 map movement points, while mountains in cold scales may cost 18 map movement points. Heavy infantry typically has lower map movement points than light infantry), and there are multi-turn movement planning available (you may have to turn it on in the options; also note it was a bit flaky in my experience, though worked fairly well overall); Battles are executed real-time; In addition to Income and Resources, every province has Recruitment points, and units take up different amounts of recruitment points; Commanders likewise take up Commander points, which can be increased by higher-level fortifications (this means that you can potentially recruit multiple scouts in one province in one turn); It is no longer possible to build add-ons to fortifications, instead you always start by building palisades or similar, and instead can upgrade that fortification to the next level available to you (like 'Palisades -> Castle -> Citadal'); A bunch of very nice UI upgrades and short-cuts (remember to use '?' to see the short-cuts available for the current GUI window); Improved random map generation; Snow/cold scale affects movement and snow is shown on the global map; Retreatment is handled differently and smarter units and commanders has a higher chance of making it to friendly territory; The borders between your dominion and others' dominion can be turned on to be highlighted; Storming castles now features actual missile troops standing on the walls instead of missiles being fired from towers; And a bunch of other nice things. Overall, my experience with the changes and improvements and the newest version of the game as a whole have been good.

I saw the crappy graphics and saw that battles automated and thought to myself, \"Yuck!\" However, some of the fans on the forums told me I had to give it a shot and play at least one game through. Well, I am a sucker for proving games suck when they suck, so I did.\n\nI am glad I did. This game is seriously deep and strategic. I haven't played any game where the player has so many decisions to make in quite a while. I found myself planning things like, \"Ok, if I try to get some forests, crank out some mages there, rush my research for alteration, then buff my bowmen in battle, while protecting them with these shield guys...\" or \"Maybe I can use a pretender with air, so I can crank out quills and get my research faster in order to raise the dead, because there will be mounds of corpses.\" I mean, I laid in bed at night with thoughts like those dancing through my head. That to me, is a successful game.\n\nThe game is a province grabber. \n\nYou start the game with a powerful pretender, which is someone or some creature, fighting others for godhood. You acheive godhood by taking over the map or taking key provinces with thrones on them. You can spend an hour or two just going through the options to pick your nation, pretender, and his dominion (bonuses or penaltied to the are you control basically). I don't mean, giving him a cool haircut either, I mean options that effect the core of your strategy and make game changing differences..\n\nYou then start out with a main province, start cranking out troops made up of varioius units available to your nation. Here is where the game really sets itself apart. Every nation in the game has unique troops, some unquie spells, and a vastly unique way of playing. Think about the first time you \"learned the zerg\" vs \"learned the protoss\" and then multiply that by 20.\n\nAfter you crank out your troops, you and your pretender, if you chose to start with him awake rather than asleep for extra points, go out and conquer surrounding provinces. As you conquer, each province contains various independant troops that may do better or worse against certain troop compositions and battle setups. Once conquered, you get income, resources, and you may also recruit from those provinces for troops that didn't come with your nation. Perhaps you will run across a province that gives you sages so you can research faster, or druids who open up nature magic, or mermen so you can invade the sea! So many options!\n\nThe battles themselves are automated. I usually hate automated battles. But you do have a good amount of control. Way way more than most games with scripted battles. You can setup the positions of your squads, set thier formations, take along various commanders, and the initial spells your commanders will be using, and tell each squad or commander to attack a particular type, like attack calvary, for example. You can also make them wait and attack, retreat, hold for a bit and then attack, etc. How you set up your battles really does make a difference and you will spend some hours toying with the different options in order to devide the most effective killing machine in terms of losses and speed of expansion.\n\nAs you take land, you can build forts, temples, and laboratories on them. The former allowing for more effective collection of resopurces and defenses in the province. The temples spread your dominion (worship of your pretender) and allow for recruitment of priests, and the latter allow for recruitment of your mages and use of magic spells, rituals, and the like. Yet, more strategy! Where will I spend my preciouis little gold to create a stronghold to defend my lands? Do I need to spread my dominion of death clouds killing of my enemies without even having to send troops? Perhaps I want to build a lab, so I can teleport my key unit from way across the map for a sneak attack.\n\nThe game is just chalk full of decisions to be made. I've always said, with strategy titles, the more decisions that I have to make, the better.\n\nSo, if you are like me, and are think you might be interested, but are put off by the indie look, give it a shot. It might become one of your favorite games!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514648795, "timestamp_updated": 1514648795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833162", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38856251": {"recommendationid": "38856251", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982460446", "num_games_owned": 782, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1515952691}, "language": "english", "review": "They've done it again.\n\nDominions 5 is a marked improvement over its previous versions, Dominions 4 and of course Dominions 3.\n\nNotable key upgrades include\n - More Map customization for random maps\n- More unit types and units with multiple 'parts' (mounts and riders, etc)\n- some extra races.\n- BATTLE REPLAYS ARE NOW IN (psuedo) REALTIME\n\nIts pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1514633453, "timestamp_updated": 1514633453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38836175": {"recommendationid": "38836175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327590530", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4455, "last_played": 1516324047}, "language": "english", "review": "The first game I was drawn to after signing on to Steam, and with respect to lots of great (I'm sure) other titles, it'll be a long time before I try anything else.

I bought the last one for 4 bucks and got mad at how ugly it was. Came back the next day and played for 4 hours straight. \n\nThe game's a good time, but it's not for the faint of heart. It's straightforward but deep. You build a pretender (sorta your race's super unit) and then you set up what sort of effect the pretender has on the world, then you pick your race and you go. \n\nYou recruit dudes, then assign them to commanders, then order the commanders to move onto other territories. If there's a commander there you fight them.\n\nThe complexity of the game comes into the squad positioning and composition because you can't actually control the battles; they're done in-between turns and you're watching the replay later. You can research spells to summon in blood waves or spies, you can seduce other commanders, you can slit their throats, you can teleport across the map.\n\nThe UI ends up being nearly perfect in a lot of ways; a ton of stuff to do and a bunch of keys to press to do it. The game's visual simplicity allows for you to accept the things the game tells you is happening. \"Oh sure, of course there's demon's gate opening up\", even though its basically a red icon on the map and a bunch of demons.\n\ntl;dr its a fun niche game, you need to get over the first hour or two of not understanding anything and then maybe watching some tutorials.

In some ways it plays like Total War, but I think it is much better. It may seem strange at first that you cannot directly control your armies in battle, but you actually have a huge amount of freedom in constructing them and setting orders prior to the battle.

You can't play Xibalba like Pangaea, or you'll end up with a lot of dead bats. Some nations need different scales to thrive. Some nations need you to change up your playstyle or use of special units. \n\nThe random maps are gorgeous and well balanced.\n\nCons:\nThis game is obviously building on a library of knowledge set up by the 4 previous, and therefore can be daunting to get into for a new player.\n\nMultiplayer is a pain to set up.\n\nGames can go long, so you've got to be willing to commit.\n\nThe game doesn't do a great job of communicating what you need to be doing.

Civ gets boring after a while, especially the routine tactics dealing with spam-fest nature of AI bonuses on diety levels (I like a challenge to be a challenge, not a grind). Fallen Enchantress is more of the same with dull endless hordes and cheese tactics late-game (little challenge). TW games tend to be broken down into economy, doom-stacks, horribly fast battlefield sludgefests and dodgy movements/abuse of AI. Endless Legend is a nice touch and with reasonable late-game scaling, but still becomes predictable. Warlock could have been a great game, but the AI was useless, the game abandoned, and the MP scene with it. Warband was cool, but becomes repetitive after a while (looking forward to the next though). \nDo I know what I am talking about? I would hope so, after over 1000 hours racked up on such games (including MP).\n\n(TL:DR over)\n\nSo why do I love the Dominion series? Surely it can get predictable, abusable and dull just like the rest? *Note: I have recently discovered it, and am only on about 40 hours playtime so far*\n\n- Firstly: replayability. So many nations and so much diversity, troop types, magic paths, ways to influence both game and battlefield. \n\n- Secondly: RPG and character investment: the choice of characters, magic items, possible abilities, etc., is huge. And yes, your beloved mage with great equipment and boosted magic paths *will* die horribly in the end....maybe...probably.\n\n- Thirdly: surprises and strategies. Even the AI, using more basic AI strategy, will catch you off guard with new unit types, spells, mage-heavy armies, flyers and cavalry taking out your back lines, large armies or elite squads you didn't see coming, and attacks on your weak flanks.\n\n- Fourthly: pace. If you are a serious and patient strategist, you will get great pleasure out of the development of your empire and borders. The diversity of potential magic sites, Thrones, bonuses, and special units you can attain is great, and the strategic vs min/max layer of fort placement and province defense is also great\n\n- Fifth: customisation. Setting up a game with 'story events' turned on and finding your capital assailed by demon horsemen who you are not ready to take out is.... amusing. Customisation of victory conditions and team games is fine, and it all adds to varying experiences and challenges\n\n- Sixth: learning curve progression. I have not even ventured into Multiplayer yet, still learning to 'get gud' in SP - but I am aware MP is where the real skill and strategy lies. By about the point where the game could get dry and I can actively use strategies which dominate any AI, congratulations to me... I am ready to get stomped in MP by strategies based on pre-planned empire/magic/troop designs and advanced reactions to the strategies/army-comp/item-use I am implementing. \n\n- Seventh: no other game combines all these elements and options for me\n\n- Eighth: the game seems to do a reasonable job of balancing and scaling. Sure, the way to pull ahead is to have more provinces, meaning stronger economy and more troops....but you have to know how to use it, and multiple opponents can still pull you down. Economy scaling is not a thing like it is in other titles, where the percentages get silly.\n\n- Ninth: when you learn cool tactics, spells, blesses, designs and strategies which walk all over the AI, SP is not over! you can simply challenge yourself by not setting up a nation in this way, with those bless designs or magic paths. Restrictions (i.e. not resorting to overwhelming strategies the AI can't cope with) do not need to feel like restrictions *as in other titles* - simply design choice and a new challenge, a new race to learn and a new way to play them\n\n\nNegatives or alternate arguments:\n\n- is the game worth the price, and is it enough of an improvement on Dom4? To me, yes. It adds enough, and brings new possibilities. As someone who enjoys the titles, I am happy paying up knowing the game should continue to improve. If there are expansions, I will also buy those. \n- What about if you are strapped for cash? You can get enough of a Dominions experience from Dom4, so if you already have it... you could wait for sale if you don't like the price. \n- If, however, you don't own Dom4... get this.\n- If you *really* like Dom4... get this. It is an improvement\n- If you don't have as much patience as you thought you did, or need quick-fix strategy games... maybe watch YouTube videos first. \n- If you don't want a game with a steep learning curve, where *only* many hours invested will give you any sense of how to play the game.... turn away. Run. You are not the market this game is reaching out to.\n\nIn other negative news, my super-mages died. Horribly. Disease is a thing, as are arrows, centaurs, assassins, drownings, elemental effects, and cyclopses.\n\nThis lengthy report comes to you from a very good 4X player (max difficulty other titles), an intermediate Dom5 noob, and Dom5 multiplayer virgin soon to be crushed by ethereal bless effects, supercombatants, and stealthy raids on all my provinces.

There's so much depth and detail to everything in this game, yet it can still be enjoyed casually. So many welcome improvements over 4, from being able to queue multiple move commands for one commander in one turn, real time combat which is fun to watch, the new bless effect system, and more.\n\nIf you're new to the series, this isn't your typical 4x strategy title. For example, most of your province improvements will come from random events, which, depending on how you've set up your pretender god (basically your main hero unit)  in the beginning can heavily influence what occurs. If you have a high luck stat, say, 3 luck, then you'll have 15% more events per turn, and 30% higher chance the event is good. However, provinces themselves can also modify their individual attributes through random events, and some provinces may flip in fortune. (and of course you won't be impervious to bad events.) Your manual improvements are limited to building a palisades/wall which upgrades into a castle, (gives you advantageous positioning and ability to defend the tile better versus enemy attacks, as well as store supplies so more units can be on that tile and not starve.) a laboratory(which can be used to transfer magical items, and research magic on that tile, as well as access your magic stones to cast ritual spells/transfer them for combat) and a temple. (which spread your gods dominion, which if you lose all dominion/faith in your god, it will disappear, and you will immediately lose the game.)    Most of the focus will be on building your army, strategically placing your defenses, and planning your offense, as well as spreading your dominion with your priests, and temples, and utilizing your resources to cast ritual spells/research higher tiers of magic for your fights.\n\nThe combat in this game has got to be my absolute favorite of any similar game, [url=http://www.illwinter.com/dom5/dom5manual.pdf]Dominion Random Number (Page 11)[/url]. To simplify it, When you roll for a random number, you'll roll either one(rarely) or two six-sided die, if either result is 6, then you subtract 1, and roll that die again. (that is, a 5 added to the roll, and each time you keep rolling a 6, you keep going until you no longer roll 6, add up the result and that's the result.)  What this means, is although improbable, nothing is truly impossible. You could see a bizarre scenario such as a single militia unit take down a dragon, however in all likeliness in over thousands of hours, you may see this once, or never. Quality is not quantity, you're still relying on individual unit strengths, and their abilities and utilizing them for their purposes. \n\nAn example (straight from the manual): It means that if you have a Jotun Moose Rider with attack skill 9 and your\nopponent has an Abysian Infantry with defense skill 10, your chance of beating him with two openended\ndice (and thus scoring a hit) is 38%. If the values were reversed, your chance of success would be\n54%.\nThe reason for the disjunction is that, at the zero point, you must roll higher (due to if the opponent rolls the same, then they've still protected themselves from the damage, thus meaning at the zero point, you have a 46% chance to beat your opponent.)\n\nThe units, spells, items, and events in this game are very in depth... You can generally take them at face value, literal descriptions, and expect things stated in them to occur. In the case of events, something may occur that just sounds like flavor text, but there's actually a chance that an event will occur later based on the one that just occurred and continue that string of events along causing perhaps ettins to assault your province later on. Different kinds of weapons hit different kinds of armor differently, and armor isn't just flat protection, it only protects [b]that[/b] part of the body which it is equipped on, you can receive crippling injuries, afflictions which affect you permanently such as losing an eye, an arm, and so forth... Each individual unit can gain experience and sometimes due to their injuries may die while trekking to a new location. This game is pretty much the perfect mix of dungeons & dragons level complexity into a 4x strategy title. \n\nFor actual battles, you can script out the starting sequences that your troops will them attempt to follow for each battle they're pit against, (you don't control any units in the actual combat, think Total War.... with far more depth) while not necessary in the beginning stages, you may need to do this in order to seize victory against higher quality troops and quantity of attacks later on, optimizing your buffs, gem usages, and positioning. Each troop, being an individual as before, has a morality check, if something demoralizing happens, such as being wounded, having someone die, or magical effects (fear, for example), if they fail the morality check, then they may begin to rout, if too many members of the squad have been demoralized, then the entire squad will have a rout check, if that passes the entire squad will rout and disperse into neighboring friendly territory (if possible). Furthermore, if your commanders are all vanquished, then the squads will rout.   Proper battle planning and getting the most out of your resources and troops can carry you a long way.   However... Too much focus on batte can lead to your downfall as well.\n\nYou're fighting for the throne, The supreme ruler has suddenly disappeared, and the world is in turmoil, prayers aren't being granted, and that's where you step in. You're a Pretender God, and the creation for said god is incredibly in depth, and will shape your nation, from the effects of provinces in your dominion, to the actual stats and when the physical form of your god actually awakens. It's important to realize that without faith, your god can't exist. If all of your dominion is gone (the faith in your god, and your provinces can worship false idols/other pretender gods), then you immediately lose the game. Equally important to the battles is spreading your dominion, the name of your god, and his/her/it's deeds far and wide, as well as claiming the Thrones of Ascension. In order to do so, your god or prophet must be on that tile to claim it . Thrones will often be heavily guarded by either a large number of units, or a small number of very powerful units capable of wiping entire armies out by themselves... often a single unit with incredible power. By claiming a throne, its abilities can aid you, and/or cause a global enchantment to occur. \n\nThe ways of victory are either to: Claim all the thrones of ascension, Spread your dominion so that every province worships your god, wipe out every other god, or... Have the most thrones claimed when the cataclysm ends. If there are any thrones left, (in that event, the horrors called by the cataclysm will win the game.)\n\nAll of this, and I haven't really gotten into any of the deeper details, as others have pointed out, there's an insurmountable amount of content and depth this game has to offer... Mercenaries for example, can be hired on any tile you own in your province, providing you're the highest bidder of said mercenary during that month. They'll be in your service for 3 months after, before returning to being able to be purchased to the highest bidder, and like everything else in the game... The mercenaries have depth as well, Each mercenary unit is an actual unit, that can lose members of its squad, and need to recruit more, accrue permanent afflictions, and even die. If a mercenary unit is wiped out, it can't be bought. I've run out of space to write, so I'll leave you with this: This is a must play title if you like strategy games. The soundtrack is awesome as well, and I implore you to give it a chance. There's so much depth that I can't go into detail here because of the word count, and others probably explain it better anyways.

This also has the side effect of making the AI a little more competitive.  A single shielded infantry won't draw all arrow fire, and units guarding commanders can't manipulate control of the battle as easily.  Cavalry units seem pretty useful again.  The map movement changes are a little confusing to understand at times, but seems like it will make raiding more fun and effective, and no longer restricted to flying units.  I also think the changes to commander recruitment makes a lot of sense;  it's no longer quite as clear that forts should do nothing but infinitely produce mages.

Though version 5 is more or less the same as version 4. \n\nI would point few weaknesses anyway.\n\n- Novice unfriendly\n\nLooks like getting started without manual or some extended reasearch is an issue. You need to find out what spells are critically important and where to get them. The same for crafted items, what is even more an issue because they are not as visible as spells. Though you may need to try many spells (especially summons) to get idea why you would need one. There is also very important \"n\" shortcut for which there is no GUI button.\n\nOverall the combination of nations. eras, spells, items etc etc makes it very problematic to play with some good understanding what's going on. Earth elementals attacking your mages? Why? Abominations or other unknown beasts devastating your entire armies? What to do? And so on. You need not just have basic understanding of your own nation and available tools, but also understanding of every other nation in contact. And this is really tough, as there are many very different nations.\n\nAnd what's that? There are games with steep learning curves. Right. But I feel that here we have much complexety in favor of more complexety rather than gameplay, while some key points are hidden rather than explained. For novice player it ever looks like chess where every other player has its own set of figures and you don't know how they move yet! In fact novice player doesn't even know many of his own (especially spells and items).\n\n- Micromanagement issues\n\nEach turn selecting what your mages should cast or forge? Want to know how many of your units are desised or wounded to consider some healing? Click every 100 of them and count. Well, with so many things going on good luck to manage everything here and avoid being feebleminded. Even of smallest map!\n\nAnd who ever invented the rule that units should retreat to all 6 different provinces?\n\n- Uninspiring battles\n\nThe more I play this game the more I don't like how battles are going. Is there ever a way to make it interesting when you can't imagine what a spell your mages will cast? What to say if you don't always know with whom you will battle, or will you ever still be alive before battle begins.\n\nI know we can choose some spells for start. But this is not a solution. You still can't control how they are cast. Not saying that against different enemies different spells needs to be chosen, but you could not know everytime what enemy it will be. You can't be ready for everything and that creates too much chaos to be enjoyable.\n\n===\n\nThis game cries for serious redesign. Being old-school is not enough this day.

It is an extremely nuanced and detailed simulation that will require literal years to just sample what it has to offer, much less master it all. On the other hand, just as with Dwarf Fortress you can easily play it on a rather casual level if that is your preference. Unlike Dwarf Fortress, it is a game that shines in multiplayer, though single-player games are absolutely possible.\n\nMost of the turn-based gameplay takes place either on the overhead strategic map, or studying (if not just enjoying) the animated battle replays. While the player has no direct control over troops during combat (something that actually adds to the gameplay in my opinion), the troops will attempt to follow pre-set orders issued prior to the engagement. This is an extremely crucial part of Dominions as a series, as building appropriate battle scripts can easily take longer than any other part of the game. For a lot of the fights this will not be necessary, and you can simply rely on basic orders, but taking on more dangerous armies will greatly benefit from customized orders.\n\nThere is an entire elaborate magic system in place (both to research, utilize during combat or for strategic benefits, and use for artifact creation), as well as a fully customizable character equipment system for your commanders. While you cannot equip general troops separately, there is a large collection of spells modifying things with individual to army-wide effects.\n\nFrankly, the game is so complex that it would take days simply to describe all the potential it carries.

This isnt very well balanced at this point though( look at cons later on)\n\n- The screens are much more polished and its much easier to get important informations already at pretender design, e.g. about unit roster of the nation\n\n- You get more options for the game: Hall of Fame can now consist of up to 20 names, global enchantments can be upped to 9 at once,etc.\n\nI would recommend to set resources at least to 200% and supplies to the maximum (300%) if you want to play vs better AI. This results in the AI recruiting more and better troops in its forts.It does make the game also slightly easier for you but the good thing is: There are also recruitment and commander points that do limit unit availability on top of money/rescources/holy points.\n\nIn game:\n\n- There are many more things visible on the global map, most changes are good some are not( look at cons, especially I have a hard time seeing temples now)\n\n- Commander and recruiting points are really nice. Most mages cost 2-4 points and starting region usally has 3 commander points, you can churn out 1 high level mage every 1,5 tunrs...or choose to make 3 assassins at once\n\n- Forts start at lowest level and can be upgraded which gives additional commander points, more income and there seems to be a special fort defense now on top of province defense, which also gets better with upgrading.\n\n- Research is much less complicated and less micro management, while still being equally deep and requiring planning , great change\n\n- AI seems to be better in vanilla dom 5 compared to vanilla dom 4. Most armies I did encounter so far ,consisted of more national troops\n\n- Battles are played out a lot faster, since attacker and defender hit at once and not after one another.\nThis makes battles a lot less real life time comsuming to watch , which to me was one of the biggest drawbacks in all old dom games. Since I like huge maps and usually play at hardest difficulty possible and mods that make it even harder, it took a ton of time to watch battles in all my SP and MP games. This time is roughly cut in half i would say.\n\n- Battles seem to be more bloody because of this change, too. This did result in some balance problems though( see cons). But overall I do like it, since even a good player will lose more units per battle, which in turn makes the AI slightly harder to beat. No more finetuning starting position of units/commanders pre battle in order to get the first hit.Good change.\n\n- multi turn movement for commanders can be activated pre game. A simple but great change. You dont have to \"babysit\" all your commanders now, since they automatically follow the movement path to destination every turn.\n\n- The fatigue system has been slightly reworked. I still hate this system in general but it has less impact now on the game, making units with high armor(and thus high fatigue) a bit  better now. They still are handicapped because of slow movement though and it is my impression that movement in battles now is more important than before.\n\n- + many more changes that are good\n\nCons:\n\n- game only comes with 2 or 3 premade maps. Sure , random maps are much better now but still...this isnt enough.\nWhere are all the classic dom 2-4 maps that came with vanilla release?\nSure, the community is very active and therefore we will have enough maps very soon...but not every player of Dom 5 will visit the forum/dom sites to download them.\n\n- Blessing choices are great but not very well balanced at this point. Also there seem to be some bugs:\n \nUndying also seems to work for non undead sacreds and only costs 1 bless point...this is extremely powerful since you can take it several times at pretender generation.\nYou only need 4 bless points to get to +3 magic resistance...this is also extremely powerful.\n\nAll in all this is still a great change, at least once patches and mods are out.\n\n- the new global map has its drawbacks:\n 1. I have a hard time seeing temples\n 2. I loved the candles displaying the dominion strength, they seem to have disappeared, instead you get your provinces highlighted in yellow that have your dominion. So far so good, but you have now to click on the province to see the actual dominions strength AND on some maps that use a green/yellow color pattern for most provinces,e.g. cradle,  you simply cant see the yellow highlighted province very easy.\n 3. Cold provinces will be colored differently and behave differently...looks good on paper, but this vastly improves all nations liking cold climate and vastly hampers hot climate nations imo. I\n This is a pretty big balance issue I have right atm.\n\n- while battles result in more casualties now, which is good, assassins are right now a ton weaker.\nI played LA Abysia in my test games and loved to conquer neutral provinces with Assassins, killing the commanders and then just sending one commander of my own to conquer the province.\nThis Strategy was balanced before imo, since I had to invest quite some time and money in order to make that strat work...and here and there my assassins would be killed,too. Since both combatants hit and once now, most assassins either die alone or manage to die but poison the enemy commander so that he dies ,too. Very rarely Ive seen my blessed assassins to kill neutral province commanders and survive. This makes ist necessary to also give them items right from the start, which isnt cost effective anymore.\n\n- last but not least: If you compare Dom 5 with Dom 4 latest patch, there are only a select few new nations( if at all).\nSure, I expect to see quite a some new nations patched in for free over the next years, but still...\nAlso , all nations basically use the same unit roster as in Dom 4.\n\nAll in all I can easily recommend this game to every Domx player and to every player that likes 4 x games like this.\nThe game is tough to master though and very time consuming but if offers unlimited replayabilty and very, very active MP community . MP games are where this game really shines. BUT I can also recommend this game for players that only be play SP. The dominions series is one of my most favorite one of all time, right after Master of Magic but slightly  ahead of games like HoMM,Age of Wonders,etc..\n\nI would give Dom 5 9/10 rating because I firmly believe most problems will be solved soon.", "timestamp_created": 1512314857, "timestamp_updated": 1512316413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748497", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38033930": {"recommendationid": "38033930", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995285223", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513469540}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a Dominions fan since Dominions 3.

Yes, the game can be a little confusing and tough to grasp at first, mostly on a functionality level, but using the provided tutorial videos on the dev page will set you up nicely, so that when war comes...and it will...you will be ready.\n\nOr will you?", "timestamp_created": 1512285539, "timestamp_updated": 1512285539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38022626": {"recommendationid": "38022626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254675977", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514058699}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1512275027, "timestamp_updated": 1512275027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38021861": {"recommendationid": "38021861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338623706", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512272369}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5404\u79cd\u82b1\u5f0f\u6253\u6eda\u6c42\u4e2d\u6587~\n\u73a9\u7684\u597d\u7d2f\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u82f1\u6587\u8bfb\u4e0d\u660e\u767d~\n\u6709\u4e2d\u6587MOD\u6216\u8005\u4e2d\u6587\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u6c42\u53d1\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u6c42\u5ea6\u76d8\uff01\n", "timestamp_created": 1512272384, "timestamp_updated": 1512272384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38021718": {"recommendationid": "38021718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041437187", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512616244}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1512271875, "timestamp_updated": 1512271875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38019124": {"recommendationid": "38019124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007736469", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 723, "last_played": 1516399896}, "language": "english", "review": "I really do enjoy the gameplay.

By default you won the game once you have defeated all other pretender gods.\n\nNow let's review the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nMost of the people here said that Dominion 5 is a complex game but for me it's a simple game why? Because of it's high level management. You don't move your every soldier in the battlefield instead they move on their own, your role here is to issue a strategy in pre-battle. Will your cavalery target the rearmost unit? Will your infantry attack the closest unit or large enemy monster? it's all up to you in the strategic screen.\n\nYou can see your provinces in the strategic map, the resources, income, recruitment point (which I still don't understand how it's work) and the units you can hire. There are some unique unit in certain provinces like lizarmen, shamblers, mermen, jaguar warriors, etc. You can recruit them but to move unit you have hired to another province, you'll need a commander. Units can only move from province to province by the lead of a commander, once your commander dies your unit will disperse, you'll lose your units. You might regain some unit if you are lucky.\n\nThere's a dominion mechanic, it's like spreading your religion. You'll be given a prohet that you picked yourself. This prophet will spread religion of your pretender god not only a prophet a priest can also do the same but it is not as powerful as a prophet. Spreading your religion is important because it expand your dominion, if you have no dominions left you lose the game.\n\nIt's just that, simple isn't it?... no need to think tactical, just give high level command and let your unit go crazy. But, it by no means a CASUL game. If you are careless, you'll got rekt and you'll realize it's too late to fix that. Like me, I was focused on building my military but neglected my religion spreading, I got huge military on every province and every nation feared me but my dominions keep decreasing and in the end it's gone completely, I got domkilled.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe music is nice at first but it's repeating. I think it only has one track. I advise to turn off the music and just open youtube and search for epic music, it'll do beter, trust me.\n\n[h1]Artstyle[/h1]\nCertainly, dominion games has a minimalist art, 3D for environment and 2-frame 2D sprites for units and characters. For me the art is okay, I can relate to it, I can imagine it. It'll grow on you eventually.\n\n[h1]Score[/h1]\nI'll give this game a 8/10, great game.", "timestamp_created": 1512215524, "timestamp_updated": 1512215524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38000497": {"recommendationid": "38000497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085664374", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514644365}, "language": "german", "review": "Words like Necrocracy deserve the 10/10 at least.This game is a masterpiece of strategic gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1512213358, "timestamp_updated": 1512213358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37998659": {"recommendationid": "37998659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007571500", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513624416}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1512208348, "timestamp_updated": 1512208348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460427", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37993654": {"recommendationid": "37993654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006807995", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1565, "last_played": 1516296463}, "language": "english", "review": "The best multi-player 4X strategy has become even better.", "timestamp_created": 1512190374, "timestamp_updated": 1512190374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37992141": {"recommendationid": "37992141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030956258", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513232365}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Dominions, it's honestly one of my favorite games, but Dom 5 is simply too similiar to Dom4 for me.

Confuse.\n - Tons of weird/funny/crazy stuff happening\n - The random maps look \"good\" now, they are really enjoyable.\n - Millions of possibilities: you can command large armies, where each individual has its own stats. You can equip dozen of commanders with items and whatnot. You can really \"role play\" your own way of playing.\n\nIn short, I totally recommand Dominions 5 for newcomers, it's the most polished and accessible iteration I've played.

Start off with training wheels, then get going consuming the world in the bloody reign of a necromancer or claim the realms of the land with lovecraftian horrors.  I had known of Dom 4 for ages, but was never willing to take the plunge.  It only took a game or two to understand the core mechanics.  \n\nThe sheer ammount of content is astounding, and the numbers are not like the Borderlands \"500 bazillion guns,\" most spells, units, blessings, etc. are tremendously different and can have entire strategies developed around them.  I have played as a celestial empire ruled by a shapeshifting astral dragon and a kingdom of norsemen ruled by a race of dwindling elves.  It is the immense quantity of well developed, interesting nations and innumerable viable gods for them that guarantees there is always something new to try.  The nations are based on amalgams of dozens of cultures from throughout history as well as literature and some things that are just downright strange.  Point is there is something, or probably many things, for everyone.\n\nThe game is based on a turn based overworld, with variable regions (the random map generator works great and can be tailored to your desired game) and a pseudo-realtime battle replay.  The overworld relies on resource management, the claiming of territory, building construction, exploration, and of course, spreading your dominion.  These concepts are very familiar, just with their own unique flavor.  The combat is all pre-planned, so there is no tactics or direct control.  At first I thought this was offputting, but the forethought and creativity of planning an army and giving it orders, all in advance turns out to be just as fun.  And, if you don't really care, you can just read the results.  Definitely a better autobattle system than Total War.  Like Dwarf Fortress, every unit is fully simulated.  You can watch your units who where lit ablaze, diseased, entangled or crippled limp behind the rest of your army.  Will you care about every archer?  No, but the attention to detail and quality of the simulation is astounding.  Due to the remarkable variety, the interactions of different units can be downright hillarious.  \n\nI know that Dom 4 had a great modding scene as well, including many total conversions.  The game is very mod friendly and allows unbelievably creative maps and units.  The game has a very modular nature, making the possibilites for mods endless and relatively easy to develop.  I look forward to what the community will cook up.  That said, there are a few issues regarding balance and mechanics, but I am not enough of an expert to explain.  It is fun, and if it is too easy, ramp up the difficulty or knock down some of the map generation figures.  No game is perfect, and not on release.  There are also a few UI quirks that don't really make sense or are a bit irritating to use, but none are gamebreaking.\n\nI would highly reccomend this game to anyone who has a bit of an imagination or loves grand strategy/god games.  \n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]  \nEveryone is playing hipster pixel art games, but is afraid of elementary arithmetic.  The game is basically what would happen if Limbo/Purgatory was given a kickstarter. \n[b]PROS:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]There is too much to ever do or understand\n[/list]\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]There is too much to ever do or understand\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1512104873, "timestamp_updated": 1512106666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881503", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37968416": {"recommendationid": "37968416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027889509", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514866453}, "language": "english", "review": "Dominions 4 just became better and that's cool.\n\nWell done Illwinter!", "timestamp_created": 1512103199, "timestamp_updated": 1512103199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37967748": {"recommendationid": "37967748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969134411", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3480, "last_played": 1516270897}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing gameplay, if the PBEM multiplayer was made into a native in-client (not direct connect \"blitz\" games) way to play long term games I would domgasm.", "timestamp_created": 1512100150, "timestamp_updated": 1512100150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563265", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37965044": {"recommendationid": "37965044", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970815393", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514819501}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful and deep immersive fantasy strategy game.", "timestamp_created": 1512088314, "timestamp_updated": 1512088314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37964953": {"recommendationid": "37964953", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973064382", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 3063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514848865}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game and series!

You just have to wing it and hope you figure it out over time.\n\n- All races are just reskins of others. The graphics are already pretty lackluster which isn't a big deal for me. But with only a couple exceptions, almost everything is a reskin of everything else. If you are going to make graphics that simple, atleast make them diverse.\n\n- There is very little depth. The whole game is, build a commander, build him an army over a few turns, attack the tile next to you, rinse repeat until you have captured all thrones of ascension or have killed the enemies main base.\n\n- There isn't much more terribly wrong with the game, but that is simply because there isn't much going on with the game at all. The fact that it is a 4x style game with real time combat that is handled by the ai and you are more or less just a general is pretty cool.

Sigh... I'm sorry, but as owner of Dominions since Dom 2 I kinda have to say this, and believe me, I know I'm going to get shit for this but~\n\n- Dominions 5 didn't need to exist. The feature list that is here isn't that dynamic, and there isn't much in terms of game changing that would merit a new game. It's unfortunate, because I was really really REALLY hoping that there would be more to this game than there currently is. I was hoping for some early game changes, but saddly I still have some issues. My problem is with large maps, (and I always play large maps) I end up having too much gold and not enough to spend it on. I think it would be great to kill two birds with one stone and allow for more build options on tiles. But~ Then I'm going to get crap in the comments section about how this isn't CIV, and I should go play that. However, I will say that Dominions has the mechanic IN PLACE for building on tiles, but it's never truly been fleshed out, and thats a shame, because it's a really fun mechanic.\n\n- The overall current game Dom 4 plays pretty much exactly the same as Dom 5. Yes, there's some subtle changes here and there with the winter maps now, but... idk... it feels like you could have charged us $15 for a DLC for Dom 4. I'm just saying, we need more changes and addon's to really make this game A NEW GAME. (hell, you could ignore my suggestion altogether, just add more something, make a few more new mechanics) Currently though, I can't recommend this title at the current price tag. That's the worst part of this too, because I really love Dominions, unfortunately there isn't enough here to pay $35 to $40. Buy and play Dominions 4, the mods and maps alone make that game worth the price of admission, Dom 5 though... I'd at least wait a few months to a year, see what can be done for this title before buying.\n\nNOTE: If changes are made latter on, I will update my review to reflect this.\n\nPSS: I included my suggestion in the review because, for large maps this is a problem in the early game. We also see the same old, I've got 40k in gold, but nothing to spend it on because my resources are maxed. These are problems that are not adressed in dominions 5. I'm sure many of you will have your own unique solutions in the comments section. But I'm not changing my review because you don't like what I have to say. I need something more to fix what I feel, is still currently an issue with Dominions. I'm sorry if this rakes some of you on some coals here, but I can not justify giving this game a reccomendation at this time. There isn't much here, it's enough content for a DLC, not enough content for a full game.", "timestamp_created": 1511979522, "timestamp_updated": 1511981799, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719832", "comment_count": "26", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37934772": {"recommendationid": "37934772", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994724994", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1515924872}, "language": "english", "review": "In one game, the city of crystal and bronze is rising from the waves. My people have fled a cataclysm and found refuge under the sea. We tamed the Morvarc'h, fierce sea-horses gallopping over the sea and able to change shape into nightmarish fire-breathing mares. As the priests casts the blessings of our God, a creature composed of the shifting sea herself, the lances of our riders shimmer with holy power and zeal. None can catch our blessed cavalry as it dances around the bulk of our enemy's defense to strike at their leadership while our sorceresses rain down fire, thunder and rain on those poor fools daring to oppose us.\n\nThen, I am human, master of the secret isle of Avalon. Our armies are guided by mysterious witches capable of the forest magic. We summon allies from these forests, for our priests are weak even though our hearts are strong. None can match our skills with the longbow or the cunning of our witches. Their mastery over nature provides us with food, so we can field and supply much larger armies than those of our neighbors.\n\nNow I am a lizard king, long mummified and honoured by my people. Stout warriors of C'tis, some of them. But mostly a rabble of low morale. They break easily, scattering to the neighboring realms. It is for the dead we summon to hold the lines while the sauromancers prepare spells to drain the souls of our enemies, and reanimate them on the spot.\n\n\nDominions 5 is about choice and strategy. With countless nations to play, each one very different from the other, and countless tactics for each of these, it's a game with immense replay value.\n\nPlayers of the series will recognize most nations, and most units. However, the Bless effects have been completely reworked. The random map generator is a piece of art to the point I'll be using it to generate world maps for my tabletop sessions. The nations have been slightly rebalanced. Research has been simplified, and the UI has been made even clearer.\n\nLike every Dominions release before it, it's easily the best of the series. Highly recommended for newcomers willing to get a real strategy game, and for those of us who are playing since Dominions 1.", "timestamp_created": 1511979340, "timestamp_updated": 1511979340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800019", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37933380": {"recommendationid": "37933380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047640629", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514388081}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that screams \"you dont need AMAZING graphics to make a game\".

Which is great right?!!! But I'll leave a couple of caveats that no-one has mentioned yet just for people to be aware of before purchase:\n\n1) There are hardly any pre-made maps in the game. There are two medium 'wraparound' maps and one fairly small standard map. I personally don't like wraparound maps as they make the game feel like it's taking place on a really really really tiny planet. So I am relying on the random maps which are an improvement over Dom 4 but...\n\n2) The random maps get pixellated in a close zoom and look a mess. Also the province names are often unreadable as they are in a white font which is lots of fun when it has snowed :-D\n\n3) No steam workshop support. This was a bit of a dream, but may be important for a game that needs more maps and also for all those great Dom 4 mods that buffed the gameplay. So I guess we'll be digging around random obscure websites to try and find new mods and maps in the future.\n\nOne final plus point that no-one has mentioned yet though - the music is great!", "timestamp_created": 1511899424, "timestamp_updated": 1511906513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733635", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37909738": {"recommendationid": "37909738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079476449", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1470, "last_played": 1516395820}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u043b\u043b\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0435, \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0445, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0431\u043e\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c. \u0414\u043e\u043c5 - \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432. \u0418\u0437 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439. \u0410 \u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u0436\u0434\u0451\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c )))", "timestamp_created": 1511897589, "timestamp_updated": 1511897589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37909225": {"recommendationid": "37909225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155256384", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "last_played": 1515896574}, "language": "english", "review": ">build the nation of Kekistan\n>praise Kek\n>sacrfice virigin normies\n>build your army of meme's\n>sacrifice other gods to the glory of Kek\n\n\nIf you ever wanted to see what would happen if Dwarf Fortress & Civ 2 had a baby?

In actuality, I have played the series since the original, for thousands of hours, and I can't foresee that changing with the fifth iteration.\n\nAnd there's a good reason for that: unlike most other series, Dominions has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and instead of each iteration launching with negative amount of content and mechanics compared to its predecessor, in Dominions the 16 some nations of the original have turned to almost a hundred, on top of added mechanics, modding options and improved user experience. This admittedly does make it \"Dominions 4.5\" in a sense, but the benefits of this approach are not to disputed and since Dom 5 reworks some of the core systems of the game, the accusations seems very suspect to me. It's also worth pointing out that while some nations remain a bit same-y as they develop over the three playable ages (each with 20-30 nations), there's a great deal of variety between the factions, especially the new ones: there's still a lot of room in the design space to make unique and flavorful nations. And when I say \"unique\", I mean the degree of difference (in its extremes) analogous to one nation having slow Zerglings as recruitable units, while another fields +3/+3 Ultralisks. And when I say \"flavorful\", Dominions is a legitimate contender for having the best fluff and worldbuilding in strategy gaming, and as far as I'm concerned, video games in general.\n\nBut I digress, let's take a step back and look at what the game is about. You play as a pretender god (a powerful spirit, minion on the previous god, an ancient monster or just a human mage powerful enough to have mastered death) trying to fill the vacancy left behind by mysterious disappearance of the Almighty Pantokrator and aiding you in your quest for Godhood is a nation of loyal followers. Most of the nations are based on real-world mythology or historical nations with fantasy twist and include Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, Zoroastrian birdmen, undead Roman Empire, Spanish Inquisition and Biblical Rephaite giants, and fluff tends to feature detailed mythological references or juxtapositions to real-world history. Dominions is also a very thematic game: An example I like to use is Heart Companions of Arcoscephale (a unit inspired by Sacred Band of Thebes) being canonically gay as they are immune to seduction, but while you can find deviations if you look hard enough, generally speaking mechanics down to combat resolution make thematic sense and when combined with the top-notch fluff (and ability to treat myth and history as expanded universe of sorts), the emergent storytelling potential in Dominions is matched only by the likes of Dwarf Fortress and NetHack.\n\nMechanically, it wouldn't be utterly wrong to call Dominions 4X, but it's certainly not a typical one and Dominions has more in common with board wargames and their computerized versions so \"fantasy wargame\" might be a more apt description. The map is province-based, turns are simultaneous and combat takes place during turn resolution based on deployment and scripted orders you can set up in advance with replay of the battle viewable the next turn. This style of combat isn't unprecedented (also seen in games like Frozen Synapse) but especially when you consider the scale (potentially hundreds or even thousands of troops all handled as individuals), it's fairly unique, and besides being a nice change of pace from the more typical omniscient control, it has several key advantages: Predicting enemy tactics and devising a counter in advance becomes paramount and seeing a good plan pay off in a decisive victory is extremely satisfying while anticipating those results is a huge thrill. It more closely captures the decision-making process of a historical commander even if they didn't have magical nukes or battlefield-wide mind control spells at their disposal (or gods fighting on their side). And perhaps most importantly, it enables simultaneous turns, making Dominions extremely well-suited to multiplayer. There is little to no development of provinces and no civilian research: instead, magical research effectively acts as the tech tree that allows you to broaden your strategic and tactical repertoire.\n\nIn terms of polish and similar details, I think Dominions by its fifth iteration has reached a good spot, although it obviously is a low production value game. Graphics are perfectly serviceable with clear and easily readable spritework (with a surprising amount of detail on a lot of units if you bother to look) - personally I actually like how the game looks in general despite its undeniably low-tech aesthetic. The soundtrack is solid, although it could use more tracks. Modding doesn't let you alter the core mechanics of the game, but in terms of modding the content, it's very robust and straightforward (plain text files you can edit with the editor of your choice). The UI isn't the prettiest one out there and doesn't adhere to modern ideals but at this point the efficiency is pretty close to local optimum once you figure out the workflow (pro tip: '?' shows all available shortcuts in any given game screen) and I feel it compares just fine against most modern strategy games.\n\nNow that the general description is over, what can I say? Should I focus on actual endgame strategies like indirectly wishing more wishes, breaking dead Titans free from Tartarus and equipping them magical artifacts so as to enable them to wipe out unprepared armies single-handedly, polluting the source of magic with sacrifice of hundreds of virgin girls such that any mage daring to cast a non-blood spell can be detected and tracked by eldritch Horrors, seducing enemy commanders with dryads and then proceeding to rout their leaderless army, or simply buffing your elite troops, making each of them a one-man army? What about discussing the lore in more detail, like how Ermor (Rome) learns death magic from C'tis (Egyptian Lizardmen), inadvertently causing an undead apocalypse and forcing Marignon (Spanish Inquisition) to make a deal with the devil to save the world? Quantity of content (3k+ units, 90 some factions etc)? The multiplayer experience?\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter because there's a simpler answer: Dominions has it all. It's undeniably one of the kings of fantasy wargaming, considered one of the greatest strategy/tactics games of all time by many, and at risk of sounding pretentious, I feel it even has value as an \"art house game\" (ie. you could ignore the exceptional wargame that serves as a vehicle for worldbuilding and simply explore the world the authors have conjured). As of writing this, I have barely touched games other than Dominions 4 for the last half a year, because in my mind they just don't compare, and Dominions 5 seems like a direct upgrade.", "timestamp_created": 1511884714, "timestamp_updated": 1511988141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892568", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37877780": {"recommendationid": "37877780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004310903", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 116, "last_played": 1515894208}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a first impressions review, will update later. \n\nDom 5 helps make the series a little more acessible through cleaner graphics, more in game help, and new tutorials without sacraficing what made the game great.\n\nStill much to discover but I feel I will finally put in the necessary hours to get good at this one after only a handful in Dom 4 despite being interested in learning it, but never committing.", "timestamp_created": 1511873701, "timestamp_updated": 1511873701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37876020": {"recommendationid": "37876020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005652936", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1516376934}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u624d100\u5757\u94b1\uff0c\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\uff0c\u4e0d\u4e70\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e73\u6c11\u6124\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u592a\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u8c01\u73a9\u8c01\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u56f0\u96be\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5669\u68a6\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1511872210, "timestamp_updated": 1511872210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37873113": {"recommendationid": "37873113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030474159", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 599, "last_played": 1516351165}, "language": "english", "review": "The only game where your unicorn riding knight hero that slayed a dragon god of the lizard people can be stolen from you by a low teir succubus in a single turn\nSeriously though this game offers so much detail and depth into its gameplay is estounding\nEvery game you play is different and the replay value is off the scale\nWhen the trailer says that its the most complex strategy game, it means it\nAlso many thanks to the developers for all their hard work on this unique series for 15 years\n", "timestamp_created": 1511869639, "timestamp_updated": 1511869639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559800", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37872368": {"recommendationid": "37872368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049672988", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514050805}, "language": "english", "review": "This game! <3 \nThis game is well loved, the Devs treat it nice.

I've been a fan since Dominions 3, but, as far as games go, there was a few things that could have been improved.\n\nI'm more than happy to say... It's been DONE.\n\nMajor changes from previous version are the combat (not sure it was useful, but it's certainly not detrimental to the game - it helps with cheese \"I'm the one that casted the fastest\" that was there before though, bonus points here), the recruitment mechanics, and the new bless mechanics.\n\nThe recruitment mechanics are awesome. Previously it was good for players to recruit \"standard\" commanders because it prevented you from recruiting mages. Now, standard commanders can be recruited along with mages. Provinces also have the ability to recruit multiple base commanders.  his is a huge shift in the game as you'll now be able to use the native commanders !\n\nAbout the new bless effects... Not only there is the possibilty of choosing what effects you want, they also might occur differently depending on province scales ! And there are cross scale blesses too !\n\nAlso, smaller point, but... the main menu's been reworked.\n\nOne of the deepest and longest running series has just gone better. Fully recommend.\n\nPS: quoted from another review...\n\"I suggest to activate the multi-turn movement option, as it is great to be able to plan armies movement over several turn, rather than turn by turn.\"\n\nOk, it may seems dumb as every other game has had since for ages, but... Dominions hadn't. And now it does. Devs of this game have always been committed but new nations and units had taken most of the attention rather than UI and QoL improvement. I'm happy to see that they focus more on QoL and UI. It was needed.\n\nAnother (much needed) QoL that's finally there: national units can now be seen on the nation selection screen INCLUDING the one with terrain recruitment (like the one that can only be recruited in forest for Pangaea for example).\n\nThere are probably others.", "timestamp_created": 1511851515, "timestamp_updated": 1511852183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555507", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37855585": {"recommendationid": "37855585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989563082", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 616, "last_played": 1516249337}, "language": "english", "review": "I just want to start adding to the clamoring of how awsome this game is...\n\nWill do a full review later!", "timestamp_created": 1511849695, "timestamp_updated": 1511849695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479452", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37855328": {"recommendationid": "37855328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043932338", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512289815}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid improvement over Dominions 4, retaining its position as my favourite 4x game series.

For anyone interested in strategy games, especially ones that rely more on thinking than clicks-per-minute, the Dominions series is a must. It's great for intense multiplayer games that span weeks, fantasy and history nerds, and the kinds of players who want to obliterate their enemies with powerful magic. Don't let the graphics fool you - if you're looking for excellent, deep strategy, this is your game. Yes, it's a long learning process, but it's easy to take baby steps and start playing the AI after a quick tutorial. You'll get good later, when you learn about more of the systems. There are plenty of great tutorials on Steam and online that can help you get started, and plenty for more advanced players too. The community actively writes strategy guides and makes whole new nations from mods. It's amazing. Buy it if you're looking for a strategy game where you have to use your head.\n\nThat's the pitch for new players. For those returning to the Dominions series, it's a tougher sell. The graphics of the maps are improved, they convey more information, and the randomly-generated ones have new features like rivers and bridges. There's some nice new music. The new bless system is an improvement, both for balance and for creativity. I can't tell yet how much the real-time battle system will affect high-level competitive play, but it doesn't seem to make a big difference in typical situations versus the AI. There have been some small improvements to lowering micromanagement, like the new research system and the option to plot moves that will take multiple turns (I enabled it in Preferences). Other than that (and 3 new nations) not much has changed. $36, or $40, depending on when you read this, is a lot to ask for people who own the very-similar Dominions 4.

This game is deeper than deep - it is vast. In my humble opinion it is the best fantasy strategy game I know and one of the best strategy games in general. \nWhy?\nYou have near endless stragic possibilities, a deep nation setup based on the countless myths of our planet (celtic, german, indian, mayan, greek roman, middle eastern, northern, chinese, japanese and many more) and the battles need your tactical brilliance.\nIt is a world to dive into. Join the growing community and learn about myths, strategic brilliance and tactical finesse. You'll have a steep learning curve but you will enjoy a deep experience like no other.\n\nSo what is new in dominions 5 compared to previous titles of the series? Apart from a great new soundtrack (really beautiful), better graphics, an improved random map generator, further content (like new units and nations, random events, etc.), improved user interface, a new combat system was implemented (now real time and thus more realistic battles) and many inner mechanics were overhauled, streamlined and in my view perfected.\n\nOne example of these changes is the complete overhaul of the bless system. The mighty being you play in this game in your strive to godhood blesses his sacred followers (the priests and holy units (mages/commanders/warriors) of your nations. How these blesses function and what they do was streamlined. But also the mechnics were improved. For example that the most powerful blesses only work on your faithful sacred minions when you, the god pretender, is alive (when you die in game you can be called back by your priests what costs time) is new and makes perfect sense as well as keeping your pretender alive even more important than in Dominions 4 and before. \n\nAnother (minor) example is the unit log that you now have. The game keeps track of the actions every unit in the game did in the unit tab. So if you have one of your heroes or mighty summoned beings or even a \"lowly\" slave unit that you feel close to your heart (as it by chance chopped off the head of the mighty scorpion king that tried to pillage your jucy high income province :)) you can browse through his history and see what he did throughout the game in your glorious conquest.\n\nThe two guys behind of illwinter that are the creators of the Dominions series (backed by a growing and decdicated community) have shown in the past that they continuosly improve their products (Dominions and Conquest of Elysium series mainly) for many years. Its predecessor Dominions 4 has up to now 31 updates, fixing bugs, polishing the game (ai etc), delivering new nations, units, spells and so forth. This is more than good support to say the least. Thus, do not hear to people telling you that just a few things changed and that Dominions 5 is just a Dom 4 plus that costs a bunch of money. That's not true. It is worth every PENNY!\n\nSee you around as Zeus, a fourth armed Indian Goddess of destruction, a giant squid in the sea or in whatever embodiemened you chose to claim for ascension. ;-)\n\nAnd now excuse me - I,  Tauron, Master of the Rock, the Hidden One, Nourisher of the fields (the game gives you names depending on how you design your pretender being) must return to my holy and rigthous cause to banish all other Pretenders to become - you know what.", "timestamp_created": 1511821566, "timestamp_updated": 1511897215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639329", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37829986": {"recommendationid": "37829986", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994121840", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 453, "last_played": 1515830480}, "language": "english", "review": "The Dominions series is the best example I can imagine of designers creating a compelling world in their heads and then completely translating that world to the digital realm, to the point where the digital realm starts to take on an existence of its own.

voice*\n\nYou know what I like best?\n\nThe price.\n\n*Drives out through the window of Illwinter's office and escapes down the highway*\n\n\nWell what can I say? Every new instalment in the Dominions series is an expansion on the last and so there's really no reason to stick with any of the prequels. Because of this, everything that I said in my lengthy Dominions 4 review still stands. Dominions 5 is a polished and expanded version of Dominions 4.\n\nI was initially skeptical that the game would be worth the \u00a330/$40 for me, as someone who owned Dominions 4. Having now played the game, I can safely say that my skepticism has been washed away and that I'm very glad that I bought the game the instant that it was released (and there was never any doubt that I would).\n\nDominions 5 continues the series tradition of being on an extreme end of the graphics versus gameplay scale. Namely the end that cares little about the visuals and everything about depth of gameplay. This is what makes the Dominions series so special and why myself and most other fans love it. And I say that as a relatively new recruit, having only discovered the series with Dominions 4. However, Dominions 5 has received a high degree of polish in the visual department and looks markedly better than its predecessor.\n\nThere are new nations, new events, and everything else that you'd expect from a Dominions sequel, including new features that only someone who knows the Dominions series can truly appreciate. For example, your characters will now make their own way to a destination without you having to micromanage them through every province. I'm not joking when I say that such a feature alone would make Dominions 5 tempting to me, and I didn't see anyone even mention it in the run-up to release. Dominions 5 seems to emphasise playing on random maps more than its prequel did, and they look utterly gorgeous compared to how they did in Dominions 4. What I personally love is how you can prevent random maps from wrapping around in every direction now. Of course if you've never played a Dominions game before that won't mean anything to you. But trust me, it's a good thing. The new music is gorgeous too.\n\nTo be honest, I just wanted to give the game the good review it deserves\u2014I didn't really plan to say much. It's Dominions again and it's better than before. The trailer for the game claims that it's the deepest strategy game of all time, and that's no idle boast. I've been gaming for nearly thirty years now and I've never played anything that comes close to Dominions in terms of tactical depth and strategic potential.\n\nIf you're a fan of turn-based strategy at all, then the Dominions series is essential. You won't be able to understand its depths without reading the manual or asking for help on the forums, and even then you'll be pretty clueless for your first few games, but believe me, Dominions is a series that amply rewards perseverance. I myself am still learning, and I'm loving every minute of it.\n\nNow excuse me, I must lead the nation of Atlantis across the bottom of the ocean so that I can spread the good word of our god, Kronos, across the lands of men from the safety of our underwater temples.\n\nOh, and I was just joking with the opening. Illwinter Game Design consists of two guys (Johan Karlsson and Kristoffer Osterman) who're responsible for not only the Dominions games, but also the Conquest of Elysium series. They probably make their games while sitting in their underpants in their living rooms. I know I would. I'd be surprised if they had an office, nevermind one with a window big enough to drive out of.", "timestamp_created": 1511787799, "timestamp_updated": 1511791202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 214, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.898130", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37778096": {"recommendationid": "37778096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069769616", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515449991}, "language": "english", "review": "It's dominions 4 but way better.

It has insane nation and strategic customization, and the  pretender design, research targets, combat scripting choices, and gem use strategy result in a game that is filled to the brim with meaningful player choices and decision.\n\nIt's also a game that's filled with lore.

Literally everything is simulated in the game: age, old age afflictions, permenant wounds, disease, commander ability, morale, formations, magic resistance, elemental resistance.\n\nIf you're a dominions 4 veteran, I highly recommend dominions 5 because the new bless and pretender design system is much deeper than before, and because they significantly sped up gameplay with the overall halving of siege defense.

Huge mistake. I have been a fan of Crusader Kings II, Civilisation and Masters of Orion for a long time and I am astonished to say that this game burries tham all. \n\nDominions is perhaps the most complex game I have ever seen, yet it is equally elegant in it's easy to master interface. The options in this game are truely unlimited in their variety and combination, but every new choice comes as something to be investigated and discovered, rather than some hidden stumbling block preventing you from getting ahead. Don't get me wrong, you will want to watch a tutorial or read the manual before you get into it, but this is a testiment to the truly unique game play which is at once reminisent of so many classics and totally original in every way. \n\nAt first Dominions is intimidating with its laundry lists of skills and statistics, but every strength and weakness is represented in the descriptions and lore, allowing you to reliably ignor the numbers and read the text to figure things out. What's more is that every element in the game is based on something from mythology or litrature, infact it was after discovering a reference to Kipling that I decided I had to write this review. If you are like me, and love history and can't get enough of table games like Risk or Settlers this game is a must own. \n\nNo description or review can do this game justice, it really must be experienced to be belived. And those graphics? Once everything is in motion they are actually captivatingly beutiful, with every element a symbol carrying information about the armaments of units or compositions of enemy armies. Honestly, 3D models or flashy map effects like Civ and Age of Wonders would be nothing more than a confusing distraction in Dominions. The game is a master work, and is clearly the product of decades of dedication by it's developers who I would cautiously describe as the Van Goghs of game design after experiencing their work.\n\nI have only been playing for a few weeks as of writing this, and I know as an internet stranger my opinion doesn't count for anything, but do yourself a favour, invest in a game that needs no steam sale or advertisments.

They even recently buffed the new nation Mekone in the short span of time after its release. \nBut there are still clear winners and losers.\nIf you really want to play a specific nation, then you have to proceed knowing full well that you may not be playing on even ground.\n\nOverall, a great game and worth the relatively high price for an indie game.", "timestamp_created": 1520167257, "timestamp_updated": 1520167765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40552941": {"recommendationid": "40552941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099950212", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520515535}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ea\u6709\u4e09\u5f20\u5730\u56fe\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1520138503, "timestamp_updated": 1520138503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40524017": {"recommendationid": "40524017", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970657035", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514265642}, "language": "english", "review": "Devs continue to update and add to the game!", "timestamp_created": 1520044410, "timestamp_updated": 1520044410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40501799": {"recommendationid": "40501799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059377901", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 27572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8126, "last_played": 1521677307}, "language": "english", "review": "I started playing IllWinter games with Conquest of Elysium 3, and have been hooked on that and the Dominions series ever since.  \n\n\nLIke many others have said more eliquently, and with better spelling, this is a no-brainer purchase if you have any love for deep strategy games.  It is easily the most complex and thoroughly thought out game I've ever played.  \n\nIt has more factions than you can ever hope to master, and each has both a deep and often historically relevant or fantastical backstory, and an individual playstyle.  You can play as Undead Romans, Eagleman Zororastrians, Bloodthirsty Aztecs, Lizard Egyptans, Giant Vikings, Japanese Demons, Cananite Monsters, Lovecraftian Illithids, Conan-Inspired Barbarians. There is even a race i think is based on the children's story Where the Wild Things Are.  It never stops.  There are so many units, spells, and items that the strategic depth is basically limitless.  While the game is pretty balanced, they don't fall prey to the god of balancing, as some factions are purposely stronger or weaker to give the game added flavor and realism.  The modding community is super active and I haven't even started playing multiplayer as I still get whooped by anything over Mighty, but I'm getting there.  \n\n\nThey add factions without DLC.  They add factions for free.  They have added 3 or 4 full factions since Dominions 5 came out.  Some people felt Dominions 5 was a glorified update of Dominions 4, but it added simultaneous movement in battles which really changed the game significantly, and of course they added a bunch of new factions for Dom5, changed the tax system (removing a micro-headache) and changed the bless system (made it much better, much more strategically deep).  \n\n\nI think most would agree that each update is well thought out and adds to the game without breaking things.  They update the game about once a month or every other month.  They are thorough updates.  they don't go more than 3-4 updates without adding a new faction (or two with the latest one).  \n\n\nI've owned both Dom 4 and Dom 5 on Steam and I still haven't even PLAYED all the factions yet.  there are like at least 80, they may be up to 90 by now.  It CRAZY! Plus there are many dozens of additional factions made by modders.  \n\nThere is no learning \"curve\"  You never stop learning.  I don't think the game can ever truly be mastered.  \n\nBut you get a feel for the rhythm of the game over time.  There are 3 distinct phases to the game, early expansion, the middle game, and the end game, and they each play quite differently, your faction may have advantages at one stage but become vunerable during another, and you have to play accordingly.  you have to balance research, troop recruitment, conjuration, item production, dominion spread, blood hunting, etc.  Some factions kill off their population on purpose and just use magic or necromancy to develop armies.  You can kit up superunits that can kill whole armies on their own. it's really just endless fun. There are even three ages that you can play the game in, where the factions evolve and technology and access to magic changes, later age armies have more armor and deeper but more narrow magic pathing, lower magic resources, better fortresses etc.  They give you lots of starting options though, you can play late age with lots of magic sites and super fast research if you want, you can start with 1 province or up to 9 if you want, etc etc etc. \n\n\nThe graphics are 2D sprites, but are full of information about what the unit can do.  Can your unit throw a javelin before charging into melee? The sprite carries a little javelin.  Is your unit a size 6 giant with 60 HP?  He towers over the size 2 human units as he should (careful giant, you're easily surroundable!)  Is your unit a cave man in fur clothes carrying only a club.  check.  Can your merman grow legs when on land? done.  The graphics are just a functional as the rest of the game.  \n\n\nDid I mention injuries? Your unit can be one shot with a good lick to the head, can loose an eye from a well placed arrow (and it will affect is attack ability), can lose a leg and be crippled (but still fight on).  He can take a chest wound that never fully heals, permanently reducing HP.  Morale is also very well modeled, troops definatly get less enthuastic as the battle progress, and fatigue is modeled as well.  \n\nYour Pretender God can die, and be prayed back into existence.  You can blood sacrifice to strenghen you God's power over enemy territory.  You can pray another faction literally to death.  You can summon demons, you can mark enemy units to be targeted the the horrors of the void. You can effectly raid with stealthy units, or flying units, or conjured units.  you can blot out the sun, you can poison the entire battlefield, you can poison your enemy's provines, or send a hurricaine there. you can wish. You can raise the dead. If you're a lizard nation, some of your undead will be little undead lizard men.  the little things add up.  \n\n\nOk, so buy the game, support this development team, they are a true gem.", "timestamp_created": 1519965235, "timestamp_updated": 1519965235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40493718": {"recommendationid": "40493718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087552132", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521357781}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been playing the Dominions series since the third game.

The diversity, the options, the fact that every nation actually plays differently, rather than being the same thing with slight varients...\n\nBut one of the things that sold me the most is how much the games improve with each iteration. It doesn't feel like you're changing the game, it feels like you're taking what's already there and making it better. improving the UI, making it more realistic, which really appeals to me. It's like the Malazan Book of the Fallen of Fantasy video games... and gives that touch of fantasy realism that really helps with immersion.\n\nI am by no means a \"hardcore gamer\" and recognize that a lot of the game stuff goes over my head, or I don't take the time to do properly.

The option is there, but it's not a requirement.\n\nI love the new bless system, making your gods even more customizeable to your specifics, which really appeals to me.

Every culture and unit have a fantasy lore, inspired in traditional folclores, such as indian, or even Lovecraftian cultures... I believe you can download the manual so you can take a look... And each culture have a quite unique strategy for playing... \n\nIf you want a game with exceptional artwork, and friendly interface... Well... Go somewhere else. If you want a game with an astounding quantity of options and strategies, and you are not afraid of spreadsheets and to read a 382 pages manual, keep reading...\n\nThe game have a very complex mechanic: for starters, an army is composed of commanders, that would be very similar to \"heroes\" on other games: special individuals that can lead up to a number of undead, magical or normal units. And then they have units, that represents individual soldiers. These soldiers may be maimed, crippled, mortally wounded, beheaded... You archers can kill your own men... And battles are decided entirely by the computer, based on orders you specify before the battle begins: you control the position and formation of squads, and the initial 5 orders for commanders, and a general directive, such as advance and cast spells.\n\nA battle may be decided even before it starts: it is the morale of the troops what ultimately decides a battle, not necessarily what do you kill... If you kill a commander, the squads this commander leads will rout. The challenge here is how to reach the commander, if you can't identify where the commander is: there is no way to tell the units to \"kill the commander\"... You can tell the units to attack the rearmost units and hope the commander is there...\n\nThe user interface is lacking... And this starts building up as the game advances... This makes the game be played in two ways: for people who like to micromanage , like myself, this becomes a pain, that ends up making me quit the game after 20 or 25 turns: there is no easy way to account for the units you have, the leaders you have... you can't see the provinces with different sort orders... To organize your troops, you need commanders... and organization can be very complex: there are shortcuts for some actions, but the complexity of the game itself make you want to see some more complex queries than simply select all units of the same type at a single stack... You can see all my wishlists in the forum. \n\nBut you can see in the videos people enjoying the game simply by ignoring most of the mechanics, and building an army or killer pretender and jumping from province to province, hoping for the best...

The easy and obious anser is of course: you dont. Big companys balance their games for years to find a good balance between 3-5 nations and even some very \"basic\" games like chess where it seems that their is only one \"nation\" that the white side has a slight advantage over the black side. \n\nBut the developer where quite active and tried their best to balance certain obious stuff in patches over the days, and also i never mindet the lack of perfect balance of the game, because of the many opportunitys that you could do, the lategame magic spells that you can research, so that it always feeled in the lategame, that if you loosed than your opponent just was able to put out cooler tactics out of his sleves and that he deserved the win. The variety of possible choices in the later state of the game where the  thing that made the game so awesome to me. \n\nBut there was always one play-style i did not like a all: The bless strategie. \n\nFor explanation: A bless strategie is a tactic in which you are able to increase the strenght of your sacred units, your strongest units that you can regulary recruit and only in smaller numbers per turn, immensly from the start. This is in theorie quite interesting, because the more magic scales you choose for your pretender, the worser your scales, that affect your income of gold or ressources and other stuff, will be. \n\nBut this was always a very \"dirty\" tactic for me, since i have seen this tactic in action by myself in my first MP game, since it gives a huge advantage to nations that have already strong but expensive sacreds, since the limit of a few per turn doesnt affect them, if their sacreds are already so expensive that they couldnt recruite more of them, even if they wanted. And nations of which the sacred warriors are just stronger regular units, from which you could recruit 100 per turn if you whould be allowed, have a massive dissadvantage. \n\nBut even so it was balancable, since the strongest blessings where locked behind a magic path of 9, which means that a player who wanted to go for the popular double bless strategie, had to invest massive points into his pretender to boost 2 magic paths to 9 to get the required blessings. \n\nBut in dom 5 the developer thought that this \"mass to magic path 9\" pretender building was somewhat boring so they implemendet a total new blessing system in which you have to choose from many many blessings you can choose from. So with fire 7 you can either buy the most expensive but most likely also strongest blessing, the Awe, and nothing else, or many minor blessings. But because you can choose now from so many different blessings to the already so many different nations...it just became totally unbalanced and for me unfun. \n\nFor example must pick for strong but expensive sacred troops were always regeneration, which gives them 10% of their health back every turn. \nA white centaur of Pangaea for example can increase his HP easly to 31 from which on he will regain 4 health every turn...what is around 50% of the most units health. But now they can buff this already very hard to kill centaur with other blessings like the ethernal blessing, which not only makes them regain 4 HP every turn, but also let them become almost impossible to hit for the most regular troops, which allows a very small number of them to crush through 100 regular soldiers or more without problem.\n\nOr lets take a looks at the sacred troops of Ashdod. Their sacred giants start already with 50 HP, so a little HP boost of 1+ Regeneration allows them to regain 6 HP per turn...which is massiv. But now only that, but as strong armored giants they also have a very high protection...but with the new blessing system there is a bless called \"stygian flesh\" which increases the protection against every weapontype by 10...which boost their sacred warriors to a total protection of 25 and the other sacred warriors even to 28. This huge protection value makes it impossible for the most warriors to even make a slight wound, but with the regeneration of 6 HP per turn, it is not already almost impossible to hurt them at all...but even if someone can make a lucky hit and hurt the giant for 1 HP, he will just regain it in one turn. Which makes these giants not hard, but totally impossible to kill for the most nations that have not elemental weapons on their regular troops or special attacking units that dont care about the high protection value. And not only for the first years, but really until the lategame where you have gain very strong spells that can deal with them. \n\nAnd this is why i dislike the new blessing system so uppermost. While the game was never balanced, their was always something to do in the lategame, so that it always feeled, that if you loose that your opponent outplayed you, and that he deserve the win and you deserve the loose since their are so many ways how you could play differently which would let you be better prepared to the enemy. \n\nBut since the research that allows you the variety of playstyles with your magic has to be researched first, while the overwhelming blessings of the sacred units start already with turn 1, every MP game becomes a gambling, since the only way how to counter a strong-blessing nation...is to be a strong blessing nation yourself. But if you are not...then you are under the mercy of the blessing nation and can only pray that he lets you live, and attack other nations first, until you have enough research done that you can counter the sacred troops. \n\nAnd this feels just so unfair, that at least for me, i now have to check every nation that in the game i want to play with if their is a nation, that has access to strong but expensive sacreds, that can overwhelm everything you can throw at them in many game-years to come, since nations like this will at least for me destory every fun i had in the past games of dom 4, since seeing a small troop of sacred units that cost a few hundret gold destroy a full army of yours, that cost thousends of gold and takes many turns to recruit...is just not fun nor does it feeled that the opponent did just outplayed you, since its more like \"well he has access to strong sacred units and i have not...GG\" \n\nI really hope that the next installement of dominions will throw this new bless system, that sounds cool on paper but is aweful in reality, out, so that the games will really be decidet once more who can react to the tactic of the enemy the most, and not who can build with his sacred troops the strongest warriors.", "timestamp_created": 1518610633, "timestamp_updated": 1518610633, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514027", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40064500": {"recommendationid": "40064500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244630378", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "last_played": 1521747468}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d. \u0421\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u044e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u044b\u0433\u0440\u044b\u0448, \u0433\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432, etc. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1518600306, "timestamp_updated": 1518600306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39963891": {"recommendationid": "39963891", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996049777", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3830, "last_played": 1521682405}, "language": "english", "review": "Must grab for any fan of wargames.", "timestamp_created": 1518216831, "timestamp_updated": 1518216831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39944134": {"recommendationid": "39944134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029363031", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "last_played": 1521518139}, "language": "english", "review": "First of, I DO NOT REGREAT BUYING THIS GAME.

If you want to learn to play it you must be willing to sit down, play, learn the games in and outs, and ultimately be ready to lose. But once you get through the hurdles and have a good idea of how to play the game, you will find it is a game unlike any other.

This company has grown lazy. Okay, I've been playing the game since the original Dominions and have over a 1,000 hours into Dominions 3 and 4 so I have a decent history with this series. This company should be embarrassed for charging $39.99 for this game. Aren't new versions supposed to enhance the game? Let me see, almost no maps, no mods, I love the random disease feature that they've added. Anyone, anywhere can become diseased even if they've never left your starting province. How about put some work into the game and add Steam Achievements, or a Hall of Fame. \n\nWhen the original Dominions came out, I was amazed at the level of detail and intellect that went into the game, Dominions 5 literally makes me angry that they obviously don't care about the product anymore and are making a money grab.  I'll say it one last time, save your money, there isn't enough in Dominions 5 to justify a $40.00 price grab.

And I have played a lot of them.\n\nYou know how in Total War games you end up repeatedly reloading the game to re-roll an assassination attempt? Not in this game, because it is a rogue-like 4x game: you can only quit by saving, you can only save by quitting, and there is only one save. You live with your mistakes and losses, and learn to make the best of them, and recover from them. This makes for a much more interesting, challenging and rewarding game than you would get from any other 4x game.\n\nYou know how in Total War you get fed up with controlling the battles since it's just the same old tactics: artillery/mages behind archers behind infantry with cavalry to take out the enemy artillery, or intercept enemy cavalry to protect your own artillery if they have cavalry. Rinse and repeat. Well in Dominions you give your orders when you build your army, then just sit back and watch the carnage. No need to the exact same thing every battle. You know how your army is designed to work, so why keep going through the motions? Ever played Gratuitous Space Battles? It's like that, but in a fully fleshed out 4x, with old school complexity (lots of complexity). You know how in Total War there are problems with balancing the auto resolve? If auto is too effective there is no need to fight the battles, if it's too ineffective you have to fight all of them. And they never seem to get it quite right. There is no auto resolve in Dominions. All battles are fully simulated according to the standing orders you gave the troops, and their AI. You just decide if you need to watch them to see if you need to re-calibrate those orders, or try a different army composition. Or to cackle maniacally as your minions head into the meat grinder.\n\nYour avatar in the game is a living god, heavily customisable at the start of the game. You can build your god as a massive monster able to devour whole armies on it's own, pushing for early game wins, or play as a literal fountain of blood, immobile, but vibrating with tremendous power and menace, giving huge bonuses to your empire and laying foul plagues upon cities who fail to bend the knee.\n\nThe game is massively moddable, already with a multitude, nay a plethora of mods, with custom factions and much much more:\n\nhttp://s7.zetaboards.com/Dom3mods/topic/1274067/1/\n\nAnd yes, the Warhammer mods are slowly but surely trickling in as we speak.\nThere is no other 4x game like this.

The fortifications have been streamlined into overall upgrades, the bless superabilities are customizable, and combat is in real-time. I love this game and I love what they're doing.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't played Dominions 4, this is a turn-based empire game such as Total War: Warhammer, only instead of investing time and money on graphics, it's all put into adding 100s of different species, races, monsters, units, spells etc. into the game. So each unit is litterally two sprites, the normal stand, and the moving sprite. The lack of animation means that they can't do a ton of more things, and honestly it doesn't detract from the strategy, tactics, or coolness of it all.\n\nThere are 3 time ages that you can play in, each has like, 20?ish different empires, the early age is more magical, the later age is more conventional warfare, while the middle one is more...middle! There are different ways to win.\n\nAnother one of the main differences that this game offers is religion. It affects the strength of your 'god' (did I mention your main leader of your empire is a 'god'?) and if you can snuff out the enemy's religion, their god dies (and their empire dies with it). Religion spreads around the world and you can make it happen faster by using monks / priests / sacrifices / missionaries / inquisitors / etc. (there's really so many units and things in this game).\n\nThe races/deities/empires are inspired by many things. Some are themed around the various dozens of mythologies from around the world. Others feel as though they came more or less from conventional high fantasy games. Others yet are also completely unique to this game. There is so much variety it's just oh-so fascinating.\n\nThe battles work by moving generals into a territory that has an enemy force inside it. Basic troops are assigned to generals, and the player selects where on the battlefield all the units start (before they move or you ever see the enemy, mind you). You can give the units and generals orders too, but for the most part you can only guess what would be ideal for when a battle occurs. It could be that the enemy had flying units hiding in wait and despite having knights flanking their snake monsters and a line of mercenaries charging forward, their flying units may decide to fly to the back of your forces and take out all your commanders, mages and archers, so it can be a very unpredictable thing. You can only wait until the turn has been processed to know the results of each battle.\n\nDid I mention that everyone's turns are processed simultaneously? So it's perfect for Play-By-E-Mail (PBEM) matches. Of course you can play by network, or hotseat, of course single player's always there, too. So many options!\n\nAnyone who's into role-playing, into fantasy, into strategy/tactics, or who just needs a break from slow triple-A titles should definitely try this out.
